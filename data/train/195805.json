Bourque  claims\n\nthat  the  FDIC and  Newmark agreed  to sell  him a  piece of\n\nproperty  in Woonsocket,  Rhode  Island, for  $130,000.   The\n\ndefendants denied that a contract  had been formed and  filed\n\nseparate motions  for summary  judgment.  The  district court\n\ngranted defendants' motions, and Bourque appeals.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \n\n          The FDIC  is the receiver and  liquidating agent of\n\nEastland  Savings Bank  of Woonsocket.   In  its capacity  as\n\nreceiver,  the FDIC  is  the sole  shareholder of  Newmark, a\n\nwholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Eastland.    In December  1992,\n\nNewmark retained the FDIC to  market its real estate  assets,\n\nincluding the property at issue here.\n\n          On  June  1,  1993, Bourque's  attorney,  Edward J.\n\nCasey, wrote to FDIC account officer Curtis Cain that Bourque\n\nwas interested  in purchasing the property  at 846 Cumberland\n\nHill Road  in Woonsocket (the \"Property\").   Casey asked Cain\n\nwhether he  was \"the person  handling the asset,\"  whether he\n\nhad authority \"to discuss\" the Property, and what the current\n\nstatus  of the  Property was.   At  Cain's  direction, Cain's\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nassistant  contacted Casey  and  informed him  that Cain  was\n\nindeed the person \"handling\" the Property, but she apparently\n\ndid not inform  Casey of any limitations  on Cain's authority\n\nto sell the Property.\n\n          On June 11, 1993, Casey sent Cain a letter offering\n\nto  buy the Property on Bourque's behalf for $105,500.  Casey\n\nenclosed  a  $10,000  earnest   money  deposit  and  an  FDIC\n\npurchase-and-sale  agreement  form  signed  by  Bourque  that\n\ndescribed the Property and the terms of the offer.\n\n          Cain's response, dated June 23, 1993, (the \"June 23\n\nletter\")  was  printed   on  FDIC  Division   of  Liquidation\n\nletterhead  and  bore the  heading  \"NOTICE  OF REJECTION  OF\r                                                 NOTICE  OF REJECTION  OF\n\nOFFER\".  The letter's critical paragraph read as follows:\r            OFFER\n\n          This letter is to advise you that FDIC is\n          unable  to  accept  Mr. Bourque's  offer.\n          FDIC's counter offer is $130,000.00.  All\n          offers are  subject  to approval  by  the\n          appropriate  FDIC  delegated   authority.\n          FDIC has  the right  to accept  or reject\n          any and all offers.   I am returning your\n          customer's contract of  sale and  earnest\n          money deposit.   If your  customer wishes\n          to  accept  this  counter  offer,  please\n          return  the  amended   Purchase  &amp;   Sale\n          Agreement to me.\n\nCain  did not return Bourque's  $10,000 deposit.  Indeed, the\n\nFDIC  deposited  the check  \"by  mistake,\"  according to  the\n\ndeposition testimony of Cain's supervisor, Donald Lund.  Cain\n\nalso failed, contrary  to FDIC policy,  to attach a  standard\n\n\"Letter  of  Understanding\"  to  the  FDIC  purchase-and-sale\n\nagreement form he returned to  Casey along with the rejection\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nnotice.  That  form letter  explicitly states  that the  FDIC\n\naccount officer has no delegated authority to accept an offer\n\nand  that \"[n]o  contract will  arise\" until  the appropriate\n\ndelegated authority notifies the offeror that it has accepted\n\nthe offer.   Under FDIC policy, account  officers may suggest\n\nand  negotiate terms  and  recommend  appropriate offers  for\n\napproval  by the proper delegated  authority, but they do not\n\nhave  the  authority  to  liquidate FDIC  assets  by  binding\n\ncontracts.   That authority is conferred on other job titles;\n\nin  this case,  the  sale of  the  Property could  have  been\n\napproved  by an  FDIC assistant  managing liquidator.   Other\n\nthan  Cain's June 23 letter, there is no evidence that anyone\n\nat the FDIC communicated  this policy to Casey or  Bourque in\n\nconnection with  the transaction  before this  dispute arose.\n\nJohn  Chiungos,   another  FDIC  account   officer,  however,\n\ntestified at his  deposition that he had explained the policy\n\nto Casey  in connection with another,  smaller transaction in\n\nJanuary 1993.   At his  deposition, Casey at  first testified\n\nthat he had  never had  prior dealings with  the FDIC;  then,\n\nwhen  confronted  with  documentary  evidence  of  the  prior\n\ntransaction, he said he had \"completely forgot\" about it.  In\n\nany  event,  Casey did  not  rebut  Chiungos' testimony  that\n\nChiungos had  explained the FDIC liquidation  policy to Casey\n\nat least on one prior occasion.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          On  June  25,  1993,  Casey returned  to  Cain  the\n\npurchase-and-sale agreement, which was signed by  Bourque and\n\namended   to  indicate   a   $130,000  purchase   price  (the\n\n\"Agreement\").   The Agreement set forth July 30, 1993, as the\n\nclosing date for the transaction.\n\n          On  July 7,  1993,  another  FDIC account  officer,\n\nElizabeth M.  Carroll, informed  Casey by telephone  that the\n\nFDIC had received an offer  on the Property substantially  in\n\nexcess of  $130,000.1  Casey  responded by sending  Carroll a\n\nletter  stating that  Bourque  considered the  parties to  be\n\nbound  by  contract  and  that  Bourque  would  litigate,  if\n\nnecessary, to obtain the benefit of his bargain.\n\n          On July 27, 1993, Carroll sent a letter to Bruce E.\n\nThompson, Casey's  law partner,  stating that the  FDIC would\n\nnot accept  Bourque's $130,000 offer, but  that Bourque could\n\nsubmit  another offer of at  least $250,000 by that afternoon\n\nfor  consideration   by   the  appropriate   FDIC   delegated\n\nauthority.  In her letter, Carroll wrote:\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Prior to working for  the FDIC, Carroll worked  for seven\nyears  at  Eastland,  initially  as an  assistant  to  Arthur\nGauthier,  Eastland's  executive   vice-president  for   real\nestate.   Gauthier is the real estate agent who brokered this\nhigher (and  ultimately successful) offer  for the  Property,\nand his office  stands to  receive a 4.5%  commission on  the\n$253,000  transaction.   Carroll's  supervisor,  Donald Lund,\ntestified at  his deposition that  had he known  of Carroll's\npast working  relationship with  Gauthier, he would  not have\nlet her market the Property to him.  While these questionable\ndealings indicate  that  the  FDIC  may wish  to  review  its\noversight practices, they do not animate our decision in this\ncase.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          After reviewing the  file and  conferring\n          with the previous  account officer, it is\n          clear that the FDIC's policy that account\n          officers  have no  authority to  bind the\n          FDIC  or  its subsidiary  corporation was\n          communicated  to your  client.   Mr. Cain\n          indicated   to   your  client   that  his\n          authority is limited  to recommending  an\n          offer  and  that  all  final  offers  are\n          subject  to  approval by  the appropriate\n          delegated authority.\n\n          On August  2, after  the FDIC  refused to sell  the\n\nproperty to Bourque, Bourque filed a notice of lis pendens on\n\nthe property  and  instituted this  action, seeking  specific\n\nperformance from either FDIC or Newmark, and damages from the\n\nFDIC.2\n\n          The  defendants  filed  separate  summary  judgment\n\nmotions,  arguing  that there  was  no  contract between  the\n\nparties, that  the alleged  contract violated  Rhode Island's\n\nStatute  of Frauds  and  that Cain  did  not have  actual  or\n\napparent authority to bind the FDIC or Newmark.  A magistrate\n\njudge recommended that the  motions be granted, and following\n\noral    argument,   the    district   court    adopted   that\n\nrecommendation.3  This appeal ensued.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  On  August 9, 1993, the FDIC entered into an agreement to\nsell the Property to  Supreme Corporation of Goshen, Indiana,\nfor  $253,000.  The closing  of that sale  has been postponed\npending the outcome of this case.\n\n3.  Although the  district court's  order does not  so state,\nthe transcript  of the  oral argument clearly  indicates that\nthe  district  court  based  its  decision  on  the  contract\nformation  issue and  never  reached the  apparent or  actual\nauthority issues.  The district court also suggested that had\nit found that  a contract was formed, it would also have held\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n          We begin by  reviewing traditional summary judgment\n\nprinciples and how they apply in contract formation disputes.\n\nWith  those principles  in mind,  we then  turn to  Bourque's\n\nsubstantive argument that  summary judgment is inappropriate.\n\nBecause  our resolution  of the  contract formation  issue is\n\ndispositive,  we do not reach the statute of frauds or agency\n\nissues.\n\nA.  Summary Judgment in Contract Formation Disputes\r                                                               \n\n          We accord  a  district  court's  grant  of  summary\n\njudgment no  deference; the scope  of our review  is plenary.\n\nAlan Corp.  v.

We  affirm a  grant of  summary\n\njudgment if our evaluation  of the parties' proof on  file --\n\nviewing  the  evidence in  the  light most  favorable  to the\n\nnonmovant  -- reveals \"that there  is no genuine  issue as to\n\nany  material fact and that  the moving party  is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"  NASCO, Inc. v.

Were the  parties' understandings of\n\neach  other's actions reasonable under all the circumstances?\n\nAnswering these  questions is the province  of the factfinder\n\nand  not the court.

Rather,\n\nwe  recognize that where  intent and the  meaning of contract\n\nlanguage are at  issue, cases in which  different parties had\n\nan entirely  different set  of communications are  of limited\n\nprecedential value.  Nevertheless,  we think that these cases\n\ndo support the general principle that unequivocal language of\n\noffer or acceptance  cannot be taken in isolation from other,\n\nqualifying  language  in  the  document and  that  where  the\n\nunqualified  statement  and  the qualification  coexist,  the\n\nqualification is likely to  control, at least in  the context\n\nof offer and acceptances.\n\nC.  Interpreting the June 23 Letter\r                                               \n\n          In arguing that Cain's  June 23 letter contained an\n\noffer that  bound the FDIC  and Newmark, Bourque  focuses our\n\nattention  on the second and sixth  sentences of the letter's\n\ncritical paragraph:  \"FDIC's  counter offer is $130,000.00. .\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n. . If  your customer  wishes to accept  this counter  offer,\n\nplease return the  amended Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement  to me.\"\n\nBourque argues that these words are unequivocal, conveying no\n\npossible meaning other  than that the  FDIC was offering  the\n\nProperty to  Bourque for the  stated price, and  that Bourque\n\ncould accept the offer in the prescribed manner.\n\n          If  Cain  had  written   no  more  than  those  two\n\nsentences, then  Bourque's acceptance may well  have formed a\n\ncontract between  the parties.   But  Cain's  letter did  say\n\nmore,  and  it is  a fundamental  tenet  of Rhode  Island and\n\ngeneral   contract  law  that  \"[i]n  ascertaining  what  the\n\n[parties']  intent is  we must  look at  the instrument  as a\n\nwhole and  not at some detached portion thereof.\"  Hill v.

Bourque  argues that these  sentences, when\n\nread in the context of the entire paragraph and Casey's prior\n\ncommunications  with   Cain,  did   nothing  to   dispel  his\n\nreasonable understanding  that he  could indeed enter  into a\n\nbinding contract  by performing the act prescribed by Cain in\n\nthe  letter's  final sentence.   At  the very  least, Bourque\n\nargues, the  paragraph is  ambiguous and should  be construed\n\nagainst the FDIC, since it drafted the document.\n\n            At  oral argument, Bourque's counsel stated that,\n\nunder the  circumstances of this  case,5 where Cain  had told\n\nCasey that  he was the  person \"handling\"  the Property,  the\n\nparagraph at issue  could only  mean that the  writer of  the\n\nletter himself  --  i.e., Cain  -- was  the appropriate  FDIC\n\ndelegated  authority and  that  he included  the \"subject  to\n\napproval\" language  even though  he had already  approved the\n\n$130,000 figure.   This interpretation, rather  than giving a\n\n\"reasonable and  effective meaning\" to the  paragraph's third\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  In his brief, Bourque points to the FDIC's deposit of his\n$10,000  earnest money  check as  another reason  why summary\njudgment  should  not  be  granted.   He  fails  to  explain,\nhowever, exactly how  this action  could be  understood as  a\nmanifestation of intent in  light of Cain's express statement\nin  the June  23 letter  that he was  returning the  check to\nBourque.\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nand fourth sentences, foists  upon them a tortured, illogical\n\nreading.  An  offer cannot  be both subject  to approval  and\n\nalready  approved:   it is  either one  or the  other.6   Nor\n\nwould   one  reasonably  expect  the  \"appropriate  delegated\n\nauthority\" --  even of the FDIC -- to refer to himself in the\n\nthird person  in proclaiming that  he retained  the power  to\n\napprove  all   offers.     One  would  understand   that  the\n\nappropriate authority must be someone else.\n\n          Bourque   attempts   to   avoid  these   linguistic\n\nobstacles  by  emphasizing that,  on  its  own terms,  Cain's\n\nletter distinguishes \"counter  offers\" from \"offers.\"   Thus,\n\nso  this argument goes, the third and fourth sentences of the\n\nletter  reserve  FDIC approval  only  for  \"offers\" --  i.e.,\n\noffers to buy the Property for  less than $130,000 -- and not\r                         \n\nfor  the FDIC's \"counter offer\"  to sell it  at the specified\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.

The word \"subject,\"\r                                       \nwhen  used as  an adjective,  has several  possible meanings,\naccording  to Webster's  Third New  International Dictionary.\r                                                                        \nThe  only meaning that makes any  sense in the context of the\nJune  23  letter,  however,  is \"likely  to  be  conditioned,\naffected,  or modified  in  some  indicated  way:   having  a\ncontingent relation to  something and usu[ally] dependent  on\nsuch  relation for  final form,  validity,  or significance.\"\nWebster's  Third  New International  Dictionary  2275 (1986).\r                                                           \nThis meaning,  implying future  action, is  inconsistent with\nBourque's purported understanding that the offer had  already\nbeen approved.\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nprice,  which  the paragraph's  final  sentence unambiguously\n\nholds  out  for acceptance  by  a  prescribed  method.   This\n\ninterpretation  fails  too,  however,  for  it  places  undue\n\nreliance on the presence of the words \"counter\" and \"accept,\"\n\nwhile  glossing over  the manifestation  of reluctance  to be\r                                                                  \n\nbound contained in the third and fourth sentences.\n\n          It is  axiomatic that  a counteroffer is  simply an\n\noffer  that operates also as a rejection of a previous offer;\n\nit is still very much an offer.   See Restatement (Second) of\r                                                                         \n\nContracts   39 (1981).   Bourque's argument assumes  that the\r                     \n\nuse of the word \"counter\" by Cain removed the FDIC's $130,000\n\n\"offer\"  from the set of offers  referred to in the very next\n\nsentence:    \"All  offers  are  subject  to  approval  by the\r                             \n\nappropriate  FDIC  delegated authority.\"  (emphasis supplied)\n\nThere is  nothing magical about the  word \"counter,\" however;\n\nit is merely a descriptive term, letting us know that another\n\noffer  preceded the  counteroffer  and was  rejected,  either\n\nexplicitly or  implicitly by the making  of the counteroffer.\n\nBourque  responds   to  the  fact  that   a  counteroffer  is\n\n\"technically\"   an  offer   by  calling   it  a   \"legalistic\n\nobfuscation\" that ignores the  fact that the FDIC \"explicitly\n\nempowered Bourque  to accept  its counteroffer, and  told him\n\nhow to do so.\"\n\n          We  respond   thusly.    First,  it   is  hardly  a\n\ntechnical, legalistic obfuscation  to say that  counteroffers\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nare  offers;  we think  that is  rather elementary.   Second,\n\nCasey is a lawyer, and had some familiarity with how the FDIC\n\nworks; even if this  argument is \"legalistic,\" it is  not one\n\nthat should have entirely eluded him when he read the letter.\n\nSee Trifiro v.

Third, the FDIC only \"empowered Bourque to\n\naccept  its  counteroffer\" according  to  the  terms of  that\n\noffer,   which  included   obtaining  the  approval   of  the\n\nappropriate  delegated authority.

As for\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nCain's statement that he was \"handling\"  the Property, he was\n\nindeed:   he was handling bids  on the Property,  much like a\n\nreal  estate  agent or  a loan  officer  at a  bank \"handles\"\n\npreliminary  negotiations  before   submitting  a   tentative\n\nagreement or offer to the principal for approval.  \"Handling\"\n\nis not a  synonym for  \"authorized to sell.\"   Hence,  Cain's\n\nanswer to Casey's query that he was the FDIC person with whom\n\nCasey should  be  dealing was  correct, and  should not  have\n\nsuggested  to Casey  that Cain  was vested with  authority to\n\nclose a deal for the Property.\n\n          While hardly a  model of clarity,7  we nevertheless\n\nhold that  the only  reasonable interpretation of  the entire\n\nparagraph at  issue places  the  recipient of  the letter  on\n\nnotice  that  the  FDIC's  \"counter offer\"  of  $130,000  was\n\nsubject  to further  approval.   This interpretation  gives a\n\nreasonable  meaning to  each  sentence; it  alters the  plain\n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  Following  the  initiation  of  this  lawsuit,  the  FDIC\nchanged the  \"macros\" on account officers'  computers so that\nthey  could  not  fire  off  \"counteroffers\"  with  a  simple\nkeystroke.  If Cain were to write his letter today,  it would\nnot contain the word \"counteroffer,\" but would instead invite\nanother offer from Bourque.\n     We  agree  that handling  the  transaction  in this  way\nprovides  the potential  buyer  virtually  no opportunity  to\nmistake the FDIC's communication as an offer, and we would no\ndoubt not be deciding this case had the FDIC taken this  step\nin responding  to Bourque's first offer.   Nevertheless, just\nas a subsequent modification  does not prove negligence in  a\ndefective design case (indeed, it  is not even admissible for\nthat purpose under the Federal Rules of Evidence), the FDIC's\nchange  is not  probative of  what Cain's  letter meant  to a\nreasonable reader  in Bourque's position (i.e.,  one aided by\nan attorney such as Casey).    \n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nmeaning of the paragraph's  second and last sentences  -- the\n\napparent  extension  of  an   offer  and  the  invitation  of\n\nacceptance  by a prescribed method -- only if one reads those\n\nparticular  sentences in isolation.  When read as a whole, as\n\nit must  be read,  the paragraph  sets forth  with sufficient\n\nclarity that the recipient may \"accept\" Cain's \"counteroffer\"\n\nof $130,000,  but  only  subject to  final  approval  by  the\n\nappropriate  FDIC authority.   We are  unable to  discern any\n\nother  reading of the paragraph -- and Bourque has not guided\n\nus  to  one --  that gives  some  reasonable meaning  to each\n\nsentence.\n\nD.  Conclusion: The June 23 Letter Was Not an Offer\r                                                               \n\n          Because the only  reasonable interpretation of  the\n\nJune  23   letter  is   that  Casey's  \"acceptance\"   of  the\n\ncounteroffer would  still be  subject to approval,  Casey was\n\nnot justified in believing that his assent to the offer would\n\nconclude  the deal;  it was  \"reasonably apparent\"  that some\n\nfurther act by the FDIC would be necessary to close the deal.\n\nCain's June 23  letter, therefore,  even though  it used  the\n\nwords \"counter offer,\" was no offer at all; it was instead an\n\ninvitation for Bourque to  make an offer to buy  the Property\n\nfor $130,000.  Bourque  made that offer when he  returned the\n\namended purchase-and-sale  agreement to  the FDIC.   The FDIC\n\nnever accepted  the offer, however, so as a matter of law, no\n\ncontract was ever formed between the parties.\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n          Thus,   the  defendants  are  entitled  to  summary\n\njudgment and the district court's decision is\n\n          AFFIRMED.

(\"Newmark\") (collectively, \"defendants\").  Bourque claims that the FDIC and Newmark agreed to sell him a piece of property in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, for $130,000.  The defendants denied that a contract had been formed and filed separate motions for summary judgment.  The district court granted defendants' motions, and Bourque appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDIC is the receiver and liquidating agent of Eastland Savings Bank of Woonsocket.  In its capacity as receiver, the FDIC is the sole shareholder of Newmark, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastland.  In December 1992, Newmark retained the FDIC to market its real estate assets, including the property at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1993, Bourque's attorney, Edward J. Casey, wrote to FDIC account officer Curtis Cain that Bourque was interested in purchasing the property at 846 Cumberland Hill Road in Woonsocket (the \"Property\").  Casey asked Cain whether he was \"the person handling the asset,\" whether he had authority \"to discuss\" the Property, and what the current status of the Property was.  At Cain's direction, Cain's assistant contacted Casey and informed him that Cain was indeed the person \"handling\" the Property, but she apparently did not inform Casey of any limitations on Cain's authority to sell the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 1993, Casey sent Cain a letter offering to buy the Property on Bourque's behalf for $105,500.  Casey enclosed a $10,000 earnest money deposit and an FDIC purchase-and-sale agreement form signed by Bourque that described the Property and the terms of the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain's response, dated June 23, 1993, (the \"June 23 letter\") was printed on FDIC Division of Liquidation letterhead and bore the heading \"NOTICE OF REJECTION OF OFFER\".   The letter's critical paragraph read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>This letter is to advise you that FDIC is unable to accept Mr. Bourque's offer.  FDIC's counter offer is $130,000.00.  All offers are subject to approval by the appropriate FDIC delegated authority.  FDIC has the right to accept or reject any and all offers.  I am returning your customer's contract of sale and earnest money deposit.  If your customer wishes to accept this counter offer, please return the amended Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement to me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain did not return Bourque's $10,000 deposit.  Indeed, the FDIC deposited the check \"by mistake,\" according to the deposition testimony of Cain's supervisor, Donald Lund.  Cain also failed, contrary to FDIC policy, to attach a standard \"Letter of Understanding\" to the FDIC purchase-and-sale agreement form he returned to Casey along with the rejection notice.  That form letter explicitly states that the FDIC account officer has no delegated authority to accept an offer and that \"[n]o contract will arise\" until the appropriate delegated authority notifies the offeror that it has accepted the offer.  Under FDIC policy, account officers may suggest and negotiate terms and recommend appropriate offers for approval by the proper delegated authority, but they do not have the authority to liquidate FDIC assets by binding contracts.  That authority is conferred on other job titles;  in this case, the sale of the Property could have been approved by an FDIC assistant managing liquidator.  Other than Cain's June 23 letter, there is no evidence that anyone at the FDIC communicated this policy to Casey or Bourque in connection with the transaction before this dispute arose.  John Chiungos, another FDIC account officer, however, testified at his deposition that he had explained the policy to Casey in connection with another, smaller transaction in January 1993.  At his deposition, Casey at first testified that he had never had prior dealings with the FDIC;  then, when confronted with documentary evidence of the prior transaction, he said he had \"completely forgot\" about it.  In any event, Casey did not rebut Chiungos' testimony that Chiungos had explained the FDIC liquidation policy to Casey at least on one prior occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 1993, Casey returned to Cain the purchase-and-sale agreement, which was signed by Bourque and amended to indicate a $130,000 purchase price (the \"Agreement\").  The Agreement set forth July 30, 1993, as the closing date for the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 1993, another FDIC account officer, Elizabeth M. Carroll, informed Casey by telephone that the FDIC had received an offer on the Property substantially in excess of $130,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Casey responded by sending Carroll a letter stating that Bourque considered the parties to be bound by contract and that Bourque would litigate, if necessary, to obtain the benefit of his bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1993, Carroll sent a letter to Bruce E. Thompson, Casey's law partner, stating that the FDIC would not accept Bourque's $130,000 offer, but that Bourque could submit another offer of at least $250,000 by that afternoon for consideration by the appropriate FDIC delegated authority.  In her letter, Carroll wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>After reviewing the file and conferring with the previous account officer, it is clear that the FDIC's policy that account officers have no authority to bind the FDIC or its subsidiary corporation was communicated to your client.  Mr. Cain indicated to your client that his authority is limited to recommending an offer and that all final offers are subject to approval by the appropriate delegated authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 2, after the FDIC refused to sell the property to Bourque, Bourque filed a notice of lis pendens on the property and instituted this action, seeking specific performance from either FDIC or Newmark, and damages from the FDIC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed separate summary judgment motions, arguing that there was no contract between the parties, that the alleged contract violated Rhode Island's Statute of Frauds and that Cain did not have actual or apparent authority to bind the FDIC or Newmark.  A magistrate judge recommended that the motions be granted, and following oral argument, the district court adopted that recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by reviewing traditional summary judgment principles and how they apply in contract formation disputes.  With those principles in mind, we then turn to Bourque's substantive argument that summary judgment is inappropriate.  Because our resolution of the contract formation issue is dispositive, we do not reach the statute of frauds or agency issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A. Summary Judgment in Contract Formation Disputes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accord a district court's grant of summary judgment no deference;  the scope of our review is plenary.  Alan Corp. v. International Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 22 F.3d 339, 341 (1st Cir.1994).  We affirm a grant of summary judgment if our evaluation of the parties' proof on file--viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant--reveals \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  NASCO, Inc. v. Public Storage, Inc., 29 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).  An issue is only \"genuine\" if there is sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to resolve the point in the nonmoving party's favor, NASCO, 29 F.3d at 32, while a fact is only \"material\" if it has \" 'the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law.' \"  Id. (quoting Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 703 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an axiom of modern contract law that the formation of a contract requires the \"manifestation of mutual assent\" by the parties to the agreement.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 17 (1981).  Under Rhode Island's law of contracts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we look to the parties' words and actions to determine whether they have manifested the objective intent to promise or be bound.  Smith v. Boyd, 553 A.2d 131, 133 (R.I.1989).  This manifestation \"almost invariably takes the form of an offer or proposal by one party accepted by the other party or parties.\"  McLaughlin v. Stevens, 296 F.Supp. 610, 613 (D.R.I.1969) (interpreting Rhode Island law).  Determining whether there was mutual assent may involve factual questions:  What did the parties say (or do) to manifest their intent?   Were the parties' understandings of each other's actions reasonable under all the circumstances?   Answering these questions is the province of the factfinder and not the court.  See Salem Laundry Co. v. New England Teamsters and Trucking Indus. Pension Fund, 829 F.2d 278, 280 (1st Cir.1987) (stating that it is \"a question of fact whether any particular conduct or actions imply a contractual understanding\" (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like other questions of fact, however, there is sometimes no genuine issue as to whether the parties' conduct implied a \"contractual understanding.\"   The words and actions that allegedly formed a contract may be \" 'so clear themselves that reasonable people could not differ over their meaning.' \"  FDIC v. Singh, 977 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Secretary of Dep't of HUD, 768 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1985)).  In such cases, \"the judge must decide the issue himself, just as he decides any factual issue in respect to which reasonable people cannot differ.\"  Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, 768 F.2d at 8.   Even if the language of a purported contract is ambiguous, summary judgment is appropriate when the extrinsic evidence about the parties' meaning is \" 'so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide the contrary.' \"  Allen v. Adage, Inc., 967 F.2d 695, 698 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, 768 F.2d at 8).   A corollary of this last proposition is that even if the language of purported assent is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, summary judgment is nevertheless appropriate if none of those interpretations would support the nonmovant's legal argument.  See O'Connor v. McKanna, 116 R.I. 627, 359 A.2d 350, 354 (1976) (stating that summary judgment must be denied if the factfinder \"could reasonably adopt the opposing party's version as to what was said and done and intended by the parties\");  Knight v. Sharif, 875 F.2d 516, 523 (5th Cir.1989) (granting summary judgment in contract formation dispute where nonmovant was unable to \"provide a plausible interpretation\" of the documents at issue that would support his argument that a contract had been formed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placed in the context of this case, Bourque can avoid summary judgment only if we are able to discern a reasonable interpretation of Cain's June 23 letter that supports Bourque's legal argument--that Cain's June 23 letter constituted an unequivocal offer to sell Bourque the Property for $130,000.  This we are unable to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Law of Offers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An offer is a \"manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.\"   Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 24 at 71 (1981) (emphasis supplied). See also 1 Corbin on Contracts Sec. 1.11 at 31 (rev. ed. 1993) (\"So long as it is reasonably apparent that some further act of the purported offeror is necessary, the purported offeree has no power to create contractual relations, and there is as yet no operative offer.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that a party uses the word \"offer\" or \"counteroffer\" in a communication with another party \"is deserving of weight, but it is not controlling, and a court may decide that what is called an offer is merely an invitation to the recipient to make an offer.\"   E. Allen Farnsworth, Contracts Sec. 3.10, at 139 (2d ed. 1990).  \"On the other hand, the insertion into a proposal of a clause that reserves to its maker the power to close the deal is a compelling indication that the proposal is not an offer.\"   Id.  Thus, in Foster &amp; Kleiser v. Baltimore County, 57 Md.App. 531, 470 A.2d 1322, 1326 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1984), an agreement by which Baltimore County purported to purchase land, but that contained a clause stating that the agreement was null and void if not approved by the county council, was held merely part of preliminary negotiations because the seller of the land \"could not have accepted [the county's] 'offer' without further action by the County.\"   See also Dillon v. AFBIC Dev.  Corp., 420 F.Supp. 572 (S.D.Ala.1976), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 597 F.2d 556 (5th Cir.1979) (holding that woman's \"offer\" to purchase house \"subject to approval\" by husband lacked clarity of intent and mutuality of obligation and was therefore not an offer that, without more, could bind the parties);  Engineering Assocs. v. Irving Place Assocs., 622 P.2d 784, 787 (Utah 1980) (holding that letter \"offering\" to make mortgage loan, with the agreement to become binding upon execution of documents by \"offeror's\" chairman, was merely invitation to submit offer, because purported offeror \"reserved to itself the last act in the formation of any agreement between the parties\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bourque argues that cases such as Dillon and Foster &amp; Kleiser are inapposite because the purported offerors in those cases clearly reserved authority to take further action, while Cain did no such thing.  We agree that Cain could have expressed his intention with more clarity, and we do not base our decision primarily on these cases.  Rather, we recognize that where intent and the meaning of contract language are at issue, cases in which different parties had an entirely different set of communications are of limited precedential value.  Nevertheless, we think that these cases do support the general principle that unequivocal language of offer or acceptance cannot be taken in isolation from other, qualifying language in the document and that where the unqualified statement and the qualification coexist, the qualification is likely to control, at least in the context of offer and acceptances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Interpreting the June 23 Letter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that Cain's June 23 letter contained an offer that bound the FDIC and Newmark, Bourque focuses our attention on the second and sixth sentences of the letter's critical paragraph:  \"FDIC's counter offer is $130,000.00....  If your customer wishes to accept this counter offer, please return the amended Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement to me.\"   Bourque argues that these words are unequivocal, conveying no possible meaning other than that the FDIC was offering the Property to Bourque for the stated price, and that Bourque could accept the offer in the prescribed manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Cain had written no more than those two sentences, then Bourque's acceptance may well have formed a contract between the parties.  But Cain's letter did say more, and it is a fundamental tenet of Rhode Island and general contract law that \"[i]n ascertaining what the [parties'] intent is we must look at the instrument as a whole and not at some detached portion thereof.\"  Hill v. M.S. Alper &amp; Son, Inc., 106 R.I. 38, 256 A.2d 10, 15 (1969).  See also In re Newport Plaza Assoc., 985 F.2d 640, 646 (1st Cir.1993) (applying Rhode Island law and stating that \"a court is duty bound to construe contractual terms in the context of the contract as a whole\");  Dial Media, Inc. v. Schiff, 612 F.Supp. 1483, 1488 (D.R.I.1985) (\"An interpretation which gives reasonable and effective meaning to all manifestations of intent is to be preferred to one which leaves part of the manifestation of no effect.\")  (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately following the sentence \"FDIC's counter offer is $130,000.00,\" Cain wrote:  \"All offers are subject to approval by the appropriate FDIC delegated authority.  FDIC has the right to accept or reject any and all offers.\"   The defendants argue that these sentences clearly and unambiguously attached a condition to Cain's $130,000 counteroffer:  the approval of the offer by the appropriate FDIC authority.  Bourque argues that these sentences, when read in the context of the entire paragraph and Casey's prior communications with Cain, did nothing to dispel his reasonable understanding that he could indeed enter into a binding contract by performing the act prescribed by Cain in the letter's final sentence.  At the very least, Bourque argues, the paragraph is ambiguous and should be construed against the FDIC, since it drafted the document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Bourque's counsel stated that, under the circumstances of this case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> where Cain had told Casey that he was the person \"handling\" the Property, the paragraph at issue could only mean that the writer of the letter himself--i.e., Cain--was the appropriate FDIC delegated authority and that he included the \"subject to approval\" language even though he had already approved the $130,000 figure.  This interpretation, rather than giving a \"reasonable and effective meaning\" to the paragraph's third and fourth sentences, foists upon them a tortured, illogical reading.  An offer cannot be both subject to approval and already approved:  it is either one or the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Nor would one reasonably expect the \"appropriate delegated authority\"--even of the FDIC--to refer to himself in the third person in proclaiming that he retained the power to approve all offers.  One would understand that the appropriate authority must be someone else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bourque attempts to avoid these linguistic obstacles by emphasizing that, on its own terms, Cain's letter distinguishes \"counter offers\" from \"offers.\"   Thus, so this argument goes, the third and fourth sentences of the letter reserve FDIC approval only for \"offers\"--i.e., offers to buy the Property for less than $130,000--and not for the FDIC's \"counter offer\" to sell it at the specified price, which the paragraph's final sentence unambiguously holds out for acceptance by a prescribed method.  This interpretation fails too, however, for it places undue reliance on the presence of the words \"counter\" and \"accept,\" while glossing over the manifestation of reluctance to be bound contained in the third and fourth sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that a counteroffer is simply an offer that operates also as a rejection of a previous offer;  it is still very much an offer.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 39 (1981).  Bourque's argument assumes that the use of the word \"counter\" by Cain removed the FDIC's $130,000 \"offer\" from the set of offers referred to in the very next sentence:  \"All offers are subject to approval by the appropriate FDIC delegated authority.\"  (emphasis supplied)  There is nothing magical about the word \"counter,\" however;  it is merely a descriptive term, letting us know that another offer preceded the counteroffer and was rejected, either explicitly or implicitly by the making of the counteroffer.  Bourque responds to the fact that a counteroffer is \"technically\" an offer by calling it a \"legalistic obfuscation\" that ignores the fact that the FDIC \"explicitly empowered Bourque to accept its counteroffer, and told him how to do so.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We respond thusly.  First, it is hardly a technical, legalistic obfuscation to say that counteroffers are offers;  we think that is rather elementary.  Second, Casey is a lawyer, and had some familiarity with how the FDIC works;  even if this argument is \"legalistic,\" it is not one that should have entirely eluded him when he read the letter.  See Trifiro v. New York Life Ins. Co., 845 F.2d 30, 33 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that when confronted with conflicting manifestations of intent, \"a reasonable person investigates matters further;  he receives assurances or clarification before relying\").  Third, the FDIC only \"empowered Bourque to accept its counteroffer\" according to the terms of that offer, which included obtaining the approval of the appropriate delegated authority.  See In re Newport Plaza Assoc., 985 F.2d at 645 (stating that under Rhode Island law, the offeror controls the offer and the terms of its acceptance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bourque attaches great significance to the fact that Cain, through his assistant, confirmed to Bourque that he was indeed the person \"handling\" the Property and that he did not expressly state that his authority to sell the Property was limited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal with the latter point first.  Cain did in fact state that his authority was limited, by informing Casey that \"[a]ll offers are subject to approval by the appropriate delegated authority.\"   As we explained above, Cain cannot reasonably be viewed as referring to himself here.  As for Cain's statement that he was \"handling\" the Property, he was indeed:  he was handling bids on the Property, much like a real estate agent or a loan officer at a bank \"handles\" preliminary negotiations before submitting a tentative agreement or offer to the principal for approval.  \"Handling\" is not a synonym for \"authorized to sell.\"   Hence, Cain's answer to Casey's query that he was the FDIC person with whom Casey should be dealing was correct, and should not have suggested to Casey that Cain was vested with authority to close a deal for the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While hardly a model of clarity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> we nevertheless hold that the only reasonable interpretation of the entire paragraph at issue places the recipient of the letter on notice that the FDIC's \"counter offer\" of $130,000 was subject to further approval.  This interpretation gives a reasonable meaning to each sentence;  it alters the plain meaning of the paragraph's second and last sentences--the apparent extension of an offer and the invitation of acceptance by a prescribed method--only if one reads those particular sentences in isolation.  When read as a whole, as it must be read, the paragraph sets forth with sufficient clarity that the recipient may \"accept\" Cain's \"counteroffer\" of $130,000, but only subject to final approval by the appropriate FDIC authority.  We are unable to discern any other reading of the paragraph--and Bourque has not guided us to one--that gives some reasonable meaning to each sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>D. Conclusion:  The June 23 Letter Was Not an Offer</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the only reasonable interpretation of the June 23 letter is that Casey's \"acceptance\" of the counteroffer would still be subject to approval, Casey was not justified in believing that his assent to the offer would conclude the deal;  it was \"reasonably apparent\" that some further act by the FDIC would be necessary to close the deal.  Cain's June 23 letter, therefore, even though it used the words \"counter offer,\" was no offer at all;  it was instead an invitation for Bourque to make an offer to buy the Property for $130,000.  Bourque made that offer when he returned the amended purchase-and-sale agreement to the FDIC.  The FDIC never accepted the offer, however, so as a matter of law, no contract was ever formed between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment and the district court's decision is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.

Gauthier is the real estate agent who brokered this higher (and ultimately successful) offer for the Property, and his office stands to receive a 4.5% commission on the $253,000 transaction.  Carroll's supervisor, Donald Lund, testified at his deposition that had he known of Carroll's past working relationship with Gauthier, he would not have let her market the Property to him.  While these questionable dealings indicate that the FDIC may wish to review its oversight practices, they do not animate our decision in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> On August 9, 1993, the FDIC entered into an agreement to sell the Property to Supreme Corporation of Goshen, Indiana, for $253,000.

He fails to explain, however, exactly how this action could be understood as a manifestation of intent in light of Cain's express statement in the June 23 letter that he was returning the check to Bourque</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Under Rhode Island contract law, \"unless a plain and unambiguous intent to the contrary is manifested, the words used in the contract are assigned their ordinary meaning.\"  Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. v.

The word \"subject,\" when used as an adjective, has several possible meanings, according to Webster's Third New International Dictionary.   The only meaning that makes any sense in the context of the June 23 letter, however, is \"likely to be conditioned, affected, or modified in some indicated way:  having a contingent relation to something and usu[ally] dependent on such relation for final form, validity, or significance.\"   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2275 (1986).  This meaning, implying future action, is inconsistent with Bourque's purported understanding that the offer had already been approved</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Following the initiation of this lawsuit, the FDIC changed the \"macros\" on account officers' computers so that they could not fire off \"counteroffers\" with a simple keystroke.  If Cain were to write his letter today, it would not contain the word \"counteroffer,\" but would instead invite another offer from Bourque</p>\n        <p>We agree that handling the transaction in this way provides the potential buyer virtually no opportunity to mistake the FDIC's communication as an offer, and we would no doubt not be deciding this case had the FDIC taken this step in responding to Bourque's first offer.  Nevertheless, just as a subsequent modification does not prove negligence in a defective design case (indeed, it is not even admissible for that purpose under the Federal Rules of Evidence), the FDIC's change is not probative of what Cain's letter meant to a reasonable reader in Bourque's position (i.e., one aided by an attorney such as Casey).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(\"Newmark\") (collectively, \"defendants\").  Bourque claims that the FDIC and Newmark agreed to sell him a piece of property in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, for $130,000.  The defendants denied that a contract had been formed and filed separate motions for summary judgment.  The district court granted defendants' motions, and Bourque appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDIC is the receiver and liquidating agent of Eastland Savings Bank of Woonsocket.  In its capacity as receiver, the FDIC is the sole shareholder of Newmark, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastland.  In December 1992, Newmark retained the FDIC to market its real estate assets, including the property at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1993, Bourque's attorney, Edward J. Casey, wrote to FDIC account officer Curtis Cain that Bourque was interested in purchasing the property at 846 Cumberland Hill Road in Woonsocket (the \"Property\").  Casey asked Cain whether he was \"the person handling the asset,\" whether he had authority \"to discuss\" the Property, and what the current status of the Property was.  At Cain's direction, Cain's assistant contacted Casey and informed him that Cain was indeed the person \"handling\" the Property, but she apparently did not inform Casey of any limitations on Cain's authority to sell the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 1993, Casey sent Cain a letter offering to buy the Property on Bourque's behalf for $105,500.  Casey enclosed a $10,000 earnest money deposit and an FDIC purchase-and-sale agreement form signed by Bourque that described the Property and the terms of the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain's response, dated June 23, 1993, (the \"June 23 letter\") was printed on FDIC Division of Liquidation letterhead and bore the heading \"NOTICE OF REJECTION OF OFFER\".   The letter's critical paragraph read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>This letter is to advise you that FDIC is unable to accept Mr. Bourque's offer.  FDIC's counter offer is $130,000.00.  All offers are subject to approval by the appropriate FDIC delegated authority.  FDIC has the right to accept or reject any and all offers.  I am returning your customer's contract of sale and earnest money deposit.  If your customer wishes to accept this counter offer, please return the amended Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement to me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain did not return Bourque's $10,000 deposit.  Indeed, the FDIC deposited the check \"by mistake,\" according to the deposition testimony of Cain's supervisor, Donald Lund.  Cain also failed, contrary to FDIC policy, to attach a standard \"Letter of Understanding\" to the FDIC purchase-and-sale agreement form he returned to Casey along with the rejection notice.  That form letter explicitly states that the FDIC account officer has no delegated authority to accept an offer and that \"[n]o contract will arise\" until the appropriate delegated authority notifies the offeror that it has accepted the offer.  Under FDIC policy, account officers may suggest and negotiate terms and recommend appropriate offers for approval by the proper delegated authority, but they do not have the authority to liquidate FDIC assets by binding contracts.  That authority is conferred on other job titles;  in this case, the sale of the Property could have been approved by an FDIC assistant managing liquidator.  Other than Cain's June 23 letter, there is no evidence that anyone at the FDIC communicated this policy to Casey or Bourque in connection with the transaction before this dispute arose.  John Chiungos, another FDIC account officer, however, testified at his deposition that he had explained the policy to Casey in connection with another, smaller transaction in January 1993.  At his deposition, Casey at first testified that he had never had prior dealings with the FDIC;  then, when confronted with documentary evidence of the prior transaction, he said he had \"completely forgot\" about it.  In any event, Casey did not rebut Chiungos' testimony that Chiungos had explained the FDIC liquidation policy to Casey at least on one prior occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 1993, Casey returned to Cain the purchase-and-sale agreement, which was signed by Bourque and amended to indicate a $130,000 purchase price (the \"Agreement\").  The Agreement set forth July 30, 1993, as the closing date for the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 1993, another FDIC account officer, Elizabeth M. Carroll, informed Casey by telephone that the FDIC had received an offer on the Property substantially in excess of $130,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Casey responded by sending Carroll a letter stating that Bourque considered the parties to be bound by contract and that Bourque would litigate, if necessary, to obtain the benefit of his bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1993, Carroll sent a letter to Bruce E. Thompson, Casey's law partner, stating that the FDIC would not accept Bourque's $130,000 offer, but that Bourque could submit another offer of at least $250,000 by that afternoon for consideration by the appropriate FDIC delegated authority.  In her letter, Carroll wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>After reviewing the file and conferring with the previous account officer, it is clear that the FDIC's policy that account officers have no authority to bind the FDIC or its subsidiary corporation was communicated to your client.

A magistrate judge recommended that the motions be granted, and following oral argument, the district court adopted that recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by reviewing traditional summary judgment principles and how they apply in contract formation disputes.

We agree that Cain could have expressed his intention with more clarity, and we do not base our decision primarily on these cases.  Rather, we recognize that where intent and the meaning of contract language are at issue, cases in which different parties had an entirely different set of communications are of limited precedential value.  Nevertheless, we think that these cases do support the general principle that unequivocal language of offer or acceptance cannot be taken in isolation from other, qualifying language in the document and that where the unqualified statement and the qualification coexist, the qualification is likely to control, at least in the context of offer and acceptances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Interpreting the June 23 Letter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that Cain's June 23 letter contained an offer that bound the FDIC and Newmark, Bourque focuses our attention on the second and sixth sentences of the letter's critical paragraph:  \"FDIC's counter offer is $130,000.00....  If your customer wishes to accept this counter offer, please return the amended Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement to me.\"   Bourque argues that these words are unequivocal, conveying no possible meaning other than that the FDIC was offering the Property to Bourque for the stated price, and that Bourque could accept the offer in the prescribed manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Cain had written no more than those two sentences, then Bourque's acceptance may well have formed a contract between the parties.  But Cain's letter did say more, and it is a fundamental tenet of Rhode Island and general contract law that \"[i]n ascertaining what the [parties'] intent is we must look at the instrument as a whole and not at some detached portion thereof.\"  Hill v.

FDIC has the right to accept or reject any and all offers.\"   The defendants argue that these sentences clearly and unambiguously attached a condition to Cain's $130,000 counteroffer:  the approval of the offer by the appropriate FDIC authority.  Bourque argues that these sentences, when read in the context of the entire paragraph and Casey's prior communications with Cain, did nothing to dispel his reasonable understanding that he could indeed enter into a binding contract by performing the act prescribed by Cain in the letter's final sentence.  At the very least, Bourque argues, the paragraph is ambiguous and should be construed against the FDIC, since it drafted the document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Bourque's counsel stated that, under the circumstances of this case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> where Cain had told Casey that he was the person \"handling\" the Property, the paragraph at issue could only mean that the writer of the letter himself--i.e., Cain--was the appropriate FDIC delegated authority and that he included the \"subject to approval\" language even though he had already approved the $130,000 figure.  This interpretation, rather than giving a \"reasonable and effective meaning\" to the paragraph's third and fourth sentences, foists upon them a tortured, illogical reading.  An offer cannot be both subject to approval and already approved:  it is either one or the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Nor would one reasonably expect the \"appropriate delegated authority\"--even of the FDIC--to refer to himself in the third person in proclaiming that he retained the power to approve all offers.  One would understand that the appropriate authority must be someone else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bourque attempts to avoid these linguistic obstacles by emphasizing that, on its own terms, Cain's letter distinguishes \"counter offers\" from \"offers.\"   Thus, so this argument goes, the third and fourth sentences of the letter reserve FDIC approval only for \"offers\"--i.e., offers to buy the Property for less than $130,000--and not for the FDIC's \"counter offer\" to sell it at the specified price, which the paragraph's final sentence unambiguously holds out for acceptance by a prescribed method.  This interpretation fails too, however, for it places undue reliance on the presence of the words \"counter\" and \"accept,\" while glossing over the manifestation of reluctance to be bound contained in the third and fourth sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that a counteroffer is simply an offer that operates also as a rejection of a previous offer;  it is still very much an offer.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 39 (1981).  Bourque's argument assumes that the use of the word \"counter\" by Cain removed the FDIC's $130,000 \"offer\" from the set of offers referred to in the very next sentence:  \"All offers are subject to approval by the appropriate FDIC delegated authority.\"  (emphasis supplied)  There is nothing magical about the word \"counter,\" however;  it is merely a descriptive term, letting us know that another offer preceded the counteroffer and was rejected, either explicitly or implicitly by the making of the counteroffer.  Bourque responds to the fact that a counteroffer is \"technically\" an offer by calling it a \"legalistic obfuscation\" that ignores the fact that the FDIC \"explicitly empowered Bourque to accept its counteroffer, and told him how to do so.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We respond thusly.  First, it is hardly a technical, legalistic obfuscation to say that counteroffers are offers;  we think that is rather elementary.  Second, Casey is a lawyer, and had some familiarity with how the FDIC works;  even if this argument is \"legalistic,\" it is not one that should have entirely eluded him when he read the letter.  See Trifiro v. New York Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504709\"><a href=\"/opinion/504709/richard-j-trifiro-v-new-york-life-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that when confronted with conflicting manifestations of intent, \"a reasonable person investigates matters further;  he receives assurances or clarification before relying\").  Third, the FDIC only \"empowered Bourque to accept its counteroffer\" according to the terms of that offer, which included obtaining the approval of the appropriate delegated authority.  See In re Newport Plaza <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600262\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Assoc.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/600262/in-re-newport-plaza-associates-lp-debtor-newport-plaza-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">645</span> </a></span>(stating that under Rhode Island law, the offeror controls the offer and the terms of its acceptance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bourque attaches great significance to the fact that Cain, through his assistant, confirmed to Bourque that he was indeed the person \"handling\" the Property and that he did not expressly state that his authority to sell the Property was limited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal with the latter point first.  Cain did in fact state that his authority was limited, by informing Casey that \"[a]ll offers are subject to approval by the appropriate delegated authority.\"   As we explained above, Cain cannot reasonably be viewed as referring to himself here.  As for Cain's statement that he was \"handling\" the Property, he was indeed:  he was handling bids on the Property, much like a real estate agent or a loan officer at a bank \"handles\" preliminary negotiations before submitting a tentative agreement or offer to the principal for approval.  \"Handling\" is not a synonym for \"authorized to sell.\"   Hence, Cain's answer to Casey's query that he was the FDIC person with whom Casey should be dealing was correct, and should not have suggested to Casey that Cain was vested with authority to close a deal for the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While hardly a model of clarity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> we nevertheless hold that the only reasonable interpretation of the entire paragraph at issue places the recipient of the letter on notice that the FDIC's \"counter offer\" of $130,000 was subject to further approval.  This interpretation gives a reasonable meaning to each sentence;  it alters the plain meaning of the paragraph's second and last sentences--the apparent extension of an offer and the invitation of acceptance by a prescribed method--only if one reads those particular sentences in isolation.  When read as a whole, as it must be read, the paragraph sets forth with sufficient clarity that the recipient may \"accept\" Cain's \"counteroffer\" of $130,000, but only subject to final approval by the appropriate FDIC authority.  We are unable to discern any other reading of the paragraph--and Bourque has not guided us to one--that gives some reasonable meaning to each sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>D.

Cain's June 23 letter, therefore, even though it used the words \"counter offer,\" was no offer at all;  it was instead an invitation for Bourque to make an offer to buy the Property for $130,000.  Bourque made that offer when he returned the amended purchase-and-sale agreement to the FDIC.  The FDIC never accepted the offer, however, so as a matter of law, no contract was ever formed between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment and the district court's decision is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.

Gauthier is the real estate agent who brokered this higher (and ultimately successful) offer for the Property, and his office stands to receive a 4.5% commission on the $253,000 transaction.  Carroll's supervisor, Donald Lund, testified at his deposition that had he known of Carroll's past working relationship with Gauthier, he would not have let her market the Property to him.  While these questionable dealings indicate that the FDIC may wish to review its oversight practices, they do not animate our decision in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> On August 9, 1993, the FDIC entered into an agreement to sell the Property to Supreme Corporation of Goshen, Indiana, for $253,000.

The word \"subject,\" when used as an adjective, has several possible meanings, according to Webster's Third New International Dictionary.   The only meaning that makes any sense in the context of the June 23 letter, however, is \"likely to be conditioned, affected, or modified in some indicated way:  having a contingent relation to something and usu[ally] dependent on such relation for final form, validity, or significance.\"   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2275 (1986).  This meaning, implying future action, is inconsistent with Bourque's purported understanding that the offer had already been approved</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Following the initiation of this lawsuit, the FDIC changed the \"macros\" on account officers' computers so that they could not fire off \"counteroffers\" with a simple keystroke.  If Cain were to write his letter today, it would not contain the word \"counteroffer,\" but would instead invite another offer from Bourque</p>\n        <p>We agree that handling the transaction in this way provides the potential buyer virtually no opportunity to mistake the FDIC's communication as an offer, and we would no doubt not be deciding this case had the FDIC taken this step in responding to Bourque's first offer.  Nevertheless, just as a subsequent modification does not prove negligence in a defective design case (indeed, it is not even admissible for that purpose under the Federal Rules of Evidence), the FDIC's change is not probative of what Cain's letter meant to a reasonable reader in Bourque's position (i.e., one aided by an attorney such as Casey).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
