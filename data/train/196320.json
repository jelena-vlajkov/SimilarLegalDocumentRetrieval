After Bogosian failed to endorse over\r\n\nto F&amp;M checks made payable to Bogosian by the defendant in\r\n\nthe underlying litigation and delivered to F&amp;M as her\r\n\ncounsel, F&amp;M sued Bogosian for breach of contract.  Bogosian\r\n\ncounterclaimed for malpractice and breach of the attorney-\r\n\nclient contract.  The district court awarded summary judgment\r\n\nto F&amp;M on all claims.  We now reverse the award of summary\r\n\njudgment on F&amp;M's breach-of-contract claim, and affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's ruling on Bogosian's counterclaims.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n          In  November  1989,  following  the  withdrawal  of\r\n\nBogosian's prior counsel from the underlying litigation, F&amp;M,\r\n\na  Providence,   Rhode  Island,  law  firm,   took  over  the\r\n\nrepresentation  of Bogosian,  a  citizen of  Florida, in  the\r\n\nongoing lawsuits  stemming from  her involvement in  a family\r\n\nreal estate empire created by her and her two brothers, James\r\n\nH.   Woloohojian  and   Harry  Woloohojian   (now  deceased).\r\n\nBogosian had few liquid assets at  the time from which to pay\r\n\nher lawyers  but stood  to receive  substantial amounts  as a\r\n\nresult of  her lawsuits.   In  a letter sent  to Bogosian  on\r\n\nNovember  24,  1989 (the  \"November  24  letter\"), and  which\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nBogosian then signed indicating her  agreement, F&amp;M explained\r\n\nthe terms of  its representation.   The firm  would obtain  a\r\n\n$25,000  retainer  from  Bogosian,  to  be  deposited  in  an\r\n\ninterest-bearing account; it would   bill Bogosian each month\r\n\nat  its lawyers' hourly rates, with each bill due and payable\r\n\nwithin ten days after receipt; and interest would  accrue (at\r\n\na local  bank's prime  rate) on  bills outstanding for  sixty\r\n\ndays or more.

It is my  understanding that you\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  \"E &amp;  J  receivership\" and  the \"Woloohojian  Realty\r\nAssociates receivership\" are  state court actions  concerning\r\ntwo  family real  estate  partnerships.   The \"federal  court\r\nlitigation\"  (or  \"valuation\"  litigation)  was   brought  by\r\nBogosian in the United States District Court for the District\r\nof  Rhode Island  to  dissolve the  family-owned  Woloohojian\r\nRealty   Corporation  (\"WRC\"),   pursuant  to   Rhode  Island\r\ncorporations  law.   See R.I.  Gen. Laws    7-1.1-90.   After\r                                    \r\nBogosian filed her lawsuit,  WRC exercised its option to  buy\r\nout Bogosian's one-third share of the corporation rather than\r\nface dissolution.  In April 1995,  the district court adopted\r\nas its  findings  the  report  of a  special  master  valuing\r\nBogosian's  WRC  stock  at   $4,901,801.

F&amp;M\r\n\nfiled an  appropriate financing statement with  the office of\r\n\nthe  Secretary of  State, asserting  F&amp;M's rights  as secured\r\n\nparty to \"[a]ll of Debtor's rights to the recoveries received\r\n\nby Debtor arising from\" Bogosian's various lawsuits.\r\n\n          F&amp;M  represented  Bogosian  pursuant to  the  above\r\n\nterms in at least ten different matters between late 1989 and\r\n\nthe  end of 1992,  with the bulk  of its time  devoted to the\r\n\nvaluation litigation.   In July  1990, the district  court in\r\n\nthat case ordered  WRC (1)  to grant Bogosian  a $10  million\r\n\nmortgage  on one of WRC's properties as security to guarantee\r\n\neventual payment  of her  shares' value  once that  value had\r\n\nbeen determined,  and (2)  to provide Bogosian  with \"interim\r\n\ndistribution\" payments  of an  initial $100,000  plus $10,000\r\n\nper  month, to continue until  the entry of  a final judgment\r\n\ndetermining the fair value of her shares.3\r\n\n          On December  23,  1992, without  -- so  far as  the\r\n\nrecord shows -- any solicitation from either Bogosian or F&amp;M,\r\n\nWRC delivered two  checks to F&amp;M  made payable to  Bogosian.4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  F&amp;M  asserted  no  claim  to  these payments,  presumably\r\nbecause it had argued to the district court that the payments\r\nwere necessary  for Bogosian to meet  her day-to-day expenses\r\nand  demands of other  creditors.  WRC  appealed the district\r\ncourt's  order, and  we  affirmed.   Bogosian v.  Woloohojian\r                                                                         \r\nRealty Corp., 923 F.2d 898 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                        \r\n\n4.  The voluntary payment  followed on  the heels  of a  jury\r\nverdict in  Bogosian's favor  in a Massachusetts  state court\r\nlawsuit  initiated by  WRC, in  which  WRC sought  damages in\r\nexcess of  $20 million  for Bogosian's alleged  usurpation of\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nThe checks, one for $900,000 and the other for $100,000, were\r\n\naccompanied by a letter stating the following:\r\n\n               Enclosed   please   find   two   (2)\r\n          Woloohojian  Realty Corp.

Bogosian\r\n\nrefused,  and  that  same  day faxed  to  F&amp;M  the  following\r\n\nhandwritten letter:\r\n\n          Please be  advised that  I do not  accept\r\n          nor  do I authorize  the acceptance  of a\r\n          check  from  Woloohojian Realty  Corp. or\r\n          any affiliates as partial payment  of any\r\n          kind for any purpose.\r\n\n          I  have  been advised,  as your  firm has\r\n          represented to Judge Boyle, by Eustace T.\r\n          Pliakas, Esq., my primary counsel, that a\r\n          355  division  of  the corporation  would\r\n          have no adverse  tax consequences for  me\r                                                               \r\n          or WRC and that  if his Honor Judge Boyle\r                            \r\n          so  decides as to effect that result that\r\n          it would be very favorable to me.\r\n\n          As you know, WRC has purported that there\r\n          will  be major  tax consequences  for the\r\n          liquidation of  property in order  to pay\r\n          for  my  shares  which  sale  Judge Boyle\r\n          stated in the  last hearing would  \"never\r\n          happen.\"\r\n\n          If by  some means,  at the time  of Judge\r\n          Boyle's  final decision,  I am  forced to\r\n          take  dollars   instead  of  mortgageable\r\n          property,  I question whether or not such\r\n          principal of tax effecting does not apply\r\n          to me. [sic]\r\n\n          In any event I do not wish to prematurely\r\n          determine   Judge   Boyle   [sic]   final\r\n          [unreadable]  decision.    I   will  only\r\n          accept, as  I have requested  you pursue,\r\n          similar interim relief as I have received\r\n          in  the  past   to  meet   my  on   going\r\n          obligations.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  F&amp;M  explained  that  it contacted  Pliakas  rather  than\r\nBogosian  directly  because  it  recognized  that  it  had  a\r\nconflict of interest with Bogosian regarding the checks.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          I  will  not  in  my  present  health  or\r\n          circumstances accept any coercive tactics\r\n          or any actions taken which is directed to\r\n          creating fear of retribution to myself or\r\n          any members of my family.\r\n\nWRC   eventually  dropped   its  requirement   that  Bogosian\r\n\nacknowledge in  writing receipt  of the checks  (and possible\r\n\nacknowledgment  that the  checks were  payments of  principal\r\n\nrather than interest), but  Bogosian still refused to indorse\r\n\nthem.   F&amp;M  and Pliakas  discussed over  the next  couple of\r\n\nweeks whether  the parties  could share  the  money,6 but  no\r\n\nagreement  was  reached.   Thus,  on  January  14, 1993,  F&amp;M\r\n\ninitiated the present action  in the district court, alleging\r\n\nthat  Bogosian  had  breached  the  assignment  agreement  by\r\n\nrefusing  to indorse the checks over to F&amp;M.  Bogosian denied\r\n\nthe breach, arguing that the  checks were not \"proceeds\" from\r\n\nthe  litigation  because  neither   the  court  nor  she  had\r\n\nauthorized such payment,  and counterclaimed, alleging  legal\r\n\nmalpractice  and  breach  of  contract  by  F&amp;M.    Following\r\n\ndiscovery,  both parties  moved  for summary  judgment.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  ruled  that  F&amp;M  was  entitled  to  summary\r\n\njudgment on all claims, and Bogosian appealed.    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Bogosian claims that she neither knew  of nor approved of\r\nthese negotiations,  but that  Pliakas undertook them  on his\r\nown  because he  feared  that F&amp;M's  abandonment of  Bogosian\r\ncould severely harm her position in the ongoing litigations.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\nA.

Having  so assigned the proceeds, Bogosian  had\r\n\nno power to reject  them.  She was  obligated to indorse  the\r\n\nchecks and pay them over to F&amp;M.\"   Flanders &amp; Medeiros, Inc.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Bogosian, 868 F. Supp.  412, 421 (D.R.I.  1994).  Whether\r                        \r\n\nBogosian  had a good faith basis for refusing the checks, the\r\n\ncourt held, is \"irrelevant.\"  Id.\r                                             \r\n\n          The  district  court's  analysis contains  a  fatal\r\n\nflaw:    It  assumes  that,  because  Bogosian  assigned  her\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ninterest in future  litigation proceeds up  to the amount  of\r\n\nany  outstanding legal bills, she  also gave up  her right to\r\n\nreject  any  offer  of  partial  payment.    But  the  latter\r\n\nproposition does  not necessarily  follow from the  former; a\r\n\nlitigant may (and often  does) assign expected proceeds while\r\n\nretaining  the right to accept or reject any offer of payment\r\n\nor settlement.  None of the cases cited by the district court\r                                \r\n\nin support of its construction of the assignment agreement --\r\n\nand subsequently adopted by F&amp;M as authority for its position\r\n\nin  its appellate brief -- stands for the proposition that an\r\n\nassignment   of  expected  litigation   proceeds  deprives  a\r\n\nlitigant  of his  or  her  right  to  control  the  terms  of\r\n\nsettlement.    For  example,  the court  cited  Berkowitz  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHaigood,  606 A.2d 1157, 1160 (N.J. Super. Ct.

But the funds the assignee was claiming in Berkowitz\r                                                                         \r\n\nwere part of  a settlement  to which Haigood  had agreed  and\r                                                                    \r\n\nwhich  had  already  been  paid  into  his  attorney's  trust\r\n\naccount.

In  neither  of  these  cases  did  the  assignee\r\n\nchallenge  the assignor-litigant's  rejection of an  offer of\r\n\nsettlement or partial payment.\r\n\n          Nothing  in the  assignment  agreement purports  to\r\n\ntransfer  Bogosian's fundamental  right  to  control her  own\r\n\nlitigation and  accept or reject a  settlement offer, whether\r\n\nin whole or in part.  See R.I.  Rules of Professional Conduct\r                                     \r\n\nRule 1.2(a) (\"A  lawyer shall  abide by  a client's  decision\r\n\nwhether  to accept  an offer  of  settlement of  a matter.\").\r\n\nWhether a  contract that abrogated this  axiomatic duty would\r\n\neven be upheld under Rhode  Island law is a question  we need\r\n\nnot  reach,   for  the  assignment  contains   no  indication\r\n\nwhatsoever  that  the  parties  intended   such  a  contract.\r\n\nWithout  a   clear  expression   of  intent  to   abrogate  a\r\n\nfundamental  rule  of  the  attorney-client  relationship, we\r\n\nwould be loath to find such intent.  Thus, the assignment  of\r\n\n\"recoveries\"  or \"proceeds\"  by  Bogosian  to  her  attorneys\r\n\npresumes  her  prior  acceptance   of  a  proffered  payment.\r                                \r\n\nOtherwise, the  proffered payment  remains nothing  more than\r\n\njust  that; until  it  has been  accepted  by the  client  or\r\n\nordered by  the court, it constitutes  neither \"proceeds\" nor\r\n\n\"recoveries\"  but  only  an   offer  of  payment  or  partial\r\n\nsettlement.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          Nor   does  F&amp;M  seriously  dispute  that  Bogosian\r\n\nretained  the right to accept or reject any settlement offer.\r\n\nIn  fact,  F&amp;M concedes  in  its  brief that  the  assignment\r\n\nagreement operated  as a  security  agreement, with  Bogosian\r\n\nretaining control over  her cause  of action, and  not as  an\r\n\nabsolute assignment of litigation rights:\r\n\n          The agreement did  not assign  Bogosian's\r\n          causes  of action  to F&amp;M (F&amp;M  could not\r\n          have sued WRC on those causes of action),\r\n          but only assigned the first proceeds from\r\n          the  litigation; it did  not give  F&amp;M an\r\n          interest  in  the  litigation beyond  the\r\n          amount  of its  earned  fees  and  costs.\r\n          Moreover,   the    assignment   was   not\r\n          absolute: it would have  been ineffective\r\n          if Bogosian had simply paid her bills.7\r\n\nBrief  of  Plaintiff-Appellee  at  20.8    These  concessions\r                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.

Although   the  language  of  the\r\nagreements in  some of  these cases more  clearly established\r\nthat  they were  intended to  operate as  security agreements\r\nthan  the assignment  agreement  here, both  the November  24\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nnotwithstanding, F&amp;M argues that  Bogosian still had no right\r\n\nto reject WRC's  $1 million voluntary payment because  it was\r\n\nnot an offer  of settlement.  At least after  WRC dropped the\r\n\nrequirement that  Bogosian stipulate that the  money would be\r\n\napplied  to  principal  and  not interest,  F&amp;M  argues,  WRC\r\n\nimposed no conditions on  Bogosian's acceptance of the money.\r\n\nTherefore, so this argument goes, Bogosian could not have had\r\n\nany valid reason for rejecting the checks.\r\n\n          This  argument  also  misses  the  mark,   for  the\r\n\nproffered payment did in  fact contain an implicit condition:\r\n\nnamely, that  the $1  million portion of  Bogosian's ultimate\r\n\naward represented by the two checks would be paid in cash and\r\n\nnot property.   Bogosian, in accepting  the checks, would  be\r\n\nforgoing  her right to attempt in the future to structure the\r\n\npayment  of that  portion  of her  award  in an  advantageous\r\n\nmanner.  Thus, while WRC's offer of payment may not have been\r\n\na  partial  \"settlement  offer\"   in  the  usual  sense,  its\r\n\nacceptance nevertheless could  have limited Bogosian's future\r\n\noptions, and she  may well  have had  legitimate reasons  for\r\n\nrefusal.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nletter  and   the   assignment  document   limit   Bogosian's\r\nassignment of proceeds  to the extent  that Bogosian has  not\r\npaid F&amp;M's  bills.   Thus, F&amp;M  would have  no rights to  any\r\nproceeds unless and only to the extent that Bogosian fails to\r\npay her attorney's bills.  This is an assignment for purposes\r\nof security.  See In  re Apex Oil, 975 F.2d at 1369  (\"We see\r                                             \r\nno meaningful  difference between a security  interest and an\r\nassignment for purposes of security.\").\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          Moreover, there is evidence that the possibility of\r\n\nBogosian  ultimately receiving property  rather than  cash in\r\n\nexchange  for  her  shares  is no  pipedream.    The  statute\r\n\ngoverning  the valuation  litigation provides that,  once the\r\n\nvalue of  Bogosian's shares have been  determined, \"the court\r\n\nshall set forth in its order . . . the purchase price and the\r\n\ntime within which the  payment shall be made, and  may decree\r                                                                         \r\n\nsuch other terms and  conditions of sale as it  determines to\r                                                                         \r\n\nbe  appropriate . .  . .\"  R.I.

It may be that  the\r                                                               \r\n          court  will  order  satisfaction  of  the\r                                                               \r\n          purchase   price   by  the   transfer  of\r                                                               \r\n          particular  parcels  of  real estate,  at\r                                                          \r\n          least  in part, a result contended for by\r\n          Plaintiff.      What   is  clear   beyond\r\n          peradventure is that it is for this Court\r\n          to  determine, under the precise terms of\r\n          the statute, the \"terms and conditions of\r\n          sale   as  it   determines  appropriate.\"\r\n          Until  this Court has had the opportunity\r\n          to do  so,  Plaintiff  does  not  have  a\r\n          definable   interest   in  any   specific\r\n          property.    There  is  no  judgment  for\r\n          Plaintiff which may be levied upon.\r\n\nBogosian v. Woloohojian,  C.A. No. 88-0373B, slip. op. at 7-8\r                                   \r\n\n(D.R.I. Aug. 4, 1995) (emphasis added).\r\n\n          Nevertheless, F&amp;M  argues that, even  assuming that\r\n\nBogosian eventually could receive property instead of cash as\r                                     \r\n\npayment for her shares,  she could not have had  a good-faith\r\n\nreason  for  rejecting  the  checks because:  (1)  she  would\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\neventually  have to  pay  the law  firm  in cash,  so even  a\r\n\ndisposition  of property  by the  court would  necessitate an\r\n\neventual sale of  assets, and (2) any payments made  to F &amp; M\r\n\nwould be tax-deductible, so a cash payment from WRC would not\r\n\nhave  any  adverse  tax   consequences.    This  argument  is\r\n\nsimilarly unpersuasive: Bogosian  could conceivably  mortgage\r\n\nany  property she receives and  pay F&amp;M from  those funds, or\r\n\nperhaps F&amp;M would even acquire  an interest in the  property.\r\n\nAnd even if a  cash payout would be tax-deductible,  Bogosian\r\n\nmight prefer  a disposition of  property for  non-tax-related\r\n\nreasons,  e.g., because  she believes  the property  is worth\r\n\nmore  than  its  court-assigned  valuation,  or  because  she\r\n\nbelieves its  appreciation rate  and income stream  will more\r\n\nthan compensate  for interest costs she  incurs in mortgaging\r\n\nit to  pay off F&amp;M.   In any event, Bogosian  asserted in her\r\n\nfaxed response to F&amp;M, on the same day that F&amp;M requested her\r                                                  \r\n\nindorsement of  the checks, that she did not want to do so in\r\n\npart  to avoid  foreclosing the  possibility of  the district\r\n\ncourt awarding her \"mortgageable property\" instead of cash.\r\n\n          If  Bogosian did not  in fact reject  the checks in\r\n\ngood faith,9 but rather simply because she wanted the cash in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  F&amp;M  is correct, of course, in stating that good faith is\r\nnot a defense to a breach-of-contract claim.  See Restatement\r                                                                         \r\n(Second) of Contracts   11, introductory note (1979).   We do\r                                 \r\nnot  hold that a  good-faith belief that she  did not have to\r\nassign the checks to F&amp;M would absolve Bogosian of liability;\r\nrather,  we hold that if Bogosian rejected the checks in good\r                                                      \r\nfaith  -- i.e., for some legitimate reason not connected to a\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nher hands rather  than in  F&amp;M's coffers, then  she may  well\r\n\nhave  breached the  covenant of  good  faith implicit  in all\r\n\ncontracts under Rhode Island  law.

A  rational jury  might also  conclude, of  course, that\r\nBogosian only had an  aversion to receiving cash when  it was\r\ngoing  into F&amp;M's pocket,  as counsel for F&amp;M  put it at oral\r\nargument.  The fact  that Pliakas tried to negotiate  a share\r\nof the $1  million for Bogosian,  and Bogosian's argument  to\r\nthe  district court that F&amp;M should not have asserted a claim\r\nto  the money when  it knew that  she needed the  cash to pay\r\nother creditors, support this view.  Divining Bogosian's true\r\nintent requires an assessment of  her credibility, a task for\r\nthe factfinder, not the court.\r\n          We have also considered, and found meritless, F&amp;M's\r\nassertion that  comments by Bogosian's attorney  in a related\r\ninterpleader  action estops  her  from arguing  now that  the\r\nproffered $1 million were  not \"proceeds.\"  In the  course of\r\narguing  against  the  interpleading  of  WRC's  $1  million,\r\nBogosian's  attorney  told  the  court that  the  funds  were\r\n\"proceeds\" of the valuation  litigation and their disposition\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Although  we  remand  for  trial on  the  issue  of\r\n\nliability,  we leave intact that part of the district court's\r\n\nsummary judgment ruling establishing the amount Bogosian owed\r\n\nF&amp;M  as  of  the  date  of  alleged  breach,  plus  interest.\r\n\nBogosian argues that this  would be inappropriate because F&amp;M\r\n\nnever  specifically  asked  for  \"partial  summary  judgment\"\r\n\npursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 56(d).   We  know  of no  such\r\n\nrequirement; Rule 56(d) states that a court,  \"[i]f on motion\r                                                                         \r\n\nunder this rule (Rule  56) judgment is not rendered  upon the\r                                                                         \r\n\nwhole case[,] . . . shall if practicable\" specify those facts\r                                                    \r\n\nthat  are without  substantial controversy.   F&amp;M's pleadings\r\n\nand  affidavits made  clear that  it was  asserting that  the\r\n\nlegal fees  and expenses  detailed in its  billing statements\r\n\nwere  fair  and  reasonable  in  light  of  the  services  it\r\n\nperformed  for  Bogosian.    Bogosian   never  contested  the\r\n\naccuracy or truthfulness  of any of those statements, nor did\r\n\nshe adduce any expert testimony that the  requested fees were\r\n\nexcessive.   Bogosian offered her  own opinion that  the fees\r\n\ncharged  for   certain  portions   of  the  litigation   were\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nshould  be determined in that  action.  We  do not understand\r\nhis  comments to amount to an assertion of rights by Bogosian\r\nto  the money,  and we  therefore hold  that Bogosian  is not\r\nestopped  from  arguing  that  the  funds  were  not in  fact\r\n\"proceeds\" or \"recoveries.\"\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nexcessive,11 but her  generalized assertions  are not  enough\r\n\nto create a \"substantial controversy\" about the amount she is\r\n\nobligated to pay  under her contract with  F&amp;M, assuming that\r\n\nshe is found  to have breached  that contract.

Supp.  at 417  n.4  (D.R.I. 1994).13   The\r                    \r\n\ndistrict  court granted  F&amp;M summary  judgment on  each claim\r\n\nbecause Bogosian had failed  to adduce competent evidence, in\r\n\nthe form of  expert testimony,  on the standard  of care  and\r\n\nscope of  duty to  which F&amp;M should  be held, or  on damages.\r\n\nId.   Bogosian  now  argues  that the  district  court  erred\r               \r\n\nbecause (1)  merely identifying  an expert witness  who would\r                                           \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The   district   court's    characterization   of    the\r\nallegations, with which we largely agree, was as follows:\r\n\n          (a)  F&amp;M's  failure to  obtain sufficient\r\n          interim relief in the WRC litigation; (b)\r\n          F&amp;M's   failure  to   properly  supervise\r\n          expert  witness  Eric  Berenson   in  the\r\n          appraisal  proceeding before  the Special\r\n          Master;  (c) F&amp;M's  failure to  insist on\r\n          certified  income and  expense statements\r\n          from WRC in the valuation proceeding; (d)\r\n          F&amp;M's  failure to  object to  the Special\r\n          Master's  report on  the basis  of, inter\r\n          alia,   the    appropriateness   of   the\r\n          comparables  relied  upon by  the Special\r\n          Master to  arrive at the value of certain\r\n          real  estate,  his  valuation   of  WRC's\r\n          management business based upon two years'\r\n          management  contracts,  and the  issue of\r\n          whether there  was a waterway  on another\r\n          site;   (e)   F&amp;M's  withdrawal   of  its\r\n          representation  of  Bogosian  in the  WRC\r\n          litigation, and its failure to bring suit\r\n          to   enjoin   Bogosian's   brother   from\r\n          entering  into  unauthorized   management\r\n          contracts; (f) F&amp;M's numerous failures to\r\n          take  action  in  relation  to   the  two\r\n          receiverships; and (g)  F&amp;M's failure  to\r\n          take  action  to have  Bogosian's brother\r\n          declared incapacitated  and terminated as\r\n          a   general  partner  of  the  Section  8\r\n          limited partnerships.\r\n\n886 F. Supp. at 417 n.4.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ntestify  in support  of her  claims was  enough to  survive a\r\n\nsummary  judgment motion,14  and  (2) certain  of her  claims\r\n\ndid not require expert testimony.\r\n\n          Bogosian's first  argument is  plainly  wrong.   We\r\n\nstated  in Focus Inv. Assocs. v. American Title Ins. Co., 992\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1231, 1239 (1st Cir. 1993), that under Rhode Island law,\r\n\n\"a legal malpractice plaintiff  must present expert testimony\r\n\nestablishing  the  appropriate standard  of  care  unless the\r\n\nattorney's  lack of  care and  skill is  so obvious  that the\r\n\ntrier of  fact can resolve  the issue as  a matter of  common\r\n\nknowledge.\"  We further explained that claims that \"fall into\r\n\nthe  'common   knowledge'  category   are  those  where   the\r\n\nnegligence is  'clear and palpable,' or where  no analysis of\r\n\nlegal  expertise  is  involved.\"    Id.    Virtually  all  of\r                                                   \r\n\nBogosian's claims require  analysis of  legal expertise,  and\r\n\ntherefore the  mere identification  of an expert  expected to\r                                              \r\n\ntestify  at trial would in no way demonstrate the standard of\r\n\ncare applicable to F&amp;M, an essential element of her case.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  Bogosian   filed  a   supplemental  response   to  F&amp;M's\r\ninterrogatories  identifying an  expert  witness prepared  to\r\ntestify on  her  behalf on  February  15, 1994,  almost  five\r\nmonths after  the September 24, 1993,  discovery closure date\r\nand only  a week  before the  summary  judgment motions  were\r\nargued before  a magistrate-judge.  The supplemental response\r\ncontained  no  indication  of  the  nature or  basis  of  the\r\nexpert's  expected testimony other than to  say that he would\r\ntestify    \"in   support   of\"    Bogosian's   defenses   and\r\ncounterclaims.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\n          Summary  judgment is  \"mandate[d] .  . .  against a\r\n\nparty who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the\r\n\nexistence of an  element essential to that  party's case, and\r\n\non which that party will bear the burden of proof  at trial.\"\r\n\nCelotex  Corp. v.  Catrett, 477  U.S. 317,  322 (1986).   The\r                                      \r\n\nmoving  party  discharges  his   or  her  initial  burden  of\r\n\n\"showing\"  the  absence of  a  genuine  issue concerning  any\r\n\nmaterial  fact by pointing  out to  the district  court \"that\r\n\nthere is  an absence  of evidence  to  support the  nonmoving\r\n\nparty's  case.\"  Id. at  325.  F&amp;M  discharged this burden by\r                                \r\n\npointing in its summary judgment motion to Bogosian's absence\r\n\nof  expert  testimony  in  support  of  her  counterclaims.15\r\n\nTherefore, summary judgment was appropriate as to all of  her\r\n\nclaims that required the analysis of legal expertise.16\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Bogosian argues that F&amp;M  only complained of her failure\r\nto  identify an  expert witness,  and thus  she was  under no\r                        \r\nobligation  to do  any  more than  that.   F&amp;M's  motion  for\r\nsummary judgment, however, clearly states that Bogosian \"must\r\npresent  expert  testimony\"  and  that  she  \"has  no  expert\r\ntestimony to support this claim.\"  Stating that Bogosian  had\r\nnot  yet  even  identified an  expert  witness  was  simply a\r\nstronger way  of stating that she had  no hope of bearing her\r\nburden of proof at trial.\r\n\n16.  Bogosian also argues that  the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion  in denying her request,  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 56(f), for more time to produce expert witness affidavits.\r\nShe  bases this argument  on the notion  that the requirement\r\nthat she adduce expert  testimony to survive summary judgment\r\nwas  a \"new rule\" dreamed  up by the  magistrate-judge at the\r\nsummary  judgment hearing,  and that  its application  to her\r\ncase constitutes an  abuse of discretion.   This argument  is\r\nlegal  poppycock;  the  requirement of  expert  testimony  in\r\nproving most types  of malpractice claims has been  so widely\r\nadopted  that \"it may even be malpractice to litigate a legal\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          Bogosian  also argues  that not  all of  her claims\r\n\nwere of  the  type  that  required  expert  testimony.    For\r\n\nexample, she argues that the district court failed to realize\r\n\nthat  her allegation that F&amp;M breached its duty of loyalty to\r\n\nBogosian  when it  placed its  own interest  in getting  paid\r\n\nahead of Bogosian's possible interest in receiving a property\r\n\ndistribution rather than cash, adequately limned a breach-of-\r\n\nfiduciary  duty  claim.    Similarly,  she  argues  that  her\r\n\nallegation  that  F&amp;M  withdrew  from  ongoing litigation  in\r\n\nviolation of their contract states a breach-of-contract claim\r\n\n(assuming  that  the contract  contains  an  implied term  to\r\n\ncontinue   representation  until   the   conclusion  of   the\r\n\nlitigation) that  is completely  distinct from F&amp;M's  duty to\r\n\nperform to the  appropriate standard of care.   These claims,\r\n\nBogosian  argues,   as  well  as  a   smattering  of  similar\r\n\nallegations contained in her counterclaim, require  no expert\r\n\ntestimony because they do not  require the analysis of  legal\r\n\nexpertise.\r\n\n          We  need not  answer the  question  Bogosian poses,\r\n\nbecause even  assuming arguendo that Bogosian  has adequately\r                                           \r\n\nstated claims that  do not require expert  testimony, she has\r                                      \r\n\nfailed to  introduce adequate evidence of  damages to support\r\n\nany  of her  claims.

In  her  Counterclaim, Bogosian\r\n\nraised the  specter of having  to hire additional  lawyers to\r\n\nduplicate work  already performed by  her abandoning lawyers,\r\n\nyet  she never provides further  evidence of such  costs.  In\r\n\nanswering  F&amp;M's  interrogatories  regarding the  nature  and\r\n\nscope  of  her  damages,  Bogosian  repeatedly  answered  (or\r\n\nincorporated by reference) that  \"[a]n expert will assess the\r\n\nvalue of  damages sustained from Flanders  &amp; Medeiros' breach\r\n\nupon obtaining  further discovery.\"   Such an  assessment was\r\n\nnever  forthcoming.  As for F&amp;M's placing its own interest in\r\n\ngetting   paid  ahead  of  Bogosian's  possible  interest  in\r\n\nobtaining a property distribution for the  full amount of her\r\n\nstock's  value, the $1 million was never received by F&amp;M, and\r\n\nthe  record  contains no  evidence  that  the possibility  of\r\n\nBogosian receiving a  distribution entirely  in property  has\r\n\nbeen diminished  at all.17   Thus,  Bogosian had  not adduced\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  The   checks  eventually   expired;  WRC   initiated  an\r\ninterpleader action  in the  district court to  determine the\r\nrights of  various creditors  of Bogosian, including  F&amp;M, to\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\ncompetent evidence sufficient  to prove an essential  element\r\n\nof her claim, namely,  that these alleged breaches by  F&amp;M --\r\n\nwhether or not proof thereof would require expert testimony -\r\n\n- have in fact damaged her.

After Bogosian failed to endorse over\r\n\nto F&amp;M checks made payable to Bogosian by the defendant in\r\n\nthe underlying litigation and delivered to F&amp;M as her\r\n\ncounsel, F&amp;M sued Bogosian for breach of contract.  Bogosian\r\n\ncounterclaimed for malpractice and breach of the attorney-\r\n\nclient contract.  The district court awarded summary judgment\r\n\nto F&amp;M on all claims.  We now reverse the award of summary\r\n\njudgment on F&amp;M's breach-of-contract claim, and affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's ruling on Bogosian's counterclaims.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n          In  November  1989,  following  the  withdrawal  of\r\n\nBogosian's prior counsel from the underlying litigation, F&amp;M,\r\n\na  Providence,   Rhode  Island,  law  firm,   took  over  the\r\n\nrepresentation  of Bogosian,  a  citizen of  Florida, in  the\r\n\nongoing lawsuits  stemming from  her involvement in  a family\r\n\nreal estate empire created by her and her two brothers, James\r\n\nH.   Woloohojian  and   Harry  Woloohojian   (now  deceased).\r\n\nBogosian had few liquid assets at  the time from which to pay\r\n\nher lawyers  but stood  to receive  substantial amounts  as a\r\n\nresult of  her lawsuits.   In  a letter sent  to Bogosian  on\r\n\nNovember  24,  1989 (the  \"November  24  letter\"), and  which\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nBogosian then signed indicating her  agreement, F&amp;M explained\r\n\nthe terms of  its representation.   The firm  would obtain  a\r\n\n$25,000  retainer  from  Bogosian,  to  be  deposited  in  an\r\n\ninterest-bearing account; it would   bill Bogosian each month\r\n\nat  its lawyers' hourly rates, with each bill due and payable\r\n\nwithin ten days after receipt; and interest would  accrue (at\r\n\na local  bank's prime  rate) on  bills outstanding for  sixty\r\n\ndays or more.

The  \"E &amp;  J  receivership\" and  the \"Woloohojian  Realty\r\nAssociates receivership\" are  state court actions  concerning\r\ntwo  family real  estate  partnerships.   The \"federal  court\r\nlitigation\"  (or  \"valuation\"  litigation)  was   brought  by\r\nBogosian in the United States District Court for the District\r\nof  Rhode Island  to  dissolve the  family-owned  Woloohojian\r\nRealty   Corporation  (\"WRC\"),   pursuant  to   Rhode  Island\r\ncorporations  law.   See R.I.  Gen. Laws    7-1.1-90.   After\r                                    \r\nBogosian filed her lawsuit,  WRC exercised its option to  buy\r\nout Bogosian's one-third share of the corporation rather than\r\nface dissolution.  In April 1995,  the district court adopted\r\nas its  findings  the  report  of a  special  master  valuing\r\nBogosian's  WRC  stock  at   $4,901,801.

In July  1990, the district  court in\r\n\nthat case ordered  WRC (1)  to grant Bogosian  a $10  million\r\n\nmortgage  on one of WRC's properties as security to guarantee\r\n\neventual payment  of her  shares' value  once that  value had\r\n\nbeen determined,  and (2)  to provide Bogosian  with \"interim\r\n\ndistribution\" payments  of an  initial $100,000  plus $10,000\r\n\nper  month, to continue until  the entry of  a final judgment\r\n\ndetermining the fair value of her shares.3\r\n\n          On December  23,  1992, without  -- so  far as  the\r\n\nrecord shows -- any solicitation from either Bogosian or F&amp;M,\r\n\nWRC delivered two  checks to F&amp;M  made payable to  Bogosian.4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

Bogosian\r\n\nrefused,  and  that  same  day faxed  to  F&amp;M  the  following\r\n\nhandwritten letter:\r\n\n          Please be  advised that  I do not  accept\r\n          nor  do I authorize  the acceptance  of a\r\n          check  from  Woloohojian Realty  Corp. or\r\n          any affiliates as partial payment  of any\r\n          kind for any purpose.\r\n\n          I  have  been advised,  as your  firm has\r\n          represented to Judge Boyle, by Eustace T.\r\n          Pliakas, Esq., my primary counsel, that a\r\n          355  division  of  the corporation  would\r\n          have no adverse  tax consequences for  me\r                                                               \r\n          or WRC and that  if his Honor Judge Boyle\r                            \r\n          so  decides as to effect that result that\r\n          it would be very favorable to me.\r\n\n          As you know, WRC has purported that there\r\n          will  be major  tax consequences  for the\r\n          liquidation of  property in order  to pay\r\n          for  my  shares  which  sale  Judge Boyle\r\n          stated in the  last hearing would  \"never\r\n          happen.\"\r\n\n          If by  some means,  at the time  of Judge\r\n          Boyle's  final decision,  I am  forced to\r\n          take  dollars   instead  of  mortgageable\r\n          property,  I question whether or not such\r\n          principal of tax effecting does not apply\r\n          to me. [sic]\r\n\n          In any event I do not wish to prematurely\r\n          determine   Judge   Boyle   [sic]   final\r\n          [unreadable]  decision.    I   will  only\r\n          accept, as  I have requested  you pursue,\r\n          similar interim relief as I have received\r\n          in  the  past   to  meet   my  on   going\r\n          obligations.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  F&amp;M  explained  that  it contacted  Pliakas  rather  than\r\nBogosian  directly  because  it  recognized  that  it  had  a\r\nconflict of interest with Bogosian regarding the checks.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          I  will  not  in  my  present  health  or\r\n          circumstances accept any coercive tactics\r\n          or any actions taken which is directed to\r\n          creating fear of retribution to myself or\r\n          any members of my family.\r\n\nWRC   eventually  dropped   its  requirement   that  Bogosian\r\n\nacknowledge in  writing receipt  of the checks  (and possible\r\n\nacknowledgment  that the  checks were  payments of  principal\r\n\nrather than interest), but  Bogosian still refused to indorse\r\n\nthem.   F&amp;M  and Pliakas  discussed over  the next  couple of\r\n\nweeks whether  the parties  could share  the  money,6 but  no\r\n\nagreement  was  reached.   Thus,  on  January  14, 1993,  F&amp;M\r\n\ninitiated the present action  in the district court, alleging\r\n\nthat  Bogosian  had  breached  the  assignment  agreement  by\r\n\nrefusing  to indorse the checks over to F&amp;M.  Bogosian denied\r\n\nthe breach, arguing that the  checks were not \"proceeds\" from\r\n\nthe  litigation  because  neither   the  court  nor  she  had\r\n\nauthorized such payment,  and counterclaimed, alleging  legal\r\n\nmalpractice  and  breach  of  contract  by  F&amp;M.    Following\r\n\ndiscovery,  both parties  moved  for summary  judgment.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  ruled  that  F&amp;M  was  entitled  to  summary\r\n\njudgment on all claims, and Bogosian appealed.    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Bogosian claims that she neither knew  of nor approved of\r\nthese negotiations,  but that  Pliakas undertook them  on his\r\nown  because he  feared  that F&amp;M's  abandonment of  Bogosian\r\ncould severely harm her position in the ongoing litigations.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\nA.

At least after  WRC dropped the\r\n\nrequirement that  Bogosian stipulate that the  money would be\r\n\napplied  to  principal  and  not interest,  F&amp;M  argues,  WRC\r\n\nimposed no conditions on  Bogosian's acceptance of the money.\r\n\nTherefore, so this argument goes, Bogosian could not have had\r\n\nany valid reason for rejecting the checks.\r\n\n          This  argument  also  misses  the  mark,   for  the\r\n\nproffered payment did in  fact contain an implicit condition:\r\n\nnamely, that  the $1  million portion of  Bogosian's ultimate\r\n\naward represented by the two checks would be paid in cash and\r\n\nnot property.   Bogosian, in accepting  the checks, would  be\r\n\nforgoing  her right to attempt in the future to structure the\r\n\npayment  of that  portion  of her  award  in an  advantageous\r\n\nmanner.  Thus, while WRC's offer of payment may not have been\r\n\na  partial  \"settlement  offer\"   in  the  usual  sense,  its\r\n\nacceptance nevertheless could  have limited Bogosian's future\r\n\noptions, and she  may well  have had  legitimate reasons  for\r\n\nrefusal.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nletter  and   the   assignment  document   limit   Bogosian's\r\nassignment of proceeds  to the extent  that Bogosian has  not\r\npaid F&amp;M's  bills.

There  is  no  judgment  for\r\n          Plaintiff which may be levied upon.\r\n\nBogosian v. Woloohojian,  C.A. No. 88-0373B, slip. op. at 7-8\r                                   \r\n\n(D.R.I. Aug. 4, 1995) (emphasis added).\r\n\n          Nevertheless, F&amp;M  argues that, even  assuming that\r\n\nBogosian eventually could receive property instead of cash as\r                                     \r\n\npayment for her shares,  she could not have had  a good-faith\r\n\nreason  for  rejecting  the  checks because:  (1)  she  would\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\neventually  have to  pay  the law  firm  in cash,  so even  a\r\n\ndisposition  of property  by the  court would  necessitate an\r\n\neventual sale of  assets, and (2) any payments made  to F &amp; M\r\n\nwould be tax-deductible, so a cash payment from WRC would not\r\n\nhave  any  adverse  tax   consequences.    This  argument  is\r\n\nsimilarly unpersuasive: Bogosian  could conceivably  mortgage\r\n\nany  property she receives and  pay F&amp;M from  those funds, or\r\n\nperhaps F&amp;M would even acquire  an interest in the  property.\r\n\nAnd even if a  cash payout would be tax-deductible,  Bogosian\r\n\nmight prefer  a disposition of  property for  non-tax-related\r\n\nreasons,  e.g., because  she believes  the property  is worth\r\n\nmore  than  its  court-assigned  valuation,  or  because  she\r\n\nbelieves its  appreciation rate  and income stream  will more\r\n\nthan compensate  for interest costs she  incurs in mortgaging\r\n\nit to  pay off F&amp;M.   In any event, Bogosian  asserted in her\r\n\nfaxed response to F&amp;M, on the same day that F&amp;M requested her\r                                                  \r\n\nindorsement of  the checks, that she did not want to do so in\r\n\npart  to avoid  foreclosing the  possibility of  the district\r\n\ncourt awarding her \"mortgageable property\" instead of cash.\r\n\n          If  Bogosian did not  in fact reject  the checks in\r\n\ngood faith,9 but rather simply because she wanted the cash in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  F&amp;M  is correct, of course, in stating that good faith is\r\nnot a defense to a breach-of-contract claim.  See Restatement\r                                                                         \r\n(Second) of Contracts   11, introductory note (1979).   We do\r                                 \r\nnot  hold that a  good-faith belief that she  did not have to\r\nassign the checks to F&amp;M would absolve Bogosian of liability;\r\nrather,  we hold that if Bogosian rejected the checks in good\r                                                      \r\nfaith  -- i.e., for some legitimate reason not connected to a\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nher hands rather  than in  F&amp;M's coffers, then  she may  well\r\n\nhave  breached the  covenant of  good  faith implicit  in all\r\n\ncontracts under Rhode Island  law.

A  rational jury  might also  conclude, of  course, that\r\nBogosian only had an  aversion to receiving cash when  it was\r\ngoing  into F&amp;M's pocket,  as counsel for F&amp;M  put it at oral\r\nargument.  The fact  that Pliakas tried to negotiate  a share\r\nof the $1  million for Bogosian,  and Bogosian's argument  to\r\nthe  district court that F&amp;M should not have asserted a claim\r\nto  the money when  it knew that  she needed the  cash to pay\r\nother creditors, support this view.  Divining Bogosian's true\r\nintent requires an assessment of  her credibility, a task for\r\nthe factfinder, not the court.\r\n          We have also considered, and found meritless, F&amp;M's\r\nassertion that  comments by Bogosian's attorney  in a related\r\ninterpleader  action estops  her  from arguing  now that  the\r\nproffered $1 million were  not \"proceeds.\"  In the  course of\r\narguing  against  the  interpleading  of  WRC's  $1  million,\r\nBogosian's  attorney  told  the  court that  the  funds  were\r\n\"proceeds\" of the valuation  litigation and their disposition\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Although  we  remand  for  trial on  the  issue  of\r\n\nliability,  we leave intact that part of the district court's\r\n\nsummary judgment ruling establishing the amount Bogosian owed\r\n\nF&amp;M  as  of  the  date  of  alleged  breach,  plus  interest.\r\n\nBogosian argues that this  would be inappropriate because F&amp;M\r\n\nnever  specifically  asked  for  \"partial  summary  judgment\"\r\n\npursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 56(d).   We  know  of no  such\r\n\nrequirement; Rule 56(d) states that a court,  \"[i]f on motion\r                                                                         \r\n\nunder this rule (Rule  56) judgment is not rendered  upon the\r                                                                         \r\n\nwhole case[,] . . . shall if practicable\" specify those facts\r                                                    \r\n\nthat  are without  substantial controversy.   F&amp;M's pleadings\r\n\nand  affidavits made  clear that  it was  asserting that  the\r\n\nlegal fees  and expenses  detailed in its  billing statements\r\n\nwere  fair  and  reasonable  in  light  of  the  services  it\r\n\nperformed  for  Bogosian.    Bogosian   never  contested  the\r\n\naccuracy or truthfulness  of any of those statements, nor did\r\n\nshe adduce any expert testimony that the  requested fees were\r\n\nexcessive.   Bogosian offered her  own opinion that  the fees\r\n\ncharged  for   certain  portions   of  the  litigation   were\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nshould  be determined in that  action.  We  do not understand\r\nhis  comments to amount to an assertion of rights by Bogosian\r\nto  the money,  and we  therefore hold  that Bogosian  is not\r\nestopped  from  arguing  that  the  funds  were  not in  fact\r\n\"proceeds\" or \"recoveries.\"\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nexcessive,11 but her  generalized assertions  are not  enough\r\n\nto create a \"substantial controversy\" about the amount she is\r\n\nobligated to pay  under her contract with  F&amp;M, assuming that\r\n\nshe is found  to have breached  that contract.

Bogosian argues that F&amp;M  only complained of her failure\r\nto  identify an  expert witness,  and thus  she was  under no\r                        \r\nobligation  to do  any  more than  that.   F&amp;M's  motion  for\r\nsummary judgment, however, clearly states that Bogosian \"must\r\npresent  expert  testimony\"  and  that  she  \"has  no  expert\r\ntestimony to support this claim.\"  Stating that Bogosian  had\r\nnot  yet  even  identified an  expert  witness  was  simply a\r\nstronger way  of stating that she had  no hope of bearing her\r\nburden of proof at trial.\r\n\n16.  Bogosian also argues that  the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion  in denying her request,  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 56(f), for more time to produce expert witness affidavits.\r\nShe  bases this argument  on the notion  that the requirement\r\nthat she adduce expert  testimony to survive summary judgment\r\nwas  a \"new rule\" dreamed  up by the  magistrate-judge at the\r\nsummary  judgment hearing,  and that  its application  to her\r\ncase constitutes an  abuse of discretion.   This argument  is\r\nlegal  poppycock;  the  requirement of  expert  testimony  in\r\nproving most types  of malpractice claims has been  so widely\r\nadopted  that \"it may even be malpractice to litigate a legal\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          Bogosian  also argues  that not  all of  her claims\r\n\nwere of  the  type  that  required  expert  testimony.    For\r\n\nexample, she argues that the district court failed to realize\r\n\nthat  her allegation that F&amp;M breached its duty of loyalty to\r\n\nBogosian  when it  placed its  own interest  in getting  paid\r\n\nahead of Bogosian's possible interest in receiving a property\r\n\ndistribution rather than cash, adequately limned a breach-of-\r\n\nfiduciary  duty  claim.    Similarly,  she  argues  that  her\r\n\nallegation  that  F&amp;M  withdrew  from  ongoing litigation  in\r\n\nviolation of their contract states a breach-of-contract claim\r\n\n(assuming  that  the contract  contains  an  implied term  to\r\n\ncontinue   representation  until   the   conclusion  of   the\r\n\nlitigation) that  is completely  distinct from F&amp;M's  duty to\r\n\nperform to the  appropriate standard of care.   These claims,\r\n\nBogosian  argues,   as  well  as  a   smattering  of  similar\r\n\nallegations contained in her counterclaim, require  no expert\r\n\ntestimony because they do not  require the analysis of  legal\r\n\nexpertise.\r\n\n          We  need not  answer the  question  Bogosian poses,\r\n\nbecause even  assuming arguendo that Bogosian  has adequately\r                                           \r\n\nstated claims that  do not require expert  testimony, she has\r                                      \r\n\nfailed to  introduce adequate evidence of  damages to support\r\n\nany  of her  claims.

In\r\n\nanswering  F&amp;M's  interrogatories  regarding the  nature  and\r\n\nscope  of  her  damages,  Bogosian  repeatedly  answered  (or\r\n\nincorporated by reference) that  \"[a]n expert will assess the\r\n\nvalue of  damages sustained from Flanders  &amp; Medeiros' breach\r\n\nupon obtaining  further discovery.\"   Such an  assessment was\r\n\nnever  forthcoming.  As for F&amp;M's placing its own interest in\r\n\ngetting   paid  ahead  of  Bogosian's  possible  interest  in\r\n\nobtaining a property distribution for the  full amount of her\r\n\nstock's  value, the $1 million was never received by F&amp;M, and\r\n\nthe  record  contains no  evidence  that  the possibility  of\r\n\nBogosian receiving a  distribution entirely  in property  has\r\n\nbeen diminished  at all.17   Thus,  Bogosian had  not adduced\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.
