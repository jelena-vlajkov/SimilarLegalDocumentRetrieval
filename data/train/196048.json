Papps, First\r                                                                       \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   Although  appellant  raises  a number  of\r                            \n\nissues in  his brief,  we have jurisdiction  solely over  his\n\nappeal  from a district court order denying his request to be\n\ncertified  as a witness for  payment of fees  pursuant to the\n\nprovisions of 28  U.S.C.   1821.   We affirm for  the reasons\n\nstated  by the district court  in its order  dated August 29,\n\n1994, adding the following comments.  \n\n     Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.     1821,  as  amended  by  the\n\nIncarcerated Witness Fees Act,  a witness who is incarcerated\n\nat  the time he testifies  may not receive  witness fees.  28\n\nU.S.C.   1821(f) (1992).  The legislative history behind this\n\namendment, which became effective October 14, 1992, indicates\n\nthat its purpose is to avoid payment of witness fees to those\n\nwho,  by virtue  of their  incarceration, already  have their\n\nexpenses paid  by the taxpayer.  See  H.R. Rep. No. 194, 102d\r                                                \n\nCong.,  2d Sess.  2  (1991), reprinted  in 1992  U.S.C.C.A.N.\r                                                      \n\n1465, 1466.  Since its purpose is not punitive, the amendment\n\ndoes   not  violate   the  Ex   Post  Facto  Clause   of  the\n\nConstitution.  Cf.  Peeler v. Heckler,  781 F.2d 649,  651-52\r                                                 \n\n(8th  Cir.  1986)  (suspending social  security  benefits  of\n\nincarcerated   felons  furthers   a  nonpunitive   goal  and,\n\ntherefore,  does  not  violate  the Ex  Post  Facto  Clause).\n\nAppellant's  equal protection challenge  to the  amendment is\n\nwaived because  it was not raised in his opening brief.  See,\r                                                                        \n\ne.g.,  Sandstrom v. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\r\n\n1990).  We  add, however, that  this challenge fails  because\n\n\"[i]t is  hardly irrational  to deny fees  and allowances  to\n\nprisoner witnesses.\"   Moran v.  United States, 18  F.3d 412,\r                                                          \n\n413 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n     We also note that contrary to appellant's suggestion, he\n\nwould not have received witness fees for testimony he gave in\n\n1992 prior to the effective date of the amendment, even if he\n\nhad  applied for them  immediately.  Within  months after the\n\nSupreme  Court,  in  Demarest  v. Manspeaker,  498  U.S.  184\r                                                        \n\n(1991),  held  that    1821  did  not  except prisoners  from\n\nentitlement  to witness fees,  Congress passed appropriations\n\nlegislation   which   provided   in   pertinent   part   that\n\n\"[n]otwithstanding 18  U.S.C. 1821, no funds  appropriated to\n\nthe  Department of Justice in  fiscal year 1991  or any prior\n\nfiscal  year shall  be obligated  or expended  to pay  a fact\n\nwitness fee to a  person who is incarcerated testifying  as a\n\nfact  witness in  a  court  of  the  United  States.\"    Dire\n\nEmergency  Supplemental  Appropriations  for Consequences  of\n\nOperation    Desert/Storm,    Food    Stamps,    Unemployment\n\nCompensation   Administration,   Veterans  Compensation   and\n\nPensions, and Other  Urgent Needs  Act of 1991,  Pub.
