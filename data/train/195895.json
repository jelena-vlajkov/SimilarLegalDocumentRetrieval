Claimant Zinnia Schroeder-Rodriguez appeals\r                           \n\na  district  court order  that  affirmed  a  decision of  the\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services that denied Schroeder-\n\nRodriguez's  claim for  social security  disability benefits.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Claimant is presently  30 years old.  She graduated from\n\nhigh  school, completed additional  secretarial training, and\n\nwas employed as an office worker at various companies between\n\n1982  and  1991.   On December  29,  1991, claimant  filed an\n\ninitial  application  for  social  security  benefits.    She\n\nalleged that she became  disabled on September 11, 1991  as a\n\nresult  of injuries to her  neck, back, hands,  and legs that\n\nshe  sustained  in  a   motor  vehicle  accident.    Claimant\n\nmaintained that  she had eight  pinched nerves  and could  no\n\nlonger  type or run computers  as a result  of this accident.\n\nShe also asserted that her left leg was particularly affected\n\nand that she could not move as she used to.1  \n\n     After  claimant's  initial application  was  denied, she\n\nfiled a  request for  reconsideration which alleged  that she\n\nwas disabled due to an emotional condition in addition to her\n\nphysical ailments.   The request was  denied.  Claimant  then\n\nappeared with  counsel at a hearing  before an administrative\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Claimant  reported  that  she   could  not  drive  or  do\nhousechores,  although she  occasionally washed  dishes. (Tr.\n65).\r\r\n\nlaw  judge  (ALJ).   She testified  that  she could  not work\n\nbecause she  had no strength in  her hands and  that she also\n\nsuffered  nightmares as a result  of the accident.   She also\n\nmaintained that she experienced  constant body pain and could\n\nnot  stand, sit,  or walk  for more  than 10-15 minutes  at a\n\ntime.     Claimant  further   testified  that   she  required\n\nassistance to bathe, comb  her hair, and care for  her 5-year\n\nold daughter.2\n\n     The ALJ denied claimant's  disability claim at step five\n\nof the sequential evaluation process.  He found that claimant\n\nhad a combination of impairments, including cervical, dorsal,\n\nand lumbar  painful syndromes  and multiple nerve  entrapment\n\nneuropathies,  but   that  she  did  not   have  a  medically\n\ndeterminable  mental  impairment  or  any  significant mental\n\nlimitations.   He also found that her allegations of pain and\n\nother  symptoms were  not  fully supported  by the  objective\n\nmedical  evidence and  that  her subjective  complaints  thus\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Shortly before the hearing,  claimant submitted a list of\nmedications that had been prescribed for her.  These included\nValrelease  (an  anti-anxiety  and anti-muscle  spasm  drug),\nAnaprox,  Indocin,  Flexeril,  and  Feldene  (medications for\nmuscle relaxation,  inflammation, and  arthritis).   When the\nALJ asked claimant whether her medications relieved her pain,\nclaimant indicated  that she  preferred to remain  lying down\nand not  taking her  medications because they  caused adverse\nside effects.  (Tr. 29).  However, the ALJ correctly observed\nthat the  medical evidence indicated that  claimant had never\ncomplained  of  any  adverse  side effects  to  her  treating\nphysicians.    We  further   note  that  claimant's  list  of\nmedications indicated  that she  was not taking  them because\nshe was pregnant.  (Tr. 195).  \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ndeserved  \"very little  credibility.\" (Tr.  16-17).   The ALJ\n\nfound that  claimant  had the  residual  functional  capacity\n\n(RFC) to  perform the physical  exertional and  nonexertional\n\nrequirements of  sedentary to light work, but  that she could\n\nnot do frequent or  continuous hand-finger activities such as\n\ntyping.   While  the  ALJ concluded  that claimant  could not\n\nperform her past work because it required frequent typing, he\n\nalso found that her RFC was not  significantly compromised by\n\nher  nonexertional  limitations.     (Tr.  19).    Given  the\n\nclaimant's physical RFC for  sedentary to light work, younger\n\nage,  education  (beyond high  school),  and work  experience\n\n(skilled),  the  ALJ concluded  that  Grid  Rules 201.28  and\n\n201.29  directed a \"not disabled\"  finding.  (Tr.  17, 19).3 \n\nThe  district court  summarily  affirmed  the ALJ's  decision\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.  405(g).  This appeal followed.  \n\n                             II.\n\n     Before we  address the claimant's  arguments, we  review\n\nthe relevant  medical evidence.  Shortly  after the accident,\n\nclaimant  secured   medical  treatment  at  the  Puerto  Rico\n\nCompensation  Administration  Due  to   Automobile  Accidents\n\n(ACAA).    The  record   discloses  that  claimant  sustained\n\nwhiplash-like  injuries after her car was hit by a Mack truck\n\nwhile she was en route  to work on September 11, 1991.   (Tr.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  These rules  apply to workers with  transferable and non-\ntransferable skills  whose RFCs are limited  to the sedentary\nrange of work. \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n26,  175).  X-rays taken  a week after  the accident revealed\n\ncervical  muscle spasm.   (Tr.  153).   She was  treated with\n\nRobaxin, a skeletal muscle relaxant.   On September 18, 1991,\n\nclaimant  was examined  by  Dr. Wildo  Vargas, a  physiatrist\n\naffiliated  with  the  ACAA.4   She  complained  of  constant\n\nheadaches and pain in her neck, back, and left hip.  Physical\n\nexam  disclosed  severe   tenderness  of  the   paracervical,\n\ntrapezius,  thoracic, and lumbosacral  paraspinal muscles and\n\nthe muscles of both arms.   Her range of motion was  limited.\n\nDr.  Vargas prescribed  physical  therapy consisting  of  hot\n\npacks,  TENS  (transcutaneous  electric  nerve  stimulation),\n\nultrasound, therapeutic massage, and bed rest.  (Tr. 151).  \n\n     Over the next two  months claimant responded very little\n\nto conservative treatment.  She  continued to complain to Dr.\n\nVargas  of  pain  in her  neck,  back,  arms,  and left  hip.\n\nPhysical  examination  continued to  disclose  tenderness and\n\nspasm  in her upper body and extremities, as well as positive\n\nTinel's  sign  at both  elbows.5    Approximately five  weeks\n\nafter  the accident,  claimant complained  that her  neck and\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Unless otherwise noted, the information which  follows is\ncontained  in Dr. Vargas's 12/3/91  report and the reports of\nthe tests that he ordered.  (Tr. 150-56, 158-60).\n\n5.  Tinel's sign  is \"a tingling sensation in  the distal end\nof a limb when percussion is  made over the site of a divided\nnerve.    It indicates  a  partial  lesion or  the  beginning\nregeneration  of the nerve.\"   Dorland's  Illustrated Medical\r                                                                         \nDictionary,  (28th  ed.  1994),   p.  1527.    It  frequently\r                      \naccompanies carpal  tunnel syndrome.   See The  Mosby Medical\r                                                                         \nEncyclopedia, (1985 ed.) p. 730.\r                        \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nback  pain had  worsened,  particularly with  activity.   Dr.\n\nVargas    discontinued    physical   therapy    and   ordered\n\nelectromyogram (EMG)  and nerve conduction  velocity studies.\n\nStudies performed on November  4, 1991 revealed that claimant\n\nsuffered  from  carpal  tunnel   syndrome  and  ulnar   nerve\n\nentrapment at Guyon's canal in both upper extremities.  There\n\nwas also right ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow, bilateral\n\nS-1 root irritation, and right tarsal tunnel  syndrome.6  Dr.\n\nVargas observed that the entrapped nerves in claimant's upper\n\nextremities accounted for  the neck  pain that  she had  been\n\nexperiencing and  that her bilateral S-1  root irritation was\n\nthe  apparent cause  of  her  back  pain.  (Tr.  155).7    He\n\nreferred  claimant to  a  hand surgeon  for consideration  of\n\nsurgical decompression  of the entrapped nerves  in her upper\n\nextremities.  (Tr.  154).   While Dr. Vargas  did not  assess\n\nclaimant's  RFC,  he indicated  that  all  of her  conditions\n\nresulted  in  a 13%  impairment of  the  whole person.   (Tr.\n\n156).8   \n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  However, the EMG showed no evidence of lower motor neuron\ndisease.  (Tr. 160). \n\n7.  A  CT scan of claimant's lumbar spine was normal, with no\nevidence of disc herniation. (Tr. 158).  \n\n8.  Although Dr. Vargas referred  claimant to a hand surgeon,\nthere are no records from a hand surgeon before us.  However,\nclaimant's initial disability report  indicated that she  had\nseen Dr. Julio  Simons for  possible surgery  to relieve  her\ncarpal  tunnel  syndrome.    (Tr.  51).    According  to  the\nclaimant,  Dr.  Simons  recommended  that  claimant initially\nreceive  cortisone shots because she still had 75% use of her\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n     On 3/12/92,  claimant was examined by  Dr. Enid Berrios,\n\nanother physiatrist affiliated with the ACAA.  (Tr. 141). Dr.\n\nBerrios  found claimant's muscle strength  was 3 out  of 5 on\n\nthe  left upper  extremity and  that she  exhibited decreased\n\nsensation over the  C-6 and C-7 nerve  distribution.  Tinel's\n\nsign was positive on the left, unreported  on the right.  Her\n\nneck had a  functional range of motion.  Mild dextroscoliosis\n\nwas apparent in the dorsal and levolumbar regions.\n\n     On  3/27/92,  claimant was  examined  on  behalf of  the\n\nSocial Security Administration (SSA)  by Dr. Oscar Benitez, a\n\nneurologist.   He  found  that claimant's  mental status  was\n\nalert, well oriented  and cooperative, and that  she was able\n\nto give  a good  history  by herself.   Physical  examination\n\ndisclosed  no  atrophy,  weakness,  or  deficit  to  pinprick\n\nsensation in the upper and lower extremities.   While Tinel's\n\nsign was positive in  both wrists and elbows, no  cervical or\n\nlumbar  spasm  was  detected.9     Dr.  Benitez  completed  a\n\ndetailed  range of  motion chart  which showed  that claimant\n\nsuffered  from  no limitations  except  a 10  degree  loss of\n\nflexion-extension  in  the  lumbar  spine.   (Tr.    187-89).\n\n                    \r                                \n\nhands. If  claimant worsened  despite the shots,  surgery was\nrecommended.   (Tr. 51-2,  79).  But  claimant indicated that\nshe did not wish to undergo cortisone shots, stating, \"I have\nenough  traumas in  life  to have  shots  with possible  side\neffects.\"  (Tr. 79). \n\n9.  X-rays  taken for Dr. Benitez on  3/27/92 showed that the\ncervical  spine had  normal  vertebral alignment  and minimal\ndextroscoliosis of the lumbosacral spine.  (Tr. 186). \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nRelying on Dr. Vargas's EMG and nerve conduction studies, Dr.\n\nBenitez concluded that claimant suffered from cervical dorsal\n\nand  lumbar painful  syndrome  and multiple  nerve entrapment\n\nneuropathies.    While  he  found no  objective  evidence  of\n\nneurological  deficit, his  prognosis  was  reserved.    (Tr.\n\n185).10   \n\n     On May 5, 1992, claimant underwent further EMG and nerve\n\nconduction  studies at the request of Dr. Berrios.  While Dr.\n\nBerrios's  reports  are   largely  illegible,  those  studies\n\nrevealed that claimant suffered from early right median nerve\n\nentrapment and right C8T1 root irritability.  (Tr. 129).  Dr.\n\nBerrios recommended  that claimant continue  physical therapy\n\nand prescribed 12 visits.  (Tr. 134-36). Also    on   5/5/92,\n\nclaimant  underwent  a  psychiatric  examination  through the\n\nACAA.    In a  2-page  form report  that  was very  brief and\n\ncryptic,  Dr.  Manual Colon  indicated  that  claimant had  a\n\nmoderate anxiety neurosis with depression that was related to\n\nher accident.  He also checked off boxes which suggested that\n\nthis   condition  partially  limited  claimant's  ability  to\n\nperform her usual work, but that she was  able to perform the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n10.  On  April 23,  1992, Dr.  A.M. Marxuach,  a nonexamining\ninternist, completed a form assessment of claimant's physical\nRFC.  Dr. Marxuach concluded that claimant could occasionally\nlift  or  carry 50  pounds and  frequently  lift or  carry 25\npounds (findings consistent with  medium work under 20 C.F.R.\n 404.1567(c)), that she could  stand, walk, or sit up  to six\nhours in an  8-hour day, and  that she had no  limitations in\nher  abilities to push, pull, reach, handle, finger, or feel.\n(Tr. 112). \n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nsame type  of work.   (Tr. 138).   Dr.  Colon indicated  that\n\nclaimant   merited   psychiatric  treatment   and  prescribed\n\nTofranil and Buspar, anti-depression and anxiety medications.\n\nHe also recommended that  claimant return for reevaluation on\n\n6/3/92.   (Tr. 140).   However, there  are no records  of any\n\nsuch follow-up or further psychiatric treatment.\n\n     On  5/29/92, Dr.  Vargas  discharged  claimant from  the\n\nACAA.  He indicated that claimant's neck continued to be very\n\ntender  with severe spasm and that her arms were also tender.\n\nHe concluded that no  more physical therapy would be  of help\n\nand  noted that claimant had been offered surgery but refused\n\nit.   (Tr. 143, 128).   On 7/23/92, claimant  returned to Dr.\n\nBerrios, who prescribed  medications and additional  physical\n\ntherapy.  (Tr. 120-23).  A 7/24/92 x-ray revealed reversal of\n\nthe  cervical lordosis  indicative of  cervical spasm.   (Tr.\n\n119).  On 8/26/92, Dr. Vargas issued a final medical report. \n\nHe relied on the most recent EMG and nerve conduction studies\n\nof  Dr. Berrios  in  concluding that  claimant suffered  from\n\ncervical fibromyositis, cervical  radiculopathy, ulnar  nerve\n\nentrapment at  the elbows, carpal tunnel  syndrome and lumbar\n\nradiculopathy.   Dr. Vargas indicated that  claimant had over\n\n40 physical  therapy treatments which were of  some help when\n\nshe  received  them but  that  her  pain returned  after  the\n\ntreatments.  (Tr. 193).    He recommended  that she  continue\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nphysical therapy because her neck pain  persisted.  (Tr. 117-\n\n18).11  \n\n                             III.\n\n     On appeal,  claimant argues that the ALJ  failed to base\n\nhis  decision on  substantial  evidence on  the  record as  a\n\nwhole.   She particularly faults the ALJ for finding that she\n\nhas no  medically determinable  mental impairment.   Claimant\n\ncontends that  this finding  is not supported  by substantial\n\nevidence  because  it: (a)  was based  on  the report  of Dr.\n\nBenitez, a  consulting neurologist  who was not  qualified to\n\nrender an opinion on psychiatric matters, and (b) disregarded\n\nthe psychiatric report of Dr.  Manual Colon - which indicated\n\nthat claimant  suffered from  an anxiety neurosis.   Claimant\n\nsays   that  the   ALJ  further   violated  the   Secretary's\n\nregulations  by  failing  to  complete a  Psychiatric  Review\n\nTechnique Form (PRTF).  Finally, claimant argues that the ALJ\n\nfailed  to  give  appropriate  weight to  her  complaints  of\n\ndisabling pain.\n\n     The  ALJ  did not  mention  Dr. Colon's  report  when he\n\nconcluded that claimant did not have a medically determinable\n\nmental impairment.  But,  contrary to the claimant's argument\n\non appeal, the ALJ did not base this conclusion on the report\n\n                    \r                                \n\n11.  Dr. Vargas  had previously indicated that claimant could\nreturn to work on 6/1/92.  (Tr. 144, 146).  While he modified\nhis  diagnosis in  response  to Dr.  Berrios's EMG  and nerve\nconduction studies, he did  not comment further on claimant's\ncapacity for work.\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nof  Dr.  Benitez  alone.12    Rather,   the  ALJ  based  this\n\nconclusion  on the  results  of Dr.  Benitez's mental  status\n\nexam, his own  observations of claimant at  the hearing, and,\n\nperhaps  most importantly, the absence of evidence indicating\n\nthat   claimant   suffered   from   any   significant  mental\r                                                   \n\nlimitations.   (Tr. 16).   This last finding  is significant,\n\nfor even Dr. Colon's report does not contradict it.\n\n     Dr.  Colon's  report consisted  of  an  ACAA form  which\n\ncontained little  more  that his  conclusory  diagnosis  that\n\nclaimant  suffered  from an  anxiety  neurosis.   He  did not\n\nidentify   any   objective   findings   that   supported  his\n\nconclusion, nor did he relate how claimant's anxiety impaired\n\nher ability to work.  Indeed, even Dr. Colon did not conclude\n\nthat  claimant's anxiety left her unable to work.  His report\n\nsuggests  that claimant's  anxiety  resulted, at  most, in  a\n\npartial  limitation  but  that  she ultimately  was  able  to\n\nperform the same type of work.

We  note  that  neurologists  generally  perform  mental\nstatus  evaluations  as  part  of the  standard  neurological\nexamination.   See, e.g.,  The Merck Manual,  (Robert Berkow,\r                                                       \nM.D.,  ed.,  16th  ed.  1992), p.  1382,  McQuade,  Analyzing\r                                                                         \nMedical Records,   4-3, p.  90 (1987).   We therefore  reject\r                           \nclaimant's  contention that  the ALJ  could not  rely on  Dr.\nBenitez's mental status findings  because Dr. Benitez was not\na  psychiatrist.   While we agree  that Dr.  Benitez's report\nalone  was not  substantial evidence  that claimant  lacked a\nmental impairment, see  Boyce v. Sullivan, 754  F. Supp. 126,\r                                                     \n128  (N.D. Ill. 1990)(neurologist's  cursory mental  exam was\nnot substantial  evidence of mental condition),  we think the\nALJ could  rely on  Dr. Benitez's report  in evaluating  this\nissue.      \n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n     In  the  face of  this  cryptic  report which  contained\n\nlittle more than  check marks,  the ALJ was  not required  to\n\ncredit  Dr. Colon's diagnosis.   \"The ALJ need  not accept an\n\nopinion of a physician - even a treating physician - if it is\n\nconclusory and brief and  unsupported by clinical  findings.\"\n\nMatney v.

See 20\r                                                                      \n\nC.F.R.  404.1508;  Gray v.  Heckler, 760  F.2d 369,  375 (1st\r                                               \n\nCir. 1985).   She failed to meet this burden.   The fact that\n\nclaimant may have suffered nightmares following  the accident\n\ndoes not establish that she was not  able to work.  Moreover,\n\neven  if we assume that Dr. Colon's diagnosis was correct and\n\nthat the ALJ  erred in  finding that claimant  had no  mental\n\nimpairment, is well established that the mere existence of an\n\n                    \r                                \n\n13.  We note that  it is  not clear that  Dr. Colon  actually\ntreated claimant for  there are no  records of any  treatment\nfollowing her evaluation  on 5/5/92. Claimant's testimony  on\nthis  score was ambiguous: on one hand she indicated that she\nhad not seen a psychiatrist  in seven or eight months.   (Tr.\n27).   She   subsequently   indicated   that   she   received\nappointments  every month and a  half.  (Tr.  28).  But there\nare no records which support her latter assertion.    \n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nanxiety disorder does not constitute a disability. See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nSitar v. Schweiker, 671 F.2d 19, 20 (1st Cir. 1982); Alvarado\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Weinberger, 511  F.2d 1046,  1049 (1st  Cir. 1975).   The\r                          \n\nremaining notations in Dr. Colon's report establish that this\n\ncondition was  not severe.   Thus, even  if the ALJ  erred in\n\ndiscounting  Dr. Colon's  diagnosis, the  record proves  that\n\nthis error was harmless.14 \n\n     We are troubled, however, by another aspect of the ALJ's\n\ndecision.    The  ALJ concluded  that  the  claimant  was not\n\ndisabled because her RFC enabled her  to perform sedentary to\n\nlight  work.   Yet  he also  found  that claimant  could  not\n\nperform frequent or continuous hand-finger activities such as\n\ntyping.   \"'Most sedentary jobs require good use of the hands\n\n                    \r                                \n\n14.  We  also are  not persuaded  that a  remand is  required\nbecause  the ALJ  failed  to complete  a  PRTF.   The  record\ndiscloses that the  ALJ did  append a PRTF  to his  decision.\r                                       \n(Tr.  20).  However, the ALJ's form is an abbreviated version\nof the standard PRTF.  The ALJ's PRTF simply states that  the\nclaimant  does  not  have  a  medically  determinable  mental\nimpairment.    It  does  not  review  all the  categories  of\npotential mental impairments listed under 20 C.F.R. Part 404,\nSubpart P, App. 1,   12.00 (Mental Disorders), which are  set\nforth in  the standard PRTF.   While we think the  use of the\nstandard form is preferable,  we do not read  the regulations\nto  preclude the  use  of an  abbreviated  PRTF when  an  ALJ\ndetermines   that   there   is   no   medically  determinable\nimpairment.  20 C.F.R.  404.1520a(b)(2) provides that the SSA\nmust indicate  whether certain medical  findings relevant  to\nthe  ability  to work  are present  or  absent only  \"[i]f we\n[i.e., the  SSA] determine that a  mental impairment exists.\"\nIf there  is insufficient  evidence that a  mental impairment\nexists, there will be presumably be no medical findings which\nwould  allow the SSA  to complete the standard  PRTF.  In any\nevent, on  this record, we think that  any error that the ALJ\nmay  have made in failing  to complete the  standard PRTF was\nharmless.  \n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nand fingers.'\" Heggarty v. Sullivan,  947 F.2d 990, 996  (1st\r                                               \n\nCir.  1991)(quoting  SSR 83-14).    See  also  SSR 83-10  (CE\r                                                         \n\n1983)(same).   If  claimant  cannot perform  continuous hand-\n\nfinger  activities, she is not able to perform the full range\n\nof  sedentary   work.    Thus,  the   ALJ's  conclusion  that\n\nclaimant's  nonexertional  limitations did  not significantly\n\nreduce  claimant's RFC  is not  supportable.   His conclusion\n\nthat  claimant is not  disabled under  Grid Rules  201.28 and\n\n201.29, both of which posit an ability for  the full range of\n\nsedentary work, is similarly flawed.  \n\n     Ordinarily  we would be  required to remand  so that the\n\nALJ could  take vocational  evidence to meet  the Secretary's\n\nburden  of proof  at  step  five.    However,  the  ALJ  also\n\nconcluded that claimant was capable  of light work, a finding\n\nthat  was supported by the RFC assessment of Dr. Marxuach and\n\nDr. Benitez's findings following his  physical examination of\n\nthe  claimant.15  Light  work generally does  not require use\n\nof  the hands and fingers  for fine activities  to the extent\n\nrequired in much  sedentary work.  See SSR 83-10  at 179  (CE\r                                                  \n\n1983).   While  the  ALJ  did  not  expressly  refer  to  the\n\ncorresponding  grid  rules for  light  work  in his  decision\n\n(i.e., Rules 202.21  and 202.22), we  think his not  disabled\n\n                    \r                                \n\n15.  Contrary  to  the  claimant's arguments  on  appeal, the\nrecord does not contain uncontroverted evidence of disability\nfrom  claimant's  treating  physicians.   In  fact,  none  of\nclaimant's  physicians  ever  opined  that  she  was  totally\ndisabled.\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nfinding  is  supportable on  the  basis  that claimant  could\n\nperform light work.\n\n     Finally, we discern  no error in the  ALJ's treatment of\n\nclaimant's allegations of pain.   The ALJ properly questioned\n\nclaimant on the nature and frequency of her pain, the effects\n\nof   her  medication,   daily   activities,  and   functional\n\nrestrictions  in accordance with Avery v. Secretary of Health\r                                                                         \n\nand  Human Services, 797 F.2d 19 (1st  Cir. 1986) and SSR 88-\r                               \n\n13.   While there was clearly objective medical evidence that\n\nsupported  claimant's  complaints  of  pain,  the  ALJ  noted\n\ncertain  inconsistencies in the record, such as the fact that\n\nclaimant's testimony that her medications caused adverse side\n\neffects  was   not  corroborated   by  any  of   the  medical\n\nrecords.16     Such   inconsistencies  supported   the  ALJ's\n\nconclusion that claimant's complaints of  disabling pain were\n\nnot fully credible.   Frustaglia v.  Secretary of Health  and\r                                                                         \n\nHuman Services, 829 F.2d  192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).   We note\r                          \n\nfurther that claimant has not done all that she might have to\n\nremedy her condition.   Claimant testified that she preferred\n\nnot  to take her pain medications.  The record also discloses\n\nthat she  has been offered  cortisone therapy and  surgery to\n\nrelieve her carpal tunnel syndrome but that she has  declined\n\nboth alternatives.  \"Implicit in a finding of disability is a\n\n                    \r                                \n\n16.  While the  ALJ did not  explicitly refer  to the  record\nwhich indicated that claimant  was not taking her medications\nbecause she was pregnant, this is another inconsistency. \n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\ndetermination  that existing treatment alternatives would not\n\nrestore a claimant's ability  to work.\" Tsarelka v.

She graduated from high school, completed additional secretarial training, and was employed as an office worker at various companies between 1982 and 1991.  On December 29, 1991, claimant filed an initial application for social security benefits.  She alleged that she became disabled on September 11, 1991 as a result of injuries to her neck, back, hands, and legs that she sustained in a motor vehicle accident.  Claimant maintained that she had eight pinched nerves and could no longer type or run computers as a result of this accident.  She also asserted that her left leg was particularly affected and that she could not move as she used to.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After claimant's initial application was denied, she filed a request for reconsideration which alleged that she was disabled due to an emotional condition in addition to her physical ailments.  The request was denied.  Claimant then appeared with counsel at a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).  She testified that she could not work because she had no strength in her hands and that she also suffered nightmares as a result of the accident.  She also maintained that she experienced constant body pain and could not stand, sit, or walk for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.  Claimant further testified that she required assistance to bathe, comb her hair, and care for her 5-year old daughter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ denied claimant's disability claim at step five of the sequential evaluation process.  He found that claimant had a combination of impairments, including cervical, dorsal, and lumbar painful syndromes and multiple nerve entrapment neuropathies, but that she did not have a medically determinable mental impairment or any significant mental limitations.  He also found that her allegations of pain and other symptoms were not fully supported by the objective medical evidence and that her subjective complaints thus deserved \"very little credibility.\"  (Tr. 16-17).  The ALJ found that claimant had the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform the physical exertional and nonexertional requirements of sedentary to light work, but that she could not do frequent or continuous hand-finger activities such as typing.  While the ALJ concluded that claimant could not perform her past work because it required frequent typing, he also found that her RFC was not significantly compromised by her nonexertional limitations.  (Tr. 19).  Given the claimant's physical RFC for sedentary to light work, younger age, education (beyond high school), and work experience (skilled), the ALJ concluded that Grid Rules 201.28 and 201.29 directed a \"not disabled\" finding.  (Tr. 17, 19).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court summarily affirmed the ALJ's decision under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 405(g).

Shortly after the accident, claimant secured medical treatment at the Puerto Rico Compensation Administration Due to Automobile Accidents (ACAA).  The record discloses that claimant sustained whiplash-like injuries after her car was hit by a Mack truck while she was en route to work on September 11, 1991.  (Tr. 26, 175).  X-rays taken a week after the accident revealed cervical muscle spasm.  (Tr. 153).  She was treated with Robaxin, a skeletal muscle relaxant.  On September 18, 1991, claimant was examined by Dr. Wildo Vargas, a physiatrist affiliated with the ACAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  She complained of constant headaches and pain in her neck, back, and left hip.  Physical exam disclosed severe tenderness of the paracervical, trapezius, thoracic, and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the muscles of both arms.  Her range of motion was limited.  Dr. Vargas prescribed physical therapy consisting of hot packs, TENS (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation), ultrasound, therapeutic massage, and bed rest.  (Tr. 151).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next two months claimant responded very little to conservative treatment.  She continued to complain to Dr. Vargas of pain in her neck, back, arms, and left hip.  Physical examination continued to disclose tenderness and spasm in her upper body and extremities, as well as positive Tinel's sign at both elbows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Approximately five weeks after the accident, claimant complained that her neck and back pain had worsened, particularly with activity.  Dr. Vargas discontinued physical therapy and ordered electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity studies.  Studies performed on November 4, 1991 revealed that claimant suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve entrapment at Guyon's canal in both upper extremities.  There was also right ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow, bilateral S-1 root irritation, and right tarsal tunnel syndrome.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Dr. Vargas observed that the entrapped nerves in claimant's upper extremities accounted for the neck pain that she had been experiencing and that her bilateral S-1 root irritation was the apparent cause of her back pain.  (Tr. 155).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  He referred claimant to a hand surgeon for consideration of surgical decompression of the entrapped nerves in her upper extremities.  (Tr. 154).  While Dr. Vargas did not assess claimant's RFC, he indicated that all of her conditions resulted in a 13% impairment of the whole person.  (Tr. 156).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 3/12/92, claimant was examined by Dr. Enid Berrios, another physiatrist affiliated with the ACAA.  (Tr. 141).  Dr. Berrios found claimant's muscle strength was 3 out of 5 on the left upper extremity and that she exhibited decreased sensation over the C-6 and C-7 nerve distribution.  Tinel's sign was positive on the left, unreported on the right.  Her neck had a functional range of motion.  Mild dextroscoliosis was apparent in the dorsal and levolumbar regions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 3/27/92, claimant was examined on behalf of the Social Security Administration (SSA) by Dr. Oscar Benitez, a neurologist.  He found that claimant's mental status was alert, well oriented and cooperative, and that she was able to give a good history by herself.  Physical examination disclosed no atrophy, weakness, or deficit to pinprick sensation in the upper and lower extremities.  While Tinel's sign was positive in both wrists and elbows, no cervical or lumbar spasm was detected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Dr. Benitez completed a detailed range of motion chart which showed that claimant suffered from no limitations except a 10 degree loss of flexion-extension in the lumbar spine.  (Tr. 187-89).  Relying on Dr. Vargas's EMG and nerve conduction studies, Dr. Benitez concluded that claimant suffered from cervical dorsal and lumbar painful syndrome and multiple nerve entrapment neuropathies.  While he found no objective evidence of neurological deficit, his prognosis was reserved.  (Tr. 185).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 1992, claimant underwent further EMG and nerve conduction studies at the request of Dr. Berrios.  While Dr. Berrios's reports are largely illegible, those studies revealed that claimant suffered from early right median nerve entrapment and right C8T1 root irritability.  (Tr. 129).  Dr. Berrios recommended that claimant continue physical therapy and prescribed 12 visits.  (Tr. 134-36).  Also on 5/5/92, claimant underwent a psychiatric examination through the ACAA.  In a 2- page form report that was very brief and cryptic, Dr. Manual Colon indicated that claimant had a moderate anxiety neurosis with depression that was related to her accident.  He also checked off boxes which suggested that this condition partially limited claimant's ability to perform her usual work, but that she was able to perform the same type of work.  (Tr. 138).  Dr. Colon indicated that claimant merited psychiatric treatment and prescribed Tofranil and Buspar, anti-depression and anxiety medications.  He also recommended that claimant return for reevaluation on 6/3/92.  (Tr. 140).  However, there are no records of any such follow-up or further psychiatric treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 5/29/92, Dr. Vargas discharged claimant from the ACAA.  He indicated that claimant's neck continued to be very tender with severe spasm and that her arms were also tender.  He concluded that no more physical therapy would be of help and noted that claimant had been offered surgery but refused it.  (Tr. 143, 128).  On 7/23/92, claimant returned to Dr. Berrios, who prescribed medications and additional physical therapy.  (Tr. 120-23).  A 7/24/92 x-ray revealed reversal of the cervical lordosis indicative of cervical spasm.  (Tr. 119).  On 8/26/92, Dr. Vargas issued a final medical report.  He relied on the most recent EMG and nerve conduction studies of Dr. Berrios in concluding that claimant suffered from cervical fibromyositis, cervical radiculopathy, ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbows, carpal tunnel syndrome and lumbar radiculopathy.  Dr. Vargas indicated that claimant had over 40 physical therapy treatments which were of some help when she received them but that her pain returned after the treatments.  (Tr. 193).  He recommended that she continue physical therapy because her neck pain persisted.  (Tr. 117-18).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant argues that the ALJ failed to base his decision on substantial evidence on the record as a whole.  She particularly faults the ALJ for finding that she has no medically determinable mental impairment.  Claimant contends that this finding is not supported by substantial evidence because it:  (a) was based on the report of Dr. Benitez, a consulting neurologist who was not qualified to render an opinion on psychiatric matters, and (b) disregarded the psychiatric report of Dr. Manual Colon-which indicated that claimant suffered from an anxiety neurosis.  Claimant says that the ALJ further violated the Secretary's regulations by failing to complete a Psychiatric Review Technique Form (PRTF).  Finally, claimant argues that the ALJ failed to give appropriate weight to her complaints of disabling pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ did not mention Dr. Colon's report when he concluded that claimant did not have a medically determinable mental impairment.  But, contrary to the claimant's argument on appeal, the ALJ did not base this conclusion on the report of Dr. Benitez alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Rather, the ALJ based this conclusion on the results of Dr. Benitez's mental status exam, his own observations of claimant at the hearing, and, perhaps most importantly, the absence of evidence indicating that claimant suffered from any significant mental limitations.  (Tr. 16).  This last finding is significant, for even Dr. Colon's report does not contradict it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Colon's report consisted of an ACAA form which contained little more that his conclusory diagnosis that claimant suffered from an anxiety neurosis.  He did not identify any objective findings that supported his conclusion, nor did he relate how claimant's anxiety impaired her ability to work.  Indeed, even Dr. Colon did not conclude that claimant's anxiety left her unable to work.  His report suggests that claimant's anxiety resulted, at most, in a partial limitation but that she ultimately was able to perform the same type of work.  (Tr. 138).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of this cryptic report which contained little more than check marks, the ALJ was not required to credit Dr. Colon's diagnosis.  \"The ALJ need not accept an opinion of a physician-even a treating physician-if it is conclusory and brief and unsupported by clinical findings.\"  Matney v. Sullivan, 981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir. 1992).  See also Bernal v. Bowen, 851 F.2d 297, 301 (10th Cir. 1988).  Cf. Thompson v. Sullivan, 928 F.2d 255, 258 (8th Cir. 1991)(treating physician's conclusory statements on insurance form were not entitled to more weight than opinions of other doctors).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Claimant was responsible for providing specific medical evidence of her alleged mental impairment and its effect on her functional capacity for work.  See 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1508;  Gray v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369, 375 (1st Cir. 1985).  She failed to meet this burden.  The fact that claimant may have suffered nightmares following the accident does not establish that she was not able to work.  Moreover, even if we assume that Dr. Colon's diagnosis was correct and that the ALJ erred in finding that claimant had no mental impairment, is well established that the mere existence of an anxiety disorder does not constitute a disability.  See, e.g., Sitar v. Schweiker, 671 F.2d 19, 20 (1st Cir. 1982);  Alvarado v. Weinberger, 511 F.2d 1046, 1049 (1st Cir. 1975).  The remaining notations in Dr. Colon's report establish that this condition was not severe.  Thus, even if the ALJ erred in discounting Dr. Colon's diagnosis, the record proves that this error was harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are troubled, however, by another aspect of the ALJ's decision.  The ALJ concluded that the claimant was not disabled because her RFC enabled her to perform sedentary to light work.  Yet he also found that claimant could not perform frequent or continuous hand-finger activities such as typing.  \" 'Most sedentary jobs require good use of the hands and fingers.' \"  Heggarty v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 996 (1st Cir. 1991)(quoting SSR 83-14).  See also SSR 83-10 (CE 1983)(same).  If claimant cannot perform continuous hand-finger activities, she is not able to perform the full range of sedentary work.  Thus, the ALJ's conclusion that claimant's nonexertional limitations did not significantly reduce claimant's RFC is not supportable.  His conclusion that claimant is not disabled under Grid Rules 201.28 and 201.29, both of which posit an ability for the full range of sedentary work, is similarly flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily we would be required to remand so that the ALJ could take vocational evidence to meet the Secretary's burden of proof at step five.  However, the ALJ also concluded that claimant was capable of light work, a finding that was supported by the RFC assessment of Dr. Marxuach and Dr. Benitez's findings following his physical examination of the claimant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Light work generally does not require use of the hands and fingers for fine activities to the extent required in much sedentary work.  See SSR 83-10 at 179 (CE 1983).  While the ALJ did not expressly refer to the corresponding grid rules for light work in his decision (i.e., Rules 202.21 and 202.22), we think his not disabled finding is supportable on the basis that claimant could perform light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we discern no error in the ALJ's treatment of claimant's allegations of pain.  The ALJ properly questioned claimant on the nature and frequency of her pain, the effects of her medication, daily activities, and functional restrictions in accordance with Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986) and SSR 88-13.  While there was clearly objective medical evidence that supported claimant's complaints of pain, the ALJ noted certain inconsistencies in the record, such as the fact that claimant's testimony that her medications caused adverse side effects was not corroborated by any of the medical records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Such inconsistencies supported the ALJ's conclusion that claimant's complaints of disabling pain were not fully credible.  Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).  We note further that claimant has not done all that she might have to remedy her condition.  Claimant testified that she preferred not to take her pain medications.  The record also discloses that she has been offered cortisone therapy and surgery to relieve her carpal tunnel syndrome but that she has declined both alternatives.  \"Implicit in a finding of disability is a determination that existing treatment alternatives would not restore a claimant's ability to work.\"  Tsarelka v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 842 F.2d 529, 534 (1st Cir. 1988).  Claimant made no showing that the various medications and other treatments that had been offered to relieve her carpal tunnel syndrome would not restore her ability to work.  Nor did she offer a \"good reason\" for failing to take advantage of the various remedies that have been offered to her.  Tsarelka, id., (\"If a claimant does not follow prescribed treatment 'without a good reason,' he or she will not be found to be disabled.\")  (quoting 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1530).  In view of the foregoing, we find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Claimant reported that she could not drive or do housechores, although she occasionally washed dishes.

When the ALJ asked claimant whether her medications relieved her pain, claimant indicated that she preferred to remain lying down and not taking her medications because they caused adverse side effects.  (Tr. 29).  However, the ALJ correctly observed that the medical evidence indicated that claimant had never complained of any adverse side effects to her treating physicians.  We further note that claimant's list of medications indicated that she was not taking them because she was pregnant.

If claimant worsened despite the shots, surgery was recommended.  (Tr. 51-2, 79).

Sec. 404.1567(c)), that she could stand, walk, or sit up to six hours in an 8-hour day, and that she had no limitations in her abilities to push, pull, reach, handle, finger, or feel.

See, e.g., The Merck Manual, (Robert Berkow, M.D., ed., 16th ed. 1992), p. 1382, McQuade, Analyzing Medical Records, Sec. 4-3, p. 90 (1987).  We therefore reject claimant's contention that the ALJ could not rely on Dr. Benitez's mental status findings because Dr. Benitez was not a psychiatrist.  While we agree that Dr. Benitez's report alone was not substantial evidence that claimant lacked a mental impairment, see Boyce v. Sullivan, 754 F. Supp. 126, 128 (N.D. Ill. 1990)(neurologist's cursory mental exam was not substantial evidence of mental condition), we think the ALJ could rely on Dr. Benitez's report in evaluating this issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> We note that it is not clear that Dr. Colon actually treated claimant for there are no records of any treatment following her evaluation on 5/5/92.  Claimant's testimony on this score was ambiguous:  on one hand she indicated that she had not seen a psychiatrist in seven or eight months.  (Tr. 27).  She subsequently indicated that she received appointments every month and a half.  (Tr. 28).  But there are no records which support her latter assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> We also are not persuaded that a remand is required because the ALJ failed to complete a PRTF. The record discloses that the ALJ did append a PRTF to his decision.  (Tr. 20).  However, the ALJ's form is an abbreviated version of the standard PRTF. The ALJ's PRTF simply states that the claimant does not have a medically determinable mental impairment.  It does not review all the categories of potential mental impairments listed under 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App. 1, Sec. 12.00 (Mental Disorders), which are set forth in the standard PRTF. While we think the use of the standard form is preferable, we do not read the regulations to preclude the use of an abbreviated PRTF when an ALJ determines that there is no medically determinable impairment.  20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520a(b)(2) provides that the SSA must indicate whether certain medical findings relevant to the ability to work are present or absent only \"[i]f we [i.e., the SSA] determine that a mental impairment exists.\"  If there is insufficient evidence that a mental impairment exists, there will be presumably be no medical findings which would allow the SSA to complete the standard PRTF. In any event, on this record, we think that any error that the ALJ may have made in failing to complete the standard PRTF was harmless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the claimant's arguments on appeal, the record does not contain uncontroverted evidence of disability from claimant's treating physicians.

She graduated from high school, completed additional secretarial training, and was employed as an office worker at various companies between 1982 and 1991.  On December 29, 1991, claimant filed an initial application for social security benefits.  She alleged that she became disabled on September 11, 1991 as a result of injuries to her neck, back, hands, and legs that she sustained in a motor vehicle accident.  Claimant maintained that she had eight pinched nerves and could no longer type or run computers as a result of this accident.  She also asserted that her left leg was particularly affected and that she could not move as she used to.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After claimant's initial application was denied, she filed a request for reconsideration which alleged that she was disabled due to an emotional condition in addition to her physical ailments.  The request was denied.  Claimant then appeared with counsel at a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).  She testified that she could not work because she had no strength in her hands and that she also suffered nightmares as a result of the accident.  She also maintained that she experienced constant body pain and could not stand, sit, or walk for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.  Claimant further testified that she required assistance to bathe, comb her hair, and care for her 5-year old daughter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ denied claimant's disability claim at step five of the sequential evaluation process.  He found that claimant had a combination of impairments, including cervical, dorsal, and lumbar painful syndromes and multiple nerve entrapment neuropathies, but that she did not have a medically determinable mental impairment or any significant mental limitations.  He also found that her allegations of pain and other symptoms were not fully supported by the objective medical evidence and that her subjective complaints thus deserved \"very little credibility.\"  (Tr. 16-17).  The ALJ found that claimant had the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform the physical exertional and nonexertional requirements of sedentary to light work, but that she could not do frequent or continuous hand-finger activities such as typing.  While the ALJ concluded that claimant could not perform her past work because it required frequent typing, he also found that her RFC was not significantly compromised by her nonexertional limitations.  (Tr. 19).  Given the claimant's physical RFC for sedentary to light work, younger age, education (beyond high school), and work experience (skilled), the ALJ concluded that Grid Rules 201.28 and 201.29 directed a \"not disabled\" finding.  (Tr. 17, 19).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court summarily affirmed the ALJ's decision under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 405(g).

Shortly after the accident, claimant secured medical treatment at the Puerto Rico Compensation Administration Due to Automobile Accidents (ACAA).  The record discloses that claimant sustained whiplash-like injuries after her car was hit by a Mack truck while she was en route to work on September 11, 1991.  (Tr. 26, 175).  X-rays taken a week after the accident revealed cervical muscle spasm.  (Tr. 153).  She was treated with Robaxin, a skeletal muscle relaxant.  On September 18, 1991, claimant was examined by Dr. Wildo Vargas, a physiatrist affiliated with the ACAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  She complained of constant headaches and pain in her neck, back, and left hip.  Physical exam disclosed severe tenderness of the paracervical, trapezius, thoracic, and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the muscles of both arms.  Her range of motion was limited.  Dr. Vargas prescribed physical therapy consisting of hot packs, TENS (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation), ultrasound, therapeutic massage, and bed rest.  (Tr. 151).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next two months claimant responded very little to conservative treatment.  She continued to complain to Dr. Vargas of pain in her neck, back, arms, and left hip.  Physical examination continued to disclose tenderness and spasm in her upper body and extremities, as well as positive Tinel's sign at both elbows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Approximately five weeks after the accident, claimant complained that her neck and back pain had worsened, particularly with activity.  Dr. Vargas discontinued physical therapy and ordered electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity studies.  Studies performed on November 4, 1991 revealed that claimant suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve entrapment at Guyon's canal in both upper extremities.  There was also right ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow, bilateral S-1 root irritation, and right tarsal tunnel syndrome.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Dr. Vargas observed that the entrapped nerves in claimant's upper extremities accounted for the neck pain that she had been experiencing and that her bilateral S-1 root irritation was the apparent cause of her back pain.  (Tr. 155).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  He referred claimant to a hand surgeon for consideration of surgical decompression of the entrapped nerves in her upper extremities.  (Tr. 154).  While Dr. Vargas did not assess claimant's RFC, he indicated that all of her conditions resulted in a 13% impairment of the whole person.  (Tr. 156).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 3/12/92, claimant was examined by Dr. Enid Berrios, another physiatrist affiliated with the ACAA.  (Tr. 141).  Dr. Berrios found claimant's muscle strength was 3 out of 5 on the left upper extremity and that she exhibited decreased sensation over the C-6 and C-7 nerve distribution.  Tinel's sign was positive on the left, unreported on the right.  Her neck had a functional range of motion.  Mild dextroscoliosis was apparent in the dorsal and levolumbar regions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 3/27/92, claimant was examined on behalf of the Social Security Administration (SSA) by Dr. Oscar Benitez, a neurologist.  He found that claimant's mental status was alert, well oriented and cooperative, and that she was able to give a good history by herself.  Physical examination disclosed no atrophy, weakness, or deficit to pinprick sensation in the upper and lower extremities.  While Tinel's sign was positive in both wrists and elbows, no cervical or lumbar spasm was detected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Dr. Benitez completed a detailed range of motion chart which showed that claimant suffered from no limitations except a 10 degree loss of flexion-extension in the lumbar spine.  (Tr. 187-89).  Relying on Dr. Vargas's EMG and nerve conduction studies, Dr. Benitez concluded that claimant suffered from cervical dorsal and lumbar painful syndrome and multiple nerve entrapment neuropathies.  While he found no objective evidence of neurological deficit, his prognosis was reserved.  (Tr. 185).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 1992, claimant underwent further EMG and nerve conduction studies at the request of Dr. Berrios.  While Dr. Berrios's reports are largely illegible, those studies revealed that claimant suffered from early right median nerve entrapment and right C8T1 root irritability.  (Tr. 129).  Dr. Berrios recommended that claimant continue physical therapy and prescribed 12 visits.  (Tr. 134-36).  Also on 5/5/92, claimant underwent a psychiatric examination through the ACAA.  In a 2- page form report that was very brief and cryptic, Dr. Manual Colon indicated that claimant had a moderate anxiety neurosis with depression that was related to her accident.  He also checked off boxes which suggested that this condition partially limited claimant's ability to perform her usual work, but that she was able to perform the same type of work.  (Tr. 138).  Dr. Colon indicated that claimant merited psychiatric treatment and prescribed Tofranil and Buspar, anti-depression and anxiety medications.  He also recommended that claimant return for reevaluation on 6/3/92.  (Tr. 140).  However, there are no records of any such follow-up or further psychiatric treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 5/29/92, Dr. Vargas discharged claimant from the ACAA.  He indicated that claimant's neck continued to be very tender with severe spasm and that her arms were also tender.  He concluded that no more physical therapy would be of help and noted that claimant had been offered surgery but refused it.  (Tr. 143, 128).  On 7/23/92, claimant returned to Dr. Berrios, who prescribed medications and additional physical therapy.  (Tr. 120-23).  A 7/24/92 x-ray revealed reversal of the cervical lordosis indicative of cervical spasm.  (Tr. 119).  On 8/26/92, Dr. Vargas issued a final medical report.  He relied on the most recent EMG and nerve conduction studies of Dr. Berrios in concluding that claimant suffered from cervical fibromyositis, cervical radiculopathy, ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbows, carpal tunnel syndrome and lumbar radiculopathy.  Dr. Vargas indicated that claimant had over 40 physical therapy treatments which were of some help when she received them but that her pain returned after the treatments.  (Tr. 193).  He recommended that she continue physical therapy because her neck pain persisted.  (Tr. 117-18).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant argues that the ALJ failed to base his decision on substantial evidence on the record as a whole.  She particularly faults the ALJ for finding that she has no medically determinable mental impairment.  Claimant contends that this finding is not supported by substantial evidence because it:  (a) was based on the report of Dr. Benitez, a consulting neurologist who was not qualified to render an opinion on psychiatric matters, and (b) disregarded the psychiatric report of Dr. Manual Colon-which indicated that claimant suffered from an anxiety neurosis.  Claimant says that the ALJ further violated the Secretary's regulations by failing to complete a Psychiatric Review Technique Form (PRTF).  Finally, claimant argues that the ALJ failed to give appropriate weight to her complaints of disabling pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ did not mention Dr. Colon's report when he concluded that claimant did not have a medically determinable mental impairment.  But, contrary to the claimant's argument on appeal, the ALJ did not base this conclusion on the report of Dr. Benitez alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Rather, the ALJ based this conclusion on the results of Dr. Benitez's mental status exam, his own observations of claimant at the hearing, and, perhaps most importantly, the absence of evidence indicating that claimant suffered from any significant mental limitations.  (Tr. 16).  This last finding is significant, for even Dr. Colon's report does not contradict it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Colon's report consisted of an ACAA form which contained little more that his conclusory diagnosis that claimant suffered from an anxiety neurosis.  He did not identify any objective findings that supported his conclusion, nor did he relate how claimant's anxiety impaired her ability to work.  Indeed, even Dr. Colon did not conclude that claimant's anxiety left her unable to work.  His report suggests that claimant's anxiety resulted, at most, in a partial limitation but that she ultimately was able to perform the same type of work.  (Tr. 138).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of this cryptic report which contained little more than check marks, the ALJ was not required to credit Dr. Colon's diagnosis.  \"The ALJ need not accept an opinion of a physician-even a treating physician-if it is conclusory and brief and unsupported by clinical findings.\"  Matney v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596560\"><a href=\"/opinion/596560/39-socsecrepser-588-unemplinsrep-cch-p-17128a-tambra-l-matney/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span>, 1019 (9th Cir. 1992).

Cf. Thompson v.

See 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1508;  Gray v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451515\"><a href=\"/opinion/451515/9-socsecrepser-262-unemplinsrep-cch-16051-elaine-gray-v-margaret/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, 375 (1st Cir. 1985).  She failed to meet this burden.  The fact that claimant may have suffered nightmares following the accident does not establish that she was not able to work.  Moreover, even if we assume that Dr. Colon's diagnosis was correct and that the ALJ erred in finding that claimant had no mental impairment, is well established that the mere existence of an anxiety disorder does not constitute a disability.  See, e.g., Sitar v. Schweiker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399442\"><a href=\"/opinion/399442/juraj-sitar-v-richard-schweiker-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1982);  Alvarado v. Weinberger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"325610\"><a href=\"/opinion/325610/sofia-alvarado-v-caspar-w-weinberger-secretary-of-health-education-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></a></span>, 1049 (1st Cir. 1975).  The remaining notations in Dr. Colon's report establish that this condition was not severe.  Thus, even if the ALJ erred in discounting Dr. Colon's diagnosis, the record proves that this error was harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are troubled, however, by another aspect of the ALJ's decision.  The ALJ concluded that the claimant was not disabled because her RFC enabled her to perform sedentary to light work.  Yet he also found that claimant could not perform frequent or continuous hand-finger activities such as typing.  \" 'Most sedentary jobs require good use of the hands and fingers.' \"  Heggarty v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571056\"><a href=\"/opinion/571056/35-socsecrepser-400-unemplinsrep-cch-p-16302a-david-heggarty-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span>, 996 (1st Cir. 1991)(quoting SSR 83-14).  See also SSR 83-10 (CE 1983)(same).  If claimant cannot perform continuous hand-finger activities, she is not able to perform the full range of sedentary work.  Thus, the ALJ's conclusion that claimant's nonexertional limitations did not significantly reduce claimant's RFC is not supportable.  His conclusion that claimant is not disabled under Grid Rules 201.28 and 201.29, both of which posit an ability for the full range of sedentary work, is similarly flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily we would be required to remand so that the ALJ could take vocational evidence to meet the Secretary's burden of proof at step five.  However, the ALJ also concluded that claimant was capable of light work, a finding that was supported by the RFC assessment of Dr. Marxuach and Dr. Benitez's findings following his physical examination of the claimant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Light work generally does not require use of the hands and fingers for fine activities to the extent required in much sedentary work.  See SSR 83-10 at 179 (CE 1983).  While the ALJ did not expressly refer to the corresponding grid rules for light work in his decision (i.e., Rules 202.21 and 202.22), we think his not disabled finding is supportable on the basis that claimant could perform light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we discern no error in the ALJ's treatment of claimant's allegations of pain.  The ALJ properly questioned claimant on the nature and frequency of her pain, the effects of her medication, daily activities, and functional restrictions in accordance with Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1986) and SSR 88-13.  While there was clearly objective medical evidence that supported claimant's complaints of pain, the ALJ noted certain inconsistencies in the record, such as the fact that claimant's testimony that her medications caused adverse side effects was not corroborated by any of the medical records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Such inconsistencies supported the ALJ's conclusion that claimant's complaints of disabling pain were not fully credible.  Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494588\"><a href=\"/opinion/494588/19-socsecrepser-60-unemplinsrep-cch-17576-joseph-t-frustaglia-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).  We note further that claimant has not done all that she might have to remedy her condition.  Claimant testified that she preferred not to take her pain medications.  The record also discloses that she has been offered cortisone therapy and surgery to relieve her carpal tunnel syndrome but that she has declined both alternatives.  \"Implicit in a finding of disability is a determination that existing treatment alternatives would not restore a claimant's ability to work.\"  Tsarelka v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503428\"><a href=\"/opinion/503428/21-socsecrepser-71-unemplinsrep-cch-17963-lisa-tsarelka-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 534 (1st Cir. 1988).  Claimant made no showing that the various medications and other treatments that had been offered to relieve her carpal tunnel syndrome would not restore her ability to work.  Nor did she offer a \"good reason\" for failing to take advantage of the various remedies that have been offered to her.  Tsarelka, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503428\"><a href=\"/opinion/503428/21-socsecrepser-71-unemplinsrep-cch-17963-lisa-tsarelka-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> (\"If a </a></span>claimant does not follow prescribed treatment 'without a good reason,' he or she will not be found to be disabled.\")  (quoting 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1530).  In view of the foregoing, we find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Claimant reported that she could not drive or do housechores, although she occasionally washed dishes.

When the ALJ asked claimant whether her medications relieved her pain, claimant indicated that she preferred to remain lying down and not taking her medications because they caused adverse side effects.  (Tr. 29).  However, the ALJ correctly observed that the medical evidence indicated that claimant had never complained of any adverse side effects to her treating physicians.

We therefore reject claimant's contention that the ALJ could not rely on Dr. Benitez's mental status findings because Dr. Benitez was not a psychiatrist.  While we agree that Dr. Benitez's report alone was not substantial evidence that claimant lacked a mental impairment, see Boyce v.

Claimant's testimony on this score was ambiguous:  on one hand she indicated that she had not seen a psychiatrist in seven or eight months.  (Tr. 27).  She subsequently indicated that she received appointments every month and a half.  (Tr. 28).  But there are no records which support her latter assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> We also are not persuaded that a remand is required because the ALJ failed to complete a PRTF. The record discloses that the ALJ did append a PRTF to his decision.  (Tr. 20).  However, the ALJ's form is an abbreviated version of the standard PRTF. The ALJ's PRTF simply states that the claimant does not have a medically determinable mental impairment.  It does not review all the categories of potential mental impairments listed under 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App. 1, Sec. 12.00 (Mental Disorders), which are set forth in the standard PRTF. While we think the use of the standard form is preferable, we do not read the regulations to preclude the use of an abbreviated PRTF when an ALJ determines that there is no medically determinable impairment.  20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520a(b)(2) provides that the SSA must indicate whether certain medical findings relevant to the ability to work are present or absent only \"[i]f we [i.e., the SSA] determine that a mental impairment exists.\"  If there is insufficient evidence that a mental impairment exists, there will be presumably be no medical findings which would allow the SSA to complete the standard PRTF.
