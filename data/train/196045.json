Francisco Javier  Mejias appeals his\r                                \n\nconviction and  sentence for illegal reentry  into the United\n\nStates after  deportation subsequent to  an aggravated felony\n\nconviction, 8 U.S.C.   1326(b)(2).  We affirm.\n\n                        I. Background\r                                                 \n\n          According  to  the  Pre-Sentence   Report  (\"PSR\"),\n\nMejias, a citizen  of the Dominican Republic, was arrested in\n\nRhode  Island in August  1992 and pleaded  nolo contendere in\n\nstate court  to the  charge of  conspiring  to violate  Rhode\n\nIsland's Uniform Controlled Substances  Act. R.I. Gen. Laws  \n\n21-28-1.01, et seg. (1994).   He was sentenced to three years\r                              \n\nin prison; execution  of the sentence was  suspended.  Mejias\n\nwas  deported  from New  York  to the  Dominican  Republic in\n\nFebruary 1993.   In May 1993,  he arrived in Puerto  Rico and\n\nwas arrested  while attempting  to reenter the  United States\n\nwithout  having received permission  of the Attorney General.\n\nCounsel was appointed to represent Mejias.\n\n          At  a  change of  plea  hearing  before the  United\n\nStates District Court  for the  District of  Puerto Rico,  on\n\nJuly 6, 1993, Mejias pled  guilty to the single count of  his\n\nindictment,  charging  him  with  illegal  reentry  following\n\ndeportation subsequent to conviction for the commission of an\n\naggravated  felony, in  violation of  8 U.S.C.    1326(b)(2).\n\nThe PSR calculated a total offense level of 21. Starting with\n\na  base offense  level  of 8,  the PSR  added  16 levels  for\r\r\n\nMejias' prior conviction for an aggravated felony pursuant to\n\nthe  United  States  Sentencing  Guidelines   (\"U.S.S.G.\")   \n\n2L1.2(b)(2).    Three  levels  were  subtracted  for  Mejias'\n\nacceptance of responsibility.   Based upon a criminal history\n\ncategory of  II and  a total  offense level  of  21, the  PSR\n\narrived at a guideline  sentencing range of 41 to  51 months.\n\nThere were no objections to the PSR.\n\n          Prior  to  sentencing,  Mejias  filed a  motion  to\n\ndismiss the indictment.  He argued that his prosecution under\n\n8  U.S.C.    1326(b)(2) violated  the Constitution's  ex post\r                                                                         \n\nfacto clause.   He asserted that he had been  informed at the\r                 \n\ntime of  his deportation  that the  maximum penalty  he could\n\nreceive for  illegal reentry  was  two years.   The  district\n\ncourt denied the motion and  sentenced Mejias on December 13,\n\n1994, to a  prison term of  41 months.   Mejias appealed  and\n\ncounsel was appointed to represent him on appeal.\n\n          Appellate counsel filed a brief in accordance  with\n\nAnders  v. California,  386 U.S.  738 (1967), in  July, 1994.\r                                 \n\nThe government moved for summary dismissal of the appeal.  In\n\nan  order  dated October  14,  1994,  this  court denied  the\n\ngovernment's  motion  to  dismiss  and  counsel's  motion  to\n\nwithdraw, without prejudice to re-filing of the motions after\n\ncounsel obtained and  reviewed a transcript of  the change of\n\nplea  hearing.    Counsel  has  obtained  and  reviewed  that\n\ntranscript and,  finding  no  error in  the  change  of  plea\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nproceedings, has filed a supplemental Anders  brief and a new\r                                                        \n\nmotion  to withdraw.  The  government has filed  a new motion\n\nfor summary dismissal.\n\n                        II. Discussion\r                                                  \n\n          The Anders brief identifies two grounds for appeal:\r                                \n\n1) the ex  post facto  argument raised by  Mejias' motion  to\r                                 \n\ndismiss his indictment  and 2) the argument that the district\n\ncourt erred in  adding 16  levels to the  base offense  level\n\nbecause  Mejias' prior  conviction  was not   an  \"aggravated\n\nfelony,\"  within the meaning of U.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2).   For\n\nthe reasons that  follow, we agree with Mejias'  counsel that\n\nboth arguments are frivolous.\n\n          A. Violation of Ex Post Facto Clause.\r                                                          \n\n          The Constitution's  ex post  facto clause  bars the\r                                                        \n\nretrospective   application   of    laws   that    materially\n\ndisadvantage  a defendant.     Section  1326(b)(2) went  into\n\neffect in  November,  1988.   Mejias  was deported  in  1993.\n\nTherefore, the  application of    1326 (b)(2) to  his conduct\n\nwas  not \"retrospective\" and the ex post facto clause was not\r                                                          \n\nviolated.   See United States  v. Troncoso, 23  F.3d 612, 615\r                                                      \n\n(1st  Cir. 1994),  (rejecting  ex post  facto argument  where\r                                                         \n\nappellant   \"failed   to   demonstrate   that  the   law   is\n\n'retrospective,  that is  it must  apply to  events occurring\n\nbefore its enactment.'\"), cert. denied,     U.S    , 115 S.Ct\r                                                  \n\n912 (1995).\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          Nor is there any support in  the record for Mejias'\n\nargument that  the court  is estopped from  sentencing Mejias\n\nbeyond two years based upon representations by the INS at the\n\ntime of  his deportation.  The record  includes a copy of the\n\nINS Form  I-294 that was given  to Mejias at the  time of his\n\ndeportation  and signed  by him.   The  form states  that the\n\nmaximum sentence is  fifteen years for illegal re-entry by an\n\nalien whose  deportation was subsequent to  conviction for an\n\naggravated felony.   Mejias does not contest that he received\n\nthe I-294  Form signed by  him.  Therefore,  as there was  no\n\ngovernment  misrepresentation, Mejias has failed to satisfy a\n\nthreshold element of  the estoppel doctrine.   See  Troncoso,\r                                                                        \n\n23 F.3d  at 615.  Moreover,  even if the  INS had misinformed\n\nMejias of the maximum penalty  for illegal reentry, the court\n\nwould  not be estopped from  sentencing him in  excess of two\n\nyears  for  his  purposeful  felonious  conduct in  illegally\n\nreentering  the country.  See   id at  616; United  States v.\r                                                                      \n\nSmith,  14  F.3d  662,  666  (1st  Cir.  1994)  (government's\r                 \n\nmisrepresentation  regarding maximum sentence did not justify\n\ndownward departure).\n\n          B. Aggravated Felony Conviction\r                                                     \n\n          In view of  the complete lack  of factual or  legal\n\nsupport for Mejias' ex post facto argument, appellate counsel\r                                             \n\nidentified   the  following   alternative   argument:     the\n\nsentencing court erred in  applying a 16-level enhancement to\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nhis offense  level under U.S.S.G.    2L1.2(b)(2), because the\n\nstate  conviction  that  triggered  the  enhancement  is  not\n\nspecifically classified in the  state record as an aggravated\n\nfelony.  This issue was not raised before the district court.\n\n          The  \"Judgment of  Conviction and  Commitment\" from\n\nthe Rhode  Island Superior  Court indicates only  that Mejias\n\nwas  convicted  of  conspiracy   to  violate  the  Controlled\n\nSubstances  Act.  No specific section of the Rhode Island Act\n\nis cited.     From  the  PSR,  however, it  is  evident  that\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to  distribute was at least\n\none aspect  of  the  charge  to  which  Mejias  pleaded  nolo\n\ncontendere.\n\n          This  court  recently  outlined  the  criteria  for\n\nclassifying a prior conviction  as an \"aggravated felony\" for\n\npurposes of U.S.S.G.   2L1.2, as follows:\n\n               \"Aggravated  felony\"  is defined  in\n          paragraph 7 of the Application Notes to  \n          2L1.2 to include \"any illicit trafficking\n          in any controlled  substance (as  defined\n          in  21 U.S.C.  802),  including any  drug\n          trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C.\n          924(c)(2) .  . .\" and applies to offenses\n          in violation of federal or state law.\n               A   \"drug   trafficking  crime\"   is\n          defined  in U.S.C.   924(c)(2) to include\n          \"any   felony    punishable   under   the\n          Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801,\n          et   seq.),  the   Controlled  Substances\r                              \n          Import and  Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951, et\r                                                               \n          seq.),   or   the   Maritime   Drug   Law\r                         \n          Enforcement  Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901, et\r                                                               \n          seq.).\"    For  a  drug  offense  to come\r                         \n          within this statute and, in turn, to meet\n          the definition of \"aggravated felony,\" it\n          must  meet  two  criteria:    first,  the\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          offense must be  punishable under one  of\n          these  three   enumerated  statutes;  and\n          second, the  offense  must be  a  felony.\n          Amaral  v.  I.N.S., 977  F.2d  33,35 (1st\r                                        \n          Cir., 1992).\n\nUnited  States v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294, 1301 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                    \n\n          Mejias' state conviction meets both criteria.  Even\n\nsimple possession  of drugs  is punishable under  the federal\n\nControlled Substance Act. See  21 U.S.C.   844(a).   A felony\r                                         \n\nis defined under 21 U.S.C.   802(13) as \"any Federal or State\n\noffense classified  by applicable Federal  or State Law  as a\n\nfelony.\"   Under  Rhode Law,  an offense is  a felony  if the\n\nmaximum authorized  term of  imprisonment  exceeds one  year.\n\nSee R.I.  Gen. Laws    11-1-2 (1994).   The  maximum term  of\r               \n\nimprisonment authorized for conspiracy to possess with intent\n\nto deliver cocaine  exceeds one year under  Rhode Island law.\n\nSee R.I. Gen. Laws    21-28-4.01(A)(2)(a) and 21-28-4.08 \r               \n\n(1994).  Therefore, Mejias' conviction is a felony punishable\n\nby one of the  enumerated statutes in 18 U.S.C.    924(c)(2),\n\nand it  qualifies as  an aggravated  felony  for purposes  of\n\nU.S.S.G.   2L1.2.\n\n          We  conclude  that  counsel,  having  obtained  and\n\nreviewed the transcript from the  change of plea hearing, has\n\nfully complied with her obligation under Anders to review the\r                                                           \n\nentire record for any arguable claim.  In accordance with our\n\nobligation  under  Anders, we  too  have  fully examined  the\r                                     \n\nrecord.  We conclude that the appeal is wholly frivolous and,\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\naccordingly,   we   grant  counsel's   motion   to  withdraw.\n\nAppellant's conviction  and sentence are affirmed.   See Loc.\r                                                                    \n\nR. 27.1.\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n",

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\"), Mejias, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, was arrested in Rhode Island in August 1992 and pleaded nolo contendere in state court to the charge of conspiring to violate Rhode Island's Uniform Controlled Substances Act.  R.I. Gen. Laws Sec. 21-28-1.01, et seg.  (1994).  He was sentenced to three years in prison;  execution of the sentence was suspended.  Mejias was deported from New York to the Dominican Republic in February 1993.  In May 1993, he arrived in Puerto Rico and was arrested while attempting to reenter the United States without having received permission of the Attorney General.

He asserted that he had been informed at the time of his deportation that the maximum penalty he could receive for illegal reentry was two years.

California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), in July, 1994.  The government moved for summary dismissal of the appeal.  In an order dated October 14, 1994, this court denied the government's motion to dismiss and counsel's motion to withdraw, without prejudice to re-filing of the motions after counsel obtained and reviewed a transcript of the change of plea hearing.

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Anders brief identifies two grounds for appeal:  1) the ex post facto argument raised by Mejias' motion to dismiss his indictment and 2) the argument that the district court erred in adding 16 levels to the base offense level because Mejias' prior conviction was not an \"aggravated felony,\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2).  For the reasons that follow, we agree with Mejias' counsel that both arguments are frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Violation of Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Constitution's ex post facto clause bars the retrospective application of laws that materially disadvantage a defendant.  Section 1326(b)(2) went into effect in November, 1988.  Mejias was deported in 1993.  Therefore, the application of Sec. 1326(b)(2) to his conduct was not \"retrospective\" and the ex post facto clause was not violated.  See United States v. Troncoso, 23 F.3d 612, 615 (1st Cir. 1994), (rejecting ex post facto argument where appellant \"failed to demonstrate that the law is 'retrospective, that is it must apply to events occurring before its enactment.' \"), cert. denied, ___ U.S ___, 115 S.Ct 912 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any support in the record for Mejias' argument that the court is estopped from sentencing Mejias beyond two years based upon representations by the INS at the time of his deportation.  The record includes a copy of the INS Form I-294 that was given to Mejias at the time of his deportation and signed by him.  The form states that the maximum sentence is fifteen years for illegal re-entry by an alien whose deportation was subsequent to conviction for an aggravated felony.  Mejias does not contest that he received the I-294 Form signed by him.  Therefore, as there was no government misrepresentation, Mejias has failed to satisfy a threshold element of the estoppel doctrine.  See Troncoso, 23 F.3d at 615.  Moreover, even if the INS had misinformed Mejias of the maximum penalty for illegal reentry, the court would not be estopped from sentencing him in excess of two years for his purposeful felonious conduct in illegally reentering the country.  See id at 616;  United States v. Smith, 14 F.3d 662, 666 (1st Cir. 1994) (government's misrepresentation regarding maximum sentence did not justify downward departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2), because the state conviction that triggered the enhancement is not specifically classified in the state record as an aggravated felony.  This issue was not raised before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"Judgment of Conviction and Commitment\" from the Rhode Island Superior Court indicates only that Mejias was convicted of conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act.  No specific section of the Rhode Island Act is cited.

Sec. 924(c)(2) to include \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801, et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951, et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901, et seq.).\"  For a drug offense to come within this statute and, in turn, to meet the definition of \"aggravated felony,\" it must meet two criteria:  first, the offense must be punishable under one of these three enumerated statutes;  and second, the offense must be a felony.

Sec. 802(13) as \"any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State Law as a felony.\"  Under Rhode Law, an offense is a felony if the maximum authorized term of imprisonment exceeds one year.

Laws Secs. 21-28-4.01(A)(2)(a) and 21-28-4.08 (1994).  Therefore, Mejias' conviction is a felony punishable by one of the enumerated statutes in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(2), and it qualifies as an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that counsel, having obtained and reviewed the transcript from the change of plea hearing, has fully complied with her obligation under Anders to review the entire record for any arguable claim.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\"), Mejias, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, was arrested in Rhode Island in August 1992 and pleaded nolo contendere in state court to the charge of conspiring to violate Rhode Island's Uniform Controlled Substances Act.  R.I. Gen. Laws Sec. 21-28-1.01, et seg.  (1994).  He was sentenced to three years in prison;  execution of the sentence was suspended.  Mejias was deported from New York to the Dominican Republic in February 1993.  In May 1993, he arrived in Puerto Rico and was arrested while attempting to reenter the United States without having received permission of the Attorney General.  Counsel was appointed to represent Mejias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a change of plea hearing before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, on July 6, 1993, Mejias pled guilty to the single count of his indictment, charging him with illegal reentry following deportation subsequent to conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2).  The PSR calculated a total offense level of 21.  Starting with a base offense level of 8, the PSR added 16 levels for Mejias' prior conviction for an aggravated felony pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2).  Three levels were subtracted for Mejias' acceptance of responsibility.  Based upon a criminal history category of II and a total offense level of 21, the PSR arrived at a guideline sentencing range of 41 to 51 months.  There were no objections to the PSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to sentencing, Mejias filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.  He argued that his prosecution under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2) violated the Constitution's ex post facto clause.  He asserted that he had been informed at the time of his deportation that the maximum penalty he could receive for illegal reentry was two years.  The district court denied the motion and sentenced Mejias on December 13, 1994, to a prison term of 41 months.  Mejias appealed and counsel was appointed to represent him on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate counsel filed a brief in accordance with Anders v.
