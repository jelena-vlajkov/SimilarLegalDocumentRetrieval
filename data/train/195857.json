Insofar  as  appellant\n\ncontends  that the district court was without jurisdiction to\n\nissue its  order of dismissal,  dated April 29, 1994,  she is\n\nincorrect.

See Link\r                                                                         \n\nv.

In Cosme Nieves v.\r                                                                      \n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nDeshler, 826 F.2d 1,  2 (1st Cir.  1987), we said that  \"[i]n\r                   \n\nall the cases in which we have upheld a dismissal for want of\n\nprosecution,  we  have  found   either  extremely  protracted\r                                                  \n\ninaction (measured  in years), disobedience  of court orders,\n\nignorance  of warnings,  contumacious conduct, or  some other\r                                                             \n\naggravating  circumstance.\"  Id.

Senior Indus., 848 F.2d  315, 317\r                                                     \n\n(1st  Cir. 1988) (footnotes omitted).  Appellant's litigation\n\nefforts in this matter are directed at dragging out claims of\n\ndubious merit  beyond any reasonable expectation  of success.\n\nWe recite but a brief overview.\n\n     In 1988, the  state Department  of Education  determined\n\nthat the defendants had fully complied with federal and state\n\nlaw.  Also in 1988, the district court, in denying successive\n\nrequests   for   preliminary   injunctive  relief,   made   a\n\ndetermination that appellant's  lawsuit was not likely  to be\n\nsuccessful.  After filing appeals from each of the denials of\n\npreliminary  injunctive relief,  appellant's mother,  who was\n\nlitigating  on her then-minor daughter's behalf, moved for an\n\nexpedited trial, but  then three times  failed to attend  her\n\nscheduled  deposition - in  each instance, giving  very short\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nnotice  that  she  would  not  attend -  and  on  the  fourth\n\nscheduled date, abruptly terminated the deposition.  Two days\n\nbefore the scheduled fifth date, she informed the court  that\n\nshe and appellant had moved to Texas and asked to voluntarily\n\ndismiss the lawsuit without prejudice.\n\n     Three  years  later,  appellant  sought  to  reinstitute\n\nessentially   the  same   lawsuit.     Presumably,  appellant\n\ngraduated in June  1989; yet there is no  explanation for the\n\n2+   years  of  inactivity  from  then  until  the  attempted\n\nreinstitution in September 1991.  Although the district court\n\nfound that full payment of  the defendants' fees and expenses\n\n($6,598.50) in defending the aborted suit would be justified,\n\nin recognition of the appellant's indigency, it required only\n\nthat  appellant  deposit  $1,000 into  the  Court's  Registry\n\npending  the  outcome  of  the  new lawsuit  and  to  file  a\n\nclarification of the  basis for her new action.   We affirmed\n\nthat order as a  justifiable balance of appellant's right  of\n\naccess to the  court process with  her responsibility to  use\n\nthat process appropriately.   After granting an  extension of\n\ntime in which to file  it, we denied appellant's petition for\n\nrehearing.  As noted, mandate issued on February 18, 1994.\n\n     The  district court  warned  appellant,  by order  dated\n\nMarch 9, 1994,  that her suit would be  dismissed for lack of\n\nprosecution unless, by  April 15, she deposited the $1,000 in\n\nthe   Court  Registry   and   filed  the   required   written\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nclarification.  Appellant's response was tepid, at best.  She\n\ninformed the  district court  of her  \"interest\" in  filing a\n\nmotion  to recall  mandate in  the court  of appeals  and her\n\n\"intention\"  to timely seek certiorari in the Supreme Court.1\n\nShe  did not  seek a  stay  pending her  attempts at  further\n\nreview,  offer to  pay  even  part of  the  $1,000, file  the\n\nwritten clarification or  suggest why even that  filing would\n\nbe burdensome.  Her response is best viewed for what it truly\n\nrepresents  - more delaying tactics, unlikely to succeed, and\n\nnot warranting the withholding of dismissal.\n\n     The  \"glaring weaknesses  in  the plaintiff's  case\" are\n\nself-evident  even from this summary recitation of the course\n\nof this  litigation.   In 1988, the  state Bureau  of Special\n\nEducation Appeals  determined that  the defendants  had fully\n\ncomplied  with state  and federal  law.   Also  in 1988,  the\n\ndistrict  court, in  denying  preliminary injunctive  relief,\n\nconcluded  that she  was unlikely  to prevail on  the merits.\n\nNothing  since  that time  suggests the  contrary.   And, the\n\ndefendants  have  had  to  endure  appellant's  \"dodging  and\n\nweaving\" tactics of litigation -- which consisted of pressing\n\nfor injunctive relief  and expedited trial  in 1988, only  to\n\ncome to  a screeching halt  when prospects of  success looked\n\ndim, and  then springing to  life again three years  later in\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Certiorari  was,  in  fact, denied  on  October  3, 1994.\nHickey v. Wellesley Sch. Comm., 115 S. Ct. 112 (1994).\r                                          \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n1991, resulting in  another three years of litigation.   This\n\ncase has  consumed more amount  of the district  court's time\n\nthan it warrants.\n\n     Finally, appellant  has appealed from  an order  denying\n\nher motion \"to correct the record and request  for accounting\n\nfrom  court  of  all  handwritten  notes,  books,  documents,\n\nrecords,   papers,  tapes,  etc.  of  the  Court's  Order  of\n\nDismissal dated April 29,  1994.\"  Appellant claims that  she\n\ndid not  receive a copy of the  dismissal order until May 26,\n\nand  so, she  further claims,  dismissal  must have  actually\n\noccurred on May 23 or 24, but was back-dated to April 29.  We\n\nhave grave doubts about each of these allegations.  Appellant\n\nalso has failed to  support her claim that she is entitled to\n\n\"handwritten notes\" and the like.  In any event, the district\n\ncourt gave appellant an extension of time to file a notice of\n\nappeal from the order of  dismissal.  We have considered that\n\nappeal and it is meritless.\n\n     The order of dismissal and the  order denying the motion\n\nto correct the record and for an accounting are affirmed.\r                                                                     \n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

Insofar as appellant contends that the district court was without jurisdiction to issue its order of dismissal, dated April 29, 1994, she is incorrect.  Mandate in appellant's prior appeal issued on February 18, 1994.  \"The effect of the mandate is to bring the proceedings in a case on appeal in our Court to a close and to remove it from the jurisdiction of this Court, returning it to the forum whence it came.\"  Ostrer v.

Moreover, the mere filing of a petition for certiorari without also timely asking for, and obtaining, a stay of mandate did not prevent the district court from acting as it did.  \"[N]either the right to petition for a writ of certiorari nor the actual filing of such a petition stays enforcement of the judgment sought to be reviewed by certiorari.\"  2 Fed Proc, L Ed Sec. 3:131 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in ordering dismissal in this case.  See Link v.

Senior Indus., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507080\"><a href=\"/opinion/507080/enlace-mercantil-internacional-inc-v-senior-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 317 (1st Cir. 1988) (footnotes omitted).  Appellant's litigation efforts in this matter are directed at dragging out claims of dubious merit beyond any reasonable expectation of success.  We recite but a brief overview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, the state Department of Education determined that the defendants had fully complied with federal and state law.  Also in 1988, the district court, in denying successive requests for preliminary injunctive relief, made a determination that appellant's lawsuit was not likely to be successful.  After filing appeals from each of the denials of preliminary injunctive relief, appellant's mother, who was litigating on her then-minor daughter's behalf, moved for an expedited trial, but then three times failed to attend her scheduled deposition-in each instance, giving very short notice that she would not attend-and on the fourth scheduled date, abruptly terminated the deposition.  Two days before the scheduled fifth date, she informed the court that she and appellant had moved to Texas and asked to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three years later, appellant sought to reinstitute essentially the same lawsuit.  Presumably, appellant graduated in June 1989;  yet there is no explanation for the 2+ years of inactivity from then until the attempted reinstitution in September 1991.  Although the district court found that full payment of the defendants' fees and expenses ($6,598.50) in defending the aborted suit would be justified, in recognition of the appellant's indigency, it required only that appellant deposit $1,000 into the Court's Registry pending the outcome of the new lawsuit and to file a clarification of the basis for her new action.  We affirmed that order as a justifiable balance of appellant's right of access to the court process with her responsibility to use that process appropriately.  After granting an extension of time in which to file it, we denied appellant's petition for rehearing.  As noted, mandate issued on February 18, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court warned appellant, by order dated March 9, 1994, that her suit would be dismissed for lack of prosecution unless, by April 15, she deposited the $1,000 in the Court Registry and filed the required written clarification.  Appellant's response was tepid, at best.  She informed the district court of her \"interest\" in filing a motion to recall mandate in the court of appeals and her \"intention\" to timely seek certiorari in the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  She did not seek a stay pending her attempts at further review, offer to pay even part of the $1,000, file the written clarification or suggest why even that filing would be burdensome.  Her response is best viewed for what it truly represents-more delaying tactics, unlikely to succeed, and not warranting the withholding of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"glaring weaknesses in the plaintiff's case\" are self-evident even from this summary recitation of the course of this litigation.  In 1988, the state Bureau of Special Education Appeals determined that the defendants had fully complied with state and federal law.  Also in 1988, the district court, in denying preliminary injunctive relief, concluded that she was unlikely to prevail on the merits.  Nothing since that time suggests the contrary.  And, the defendants have had to endure appellant's \"dodging and weaving\" tactics of litigation-which consisted of pressing for injunctive relief and expedited trial in 1988, only to come to a screeching halt when prospects of success looked dim, and then springing to life again three years later in 1991, resulting in another three years of litigation.  This case has consumed more amount of the district court's time than it warrants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant has appealed from an order denying her motion \"to correct the record and request for accounting from court of all handwritten notes, books, documents, records, papers, tapes, etc. of the Court's Order of Dismissal dated April 29, 1994.\"  Appellant claims that she did not receive a copy of the dismissal order until May 26, and so, she further claims, dismissal must have actually occurred on May 23 or 24, but was back-dated to April 29.  We have grave doubts about each of these allegations.  Appellant also has failed to support her claim that she is entitled to \"handwritten notes\" and the like.  In any event, the district court gave appellant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal from the order of dismissal.  We have considered that appeal and it is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of dismissal and the order denying the motion to correct the record and for an accounting are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Certiorari was, in fact, denied on October 3, 1994.
