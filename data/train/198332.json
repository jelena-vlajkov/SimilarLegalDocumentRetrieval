Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n            Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nGlen DeValerio, with whom Kathleen M. Donovan-Maher, Berman,\r\nDeValerio &amp; Pease LLP, Stuart H. Savett, Barbara A. Podell, Savett\r\nFrutkin Podell &amp; Ryan, P.C., Sherrie R. Savett, Gary E. Cantor,\r\nBerger &amp; Montague, P.C., Stephen T. Rodd, and Abbey, Gardy &amp;\r\nSquitieri, LLP were on brief, for appellants.\r\n\nFebruary 23, 1999\r\n\n                             SELYA, Circuit Judge.  In certain types of complex\r\nlitigation, the lawyers' monetary interests often comprise a tail\r\nthat wags the dog.  So it is here:  this dispute over the\r\nreimbursement of certain payments fronted by the lawyers is what\r\nremains of a consolidated class action (actually, an amalgam of\r\nsome 16 suits) asserting claims of securities fraud.  After the\r\ndistrict court approved a global $10,000,000 settlement, the\r\nplaintiffs' attorneys filed a petition seeking 30% of the common\r\nfund in fees and approximately $277,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. \r\nThe district court awarded the movants 17% of the fund\r\n($1,750,000) as counsel fees, but turned down their request for\r\nexpenses.  See In re Fidelity/Micron Sec. Litig., No. 95-12676-RGS,\r\n1998 WL 313735 (D. Mass. June 5, 1998).\r\nIn refusing reimbursement, the district court alluded to\r\nthe movants' failure to provide adequate documentation to support\r\nthe expense request, but it based its ruling principally on its own\r\nStanding Order Regarding Costs.  The Standing Order, reprinted in\r\nthe appendix hereto, states in substance that, absent exceptional\r\ncircumstances, the court as a matter of practice will eschew\r\nreimbursement of certain categories of expenses.  To the chagrin\r\nof the lawyers who appear as appellants here, the categories\r\nenumerated in the Standing Order (e.g., postage, facsimile\r\ntransmission costs, copying expenses, telephone charges, cost of\r\ncomputer-assisted legal research) enveloped much of what they\r\nsought to collect.  The one major exception related to the cost of\r\nretaining an expert witness.  After the appellants moved for\r\nreconsideration of the expense reimbursement request and produced\r\nthe expert's billing records, the district court promptly granted\r\nthem the $124,000 they had spent on that front.  The court remained\r\nresolute, however, as to the balance of the expenditures.  This\r\nappeal followed.  In it, the lawyers protest only the court's\r\nrefusal to allow broader expense reimbursement.\r\nWe begin with bedrock:  in situations in which expenses\r\nare potentially reimbursable, district courts enjoy wide latitude\r\nin shaping the contours of such awards.  See In re Thirteen Appeals\r\nSan Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 56 F.3d 295, 309 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).  Such awards are permissible in \"common fund\" cases  \r\nbut the district court, called upon to make awards of fees and/or\r\nexpenses in such a case, functions as a quasi-fiduciary to\r\nsafeguard the corpus of the fund for the benefit of the plaintiff\r\nclass.  See, e.g., Cook v. Niedert, 142 F.3d 1004, 1011 (7th Cir.\r\n1998).  Consequently, a reviewing court has the right, if not the\r\nobligation, to view skeptically efforts by attorneys to charge\r\nsubstantial expenses to that account.\r\nEven so, law firms are not eleemosynary institutions, and \r\nlawyers whose efforts succeed in creating a common fund for the\r\nbenefit of a class are entitled not only to reasonable fees, but\r\nalso to recover from the fund, as a general matter, expenses,\r\nreasonable in amount, that were necessary to bring the action to\r\na climax.  See Swedish Hosp. Corp. v. Shalala, 1 F.3d 1261, 1265\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1993); In re Nineteen Appeals   San Juan Dupont Plaza\r\nHotel Fire Litig., 982 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThis general rule does not give counsel carte blanche to\r\nspend freely and expect that reimbursement automatically will\r\nfollow.  Administration of the rule is subject to the trial court's\r\ninformed discretion.  Reasonableness is the touchstone, and a\r\nrequest that promises to yield an unreasonable result must be\r\ntrimmed back or rejected outright.  See In re Coordinated Pretrial\r\nProceedings in Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Litig., 109 F.3d 602, 607\r\n(9th Cir. 1997) (explaining that \"[r]easonableness is the goal,\"\r\nand that courts should avoid \"mechanical or formulaic application\"\r\nof rigid rules).  Moreover, because each common fund case presents\r\nits own unique set of circumstances, trial courts must assess each\r\nrequest for fees and expenses on its own terms.  See Camden I\r\nCondo. Ass'n, Inc. v. Dunkle, 946 F.2d 768, 774-75 (11th Cir.\r\n1991).  After all, the authority to order reimbursement from a\r\ncommon fund has its origins in equity and, when a court exercises\r\nthis equitable power, individualization is the name of the game. \r\nSee Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 167 (1939).\r\nHere, the district court's Standing Order raises a core\r\nconcern:  it does not leave sufficient room for individualized\r\nconsideration of expense requests.  It may very well be that, at\r\nthe end of the day, a district court will decide in most cases that\r\nthe lawyers cannot justify particular kinds of expense requests. \r\nBut, for the most part, that decision must be made after\r\nconsideration of each particular request; it is not to be asserted\r\nbeforehand upon the authority of an inflexible, informally\r\npromulgated rule.\r\nDue to this lack of individualized consideration, we\r\nvacate the district court's order denying expense reimbursement and\r\nremand so that the court may reconsider the request.  We hasten to\r\nadd that we do not equate reconsideration with compulsory\r\nreimbursement.  For one thing, in percentage-of-the-fund cases,\r\ndistrict courts may, if they so elect, set the percentage at a\r\nlevel which not only accounts for fees, but also suffices to cover\r\nreimbursable expenses in whole or in part.  Insofar as we can tell,\r\nthe district court did not take this route, but we leave open the\r\npossibility that the court did so implicitly, or that it will do\r\nso on remand.  We caution, however, that such an approach requires\r\nthe court to set forth specific reasons for selecting the\r\npercentage and to explain its analysis with particularity.  See,\r\ne.g., Camden I, 946 F.2d at 775.\r\nFor another thing, lawyers are not necessarily entitled\r\nto the quantum of reimbursement to which they aspire.  To the\r\ncontrary, they must establish the reasonableness of their requests. \r\nIn the course of that exercise, the trial court may insist on\r\nexamining particulars, such as receipts and logs, so that it can\r\ndetermine whether the claimed expenses were reasonable, necessary,\r\nand incurred for the benefit of the class.  Unverified expenses may\r\nbe rejected out of hand.  See Weinberger v. Great N. Nekoosa Corp.,\r\n925 F.2d 518, 527 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nThe lower court also may restrict reimbursement to those\r\nlawyers or law firms who pulled the laboring oar in prosecuting the\r\ncase.  Equity ordinarily contemplates that those responsible for\r\nbringing home the bacon will receive repayment of expenditures made\r\nin that endeavor.  This is simply another way of determining\r\nwhether certain expenditures were reasonable and necessary to the\r\ncreation and maintenance of the common fund.\r\nThere is one last matter.  In their appellate brief, and\r\nagain at oral argument, the appellants informed us that they seek\r\ncounsel fees and expenses referable to work done in this court. \r\nOn appeal, awards of counsel fees and expenses for litigating the\r\nmagnitude of attorney reimbursement in common fund cases are few\r\nand far between.  Although we ruled long ago that trial courts had\r\nsome discretion in this regard, see Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank,\r\n110 F.2d 174, 177 (1st Cir. 1940), recent case law suggests that,\r\neven if a measure of discretion exists, such awards should rarely,\r\nif ever, be bestowed, see In re Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys.\r\nSec. Litig., 19 F.3d 1291, 1299 (9th Cir. 1994); United States v.\r\n110-118 Riverside Tenants Corp., 5 F.3d 645, 646-47 (2d Cir. 1993)\r\n(per curiam); Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiators &amp;\r\nStandard Sanitary Corp., 540 F.2d 102, 111 (3d Cir. 1976) (en\r\nbanc).  The concern animating the general rule is evident:  once\r\na common fund is established, class members and class counsel wind\r\nup playing a zero sum game, in which every dollar awarded to\r\ncounsel represents one dollar less that is available for\r\ndistribution to class members.  See Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 524.\r\nIn this instance, we conclude that the lawyers are not\r\nentitled to fees and expenses incurred while prosecuting the\r\nappeal.  The decisive datum is that they did not render the subject\r\nservices or incur the subject expenses in an effort to create or\r\nmaintain the common fund.  Moreover, no class member opposed their\r\napplication, and the appellants have given us no good reason why,\r\nin the circumstances of this case, we should overlook the general\r\nrule that disfavors reimbursement from the common fund for\r\nappellate litigation over fees and expenses.  Because the\r\nappellants' interests in this proceeding run counter to that of\r\ntheir clients, we reject the request for the payment of fees and/or\r\nexpenses in connection with this appeal.\r\nWe need go no further.  For the reasons elucidated above,\r\nwe direct the district court to mull the appellants' request for\r\nexpenses anew.\r\n\nVacated and remanded.                             APPENDIX\r\n\n             STANDING ORDER REGARDING COSTS\r\nAs a matter of practice, the court does not award, unless\r\nspecial circumstances are shown, the following categories of costs:\r\n(1) postage, express mail costs, courier fees, and the\r\ncost of electronic facsimiles;\r\n(2) ordinary copying charges;\r\n(3) travel expenses;\r\n(4) the costs of deposition transcripts not used at\r\ntrial;\r\n(5) fees for clerical and word processing services;\r\n(6) telephone charges;\r\n(7) office supplies;\r\n(8) exemplification costs for chalks and exhibits not\r\nused at trial;\r\n(9) automated document preparation costs;\r\n(10) charges for computer research services, and\r\n(11) jury consultant fees.\n",

So it is here:  this dispute over the reimbursement of certain payments fronted by the lawyers is what remains of a consolidated class action (actually, an amalgam of some 16 suits) asserting claims of securities fraud.  After the district court approved a global $10,000,000 settlement, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed a petition seeking 30% of the common fund in fees and approximately $277,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.  The district court awarded the movants 17 1/2% of the fund ($1,750,000) as counsel fees, but turned down their request for expenses.  See In re Fidelity/Micron Sec. Litig., No. 95-12676-RGS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">313735</span> </span>(D.Mass. June 5, 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In refusing reimbursement, the district court alluded to the movants' failure to provide adequate documentation to support the expense request, but it based its ruling principally on its own Standing Order Regarding Costs.  The Standing Order, reprinted in the appendix hereto, states in substance that, absent exceptional circumstances, the court as a matter of practice will eschew reimbursement of certain categories of expenses.  To the chagrin of the lawyers who appear as appellants here, the categories enumerated in the Standing Order (e.g., postage, facsimile transmission costs, copying expenses, telephone charges, cost of computer-assisted legal research) enveloped much of what they sought to collect.  The one major exception related to the cost of retaining an expert witness.  After the appellants moved for reconsideration of the expense reimbursement request and produced the expert's billing records, the district court promptly granted them the $124,000 they had spent on that front.  The court remained resolute, however, as to the balance of the expenditures.  This appeal followed.  In it, the lawyers protest only the court's refusal to allow broader expense reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock:  in situations in which expenses are potentially reimbursable, district courts enjoy wide latitude in shaping the contours of such awards.  See In re Thirteen Appeals--San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697253\"><a href=\"/opinion/697253/in-re-thirteen-appeals-arising-out-of-the-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir.1995).  Such awards are permissible in \"common fund\" cases--but the district court, called upon to make awards of fees and/or expenses in such a case, functions as a quasi-fiduciary to safeguard the corpus of the fund for the benefit of the plaintiff class.  See, e.g., Cook v. Niedert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754085\"><a href=\"/opinion/754085/archie-cook-individually-and-on-behalf-of-a-class-of-persons-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1011 (7th Cir.1998).  Consequently, a reviewing court has the right, if not the obligation, to view skeptically efforts by attorneys to charge substantial expenses to that account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, law firms are not eleemosynary institutions, and lawyers whose efforts succeed in creating a common fund for the benefit of a class are entitled not only to reasonable fees, but also to recover from the fund, as a general matter, expenses, reasonable in amount, that were necessary to bring the action to a climax.  See Swedish Hosp. Corp. v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628032\"><a href=\"/opinion/628032/swedish-hospital-corporation-v-donna-e-shalala-secretary-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span>, 1265 (D.C.Cir.1993);  In re Nineteen Appeals--San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597408\"><a href=\"/opinion/597408/in-re-nineteen-appeals-arising-out-of-the-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This general rule does not give counsel carte blanche to spend freely and expect that reimbursement automatically will follow.  Administration of the rule is subject to the trial court's informed discretion.  Reasonableness is the touchstone, and a request that promises to yield an unreasonable result must be trimmed back or rejected outright.  See In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Prods.  Antitrust Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738304\"><a href=\"/opinion/738304/1997-1-trade-cases-p-71755-97-cal-daily-op-serv-2082-97-daily-journal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span>, 607 (9th Cir.1997) (explaining that \"[r]easonableness is the goal,\" and that courts should avoid \"mechanical or formulaic application\" of rigid rules).  Moreover, because each common fund case presents its own unique set of circumstances, trial courts must assess each request for fees and expenses on its own terms.  See Camden I Condo.  Ass'n, Inc. v. Dunkle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569388\"><a href=\"/opinion/569388/camden-i-condominium-association-inc-camden-l-condominium-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 774-75 (11th Cir.1991).  After all, the authority to order reimbursement from a common fund has its origins in equity and, when a court exercises this equitable power, individualization is the name of the game.  See Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103201\"><a href=\"/opinion/103201/sprague-v-ticonic-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 167, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103201\"><a href=\"/opinion/103201/sprague-v-ticonic-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span> </a></span>(1939).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's Standing Order raises a core concern:  it does not leave sufficient room for individualized consideration of expense requests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  It may very well be that, at the end of the day, a district court will decide in most cases that the lawyers cannot justify particular kinds of expense requests.  But, for the most part, that decision must be made after consideration of each particular request;  it is not to be asserted beforehand upon the authority of an inflexible, informally promulgated rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to this lack of individualized consideration, we vacate the district court's order denying expense reimbursement and remand so that the court may reconsider the request.  We hasten to add that we do not equate reconsideration with compulsory reimbursement.  For one thing, in percentage-of-the-fund cases, district courts may, if they so elect, set the percentage at a level which not only accounts for fees, but also suffices to cover reimbursable expenses in whole or in part.  Insofar as we can tell, the district court did not take this route, but we leave open the possibility that the court did so implicitly, or that it will do so on remand.  We caution, however, that such an approach requires the court to set forth specific reasons for selecting the percentage and to explain its analysis with particularity.  See, e.g., Camden <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569388\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/569388/camden-i-condominium-association-inc-camden-l-condominium-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, lawyers are not necessarily entitled to the quantum of reimbursement to which they aspire.  To the contrary, they must establish the reasonableness of their requests.  In the course of that exercise, the trial court may insist on examining particulars, such as receipts and logs, so that it can determine whether the claimed expenses were reasonable, necessary, and incurred for the benefit of the class.  Unverified expenses may be rejected out of hand.  See Weinberger v. Great N. Nekoosa Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555766\"><a href=\"/opinion/555766/william-weinberger-v-great-northern-nekoosa-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court also may restrict reimbursement to those lawyers or law firms who pulled the laboring oar in prosecuting the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Equity ordinarily contemplates that those responsible for bringing home the bacon will receive repayment of expenditures made in that endeavor.  This is simply another way of determining whether certain expenditures were reasonable and necessary to the creation and maintenance of the common fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one last matter.  In their appellate brief, and again at oral argument, the appellants informed us that they seek counsel fees and expenses referable to work done in this court.  On appeal, awards of counsel fees and expenses for litigating the magnitude of attorney reimbursement in common fund cases are few and far between.  Although we ruled long ago that trial courts had some discretion in this regard, see Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></span>, 177 (1st Cir.1940), recent case law suggests that, even if a measure of discretion exists, such awards should rarely, if ever, be bestowed, see In re Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666044\"><a href=\"/opinion/666044/in-re-washington-public-power-supply-system-securities-litigation-class/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span>, 1299 (9th Cir.1994);  United States v. 110-118 Riverside Tenants Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"653627\"><a href=\"/opinion/653627/united-states-v-110-118-riverside-tenants-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 646-47 (2d Cir.1993) (per curiam);  Lindy Bros.

The concern animating the general rule is evident:  once a common fund is established, class members and class counsel wind up playing a zero sum game, in which every dollar awarded to counsel represents one dollar less that is available for distribution to class members.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555766\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Weinberger,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/555766/william-weinberger-v-great-northern-nekoosa-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, we conclude that the lawyers are not entitled to fees and expenses incurred while prosecuting the appeal.  The decisive datum is that they did not render the subject services or incur the subject expenses in an effort to create or maintain the common fund.  Moreover, no class member opposed their application, and the appellants have given us no good reason why, in the circumstances of this case, we should overlook the general rule that disfavors reimbursement from the common fund for appellate litigation over fees and expenses.  Because the appellants' interests in this proceeding run counter to that of their clients, we reject the request for the payment of fees and/or expenses in connection with this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
