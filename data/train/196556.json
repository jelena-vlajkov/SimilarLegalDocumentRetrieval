This appeal comes before the en banc court\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\nfollowing  the withdrawal  of  a two-to-one  decision, issued  on\r\n\nFebruary 6,  1996,  in which  a  panel of  this court  vacated  a\r\n\njudgment  of the United States District Court for the District of\r\n\nRhode Island.1  The  en banc court similarly withdrew  a decision\r\n\nhanded  down by a different panel that construed the same federal\r\n\nstatute,  namely,  section 905(b)  of  the  Longshore and  Harbor\r\n\nWorkers' Compensation  Act (LHWCA),  33 U.S.C.     901-950, in  a\r\n\nmaterially different way.   See Morehead v. Atkinson-Kiewit, J/V,\r                                                                          \r\n\nNo. 94-1581.  We granted rehearing en banc in both cases so as to\r\n\nafford us an opportunity  to formulate a consistent rule  in this\r\n\ncircuit   concerning  the   underlying   question  of   statutory\r\n\nconstruction.\r\n\n          This  case  illustrates  the problem.    The defendant,\r\n\nTraylor Bros., Inc. (Traylor), contracted with the State of Rhode\r\n\nIsland to construct a  new bridge spanning Narragansett  Bay from\r\n\nNorth Kingstown to Jamestown.  Once work began, Traylor chartered\r\n\ntugboats and nonmotorized barges to  assist it in building coffer\r\n\ndams  for   the  new  bridge.    It   hired  pile-driving  crews,\r\n\ncarpenters, mechanics, and crane operators to man the barges.\r\n\n          In  mid-1988, Traylor  towed the  barge BETTY  F, whose\r\n\nmain  deck was fitted with  a crane and  a vibratory pile-driving\r\n\nhammer, to the coffer dam construction site.  Thereafter, Traylor\r\n\nmoved the BETTY  F to  various other aquatic  locations where  it\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The district court's opinion  is published.  See DiGiovanni\r                                                                           \r\nv. Traylor Bros., Inc., 855 F. Supp. 37 (D.R.I. 1994).\r                                \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nfunctioned as  a stationary  platform for the  pile-driving crew.\r\n\nDuring  most pile-driving  operations,  a supply  barge, used  to\r\n\ncarry materials and to  house the powerpack for the  pile driver,\r\n\nwas moored alongside the BETTY F.  Traylor routinely assigned two\r\n\nemployees as \"tag men\" to stand  on the supply barge's main deck,\r\n\ngrasp opposing  guide ropes attached to the vibratory hammer, and\r\n\nsteady the implement  as it  moved into position  over the  metal\r\n\npiles that were to be driven.\r\n\n          Beginning in  September of  1988, worn fittings  on the\r\n\npowerpack began to  leak hydraulic fluid  which spilled onto  the\r\n\ndeck of the  supply barge.  Crewmen  complained unsuccessfully to\r\n\ntheir superiors and to the union steward about the hazard.   They\r\n\nalso tried to alleviate the problem from time to time,  but to no\r\n\navail.\r\n\n          On September 30, 1988, plaintiff Rocco DiGiovanni, Jr.,\r\n\nwho  had been  assigned by Traylor  to work  as a tag  man on the\r\n\nsupply  barge, slipped on  spilled hydraulic fluid  as he started\r\n\nacross the oil-covered deck to  steady the BETTY F's pile-driving\r\n\nhammer with his guide rope.  DiGiovanni was seriously injured and\r\n\nreceived  workers' compensation benefits from Traylor under LHWCA\r\n\n  904, 33 U.S.C.   904.\r\n\n          Not satisfied with the avails of workers' compensation,\r\n\nDiGiovanni  sued in the  federal district  court.   His complaint\r\n\nnoted  that Traylor was not only his  employer but also the owner\r\n\npro  hac  vice  of  both  the  BETTY  F  and  the  supply  barge.\r                        \r\n\nAccordingly, he asseverated that Traylor was liable in negligence\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\npursuant to 33 U.S.C.   905(b) in its capacity as vessel owner.\r\n\n          The district  court entered  judgment for Traylor  as a\r\n\nmatter  of law following a three-day bench trial.  See DiGiovanni\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Traylor Bros.,  Inc.,  855 F.  Supp.  37 (D.R.I.  1994).   As\r                                  \r\n\nmentioned  earlier, a panel  of this court  vacated the decision.\r\n\nThe panel held that the lower court had applied too restrictive a\r\n\ntest  to DiGiovanni's \"dual capacity\" claim.  It was against that\r\n\nbackdrop that we granted en banc review.\r\n\n          The en banc court has  now issued its opinion resolving\r\n\nthe companion  case.2  See Morehead v.  Atkinson-Kiewit, J/V,    \r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d     (1st Cir.  1996) (en banc).  This opinion  clarifies the\r\n\nproper interpretation of LHWCA   905(b) in \"dual capacity\" cases.\r\n\nIn the view of  the majority of the judges of  the en banc court,\r\n\nMorehead is controlling here.   Moreover, Morehead explicates our\r                                                            \r\n\nreasoning  in sufficient  detail that  added comment on  our part\r\n\nwould be supererogatory.\r\n\n          It suffices to  say that  we are not  persuaded by  the\r\n\ndistinctions  that our  dissenting  brother raises.    As we  see\r\n\nthings,  Morehead, as applied to  the facts of  the instant case,\r                           \r\n\nplainly  requires that we depart  from the position  taken by the\r\n\npanel and  reinstate the district  court's entry  of judgment  in\r\n\nTraylor's favor.  We need go no further.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  appeals  in this  case and  in  Morehead could  not be\r                                                             \r\ntreated  in a single  en banc opinion because  a senior judge who\r\nhad sat on the Morehead panel was eligible to participate  in the\r                                 \r\nen banc  decision in  that case, but  not in this  case.   See 28\r                                                                        \r\nU.S.C.   46(c); 1st Cir. Loc. R. 35.3.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                  - Dissenting Opinion Follows -\r                            - Dissenting Opinion Follows -\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          CYR, Circuit  Judge (dissenting).   On the  grounds set\r                    CYR, Circuit  Judge (dissenting).\r                                       \r\n\nforth in Morehead v.  Atkinson-Kiewit, J/V,    F.3d     (1st Cir.\r                                                    \r\n\n1996)  (Cyr, J.,  dissenting)  [No. 94-1581  (1st  Cir. Oct.    ,\r\n\n1996)],  I  respectfully dissent.    The  district court  entered\r\n\njudgment for Traylor Brothers, Inc. in reliance on decisional law\r\n\nwhich presumes  a legal fiction  of dual capacity  that conflicts\r\n\nwith both the  LHWCA and  the Supreme Court  decision in  Scindia\r                                                                           \r\n\nSteam Navigation  Co. v. De Los Santos, 451 U.S. 156 (1981).  For\r                                                \r\n\ntwo principal reasons,  reliance on the dual  capacity fiction in\r\n\nthe present case is less appropriate than in Morehead.  \r                                                               \r\n\n          First, unlike  Morehead  the present  record leaves  no\r                                           \r\n\ndoubt that  \"active control\" over the  workplace where DiGiovanni\r\n\nwas injured shifted so  haphazardly between Traylor Brothers' two\r\n\nfictional personae  that it  cannot reliably be  determined which\r\n\ncadre  of  its employees  Traylor  Brothers  expected to  control\r\n\nworkplace safety  at the site  of the  injury.  See  Morehead,   \r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at     n.6  [No. 94-1581,  slip op.  at  48 n.6]  (Cyr, J.,\r\n\ndissenting).   Indeed, the  district court acknowledged  that the\r\n\nfailure to stop the powerpack leakage for nearly a month amounted\r\n\nto  negligence,  and it  is more  than  merely arguable  that the\r\n\nnegligence   which  caused   DiGiovanni's   injury  is   directly\r\n\nattributable to the absence of any clear delineation of responsi-\r\n\nbility by  Traylor Brothers  for its  workplace-safety decisions.\r\n\nThus,  on the present record Traylor Brothers did not approach an\r\n\nefficient  \"bifurcation\" of its \"vessel-owner\" and \"construction\"\r\n\noperations.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          Second,   during  the  extended  period  the  powerpack\r\n\nleakage  persisted, Traylor  Brothers' supervisors  and employees\r\n\nresorted  to a  series  of patently  inadequate stopgap  measures\r\n\n(e.g.,  tying the powerpack with  rags, spreading kitty litter on\r\n\nthe  oil-slickened deck).   Further, even  assuming that  an open\r\n\nhatch arguably might serve some legitimate vessel or construction\r\n\npurpose  in  a  particular case,  the  faulty  powerpack and  its\r\n\ndangerous effluent  not only represented an  open and conspicuous\r\n\nhazard, but served no conceivable purpose which might warrant the\r\n\nextended failure of  Traylor Brothers'  fictional \"vessel  owner\"\r\n\npersona  to second-guess its alter ego's decision not to stop the\r\n\nleak  sooner.   Even  if one  accepts  the dubious  premise  that\r\n\nTraylor  Brothers  might establish  an  affirmative \"bifurcation\"\r\n\ndefense  on remand,  DiGiovanni  certainly  generated  a  factual\r\n\ndispute as  to whether  Traylor Brothers' \"vessel  owner\" persona\r\n\nknew of the abortive stopgap remedies, and should have known that\r\n\nits alter ego's decision not to undertake further remediation was\r\n\n\"obviously improvident.\"   Cf. Scindia,  451 U.S. at  175, 178-79\r                                                \r\n\n(noting genuine  factual dispute whether vessel  owner was liable\r\n\nbecause it  knew that stevedore's  decision not to  fix defective\r\n\nwinch  for two days was obviously  improvident, and remanding for\r\n\nfurther  factual findings).  I therefore would remand the case to\r\n\nthe district court for further factual findings.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n",
