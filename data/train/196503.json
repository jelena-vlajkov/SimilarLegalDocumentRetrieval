No.  89-110, 79 Stat.  437\r\n\n(codified  at 42 U.S.C.    1973-1973o).  Three decades later, the\r\n\nlegislation  remains  a Serbonian  bog  in  which plaintiffs  and\r\n\ndefendants, pundits  and policymakers, judges  and justices  find\r\n\nthemselves bemired.\r\n\n          The  case  before us  opens yet  another window  on the\r\n\nconceptual complexity  that  has engulfed  the  VRA.   It  arises\r\n\nagainst  the backdrop of the biennial elections that are held for\r\n\ncity  council in  Holyoke,  Massachusetts.   The plaintiffs,  two\r\n\nnonprofit organizations  with ties to the  Hispanic community and\r\n\neight  voters of  Hispanic descent,  complain that  the electoral\r\n\nstructure  violates section  2 of  the VRA  by  denying Hispanics\r\n\nequal opportunity to \"participate in the political process and to\r\n\nelect  representatives of  their choice.\"   42 U.S.C.    1973(b).\r\n\nThe district court found merit in  the plaintiffs' complaint with\r\n\nregard to councilmanic elections and granted relief.  See Vecinos\r                                                                           \r\n\nde Barrio  Uno v.  City of  Holyoke, 880 F.  Supp. 911  (D. Mass.\r                                             \r\n\n1995).1   After careful consideration  of a bulky  record, we are\r\n\nunable  to square  the lower  court's factual  findings with  its\r\n\nultimate conclusion  of vote  dilution.  Consequently,  we vacate\r\n\nthe judgment and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The plaintiffs also challenged the way  in which members of\r\nthe  school committee were elected.   The district court repulsed\r\nthat  challenge,  see  Holyoke, 880  F.  Supp.  at  928, and  the\r                                        \r\nplaintiffs do not press the point on appeal.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  sketch the  background, reserving  a more  exegetic\r\n\ntreatment of the facts pending our discussion of specific issues.\r\n\nWe refer those readers who yearn for an immediate rush of details\r\n\nto the district court's informative opinion.  See id. at 917-25.\r                                                               \r\n\n          Since 1963, the Holyoke  city council has been composed\r\n\nof fifteen members, eight  elected at large and seven  elected by\r\n\nward.   Candidates run  without party labels  for two-year terms.\r\n\nEach voter is entitled to cast a ballot for a candidate in his or\r\n\nher ward, and to vote for up to eight at-large candidates.\r\n\n          The   Hispanic   community   in   Holyoke   has   grown\r\n\ndramatically  over the  past two  decades.   By 1990,  persons of\r\n\nHispanic  origin accounted  for  31.06% of  the total  population\r\n\n(compared to  13.8%  in 1980).    Under the  current  districting\r\n\nscheme    the  ward lines  were last redrawn  in 1992    Hispanic\r\n\nvoters comprise a  clear majority  in two wards  and account  for\r\n\nnearly  one-third of the population in  a third ward.  Yet, while\r\n\nHispanic-preferred city council candidates have prevailed  in the\r\n\ntwo \"Hispanic majority\" wards, no person of Hispanic descent ever\r\n\nhas  been  elected  to  an   at-large  seat.    This  discrepancy\r\n\ncrystallizes  into the nub of  the plaintiffs' case:   their vote\r\n\ndilution claim is  that, while Hispanics now constitute 21.89% of\r\n\nHolyoke's voting  age population, the electoral  structure limits\r\n\nthe  Hispanic community's  ability  to elect  the candidates  its\r\n\nmembers  prefer to only 14%  of the available  city council seats\r\n\n(two of fifteen).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          The district court agreed  with the plaintiffs that the\r\n\nHispanic vote had been impermissibly diluted.  See id. at 925-27.\r                                                                \r\n\nTo remedy  the perceived inequity,  the court  by separate  order\r\n\nleft the ward lines  and representation intact, but cut  back the\r\n\nnumber  of at-large seats from  eight to two  (thus shrinking the\r\n\ncouncil from  fifteen to nine  members, and making  its electoral\r\n\nstructure  congruent  with that  of the  school committee).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nVecinos de Barrio Uno v. City of Holyoke, 882  F. Supp. 9, 10 (D.\r                                                  \r\n\nMass. 1995) (Holyoke  II).   The court reasoned  that, under  the\r                                  \r\n\nrevised format, Hispanics probably  would continue to control two\r\n\nof the ward  seats, and that decreasing  the size of the  council\r\n\nwould boost Hispanics' percentage  representation to a level that\r\n\nwould  compare favorably with their  percentage of the voting age\r\n\npopulation as a whole.  See id. at 12.\r                                         \r\n\n          The district court, striving  to put its remedial order\r\n\nin  place in time for the November 1995 municipal election cycle,\r\n\nsee  id. at 13,  entered the order  under pressure of  time.  The\r                  \r\n\ncity  appealed  and  simultaneously moved  for  a  stay.   By  an\r\n\nunpublished order, we expedited the appeal and granted the  stay.\r\n\nHence,  the   November  1995   elections  were  held   under  the\r\n\npreexisting scheme.\r\n\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r          II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          The bedrock on which the district court's opinion rests\r\n\nis its  conclusion that the  at-large component of  the electoral\r\n\nstructure  unlawfully dilutes  the  Hispanic  community's  voting\r\n\npower.   As  a general  matter, a finding  of vote  dilution made\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nafter a bench trial is a finding of fact subject  to review under\r\n\nthe \"clearly  erroneous\" rubric.   See Thornburg v.  Gingles, 478\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S 30, 78-79 (1986);  Houston v. Lafayette County, 56  F.3d 606,\r                                                            \r\n\n610 (5th Cir. 1995);  Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol.  Sch. Dist. Bd.\r                                                                           \r\n\nof Educ.,  4 F.3d 1103, 1116 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.\r                                                                   \r\n\nCt. 2779 (1994); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).  This means that\r                                   \r\n\na reviewing court ought not to disturb such a finding \"unless, on\r\n\nthe whole of the record, [the court] form[s] a strong, unyielding\r\n\nbelief  that a  mistake  has  been  made.\"    Cumpiano  v.  Banco\r                                                                           \r\n\nSantander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                        \r\n\n          Though the  clear error  standard is formidable,  it is\r\n\nnot  a juggernaut  that  crushes everything  in  its path.    One\r\n\nimportant qualification is that  the jurisprudence of clear error\r\n\n\"does not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct errors of\r\n\nlaw, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of\r\n\nlaw and  fact, or  a  finding of  fact that  is  predicated on  a\r\n\nmisunderstanding of  the governing  rule of law.\"   Gingles,  478\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. at 106 (quoting Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union, 466 U.S. 485,\r                                                            \r\n\n501 (1984)); accord LoVuolo v.

See In  re Extradition of  Howard, 996 F.2d  1320, 1327\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\nIII.  PROVING VOTE DILUTION\r          III.  PROVING VOTE DILUTION\r\n\n          In  order to sharpen the focus of our inquiry, we first\r\n\nlimn the statutory framework  and elucidate the requirements that\r\n\nattend a proper showing of vote dilution.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          Section 2 of the VRA, as amended in 1982, prohibits any\r\n\nstandard, practice,  or procedure \"which  results in a  denial or\r\n\nabridgement of the right of  any citizen of the United States  to\r\n\nvote on account  of race  or color.\"   42  U.S.C.    1973(a).   A\r\n\ndenial or abridgement of the right to vote is established when,\r\n\n          based on the totality of circumstances, it is\r\n          shown that the political processes leading to\r\n          nomination or election .  . . are not equally\r\n          open to  participation  by all  members of  a\r\n          [protected] class  of citizens . .  . in that\r\n          its  members have less opportunity than other\r\n          members of  the electorate to  participate in\r\n          the   political   process   and    to   elect\r\n          representatives  of their choice.  The extent\r\n          to which  members of  a protected class  have\r\n          been  elected   to  office  .  .   .  is  one\r\n          circumstance   which   may   be   considered:\r\n          Provided,  That  nothing   in  this   section\r                            \r\n          establishes  a right  to  have  members of  a\r\n          protected class elected  in numbers equal  to\r\n          their proportion in the population.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   1973(b).  While the statutory scheme does not provide\r\n\nan assurance of success at the polls for minority candidates, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nJohnson v. De Grandy, 114 S.  Ct. 2647, 2658 n.11 (1994), it does\r                              \r\n\nprovide  an  assurance  of  fairness.    Thus,  when  \"a  certain\r\n\nelectoral law,  practice, or structure interacts  with social and\r\n\nhistorical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities\r\n\nenjoyed by [minority] and  white voters to elect  their preferred\r\n\nrepresentatives,\" a section 2  claim lies.  Gingles, 478  U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n47.\r\n\n          The platform  required to launch a  vote dilution claim\r\n\nmust  contain three  interleaved planks.   First,  the plaintiffs\r\n\nmust  prove  that they  are  part of  a  minority  group that  is\r\n\n\"sufficiently large  and geographically  compact to  constitute a\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nmajority  in a  single-member district.\"   Id.  at 50.2   Second,\r                                                        \r\n\nthey must show that  the group is \"politically cohesive.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n51.  Third, they must demonstrate significant bloc voting by non-\r\n\nminorities.  See id.  Each of these showings must  be specific to\r                              \r\n\nthe electoral unit that is under fire.\r\n\n          The  first two  Gingles preconditions look  to whether,\r                                           \r\n\nputting the  challenged practice, procedure, or  structure to one\r\n\nside,  minority  voters  within  a given  constituency  have  the\r\n\npotential to elect representatives of their choice.  See Growe v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nEmison, 113  S. Ct.  1075, 1084 (1993);  Gingles, 478 U.S.  at 50\r                                                          \r\n\nn.17.  If, for example, minority voters in an at-large system are\r\n\nso  widely   dispersed  that  they  could   not  elect  preferred\r\n\ncandidates under  some reasonable  alternative  scheme, then  the\r\n\n\"at-large system cannot be responsible for that group's inability\r\n\nto  elect its candidates.\"   Solomon v. Liberty  County, 899 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2This  precondition  will have  to  be  reconfigured to  the\r\nextent that  the courts  eventually validate so-called  influence\r\ndilution  claims.

See De  Grandy, 114 S.

However,  the\r\n\ninference is  rebuttable.   As a result,  establishing the  three\r\n\nGingles  preconditions is  necessary,  but not  always in  itself\r                 \r\n\nsufficient,  to ensure success on a section  2 claim.  That is to\r\n\nsay,  because the inference of  vote dilution can  be rebutted by\r\n\nthe force  of other evidence,  proof of the  three preconditions,\r\n\nwithout more, will not invariably carry the  day.

The case  at bar, for  example, involves the\r\nvoting patterns of the majority  (loosely termed \"white\") and the\r\nspecific minority symbolized  by the  plaintiffs (loosely  termed\r\n\"Hispanics\").    Concededly,  this  taxonomy  is  imprecise;  for\r\nexample, not all people who are considered \"Hispanic\" necessarily\r\nconsider  themselves  \"non-white.\"   To  that  extent, then,  the\r\nphrase \"white bloc voting,\" though used repeatedly throughout the\r\ndecided  cases,  may  be  somewhat inaccurate  or  even  slightly\r\nmisleading.  Similarly, VRA    2 applies to denials of  the right\r\nto vote on account of either race or color, yet the opinions harp\r                                      \r\non the phrase \"racially  polarized voting.\"  To that  extent, the\r\nidiom  of   the  case  law  may   neglect  potentially  important\r\ndistinctions  between the concepts of \"race\"  and \"color.\"  While\r\nacknowledging  these limitations,  we can  think of  no universal\r\nsolution, and, thus, take refuge in the pat terminology.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nwith  three  judges dissenting),  cert.  denied, 114  S.

Ct. at 2657.  It seems self-\r                                      \r\n\nevident  that the  presence  or  absence  of  bias  is  at  least\r\n\n\"arguably relevant\" to  the question of whether  a minority lacks\r\n\nequal  electoral  opportunity.   After  all,  a minority  group's\r\n\nprospects for electoral success in a community riven along racial\r\n\nlines differ significantly from its  prospects in a more  unified\r\n\ncommunity.   We agree with  the Fifth Circuit  that \"[a] tendency\r\n\namong whites to cast their votes on the basis of  race presents a\r\n\nfar more  durable obstacle  to the coalition-building  upon which\r\n\nminority  electoral  success   depends  than  disagreements  over\r\n\nideology.\"  LULAC, 999 F.2d at 858.\r                           \r\n\n          By  like token,  however, sentiments unrelated  to race\r\n\nalso can be powerful stimuli.   When it can  be shown that, in  a\r\n\nparticular  community,  voters  are  moved  primarily  by  causes\r\n\nunrelated  to race, it is  reasonable to assume  that a minority-\r\n\npreferred candidate  who embodies  these values might  equally be\r\n\nable to engender majoritarian (white) support.   See Gingles, 478\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 100-01 (O'Connor, J., concurring).

We so hold.\r\n\n          This  holding draws  sustenance  from the  language  of\r\n\nsection 2  itself,  particularly  the  statute's  prohibition  of\r\n\nelectoral structures  that result in  a denial or  abridgement of\r\n\nthe right to vote  \"on account of  race or color.\"   42 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1973(a).

In\r                                                   \r\n\nenacting  the  amendment,  Congress  shifted  the  law's   focus:\r\n\nplaintiffs  no longer  have  to prove  discriminatory intent  but\r\n\ninstead have to carry  the burden of proving that  the challenged\r\n\nelectoral structure results  in a denial of equal  opportunity on\r\n\naccount of race.\r\n\n          Properly  conceived, the  results test  protects racial\r\n\nminorities against  a stacked  deck but  does not  guarantee that\r\n\nthey  will  be  dealt a  winning  hand.   Whitcomb     an opinion\r                                                            \r\n\npurportedly  codified in  the  1982 amendment    illustrates  the\r\n\npoint.  There, the Court discerned no denial of equal opportunity\r\n\nwhen a minority group's failure to elect its preferred candidates\r\n\n\"emerges  more as a function of losing elections than of built-in\r\n\nbias\" directed by the establishment majority against the minority\r\n\ngroup.   Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153.   The lesson to be learned is\r                           \r\n\nthat,  even  when  election  returns in  effect  short-circuit  a\r\n\nminority  group's voting  power, the  electoral structure  is not\r\n\nillegal if  the defeat represents  nothing more than  the routine\r\n\noperation of political  factors.  See id.   In other words,  even\r                                                   \r\n\nunder the 1982 amendment, a  lack of electoral success  unrelated\r                                                                           \r\n\nto race  is not  a proxy  for a lack  of opportunity  to succeed.\r                 \r\n\nHence,  VRA   2,  as amended, despite its  focus on results, does\r\n\nnot require  courts to  ignore evidence that  factors other  than\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nrace  are  the  real obstacles  to  the  political  success of  a\r\n\nminority  group.   See Gingles,  478 U.S.  at 101  (O'Connor, J.,\r                                        \r\n\nconcurring) (\"The overall vote dilution  inquiry neither requires\r\n\nnor  permits  an  arbitrary  rule against  consideration  of  all\r\n\nevidence concerning  voting  preferences other  than  statistical\r\n\nevidence of racial voting patterns.\").\r\n\n          We recognize, of course,  that permitting inquiry  into\r\n\nthe  causes  of white  bloc  voting  potentially jeopardizes  the\r\n\nremedial purposes of the VRA in  the sense that it may make proof\r\n\nof vote  dilution more difficult.  Courts  have expressed concern\r\n\non this score,  see, e.g., id.  at 72  (opinion of Brennan,  J.);\r                                        \r\n\nLULAC,  999 F.2d  at  860, and  these  concerns are  not  without\r               \r\n\nfoundation.   Yet, two responses spring to  mind.  First, the VRA\r\n\nis designed to ensure that the electoral process  is fair and the\r\n\nopportunities for access to it are equal.  Forcing courts to turn\r\n\na  blind eye to other  causes of majoritarian  bloc voting serves\r\n\nneither  of  these ends,  but,  rather,  facilitates a  back-door\r\n\napproach  to proportional  representation.   That is  not a  door\r\n\nthrough which Congress  desired courts to pass.  See  42 U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n1973(b)  (stating that nothing in the VRA \"establishes a right to\r\n\nhave members of  a protected  class elected in  numbers equal  to\r\n\ntheir proportion in the population\").\r\n\n          Second,  we   suspect  that  at  bottom   the  skeptics\r\n\nmisapprehend  the  nature  of the  showing  needed  to  support a\r\n\nsection  2 claim.  As  amended, the statute  allows plaintiffs to\r\n\nestablish  a prima  facie case  of vote  dilution by  proving the\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nthree Gingles preconditions.   The second and third preconditions\r                       \r\n\nare designed to assay whether racial cleavages in voting patterns\r\n\nexist  and, if  so, whether  those cleavages  are deep  enough to\r\n\ndefeat minority-preferred candidates time  and again.  If proven,\r\n\nthese preconditions give rise to an inference that racial bias is\r\n\noperating through the medium  of the targeted electoral structure\r\n\nto impair minority political  opportunities.

Instead,  the court  must determine\r\n\nwhether, based  on the  totality of the  circumstances (including\r\n\nthe original inference and  the factual predicate that undergirds\r\n\nit),  the  plaintiffs have  proven  that the  minority  group was\r\n\ndenied  meaningful access to  the political system  on account of\r\n\nrace.   The  burden  of  proof  at all  times  remains  with  the\r\n\nplaintiffs;  defendant's  burden  is  an  entry-level  burden  of\r\n\nproduction.  Thus, once the defendant proffers enough evidence to\r\n\nraise  a  legitimate  question  in regard  to  whether  nonracial\r\n\nfactors adequately explain  racial voting patterns,  the ultimate\r\n\nburden of persuading the factfinder that the voting patterns were\r\n\nengendered by race rests with the plaintiffs.\r\n\n          Despite  the allocation  of the  burden of  proof, this\r\n\nframework imposes a high hurdle for those who seek  to defend the\r\n\nexisting  system  despite  meaningful statistical  evidence  that\r\n\nsuggests  bloc voting along racial  lines.5  See  Jenkins, 4 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The proceedings below illustrate  this point.  The district\r\ncourt  acknowledged   but did not accept   the City's attribution\r\nof the Hispanic community's lack of electoral success to \"factors\r\nother than  the at-large  system itself, including  voter apathy,\r\nunattractive candidates, poor campaign organizations and the like\r\n  all  evidenced by low voter turnout.\"  Holyoke, 880 F. Supp. at\r                                                          \r\n926.    The  court  seemingly  rejected  the  City's  alternative\r\nexplanations  as a  matter of  fact.   See id.  (concluding that,\r                                                        \r\nbased on the overall evidence,  an Hispanic candidate, \"no matter\r\nhow  attractive and no matter  how effective at  bringing out the\r\nHispanic vote, [would not have had] a fair opportunity to win any\r\nat-large election in  Holyoke during this period\").   Having used\r\nthis illustration, we hasten to add that, on remand, the court is\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nat 1135.  We predict that cases will be rare  in which plaintiffs\r\n\nestablish the Gingles preconditions yet fail on a section 2 claim\r                               \r\n\nbecause other  facts undermine the  original inference.   In this\r\n\nregard,  we emphasize  that establishing  vote dilution  does not\r\n\nrequire  the plaintiffs  affirmatively  to disprove  every  other\r\n\npossible  explanation  for racially  polarized  voting.   Rather,\r\n\nplaintiffs   must   simply   prove  that   the   three  threshold\r\n\npreconditions (alone or  in combination with the totality  of the\r\n\ncircumstances)  are   strong  enough   in  a  given   case  that,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  the countervailing  evidence of  other causative\r\n\nagents mustered  by the  defendant, the  record sustains  a claim\r\n\nthat racial politics   specifically, the interaction of  race and\r\n\nthe electoral system    have resulted in significantly diminished\r\n\nopportunities for minority participation in elective government.\r\n\nIV.  THE ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\r          IV.  THE ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\r\n\n          Having cemented  into place  the general  framework for\r\n\nevaluating  vote  dilution claims,  we  shine  the  light of  our\r\n\ngleaned understanding  on the  City's objections to  the decision\r\n\nbelow.  We divide our discussion into four segments.\r\n\n                     A.  The Analytic Model.\r                               A.  The Analytic Model.\r                                                     \r\n\n          In  this case,  the  district  court  analyzed  fifteen\r\n\ndifferent  races in six different  election years spanning a ten-\r\n\nyear period from  1983 through 1993.  Taking  this evidence as an\r\n\nundifferentiated  whole, the  court found  a pattern  of racially\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nfree to  revisit the evidence  and reconsider  all its  findings,\r\nincluding those that touch upon other possible causes of racially\r\npolarized voting.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\npolarized voting sufficient to support the plaintiffs' prayer for\r\n\nrelief.  The City assigns error, positing that racially polarized\r\n\nvoting  cannot be deduced from an overview which blends data from\r\n\na   series  of   separate  elections,   some  suspect   and  some\r\n\nunexceptionable.   The City's  point is  that only  evidence from\r\n\n\"legally  significant\"  elections  can  be relevant  to,  or  can\r\n\nunderbrace, a finding that VRA   2 has been abridged.  Warming to\r\n\nthis  theme,  the City  asserts that  each  of the  three Gingles\r                                                                           \r\n\npreconditions  must  be shown  to  exist  vis-a-vis a  particular\r                                                             \r\n\nelection before a court may mull what transpired at that election\r\n\nas a link in the evidentiary chain  that leads to a determination\r\n\nof  vote  dilution.   If this  approach  were adopted,  the court\r\n\nbelow, in  considering whether  the plaintiffs had  established a\r\n\npattern of racially polarized  voting over the years,   could not\r\n\nhave relied upon evidence drawn from any discrete election unless\r\n\nthe plaintiffs first  proved a violation of the VRA  in regard to\r\n\nthat election.6  We reject the City's approach.\r\n\n          In   this  enlightened  day   and  age,  bigots  rarely\r\n\nadvertise an intention to engage in race-conscious politics.  Not\r\n\nsurprisingly, therefore, racially polarized  voting tends to be a\r\n\nsilent,  shadowy thief  of  the minority's  rights.   Where  such\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6To give  concrete examples,  Holyoke contends that  in 1983\r\nHispanics  did not  constitute  a sufficiently  compact group  to\r\nsatisfy  the  first  Gingles  precondition,  thus  rendering  any\r                                      \r\nevidence of  white bloc voting  in that year  legally irrelevant.\r\nIn the same vein, the City insists that the district court should\r\nhave  ignored  evidence  of  racially  polarized  voting  in  any\r\nelections  won by minority  candidates or in  which Hispanics did\r\nnot sufficiently cohere.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nactivity is  detected at all, the process  of detection typically\r\n\ninvolves  resort to  a multifaceted  array of  evidence including\r\n\ndemographics,   election   results,  voting   patterns,  campaign\r\n\nconduct,  and the  like.   Usually, such  evidence is  not neatly\r\n\npackaged  but  must  be pieced  together  bit  by  bit from  data\r\n\naccumulated  in a series of elections.   See Gingles, 478 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n57; Jenkins,  4 F.3d at 1119;  Gomez v.

The requirement  of \"legal significance\" is\r\n\nnot  a barometer for deciding what evidence of racially polarized\r\n\nvoting may  be considered;  rather, it  is the  benchmark against\r\n\nwhich all  the evidence,  taken in  sum, must  be measured.   And\r\n\nalthough  weaknesses  in  plot  lines  siphoned  from  individual\r\n\nelections  may  well imperil  an  overall  conclusion of  legally\r\n\nsignificant racially  polarized voting   the  whole is frequently\r\n\nnot greater  than the sum of  the parts   such  weaknesses do not\r\n\nrender evidence  from those  elections inadmissible.   It follows\r\n\nthat reliance on such evidence does not necessarily invalidate an\r\n\noverall  conclusion  that unlawful  vote  dilution  exists.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nGingles, 478 U.S.  at 57  (explaining that \"in  a district  where\r                 \r\n\nelections  are  shown usually  to  be  polarized, the  fact  that\r\n\nracially  polarized voting  is  not  present  in  one  or  a  few\r\n\nindividual  elections does not  necessarily negate the conclusion\r\n\nthat the district experiences legally significant bloc voting\").\r\n\n          This paradigm  is fully consistent with  the reality of\r\n\nevents.  One swallow does not a summer make, and the results of a\r\n\nsingle  election  are  unlikely,   without  more,  to  prove  the\r\n\nexistence or  nonexistence of  embedded racial cleavages.   Thus,\r\n\nrace-conscious  politics (or  its absence,  for that  matter) can\r\n\nmore  readily be  seen by  producing a  documentary that  spans a\r\n\nseries  of elections  than by  taking an  isolated snapshot  of a\r\n\nsingle election.   After all, to be legally significant, racially\r\n\npolarized  voting in a specific community must be such that, over\r\n\na period of years,  whites vote sufficiently as a  bloc to defeat\r\n\nminority  candidates most of the time.  See  id. at 56.  In order\r                                                          \r\n\nreliably  to tell  whether  racial groups  do  (or do  not)  band\r\n\ntogether  behind  particular   candidates  with  regularity,  all\r\n\nelections  in  the   relevant  time  frame   (or,  at  least,   a\r\n\nrepresentative sampling of them) must be studied   not just those\r\n\nelections  that, taken  in  isolation, reveal  the cicatrices  of\r\n\nracially polarized voting.\r\n\n          On this basis, we reject the City's contention that the\r\n\nfailure to prove any one Gingles precondition in any one election\r                                          \r\n\neliminates  that  election  from  judicial  consideration.

Currently,  the  Hispanic community  effectively\r\n\ncontrols  two of the fifteen city council  seats (Wards 1 and 2).\r\n\nIn  addition, Hispanics constitute  about 28%  of the  voting age\r\n\npopulation  in Ward 4.  Based on these population statistics, the\r\n\nCity strives to  persuade us that  the plaintiffs cannot  satisfy\r\n\nthe  Gingles preconditions  because  Hispanics, as  a group,  are\r                      \r\n\ninsufficiently  compact to  constitute  the majority  in a  third\r\n\nward.  We are unconvinced for two reasons.\r\n\n          First, the City failed to make this claim in its brief,\r\n\nasserting it for  the first time at  oral argument.   Thinking on\r\n\none's feet is  a useful tool  of appellate  advocacy only if  the\r\n\nthinker has a suitable foothold in the record.  Here, the thought\r\n\nwas too little  too late.  See United States  v. Gertner, 65 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n963, 971 n.7 (1st  Cir. 1995) (refusing to entertain  an argument\r\n\nnot raised in the government's appellate brief); see also Fed. R.\r                                                                   \r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nApp. P. 28(a).\r\n\n          In all events, the  City's spur-of-the-moment retort is\r\n\nfounded  on a  faulty  premise.   It  assumes that  the  relevant\r\n\nbenchmarks   for  matching  the   Hispanic  population   and  its\r\n\nopportunity for access are the  seven single-member wards.   This\r\n\nassumption  is faulty because the litigation challenges Holyoke's\r\n\nelectoral system  as a whole, and, to the extent the challenge is\r\n\nscissile, its cynosure is not the wards but the system's at-large\r\n\ncomponent    a component  that allegedly dilutes  the plaintiffs'\r\n\nopportunity  for  full   political  participation  in   municipal\r\n\naffairs.   Refined  to bare  essence, the  plaintiffs' theory  is\r\n\nthat, because  of the combined  impact of the  at-large electoral\r\n\nstructure and an incipient  pattern of racially polarized voting,\r\n\nHispanics can only hope to elect candidates to two of the fifteen\r\n\ncity council seats  (i.e., about  14% of the  seats) even  though\r\n\nthey  comprise at least 22% of Holyoke's total population.  Thus,\r\n\nthe City's emphasis on the seven wards misses the point.\r\n\n          This does not  mean that the wards  are an irrelevancy.\r\n\nA  successful vote  dilution  challenge \"must  find a  reasonable\r\n\nalternative practice as a benchmark  against which to measure the\r\n\nexisting voting practice.\"  Holder v. Hall, 114 S. Ct. 2581, 2585\r                                                    \r\n\n(1994).  In  that sense, the single-member districts are relevant\r\n\nto  an assessment of the  system's at-large component.   While it\r\n\nmay be theoretically possible  to analogize the plaintiffs' claim\r\n\nto  a challenge addressed to a multimember at-large district   in\r\n\nwhich case the court would have to compare Hispanic opportunities\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nto elect candidates to one of the eight undifferentiated at-large\r\n\nseats  to the  potential opportunities  that might  exist if  the\r\n\nmultimember district were  divided into eight contiguous  single-\r\n\nmember  districts,   see,  e.g.,  id.  at   2589  (O'Connor,  J.,\r                                               \r\n\nconcurring) (\"In a challenge to a multimember at-large system . .\r\n\n. a  court may compare  it to a system  of multiple single-member\r\n\ndistricts.\")   the  analogy cannot  be carried  past its  logical\r\n\nlimits.   Here,  the  analogy  would  be  imperfect  because  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' challenge is addressed  to Holyoke's electoral system\r\n\nas a whole.  Accordingly, the district court had an obligation to\r\n\nconsider  whether that system   not just its at-large component  \r\n\nprovides minorities with an equal opportunity to elect candidates\r\n\nof their choice.   See Baird, 976  F.2d at 360; NAACP  v. City of\r                                                                           \r\n\nColumbia, 850 F.

And since  we  find no  clear error  in the  court's\r\n\nconclusion  that,  under  its  projected  set  of  circumstances,\r\n\nHispanics  would constitute a majority  of the votes  in at least\r\n\nthree  of fifteen reconstituted  wards, we  cannot set  aside its\r\n\nfinding that Hispanics are a sufficiently compact group.\r\n\n                      C.

In\r\n\nthe City's view, low turnout betokens  voter apathy and precludes\r\n\na   finding  that  particular   candidates  received  significant\r\n\nminority support (as required to show minority political cohesion\r\n\nunder  Gingles,  478 U.S.  at 56).    The plaintiffs  concede the\r                        \r\n\nanemic turnout but argue  that it is irrelevant to  the political\r\n\ncohesion  inquiry.   They  take the  position that  courts should\r\n\nframe answers to such inquiries after considering the behavior of\r\n\nthose minority  voters  who actually  opt to  participate in  the\r\n\nelectoral process, and not  gaze beyond that group (whatever  its\r\n\nsize) to count the number that sit on the sidelines.\r\n\n          We  walk a middle path.   A principal  objective of the\r\n\nVRA  is  to  provide a  level  playing  field  on which  minority\r\n\ncandidates    like all candidates    will be exposed only  to the\r\n\nroutine  vicissitudes of  the electoral  process, not  to special\r\n\nimpediments  arising out  of  the intersection  of  race and  the\r\n\nelectoral system.  So, if a defeat at the polls (or even a string\r\n\nof defeats) is caused by,  say, a candidate's lack of merit  or a\r\n\ncampaign's lack of focus, the Voting Rights Act is not infringed.\r\n\nSee  Whitfield v.  Democratic Party  of State  of Ark.,  890 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1423,  1430 (8th Cir. 1989) (explaining that a \"causal connection\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nbetween  the challenged  practice .  . .  and the  diluted voting\r\n\npower  of the minority must be established\").   By like token, if\r\n\nthe defeat of minority candidates occurs because the votes of the\r\n\nmembers  of the  minority community  are scattered  due  to their\r\n\ndiverse  interests,  then  the  requisite  causal  connection  is\r\n\nlacking.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51.  Under such circumstances,\r                               \r\n\nthe interaction of race  with the electoral system  cannot justly\r\n\nbe blamed for a minority group's lack of success at the polls.\r\n\n          In the case of low  voter turnout, the electoral system\r\n\nmay not always be so easily absolved.  For one thing, even with a\r\n\nmodest  turnout,  the  actual  votes cast  may  be  probative  of\r\n\nminority cohesion if a sufficiently strong pattern emerges.  See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,  United States v.

For another thing,  low voter turnout in\r\n\nthe minority community sometimes  may result from the interaction\r\n\nof the electoral system with the  effects of past discrimination,\r\n\nwhich   together  operate  to   discourage  meaningful  electoral\r\n\nparticipation.    In  such  instances,  low  turnout  itself  may\r\n\nactually  be probative of vote dilution.  See, e.g., Gingles, 478\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at  69 (opinion of Brennan, J.); see also Gomez, 863 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n1416  n.4  (suggesting  that   voter  apathy  traceable  to  past\r\n\ndiscrimination is  \"evidence of minority voters'  lack of ability\r                                                                           \r\n\nto participate effectively in the political process\"); Kirksey v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBoard  of   Supervisors,  554  F.2d  139,  145  n.13  (5th  Cir.)\r                                 \r\n\n(observing that failure to  register may be a residual  effect of\r\n\nprevious lack of access or feelings of futility in light of white\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nbloc  voting),  cert.  denied,  434  U.S.  968  (1977);  see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nBuckanaga v.

When low turnout results from the very problems that\r\n\nthe  Voting Rights  Act is  intended to  ameliorate, it  would be\r\n\nmindless for courts to ignore  the evidence of minority  cohesion\r\n\nthat can be culled from the actual ballot tallies.\r\n\n          This  is not to say,  as the plaintiffs  would have it,\r\n\neither  that low voter turnout is altogether irrelevant to a vote\r\n\ndilution  inquiry, or  that  courts should  look  only to  actual\r\n\nvoting results.   The cause of poor turnout is often difficult to\r\n\ndetect.  If minority  voters have not made reasonable  efforts to\r\n\norganize and  participate in the electoral  system, courts cannot\r\n\naccurately gauge  the  effects  of the  system  on  the  minority\r\n\ngroup's political  aspirations.   See  City of  Columbia, 850  F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp.  at 415-16.  Furthermore,  low turnout sometimes  may be an\r\n\nindicium of  ebbing community  support for a  particular minority\r\n\ncandidate.   See id. at  418-19.  Hence, evidence  of this nature\r                              \r\n\nmay     or may  not     be probative  on  the  issue of  minority\r\n\ncohesion.\r\n\n          In  the final  analysis,  the question  of whether  low\r\n\nminority voter turnout helps  or hurts a claim of  vote dilution,\r\n\nand the related question  of whether actual votes cast  provide a\r\n\nsufficient  (or better)  measure of  minority political  cohesion\r\n\nwithout  regard   to  turnout,  both  depend  on  the  facts  and\r\n\ncircumstances  of  the  particular  case.   Consequently,  courts\r\n\ncannot resort to the  easy visibility of a bright-line  rule.  On\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nthis delicate, fact-sensitive issue, only a case-by-case approach\r\n\nsatisfactorily permits courts to peel away the layers and conduct\r\n\nthe functional vote dilution inquiry that the VRA requires.\r\n\n          In the case at hand, the district court made reasonably\r\n\ndetailed  findings concerning the  relationship between depressed\r\n\nturnout  among  Hispanics   and  the  structural   attributes  of\r\n\nHolyoke's electoral system.   The court determined that  the City\r\n\nimposed    or neglected  to remove    a  variety of  obstacles to\r\n\nHispanic  political participation.   The  court mentioned,  inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, the City's niggardly deployment of bilingual registrars and\r              \r\n\npoll  workers,  its  removal  from voter  registration  rolls  of\r\n\nHispanics who did not fill out English-language census forms, and\r\n\nits  failure to print ballot information posters in Spanish.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHolyoke, 880 F. Supp. at  925.  In the court's estimation,  these\r                 \r\n\ndeficiencies,  along  with downtrodden  socioeconomic conditions,\r\n\naccounted for the low turnout among Hispanic voters.  Id.  And to\r                                                                   \r\n\ncap  matters, the  court found  that  the actual  turnout, though\r\n\nsmall, was adequate to reflect political cohesion in the Hispanic\r\n\ncommunity.  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          We believe that  these findings are supportable.   In a\r\n\nvote dilution case characterized by meager turnout among minority\r\n\nvoters,  plaintiffs  need not  show that  the  sole cause  of low\r\n\nnumbers  is  the  interaction  between racial  divisions  in  the\r\n\ncommunity and  identifiable elements of the electoral system.  It\r\n\nis sufficient if  the plaintiffs  persuade the  trial court  that\r\n\nconsiderations  implicating  race  contributed  substantially  to\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nrepressing  minority participation.   In  light of  the aggregate\r\n\nfacts  and  circumstances,  coupled  with  the  district  court's\r\n\nexplicit findings, we believe  that the plaintiffs satisfied this\r\n\nburden here.  Thus, the evidence of low Hispanic turnout does not\r\n\nundercut  the court's  ultimate  conclusion that  the  plaintiffs\r\n\nestablished minority political cohesion.7\r\n\n                  D.

In condoning the necessary appraisal, we are mindful that\r\n\na district judge  sitting without  a jury cannot  paint with  too\r\n\nbroad a brush.  Rule 52(a) requires the judge to make findings of\r\n\nfact and  conclusions of  law that  are sufficiently detailed  to\r\n\npermit  a reviewing court to  ascertain the factual  core of, and\r\n\nthe legal foundation for, the rulings below.

Vote dilution claims  are often marked  by a significant\r\n\ndegree of complexity.

Despite   the  district  judge's   obvious\r\n\ninvestment of time and  effort in the proceedings below,  and his\r\n\nthoughtful analysis  of difficult  legal issues, the  findings of\r\n\nfact  in  the  instant  case  fail  to  satisfy  these  demanding\r\n\ncriteria.\r\n\n          In  any  claim  brought  under  VRA     2,  the Gingles\r                                                                           \r\n\npreconditions are central to the  plaintiffs' success.  Here, the\r\n\ntrial court sounded an  uncertain trumpet in respect to  both the\r\n\nsecond and third  preconditions.  This  uncertainty stems from  a\r\n\nlack of congruence between  the court's subsidiary findings anent\r\n\nthe particular elections it  studied and its overall findings  of\r\n\nminority cohesion and white  bloc voting in Holyoke.   We explain\r\n\nbriefly.\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          The  lower court  analyzed fifteen  elections in  which\r\n\nHispanic  candidates ran for office.8   Of these,  only four were\r\n\nat-large elections; the rest were ward elections for  either city\r\n\ncouncil  or school committee seats.   In four  of the eleven ward\r\n\nelections, Hispanic  candidates ran unopposed.   These  elections\r\n\nreveal  little  about  either  minority cohesion  or  white  bloc\r\n\nvoting.9   The  district  court found  neither minority  cohesion\r\n\nbehind Hispanic candidates nor racially polarized voting in seven\r\n\nof the eleven elections in  which Hispanic candidates ran against\r\n\nnon-Hispanic opponents.  The court found minority cohesion in the\r\n\nfour remaining elections, and found white bloc voting only in the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Although the  VRA does not require for a successful section\r\n2 showing  that minority-preferred  candidates be members  of the\r\nminority  group, see Clarke v.

But  evidence exhumed from \"white\r                \r\nonly\" elections may  still be relevant in  assessing the totality\r\nof  the circumstances in a  vote dilution case,  especially if it\r\ntends  to rebut  the evidence  of cohesion  or white  bloc voting\r\nextracted from \"mixed\" elections.  See Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1128.\r                                                        \r\n\n     9To be sure,  the district court implied  that blank ballots\r\ncast in three  of these four elections (the  1989 and 1993 school\r\ncommittee elections  in Ward 2, and the 1993 city council race in\r\nthe same ward) evinced  white bloc voting.   See Holyoke, 880  F.\r                                                                  \r\nSupp. at 923-24.  But the  record furnishes no foundation for the\r\nimplication that white  voters cast  blank ballots  as a  protest\r\nagainst unopposed Hispanic candidates.  In 1989, for example, the\r\nhighest  percentage of blank ballots was recorded in the precinct\r\nthat had the highest percentage of Hispanic voters.\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nthree that occurred  before 1988.10   See Holyoke,  880 F.

The finding also seems to contradict\r\n\nthe district  court's conclusion that the  plaintiffs established\r\n\nthe second and  third Gingles  preconditions.  Of  course, it  is\r                                       \r\n\npossible that  the apparent contradiction can  be explained away:\r\n\nwe recognize  that determining whether racial  bloc voting exists\r\n\nis  not merely an arithmetic exercise that consists of totting up\r\n\ncolumns  of  numbers, and  nothing more.    To the  contrary, the\r\n\ndistrict court should not confine itself to raw numbers, but must\r\n\nmake a practical,  commonsense assay  of all the  evidence.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMagnolia Bar Ass'n, Inc. v.

But  allowing  for  the  possibility  of  a  sophisticated\r\n\nevaluative judgment does  not dissipate the need  to explain that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10The district court also  found that the minority community\r\nhad cohered behind a non-Hispanic candidate, Elaine Pluta, in her\r\nsuccessful 1991 bid for an at-large seat on the city council.  In\r\nfact, Pluta  ranked ahead  of  a Hispanic  candidate on  Hispanic\r\nvoters' ballots.   However, she received strong support from non-\r\nHispanic voters  as well; that  segment of the  electorate ranked\r\nher  fifth  (out of  sixteen) among  at-large candidates.   Thus,\r\nwhile there  may have been  minority cohesion  behind Pluta,  the\r\nrecord  reflects no  evidence of  white  bloc voting  against the\r\ncandidate that minority voters preferred.\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          The district court, forced  to juggle several issues at\r\n\nonce, offered no explanation of this seeming contradiction.   The\r\n\ncourt  not only glossed over  the raw numbers  but also failed to\r\n\nclarify why  evidence reflecting racially polarized  voting in at\r\n\nmost  three or four elections (out of eleven) justified a finding\r\n\nof vote dilution.  While we are unprepared to say,  here and now,\r\n\nthat such  a finding is incorrect  as a matter of  law, we cannot\r\n\naccept it without a better  articulated rationale.  Thus, because\r\n\nwe are unable to follow the district judge's thought processes in\r\n\nthis regard, we must return  the case to him for a  more detailed\r\n\nexplication of his  reasoning.  See Houston, 56  F.3d at 612-13 &amp;\r                                                     \r\n\nn.8  (remanding  because the  \"district  court  findings are  too\r\n\ngeneral  to allow us  to conduct  our appellate  review\") (citing\r\n\ncases);  Cousin, 46  F.3d at  575 (remanding because  the \"record\r                         \r\n\nfails to provide  the bases for  the district court  reasoning\");\r\n\nVelasquez,  725 F.2d at 1021 (similar); cf.

In  this\r\n\nsituation, however, the record does not lend itself to curing the\r\n\nomissions in this fashion.\r\n\n          We  are fortified in this  cautious approach by what we\r\n\nenvision as the distinct possibility that the  district court may\r\n\nhave   undervalued  the  import  of  Holyoke's  rapidly  changing\r\n\npolitical environment.  During the decade  analyzed by the court,\r\n\n1983 to 1993, the  embryonic Hispanic community grew to maturity,\r\n\ngathering both  numbers and  political muscle.   Hispanic leaders\r\n\nmounted a \"successful  community-based voter registration  drive\"\r\n\nin   the  mid-1980s  and   boosted  voter  turnout  dramatically.\r\n\nHolyoke, 880 F. Supp. at 922.  In 1985, Holyoke voters elected an\r                 \r\n\nHispanic to political office for the first time in Massachusetts'\r\n\nhistory.   See id.  at 921.   Hot  on the  heels  of this  signal\r                            \r\n\nvictory,  the  1987  municipal   elections  witnessed  the  \"most\r\n\nsuccessful  city-wide  campaign  ever   run  by  an  Hispanic  in\r\n\nHolyoke.\"   Id.  at 922.11   Those  elections also  witnessed the\r                         \r\n\nlast contest in which the  district court supportably found white\r\n\nbloc voting.   From that time forward,  Hispanics have maintained\r\n\npolitical  dominance over  two wards  and have  represented those\r\n\nwards on both the school committee and the city council.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 921-24.\r\n\n          This   rise  in  the   Hispanic  community's  political\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11Success is,  of course,  relative; the Hispanic  candidate\r\ncame  close but  nevertheless lost.   While  some might  say that\r\nclose  only counts  in  horseshoes, hand  grenades, and  ballroom\r\ndancing,  we think that progress  of this sort,  even short of an\r\nelectoral win, is significant.\r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\nfortunes  is significant.  The ultimate question in any section 2\r\n\ncase must be posed in the present tense, not the past tense.  The\r\n\ncourt must determine  whether the challenged electoral  structure\r\n\ndeprives a racial minority of equal opportunity to participate in\r\n\nthe political process at  present.  Though past elections  may be\r                                           \r\n\nprobative of  racially polarized voting,  they become less  so as\r\n\nenvironmental  change occurs.    In  particular,  elections  that\r\n\nprovide  insights into past history are less probative than those\r\n\nthat mirror the current  political reality.  See LULAC,  999 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat  891; Meek v.

Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\nat 927, but does not appear to have given it weight in evaluating\r\n\neither the Gingles preconditions or the strength of any inference\r                            \r\n\nto be drawn therefrom.  Under these circumstances, we think it is\r\n\nincumbent upon the court to explain more fully its view that vote\r\n\ndilution persists in spite of improved political conditions.\r\n\nV.  ADDITIONAL MATTERS\r          V.  ADDITIONAL MATTERS\r\n\n          Because remand is required, we take this opportunity to\r\n\ncomment briefly on two other areas of continuing interest.\r\n\n          First,  the  shortcomings  we have  catalogued  in  the\r\n\ndistrict court's findings cloud the relationship between evidence\r\n\nof  racially polarized voting in the ward elections and the trial\r\n\ncourt's conclusion  that the at-large component  of the electoral\r\n\nsystem  unlawfully dilutes the Hispanic  vote.  Though  we do not\r\n\n                                35\r\r\n\nquarrel with  the court's decision to consider  evidence from the\r\n\nward elections  in analyzing racial polarization  in the at-large\r\n\nelections    as we have  indicated supra, a  court has a  duty to\r                                                  \r\n\nponder  all  available  evidence  concerning  racially  polarized\r\n\nvoting that  promises to cast light  on the factors at  work in a\r\n\nparticular  electoral scheme,  see, e.g.,  Citizens for  a Better\r                                                                           \r\n\nGretna  v.

CONCLUSION\r          VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          To recapitulate, the district court's opinion is  well-\r\n\nconsidered  and  in many  respects  deftly  navigates the  marshy\r\n\nterrain  of voting  rights jurisprudence.   Yet,  at the  risk of\r\n\nseeming unappreciative of a job well done, we believe the court's\r\n\nopinion lacks essential clarity in its factual findings.  For one\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12Factoring influence districts into the calculus also helps\r\nease  the  tension  between  Congress's  desire  to  permit  vote\r\ndilution claims to  be brought under section 2 and  its intent to\r\navoid  creating  a right  to  proportional  representation.   See\r                                                                           \r\nGingles, 478  U.S. at  84 (O'Connor, J.,  concurring) (discussing\r                 \r\n\"inherent  tension between what Congress wished to do and what it\r\nwished to avoid\").\r\n\n     13It is important to  realize that influence districts serve\r\nthese goals only  to the  extent that they  reflect a  meaningful\r\nopportunity for  minority voters to participate  in the political\r\nprocess.   Consequently,  before  the existence  of an  influence\r\ndistrict is given significant weight in the balance, the evidence\r\nmust reveal that  minority voters  in the district  have in  fact\r\njoined  with  other  voters  to elect  representatives  of  their\r\nchoice.     Moreover,   the   record  must   show  that   elected\r\nrepresentatives from such a district serve, at least in part, the\r\ninterests of the minority community and vie for its support.\r\n\n                                39\r\r\n\nthing,  the court  neither  acknowledges  nor discusses  critical\r\n\nevidence that  appears to  contradict its ultimate  conclusion of\r\n\nvote  dilution.  For another thing,  it never adequately explains\r\n\nthe relevance of some evidence upon which it relies quite heavily\r\n\nto  support  this  conclusion.    And,  finally,   it  omits  any\r\n\nmeaningful  mention  of  potentially  salient  factors  (such  as\r\n\ninfluence districts).  Rather than guess at the missing elements,\r\n\nwe think that the course of prudence is to vacate and remand.\r\n\n          We  leave the procedure to be followed on remand to the\r\n\nlower court's informed discretion,  without endeavoring to set an\r\n\nouter limit on its range  of options.  See Lussier v.  Runyon, 50\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 1103, 1115  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116  S. Ct. 69 (1995).\r                                                   \r\n\nAt  a  minimum,  the court  must  discuss  the  evidence we  have\r\n\nidentified as  troubling (or as possibly  overlooked) and explain\r\n\nthe  relationship of this evidence to the issue of vote dilution.\r\n\nThe court need not stop there, however; it is free  to reopen the\r\n\nrecord, to take additional evidence, and/or to reconsider all (or\r\n\nany part) of its findings  in light of the comments  contained in\r\n\nthis  opinion.   To  this  end,  while  we  neither  require  nor\r\n\nanticipate an entirely new trial, the court in its discretion may\r\n\npermit  the  parties  to  supplement  the  existing  record  with\r\n\nadditional facts (including, but not limited to, evidence gleaned\r\n\nfrom the new round of municipal elections that have recently been\r\n\ncompleted).   See Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal\r                                                                           \r\n\nPractice and Procedure   2577 (2d ed. 1995).\r                                \r\n\n          We  are mindful that, in addition to the assignments of\r\n\n                                40\r\r\n\nerror that we have discussed, the City strenuously objects to the\r\n\nremedy fashioned  by the  court below.   We  do not address  this\r\n\nobjection  today.     If   the  district  court,   after  further\r\n\nconsideration,  again  finds that  Holyoke's  electoral structure\r\n\nviolates  section  2 of  the VRA    and  we  do not  intimate any\r\n\nexpectancy  in  this regard    we  anticipate  that it  will then\r\n\nrevisit the question of  how best to mold an  appropriate remedy.\r\n\nWithal   and, perhaps, at the  expense of remarking the obvious  \r\n\nwe offer  two brief bits of general  guidance that may be helpful\r\n\nif this contingency materializes.\r\n\n          First, the court  must be sure to  analyze the question\r\n\nof remedy in  light of any new findings that  it makes on remand.\r\n\nSecond, the  court now has    and should take advantage  of   the\r\n\nluxury of time.  The court originally attempted to craft a remedy\r\n\nin time for the 1995 municipal elections.  That cycle has turned,\r\n\nand  the  next is  well  in the  future.   Given  this  window of\r\n\nopportunity,  the option of choice (assuming that the court finds\r\n\na section 2  transgression) is  to give the  defendant the  first\r\n\nchance to assemble a remedial plan.  We think it is a fundamental\r\n\ntenet of voting rights law that, time permitting, a federal court\r\n\nshould  defer in  the first  instance to  an affected  state's or\r\n\ncity's choice among  legally permissible remedies.   See Cane  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nWorcester County, 35 F.3d 921, 927 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied,\r                                                                          \r\n\n115 S.

It arises against the backdrop of the biennial elections that are held for city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The plaintiffs, two nonprofit organizations with ties to the Hispanic community and eight voters of Hispanic descent, complain that the electoral structure violates section 2 of the VRA by denying Hispanics equal opportunity to \"participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973(b).  The district court found merit in the plaintiffs' complaint with regard to councilmanic elections and granted relief.  See Vecinos De Barrio Uno v. City of Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. 911 (D.Mass.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After careful consideration of a bulky record, we are unable to square the lower court's factual findings with its ultimate conclusion of vote dilution.  Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the background, reserving a more exegetic treatment of the facts pending our discussion of specific issues.  We refer those readers who yearn for an immediate rush of details to the district court's informative opinion.  See id. at 917-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1963, the Holyoke city council has been composed of fifteen members, eight elected at large and seven elected by ward.  Candidates run without party labels for two-year terms.  Each voter is entitled to cast a ballot for a candidate in his or her ward, and to vote for up to eight at-large candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hispanic community in Holyoke has grown dramatically over the past two decades.  By 1990, persons of Hispanic origin accounted for 31.06% of the total population (compared to 13.8% in 1980).  Under the current districting scheme--the ward lines were last redrawn in 1992--Hispanic voters comprise a clear majority in two wards and account for nearly one-third of the population in a third ward.  Yet, while Hispanic-preferred city council candidates have prevailed in the two \"Hispanic majority\" wards, no person of Hispanic descent ever has been elected to an at-large seat.  This discrepancy crystallizes into the nub of the plaintiffs' case:  their vote dilution claim is that, while Hispanics now constitute 21.89% of Holyoke's voting age population, the electoral structure limits the Hispanic community's ability to elect the candidates its members prefer to only 14% of the available city council seats (two of fifteen).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the Hispanic vote had been impermissibly diluted.  See id. at 925-27.   To remedy the perceived inequity, the court by separate order left the ward lines and representation intact, but cut back the number of at-large seats from eight to two (thus shrinking the council from fifteen to nine members, and making its electoral structure congruent with that of the school committee).  See Vecinos de Barrio Uno v. City of Holyoke, 882 F.Supp. 9, 10 (D.Mass.1995) (Holyoke II ).   The court reasoned that, under the revised format, Hispanics probably would continue to control two of the ward seats, and that decreasing the size of the council would boost Hispanics' percentage representation to a level that would compare favorably with their percentage of the voting age population as a whole.  See id. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, striving to put its remedial order in place in time for the November 1995 municipal election cycle, see id. at 13, entered the order under pressure of time.  The city appealed and simultaneously moved for a stay.  By an unpublished order, we expedited the appeal and granted the stay.  Hence, the November 1995 elections were held under the preexisting scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bedrock on which the district court's opinion rests is its conclusion that the at-large component of the electoral structure unlawfully dilutes the Hispanic community's voting power.  As a general matter, a finding of vote dilution made after a bench trial is a finding of fact subject to review under the \"clearly erroneous\" rubric.  See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 78-79, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 2780-81, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986);  Houston v. Lafayette County, 56 F.3d 606, 610 (5th Cir.1995);  Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol. Sch. Dist.

This means that a reviewing court ought not to disturb such a finding \"unless, on the whole of the record, [the court] form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the clear error standard is formidable, it is not a juggernaut that crushes everything in its path.  One important qualification is that the jurisprudence of clear error \"does not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct errors of law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of law and fact, or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of law.\"  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 106, 106 S.Ct. at 2795 (quoting Bose Corp. v.

Each of these showings must be specific to the electoral unit that is under fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two Gingles preconditions look to whether, putting the challenged practice, procedure, or structure to one side, minority voters within a given constituency have the potential to elect representatives of their choice.  See Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 39-41, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 1084, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993);  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50 n. 17, 106 S.Ct. at 2766 n. 17.   If, for example, minority voters in an at-large system are so widely dispersed that they could not elect preferred candidates under some reasonable alternative scheme, then the \"at-large system cannot be responsible for that group's inability to elect its candidates.\"  Solomon v. Liberty County, 899 F.2d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1023, 111 S.Ct. 670, 112 L.Ed.2d 663 (1991).  Similarly, unless the minority group is politically cohesive, \"it cannot be said that the selection of a [particular] electoral structure thwarts distinctive minority group interests.\"  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. at 2766.   The third Gingles precondition--which embodies a showing that the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it, in the ordinary course, to trounce minority-preferred candidates most of the time, see Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 156, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 1157, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993)--addresses whether the challenged practice, procedure, or structure is the cause of the minority group's inability to mobilize its potential voting power and elect its preferred candidates.  See De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2657;  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. at 2766-67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof of all three preconditions creates an inference that members of the minority are in fact harmed by the challenged electoral practice, procedure, or structure.  However, the inference is rebuttable.  As a result, establishing the three Gingles preconditions is necessary, but not always in itself sufficient, to ensure success on a section 2 claim.  That is to say, because the inference of vote dilution can be rebutted by the force of other evidence, proof of the three preconditions, without more, will not invariably carry the day.  See De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2657.   Put another way, the critical question in a vote dilution case is whether minority voters have an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process.  While the threshold elements catalogued by the Gingles Court shed considerable light on this inquiry, they do not comprise the only conceivable source of illumination.  Completing the inquiry demands \"comprehensive, not limited, canvassing of relevant facts.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this approach, courts must be careful not to wear blinders.  The judge must sift the evidence produced at trial and gather enough information to paint a true picture of the attendant facts and circumstances.  He or she must then make a realistic appraisal of what the picture discloses.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45, 106 S.Ct. at 2763-64 (advocating achievement of a \"practical evaluation of the past and present reality\" through a \"functional view of the political process\").  Some guidance can be found in a list of factors highlighted in the congressional report that accompanied the 1982 amendment to VRA Sec. 2, see S.Rep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., at 28-29 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206-07, but the judge should not stop there.  Though helpful, the list is not all-encompassing.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45, 106 S.Ct. at 2763;  Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist., 56 F.3d 904, 910 (8th Cir.1995).  Since communities differ, and elections play out differently in different venues at different times, the judge must make a case-specific determination, giving due weight to the idiosyncracies that bear upon the particular situation.  See Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1115.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One road that we believe remains open to a court called upon to examine the totality of the circumstances in a vote dilution case is to mull other factors, apart from racial bias, that may have caused the white bloc voting identified in the third Gingles precondition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  While the Gingles Court split on this question, compare Gingles, 478 U.S. at 63-64, 106 S.Ct. at 2772-73 (opinion of Brennan, J.)  (stating for four justices that the etiology of racially polarized voting is irrelevant under VRA Sec. 2) with id. at 100-02, 106 S.Ct. at 2792-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (stating for four justices that the reasons why white voters reject minority candidates are relevant) and id. at 82-83, 106 S.Ct. at 2783 (White, J., concurring) (rejecting, without explanation, Justice Brennan's view), and controversy has raged since then, see, e.g., Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1513-14 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (holding for two judges, with two judges dissenting, that the existence of racial bias in the community is relevant to a section 2 claim), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1795, 131 L.Ed.2d 723 (1995);  League of United Latin Am.  Citizens, Council No, 4434 [LULAC ] v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 850-63 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc) (reaching similar conclusion, with three judges dissenting), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 878, 127 L.Ed.2d 74 (1994), we are of the view that De Grandy has removed much of the doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when the Gingles preconditions coalesce and thereby create an inference of discrimination, lack of equal electoral opportunity remains the central focus of the inquiry.  Furthermore, that question \"must still be addressed explicitly, and without isolating any other arguably relevant facts from the act of judgment.\"  De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2657.   It seems self-evident that the presence or absence of bias is at least \"arguably relevant\" to the question of whether a minority lacks equal electoral opportunity.  After all, a minority group's prospects for electoral success in a community riven along racial lines differ significantly from its prospects in a more unified community.  We agree with the Fifth Circuit that \"[a] tendency among whites to cast their votes on the basis of race presents a far more durable obstacle to the coalition-building upon which minority electoral success depends than disagreements over ideology.\"  LULAC, 999 F.2d at 858.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, however, sentiments unrelated to race also can be powerful stimuli.  When it can be shown that, in a particular community, voters are moved primarily by causes unrelated to race, it is reasonable to assume that a minority-preferred candidate who embodies these values might equally be able to engender majoritarian (white) support.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 100-01, 106 S.Ct. at 2792-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Evidence that a candidate preferred by the minority group in a particular election was rejected by white voters for reasons other than those which made that candidate the preferred choice of the minority group would seem clearly relevant in answering the question whether bloc voting by white voters will consistently defeat minority candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 100, 106 S.Ct. at 2792.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that when racial antagonism is not the cause of an electoral defeat suffered by a minority candidate, the defeat does not prove a lack of electoral opportunity but a lack of whatever else it takes to be successful in politics (say, failure to support popular programmatic initiatives, or failure to reflect the majority's ideological viewpoints, or failure to appreciate the popularity of an incumbent).  Section 2 does not bridge that gap--nor should it.  See De Grandy, --- U.S. at ---- n. 11, 114 S.Ct. at 2658 n. 11;  see also Baird v. Consolidated City of Indianapolis, 976 F.2d 357, 361 (7th Cir.1992) (explaining that section 2 \"is a balm for racial minorities, not political ones--even though the two often coincide\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2334, 124 L.Ed.2d 246 (1993).  We believe it follows that, after De Grandy, plaintiffs cannot prevail on a VRA Sec. 2 claim if there is significantly probative evidence that whites voted as a bloc for reasons wholly unrelated to racial animus.  We so hold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding draws sustenance from the language of section 2 itself, particularly the statute's prohibition of electoral structures that result in a denial or abridgement of the right to vote \"on account of race or color.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973(a).  Other courts have found this language determinative of the question, see, e.g., Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1515-17;  LULAC, 999 F.2d at 850, especially when coupled with legislative history indicating that an electoral scheme violates VRA Sec. 2 only when it \"interacts with racial bias in the community and allows that bias to dilute the voting strength of the minority group.\"  Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1520 (commenting upon legislative history).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those--including the present plaintiffs--who favor a more single-minded interpretation of section 2 marshal a regiment of counterarguments. Their most serious objection questions the compatibility of our holding with Congress's action in amending section 2 to scrap the \"intent\" test imposed by City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 62, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 1497, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), and to insert in its place the \"results\" test earlier adumbrated in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 765-66, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 2339-40, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), and Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 143, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1868, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971).  This substitution permits plaintiffs to show vote dilution by proving that electoral structures \"result[ ] in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color,\" 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973(a), and, concomitantly, relieves them of the burden of proving that the structures were set in place to advance a racially discrimination purpose.  Against this mise-en-scene, some have equated Congress's adoption of the \"results\" test with an intention to foreclose any inquiry whatever into the reasons why minority groups lack opportunities for electoral participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that the 1982 amendment lends itself to this restrictive conclusion.  The now-discarded \"intent\" test specifically required plaintiffs to prove that government created or maintained the challenged electoral structure with a discriminatory purpose, actually intending that a structure would disadvantage minority voters.  See Mobile, 446 U.S. at 62-63, 100 S.Ct. at 1497-98.   In enacting the amendment, Congress shifted the law's focus:  plaintiffs no longer have to prove discriminatory intent but instead have to carry the burden of proving that the challenged electoral structure results in a denial of equal opportunity on account of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Properly conceived, the results test protects racial minorities against a stacked deck but does not guarantee that they will be dealt a winning hand.  Whitcomb--an opinion purportedly codified in the 1982 amendment--illustrates the point.  There, the Court discerned no denial of equal opportunity when a minority group's failure to elect its preferred candidates \"emerges more as a function of losing elections than of built-in bias\" directed by the establishment majority against the minority group.  Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153, 91 S.Ct. at 1874.   The lesson to be learned is that, even when election returns in effect short-circuit a minority group's voting power, the electoral structure is not illegal if the defeat represents nothing more than the routine operation of political factors.  See id.   In other words, even under the 1982 amendment, a lack of electoral success unrelated to race is not a proxy for a lack of opportunity to succeed.  Hence, VRA Sec. 2, as amended, despite its focus on results, does not require courts to ignore evidence that factors other than race are the real obstacles to the political success of a minority group.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 101, 106 S.Ct. at 2792-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"The overall vote dilution inquiry neither requires nor permits an arbitrary rule against consideration of all evidence concerning voting preferences other than statistical evidence of racial voting patterns.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, of course, that permitting inquiry into the causes of white bloc voting potentially jeopardizes the remedial purposes of the VRA in the sense that it may make proof of vote dilution more difficult.  Courts have expressed concern on this score, see, e.g., id. at 72, 106 S.Ct. at 2777-78 (opinion of Brennan, J.);  LULAC, 999 F.2d at 860, and these concerns are not without foundation.  Yet, two responses spring to mind.  First, the VRA is designed to ensure that the electoral process is fair and the opportunities for access to it are equal.  Forcing courts to turn a blind eye to other causes of majoritarian bloc voting serves neither of these ends, but, rather, facilitates a back-door approach to proportional representation.  That is not a door through which Congress desired courts to pass.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973(b) (stating that nothing in the VRA \"establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we suspect that at bottom the skeptics misapprehend the nature of the showing needed to support a section 2 claim.  As amended, the statute allows plaintiffs to establish a prima facie case of vote dilution by proving the three Gingles preconditions. The second and third preconditions are designed to assay whether racial cleavages in voting patterns exist and, if so, whether those cleavages are deep enough to defeat minority-preferred candidates time and again.  If proven, these preconditions give rise to an inference that racial bias is operating through the medium of the targeted electoral structure to impair minority political opportunities.  See De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2657 (noting that a \"lack of equal electoral opportunity may be readily imagined and unsurprising when demonstrated under circumstances that include the three essential Gingles factors\");  Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1525 (stating that \"proof of the second and third Gingles factors will ordinarily create a sufficient inference that racial bias is at work\");  United States v. Marengo County Comm'n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1567 (11th Cir.)  (stating that the second and third Gingles preconditions remain the \"surest indication of race-conscious politics\"), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 976, 105 S.Ct. 375, 83 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resultant inference is not immutable, but it is strong;  it will endure unless and until the defendant adduces credible evidence tending to prove that detected voting patterns can most logically be explained by factors unconnected to the intersection of race with the electoral system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524.   It is only when such evidence possesses convictive force that the inference of racial animus will be called into serious question.  See De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2658.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if such proof is forthcoming, the defendant does not automatically triumph.  Instead, the court must determine whether, based on the totality of the circumstances (including the original inference and the factual predicate that undergirds it), the plaintiffs have proven that the minority group was denied meaningful access to the political system on account of race.  The burden of proof at all times remains with the plaintiffs;  defendant's burden is an entry-level burden of production.  Thus, once the defendant proffers enough evidence to raise a legitimate question in regard to whether nonracial factors adequately explain racial voting patterns, the ultimate burden of persuading the factfinder that the voting patterns were engendered by race rests with the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the allocation of the burden of proof, this framework imposes a high hurdle for those who seek to defend the existing system despite meaningful statistical evidence that suggests bloc voting along racial lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1135.   We predict that cases will be rare in which plaintiffs establish the Gingles preconditions yet fail on a section 2 claim because other facts undermine the original inference.  In this regard, we emphasize that establishing vote dilution does not require the plaintiffs affirmatively to disprove every other possible explanation for racially polarized voting.  Rather, plaintiffs must simply prove that the three threshold preconditions (alone or in combination with the totality of the circumstances) are strong enough in a given case that, notwithstanding the countervailing evidence of other causative agents mustered by the defendant, the record sustains a claim that racial politics--specifically, the interaction of race and the electoral system--have resulted in significantly diminished opportunities for minority participation in elective government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having cemented into place the general framework for evaluating vote dilution claims, we shine the light of our gleaned understanding on the City's objections to the decision below.  We divide our discussion into four segments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>A. The Analytic Model.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court analyzed fifteen different races in six different election years spanning a ten-year period from 1983 through 1993.  Taking this evidence as an undifferentiated whole, the court found a pattern of racially polarized voting sufficient to support the plaintiffs' prayer for relief.  The City assigns error, positing that racially polarized voting cannot be deduced from an overview which blends data from a series of separate elections, some suspect and some unexceptionable.  The City's point is that only evidence from \"legally significant\" elections can be relevant to, or can underbrace, a finding that VRA Sec. 2 has been abridged.  Warming to this theme, the City asserts that each of the three Gingles preconditions must be shown to exist vis-a-vis a particular election before a court may mull what transpired at that election as a link in the evidentiary chain that leads to a determination of vote dilution.  If this approach were adopted, the court below, in considering whether the plaintiffs had established a pattern of racially polarized voting over the years, could not have relied upon evidence drawn from any discrete election unless the plaintiffs first proved a violation of the VRA in regard to that election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We reject the City's approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this enlightened day and age, bigots rarely advertise an intention to engage in race-conscious politics.  Not surprisingly, therefore, racially polarized voting tends to be a silent, shadowy thief of the minority's rights.  Where such activity is detected at all, the process of detection typically involves resort to a multifaceted array of evidence including demographics, election results, voting patterns, campaign conduct, and the like.  Usually, such evidence is not neatly packaged but must be pieced together bit by bit from data accumulated in a series of elections.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57, 106 S.Ct. at 2769-70;  Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1119;  Gomez v. City of Watsonville, 863 F.2d 1407, 1417 (9th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1080, 109 S.Ct. 1534, 103 L.Ed.2d 839 (1989);  City of Carrollton Branch of NAACP v. Stallings, 829 F.2d 1547, 1557 (11th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 936, 108 S.Ct. 1111, 99 L.Ed.2d 272 (1988).  Thus, the question whether a given electoral district experiences racially polarized voting to a legally significant extent demands a series of discrete inquiries not only into election results but also into minority and white voting practices over time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this analysis exposes the principal flaw in Holyoke's thesis.  The requirement of \"legal significance\" is not a barometer for deciding what evidence of racially polarized voting may be considered;  rather, it is the benchmark against which all the evidence, taken in sum, must be measured.  And although weaknesses in plot lines siphoned from individual elections may well imperil an overall conclusion of legally significant racially polarized voting--the whole is frequently not greater than the sum of the parts--such weaknesses do not render evidence from those elections inadmissible.  It follows that reliance on such evidence does not necessarily invalidate an overall conclusion that unlawful vote dilution exists.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57, 106 S.Ct. at 2769-70 (explaining that \"in a district where elections are shown usually to be polarized, the fact that racially polarized voting is not present in one or a few individual elections does not necessarily negate the conclusion that the district experiences legally significant bloc voting\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This paradigm is fully consistent with the reality of events.  One swallow does not a summer make, and the results of a single election are unlikely, without more, to prove the existence or nonexistence of embedded racial cleavages.  Thus, race-conscious politics (or its absence, for that matter) can more readily be seen by producing a documentary that spans a series of elections than by taking an isolated snapshot of a single election.  After all, to be legally significant, racially polarized voting in a specific community must be such that, over a period of years, whites vote sufficiently as a bloc to defeat minority candidates most of the time.  See id. at 56, 106 S.Ct. at 2769.   In order reliably to tell whether racial groups do (or do not) band together behind particular candidates with regularity, all elections in the relevant time frame (or, at least, a representative sampling of them) must be studied--not just those elections that, taken in isolation, reveal the cicatrices of racially polarized voting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this basis, we reject the City's contention that the failure to prove any one Gingles precondition in any one election eliminates that election from judicial consideration.  The preconditions are necessary to prove an overall conclusion of vote dilution, not to demonstrate the relevance vel non of particular morsels of evidence.  Hence, the court below had every right to analyze all the elections (suspect and non-suspect) in its effort to ascertain both whether (1) the Hispanic community usually coheres behind particular candidates, and (2) Holyoke's white citizens usually vote against Hispanic-preferred candidates in sufficient numbers to prevent their election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>B. Compactness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holyoke's city council model--seven ward seats and eight at-large seats--dates back more than three decades (to an era when few persons of Hispanic descent dwelt in the municipality).  Currently, the Hispanic community effectively controls two of the fifteen city council seats (Wards 1 and 2).  In addition, Hispanics constitute about 28% of the voting age population in Ward 4.  Based on these population statistics, the City strives to persuade us that the plaintiffs cannot satisfy the Gingles preconditions because Hispanics, as a group, are insufficiently compact to constitute the majority in a third ward.  We are unconvinced for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the City failed to make this claim in its brief, asserting it for the first time at oral argument.  Thinking on one's feet is a useful tool of appellate advocacy only if the thinker has a suitable foothold in the record.  Here, the thought was too little too late.  See United States v. Gertner, 65 F.3d 963, 971 n. 7 (1st Cir.1995) (refusing to entertain an argument not raised in the government's appellate brief);  see also Fed.R.App.P. 28(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the City's spur-of-the-moment retort is founded on a faulty premise.  It assumes that the relevant benchmarks for matching the Hispanic population and its opportunity for access are the seven single-member wards.  This assumption is faulty because the litigation challenges Holyoke's electoral system as a whole, and, to the extent the challenge is scissile, its cynosure is not the wards but the system's at-large component--a component that allegedly dilutes the plaintiffs' opportunity for full political participation in municipal affairs.  Refined to bare essence, the plaintiffs' theory is that, because of the combined impact of the at-large electoral structure and an incipient pattern of racially polarized voting, Hispanics can only hope to elect candidates to two of the fifteen city council seats (i.e., about 14% of the seats) even though they comprise at least 22% of Holyoke's total population.  Thus, the City's emphasis on the seven wards misses the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that the wards are an irrelevancy.  A successful vote dilution challenge \"must find a reasonable alternative practice as a benchmark against which to measure the existing voting practice.\"  Holder v. Hall, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2581, 2585, 129 L.Ed.2d 687 (1994).  In that sense, the single-member districts are relevant to an assessment of the system's at-large component.  While it may be theoretically possible to analogize the plaintiffs' claim to a challenge addressed to a multimember at-large district--in which case the court would have to compare Hispanic opportunities to elect candidates to one of the eight undifferentiated at-large seats to the potential opportunities that might exist if the multimember district were divided into eight contiguous single-member districts, see, e.g., id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2589 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"In a challenge to a multimember at-large system ... a court may compare it to a system of multiple single-member districts.\")--the analogy cannot be carried past its logical limits.  Here, the analogy would be imperfect because the plaintiffs' challenge is addressed to Holyoke's electoral system as a whole.  Accordingly, the district court had an obligation to consider whether that system--not just its at-large component--provides minorities with an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.  See Baird, 976 F.2d at 360;  NAACP v. City of Columbia, 850 F.Supp. 404, 429 (D.S.C.1993), aff'd, 33 F.3d 52 (4th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1095, 130 L.Ed.2d 1064 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bearing this in mind, we think that the lower court constructed a reasonable benchmark by comparing current Hispanic opportunities to potential opportunities that would exist if the municipality were divided into fifteen single-member councilmanic districts.  And since we find no clear error in the court's conclusion that, under its projected set of circumstances, Hispanics would constitute a majority of the votes in at least three of fifteen reconstituted wards, we cannot set aside its finding that Hispanics are a sufficiently compact group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>C. Low Voter Turnout.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City also asserts that, given the consistently low turnout among Holyoke's Hispanic voters, see Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 925 (\"Hispanic turnout rates in Holyoke have varied from 22% to as low as 2% over a ten-year period, ... differing considerably from election to election and from precinct to precinct.\"), the district court erred as a matter of law in declaring the Hispanic community to be politically cohesive.  In the City's view, low turnout betokens voter apathy and precludes a finding that particular candidates received significant minority support (as required to show minority political cohesion under Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56, 106 S.Ct. at 2769).   The plaintiffs concede the anemic turnout but argue that it is irrelevant to the political cohesion inquiry.  They take the position that courts should frame answers to such inquiries after considering the behavior of those minority voters who actually opt to participate in the electoral process, and not gaze beyond that group (whatever its size) to count the number that sit on the sidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We walk a middle path.  A principal objective of the VRA is to provide a level playing field on which minority candidates--like all candidates--will be exposed only to the routine vicissitudes of the electoral process, not to special impediments arising out of the intersection of race and the electoral system.  So, if a defeat at the polls (or even a string of defeats) is caused by, say, a candidate's lack of merit or a campaign's lack of focus, the Voting Rights Act is not infringed.  See Whitfield v. Democratic Party of State of Ark., 890 F.2d 1423, 1430 (8th Cir.1989) (explaining that a \"causal connection between the challenged practice ... and the diluted voting power of the minority must be established\").  By like token, if the defeat of minority candidates occurs because the votes of the members of the minority community are scattered due to their diverse interests, then the requisite causal connection is lacking.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. at 2766-67.   Under such circumstances, the interaction of race with the electoral system cannot justly be blamed for a minority group's lack of success at the polls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of low voter turnout, the electoral system may not always be so easily absolved.  For one thing, even with a modest turnout, the actual votes cast may be probative of minority cohesion if a sufficiently strong pattern emerges.  See, e.g., United States v. Dallas County Comm'n, 739 F.2d 1529, 1536 n. 4 (11th Cir.1984).  For another thing, low voter turnout in the minority community sometimes may result from the interaction of the electoral system with the effects of past discrimination, which together operate to discourage meaningful electoral participation.  In such instances, low turnout itself may actually be probative of vote dilution.  See, e.g., Gingles, 478 U.S. at 69, 106 S.Ct. at 2776 (opinion of Brennan, J.);   see also Gomez, 863 F.2d at 1416 n. 4 (suggesting that voter apathy traceable to past discrimination is \"evidence of minority voters' lack of ability to participate effectively in the political process\");  Kirksey v. Board of Supervisors, 554 F.2d 139, 145 n. 13 (5th Cir.)  (observing that failure to register may be a residual effect of previous lack of access or feelings of futility in light of white bloc voting), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 968, 98 S.Ct. 512, 54 L.Ed.2d 454 (1977);  see also Buckanaga v. Sisseton Indep.  Sch. Dist., 804 F.2d 469, 475 (8th Cir.1986).  When low turnout results from the very problems that the Voting Rights Act is intended to ameliorate, it would be mindless for courts to ignore the evidence of minority cohesion that can be culled from the actual ballot tallies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say, as the plaintiffs would have it, either that low voter turnout is altogether irrelevant to a vote dilution inquiry, or that courts should look only to actual voting results.  The cause of poor turnout is often difficult to detect.  If minority voters have not made reasonable efforts to organize and participate in the electoral system, courts cannot accurately gauge the effects of the system on the minority group's political aspirations.  See City of Columbia, 850 F.Supp. at 415-16.   Furthermore, low turnout sometimes may be an indicium of ebbing community support for a particular minority candidate.  See id. at 418-19.   Hence, evidence of this nature may--or may not--be probative on the issue of minority cohesion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, the question of whether low minority voter turnout helps or hurts a claim of vote dilution, and the related question of whether actual votes cast provide a sufficient (or better) measure of minority political cohesion without regard to turnout, both depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.  Consequently, courts cannot resort to the easy visibility of a bright-line rule.  On this delicate, fact-sensitive issue, only a case-by-case approach satisfactorily permits courts to peel away the layers and conduct the functional vote dilution inquiry that the VRA requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the district court made reasonably detailed findings concerning the relationship between depressed turnout among Hispanics and the structural attributes of Holyoke's electoral system.  The court determined that the City imposed--or neglected to remove--a variety of obstacles to Hispanic political participation.  The court mentioned, inter alia, the City's niggardly deployment of bilingual registrars and poll workers, its removal from voter registration rolls of Hispanics who did not fill out English-language census forms, and its failure to print ballot information posters in Spanish.  See Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 925.   In the court's estimation, these deficiencies, along with downtrodden socioeconomic conditions, accounted for the low turnout among Hispanic voters.  Id.  And to cap matters, the court found that the actual turnout, though small, was adequate to reflect political cohesion in the Hispanic community.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that these findings are supportable.  In a vote dilution case characterized by meager turnout among minority voters, plaintiffs need not show that the sole cause of low numbers is the interaction between racial divisions in the community and identifiable elements of the electoral system.  It is sufficient if the plaintiffs persuade the trial court that considerations implicating race contributed substantially to repressing minority participation.  In light of the aggregate facts and circumstances, coupled with the district court's explicit findings, we believe that the plaintiffs satisfied this burden here.  Thus, the evidence of low Hispanic turnout does not undercut the court's ultimate conclusion that the plaintiffs established minority political cohesion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>D. Adequacy of the Findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City's most telling point involves the lower court's application of relevant legal principles to discerned facts.  In condoning the necessary appraisal, we are mindful that a district judge sitting without a jury cannot paint with too broad a brush.  Rule 52(a) requires the judge to make findings of fact and conclusions of law that are sufficiently detailed to permit a reviewing court to ascertain the factual core of, and the legal foundation for, the rulings below.  See Touch v. Master Unit Die Prods., Inc., 43 F.3d 754, 759 (1st Cir.1995);  Pearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163, 165-66 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This bedrock rule has particular force in cases of this genre.  Vote dilution claims are often marked by a significant degree of complexity.  Typically, the resolution of such claims demands a careful sifting of imbricated, highly ramified fact patterns.  The legal principles that must be applied are convoluted, and they almost always touch upon constitutional precepts, together with important issues of federalism and the separation of powers.  Accordingly, a trial court that decides a vote dilution case must be scrupulous in chronicling the relevant facts and delineating the linkages between those facts and the ultimate conclusion of vote dilution vel non.  See Cousin v. McWherter, 46 F.3d 568, 574-75 (6th Cir.1995);  Buckanaga, 804 F.2d at 472;  Velasquez v. City of Abilene, 725 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir.1984).  To this end, the district court must discuss \"not only the evidence that supports its decision but also all the substantial evidence contrary to its opinion.\"  Harvell v. Ladd, 958 F.2d 226, 229 (8th Cir.1992) (quoting Buckanaga, 804 F.2d at 472);  see also Houston, 56 F.3d at 612 n. 6 (similar;  collecting cases).  Despite the district judge's obvious investment of time and effort in the proceedings below, and his thoughtful analysis of difficult legal issues, the findings of fact in the instant case fail to satisfy these demanding criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any claim brought under VRA Sec. 2, the Gingles preconditions are central to the plaintiffs' success.  Here, the trial court sounded an uncertain trumpet in respect to both the second and third preconditions.  This uncertainty stems from a lack of congruence between the court's subsidiary findings anent the particular elections it studied and its overall findings of minority cohesion and white bloc voting in Holyoke.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court analyzed fifteen elections in which Hispanic candidates ran for office.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Of these, only four were at-large elections;  the rest were ward elections for either city council or school committee seats.  In four of the eleven ward elections, Hispanic candidates ran unopposed.  These elections reveal little about either minority cohesion or white bloc voting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The district court found neither minority cohesion behind Hispanic candidates nor racially polarized voting in seven of the eleven elections in which Hispanic candidates ran against non-Hispanic opponents.  The court found minority cohesion in the four remaining elections, and found white bloc voting only in the three that occurred before 1988.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 921-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed from a different angle, the court's finding that so few elections exhibited telltale signs of minority cohesion and/or white bloc voting seems to be tantamount to a finding that those characteristics were absent from approximately two-thirds of the analyzed elections.  The finding also seems to contradict the district court's conclusion that the plaintiffs established the second and third Gingles preconditions.  Of course, it is possible that the apparent contradiction can be explained away:  we recognize that determining whether racial bloc voting exists is not merely an arithmetic exercise that consists of toting up columns of numbers, and nothing more.  To the contrary, the district court should not confine itself to raw numbers, but must make a practical, commonsense assay of all the evidence.  See Magnolia Bar Ass'n, Inc. v. Lee, 994 F.2d 1143, 1147 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 555, 126 L.Ed.2d 456 (1993);  see also S.Rep. No. 417, supra, at 29-30 &amp; n. 118, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207-08.  But allowing for the possibility of a sophisticated evaluative judgment does not dissipate the need to explain that judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, forced to juggle several issues at once, offered no explanation of this seeming contradiction.  The court not only glossed over the raw numbers but also failed to clarify why evidence reflecting racially polarized voting in at most three or four elections (out of eleven) justified a finding of vote dilution.  While we are unprepared to say, here and now, that such a finding is incorrect as a matter of law, we cannot accept it without a better articulated rationale.  Thus, because we are unable to follow the district judge's thought processes in this regard, we must return the case to him for a more detailed explication of his reasoning.  See Houston, 56 F.3d at 612-13 &amp; n. 8 (remanding because the \"district court findings are too general to allow us to conduct our appellate review\") (citing cases);  Cousin, 46 F.3d at 575 (remanding because the \"record fails to provide the bases for the district court reasoning\");  Velasquez, 725 F.2d at 1021 (similar);  cf. Westwego Citizens for Better Gov't v. City of Westwego, 946 F.2d 1109, 1119 (5th Cir.1991) (ascribing error when district court's facially inconsistent findings were not explained).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take this step reluctantly, mindful that district courts have heavy workloads and that appellate tribunals should not stand unduly on ceremony, but should fill in blanks in the district court's account when the record and the circumstances permit this to be done without short-changing the parties.  See Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co. v. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1503-04 (1st Cir.1989) (collecting cases).  In this situation, however, the record does not lend itself to curing the omissions in this fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are fortified in this cautious approach by what we envision as the distinct possibility that the district court may have undervalued the import of Holyoke's rapidly changing political environment.  During the decade analyzed by the court, 1983 to 1993, the embryonic Hispanic community grew to maturity, gathering both numbers and political muscle.  Hispanic leaders mounted a \"successful community-based voter registration drive\" in the mid-1980s and boosted voter turnout dramatically.  Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 922.   In 1985, Holyoke voters elected an Hispanic to political office for the first time in Massachusetts' history.  See id. at 921.   Hot on the heels of this signal victory, the 1987 municipal elections witnessed the \"most successful city-wide campaign ever run by an Hispanic in Holyoke.\"  Id. at 922.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Those elections also witnessed the last contest in which the district court supportably found white bloc voting.  From that time forward, Hispanics have maintained political dominance over two wards and have represented those wards on both the school committee and the city council.  See id. at 921-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rise in the Hispanic community's political fortunes is significant.  The ultimate question in any section 2 case must be posed in the present tense, not the past tense.  The court must determine whether the challenged electoral structure deprives a racial minority of equal opportunity to participate in the political process at present.   Though past elections may be probative of racially polarized voting, they become less so as environmental change occurs.  In particular, elections that provide insights into past history are less probative than those that mirror the current political reality.  See LULAC, 999 F.2d at 891;  Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d 1471, 1482-83 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court alluded to Holyoke's political evolution, see, e.g., Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 927, but does not appear to have given it weight in evaluating either the Gingles preconditions or the strength of any inference to be drawn therefrom.  Under these circumstances, we think it is incumbent upon the court to explain more fully its view that vote dilution persists in spite of improved political conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. ADDITIONAL MATTERS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because remand is required, we take this opportunity to comment briefly on two other areas of continuing interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the shortcomings we have catalogued in the district court's findings cloud the relationship between evidence of racially polarized voting in the ward elections and the trial court's conclusion that the at-large component of the electoral system unlawfully dilutes the Hispanic vote.  Though we do not quarrel with the court's decision to consider evidence from the ward elections in analyzing racial polarization in the at-large elections--as we have indicated supra, a court has a duty to ponder all available evidence concerning racially polarized voting that promises to cast light on the factors at work in a particular electoral scheme, see, e.g., Citizens for a Better Gretna v. City of Gretna, 834 F.2d 496, 502 (5th Cir.1987) (approving use of data from exogenous elections when other evidence is sparse), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 905, 109 S.Ct. 3213, 106 L.Ed.2d 564 (1989)--we remain at a loss, on the record as it stands, to comprehend why and how the court thought that the evidence from the ward elections informed the analysis of what had transpired in the contests for at-large seats on the city council.  These questions, too, demand more specific findings.  See Monroe v. City of Woodville, 881 F.2d 1327, 1330 (5th Cir.)  (holding that when a trial court relies on information from exogenous elections, it should undertake fact-specific assessments of their relevance and probative worth), modified in other respects, 897 F.2d 763, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 822, 111 S.Ct. 71, 112 L.Ed.2d 45 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we think that the district court, which made no reference to Ward 4 in its initial assessment, must meet head-on the City's contention that this ward (in which Hispanics comprise approximately 28% of the voting age population) constitutes a so-called influence district and therefore should be taken into account in evaluating whether Hispanic voting strength has been illegally diluted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"society's racial and ethnic cleavages sometimes necessitate majority-minority districts to ensure equal political and electoral opportunity, that should not obscure the fact that there are communities in which minority citizens are able to form coalitions with voters from other racial and ethnic groups, having no need to be a majority within a single district in order to elect candidates of their choice.\"  De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2661;  see also Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 397 n. 24, 111 S.Ct. 2354, 2365 n. 24, 115 L.Ed.2d 348 (1991) (rejecting \"the erroneous assumption that a small group of voters can never influence the outcome of an election\");  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 87-88, 106 S.Ct. at 2785-86 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (intimating that a group's voting strength should be assessed with reference not only to its prospects for electoral success but also in terms of \"other avenues of political influence\").  These precedents merely confirm the lessons of practical politics:  the voting strength of a minority group is not necessarily limited to districts in which its members constitute a majority of the voting age population, but also extends to every district in which its members are sufficiently numerous to have a significant impact at the ballot box most of the time.  See Latino Political Action Comm., Inc. v. Boston, 609 F.Supp. 739, 747-48 (D.Mass.1985), aff'd, 784 F.2d 409 (1st Cir.1986);  see also Rural W. Tenn.  African-Am.  Affairs Council, Inc. v. McWherter, 877 F.Supp. 1096, 1105 (W.D.Tenn.)  (three-judge court) (holding that an influence district exists if a minority group constitutes at least one-quarter of the voting age population because the group then \"ha[s] significant influence on candidates in virtually every election\"), aff'd, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 42, 133 L.Ed.2d 9 (1995);  City of Columbia, 850 F.Supp. at 429 (discussing minority's \"shared influence\" over at-large seats in districts where the minority comprises 40% of the total voting age population).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are unwilling to prescribe any numerical floor above which a minority is automatically deemed large enough to convert a district into an influence district, we believe that when, as now, a minority group constitutes 28% of the voting age population, its potential influence is relevant to a determination of whether the group lacks a meaningful opportunity to participate in the electoral system.  Accord McWherter, 877 F.Supp. at 1102.   As is true of other factors, the district court should make a searching evaluation of the degree of influence exercisable by the minority, consistent with the political realities, past and present, and should enter its findings and conclusions as to how (if at all) the voting strength of Hispanics in Ward 4 affects the section 2 calculus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In requiring that influence districts be considered in section 2 cases, we are guided by the Court's recent admonition that the VRA's goals include \"eradicating invidious discrimination from the electoral process and enhancing the legitimacy of our political institutions.\"  Miller v. Johnson, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 2494, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995).  These goals are poorly served by balkanizing electorates and carving them into racial fiefdoms.  See id.   Influence districts, on the other hand, are to be prized as a means of encouraging both voters and candidates to dismantle the barriers that wall off racial groups and replace those barriers with voting coalitions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In fine, influence districts bring us closer to \"the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters.\"  Shaw v. Reno, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2832, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993);  see also De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2661 (reflecting that \"minority voters are not immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground, the virtue of which is not to be slighted in applying a statute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the district court's opinion is well-considered and in many respects deftly navigates the marshy terrain of voting rights jurisprudence.  Yet, at the risk of seeming unappreciative of a job well done, we believe the court's opinion lacks essential clarity in its factual findings.  For one thing, the court neither acknowledges nor discusses critical evidence that appears to contradict its ultimate conclusion of vote dilution.  For another thing, it never adequately explains the relevance of some evidence upon which it relies quite heavily to support this conclusion.  And, finally, it omits any meaningful mention of potentially salient factors (such as influence districts).  Rather than guess at the missing elements, we think that the course of prudence is to vacate and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We leave the procedure to be followed on remand to the lower court's informed discretion, without endeavoring to set an outer limit on its range of options.  See Lussier v. Runyon, 50 F.3d 1103, 1115 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 69, 133 L.Ed.2d 30 (1995).  At a minimum, the court must discuss the evidence we have identified as troubling (or as possibly overlooked) and explain the relationship of this evidence to the issue of vote dilution.  The court need not stop there, however;  it is free to reopen the record, to take additional evidence, and/or to reconsider all (or any part) of its findings in light of the comments contained in this opinion.  To this end, while we neither require nor anticipate an entirely new trial, the court in its discretion may permit the parties to supplement the existing record with additional facts (including, but not limited to, evidence gleaned from the new round of municipal elections that have recently been completed).  See Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2577 (2d ed. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful that, in addition to the assignments of error that we have discussed, the City strenuously objects to the remedy fashioned by the court below.  We do not address this objection today.  If the district court, after further consideration, again finds that Holyoke's electoral structure violates section 2 of the VRA--and we do not intimate any expectancy in this regard--we anticipate that it will then revisit the question of how best to mold an appropriate remedy.  Withal--and, perhaps, at the expense of remarking the obvious--we offer two brief bits of general guidance that may be helpful if this contingency materializes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the court must be sure to analyze the question of remedy in light of any new findings that it makes on remand.  Second, the court now has--and should take advantage of--the luxury of time.  The court originally attempted to craft a remedy in time for the 1995 municipal elections.  That cycle has turned, and the next is well in the future.  Given this window of opportunity, the option of choice (assuming that the court finds a section 2 transgression) is to give the defendant the first chance to assemble a remedial plan.  We think it is a fundamental tenet of voting rights law that, time permitting, a federal court should defer in the first instance to an affected state's or city's choice among legally permissible remedies.  See Cane v. Worcester County, 35 F.3d 921, 927 (4th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1097, 130 L.Ed.2d 1065 (1995);  Westwego, 946 F.2d at 1124.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, and only if, the City fails to formulate a satisfactory remedial plan should the district court step in and fashion the appropriate anodyne ex proprio vigore.  See Miller, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2488.   It goes almost without saying that this authority must be exercised responsibly and with due attention to the Supreme Court's recent warnings about the social and political costs of dividing communities along racial lines in the name of improving electoral systems.  See, e.g., Shaw, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2832 (observing that \"[r]acial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.  All parties will bear their own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs also challenged the way in which members of the school committee were elected.  The district court repulsed that challenge, see Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 928, and the plaintiffs do not press the point on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This precondition will have to be reconfigured to the extent that the courts eventually validate so-called influence dilution claims.  See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 156-160, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 1157-58, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993) (discussing treatment of claims brought on behalf of persons who constitute a potentially influential bloc, but less than the majority, within the relevant electorate, and raising prospect that the first Gingles precondition may have to be \"modified or eliminated\").  The lower courts are divided on the subject, compare Armour v. Ohio, 775 F.Supp. 1044, 1052 (N.D.Ohio 1991) (three-judge panel) (recognizing influence dilution claim) with McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist., 851 F.2d 937, 947 (7th Cir.1988) (rejecting influence dilution claim), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1031, 109 S.Ct. 1769, 104 L.Ed.2d 204 (1989), and the Supreme Court has declined on four occasions to decide whether such claims are cognizable under VRA Sec. 2.  See De Grandy, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2656;  Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 156-160, 113 S.Ct. at 1157-58;  Growe v.

We take no view of the matter today (although we do discuss the potential relevance of evidence from elections in a particular \"influence district\" on the plaintiffs' claims, see infra Part V)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We recognize that such widely used terms of art as \"white bloc voting\" and \"racially polarized voting\" may not always capture the subtleties of specific problems that arise in the political process.  The case at bar, for example, involves the voting patterns of the majority (loosely termed \"white\") and the specific minority symbolized by the plaintiffs (loosely termed \"Hispanics\").  Concededly, this taxonomy is imprecise;  for example, not all people who are considered \"Hispanic\" necessarily consider themselves \"non-white.\"   To that extent, then, the phrase \"white bloc voting,\" though used repeatedly throughout the decided cases, may be somewhat inaccurate or even slightly misleading.  Similarly, VRA Sec. 2 applies to denials of the right to vote on account of either race or color, yet the opinions harp on the phrase \"racially polarized voting.\"   To that extent, the idiom of the case law may neglect potentially important distinctions between the concepts of \"race\" and \"color.\"   While acknowledging these limitations, we can think of no universal solution, and, thus, take refuge in the pat terminology</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Such factors might include, for example, organizational disarray, lack of funds, want of campaign experience, the unattractiveness of particular candidates, or the universal popularity of an opponent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The proceedings below illustrate this point.  The district court acknowledged--but did not accept--the City's attribution of the Hispanic community's lack of electoral success to \"factors other than the at-large system itself, including voter apathy, unattractive candidates, poor campaign organizations and the like--all evidenced by low voter turnout.\"  Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 926.   The court seemingly rejected the City's alternative explanations as a matter of fact.  See id.  (concluding that, based on the overall evidence, an Hispanic candidate, \"no matter how attractive and no matter how effective at bringing out the Hispanic vote, [would not have had] a fair opportunity to win any at-large election in Holyoke during this period\").  Having used this illustration, we hasten to add that, on remand, the court is free to revisit the evidence and reconsider all its findings, including those that touch upon other possible causes of racially polarized voting</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To give concrete examples, Holyoke contends that in 1983 Hispanics did not constitute a sufficiently compact group to satisfy the first Gingles precondition, thus rendering any evidence of white bloc voting in that year legally irrelevant.  In the same vein, the City insists that the district court should have ignored evidence of racially polarized voting in any elections won by minority candidates or in which Hispanics did not sufficiently cohere</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We leave open the possibility that especially low minority voter turnout in a particular election may be evidence that factors other than racially based politics (say, poor political organization or lack of minority community support) were the cause of the minority community's inability to elect its preferred candidate in that election</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Although the VRA does not require for a successful section 2 showing that minority-preferred candidates be members of the minority group, see Clarke v. City of Cincinnati, 40 F.3d 807, 810 n. 1 (6th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1960, 131 L.Ed.2d 851 (1995);  Sanchez v. Bond, 875 F.2d 1488, 1495 (10th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 937, 111 S.Ct. 340, 112 L.Ed.2d 305 (1990), elections in which minority candidates run are often especially probative on the issue of racial bloc voting.  See, e.g., Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1128;  Magnolia Bar Ass'n, Inc. v. Lee, 994 F.2d 1143, 1149 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 555, 126 L.Ed.2d 456 (1993).  But evidence exhumed from \"white only\" elections may still be relevant in assessing the totality of the circumstances in a vote dilution case, especially if it tends to rebut the evidence of cohesion or white bloc voting extracted from \"mixed\" elections.  See Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1128</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the district court implied that blank ballots cast in three of these four elections (the 1989 and 1993 school committee elections in Ward 2, and the 1993 city council race in the same ward) evinced white bloc voting.  See Holyoke, 880 F.Supp. at 923-24.   But the record furnishes no foundation for the implication that white voters cast blank ballots as a protest against unopposed Hispanic candidates.  In 1989, for example, the highest percentage of blank ballots was recorded in the precinct that had the highest percentage of Hispanic voters</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The district court also found that the minority community had cohered behind a non-Hispanic candidate, Elaine Pluta, in her successful 1991 bid for an at-large seat on the city council.  In fact, Pluta ranked ahead of a Hispanic candidate on Hispanic voters' ballots.  However, she received strong support from non-Hispanic voters as well;  that segment of the electorate ranked her fifth (out of sixteen) among at-large candidates.  Thus, while there may have been minority cohesion behind Pluta, the record reflects no evidence of white bloc voting against the candidate that minority voters preferred</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Success is, of course, relative;  the Hispanic candidate came close but nevertheless lost.  While some might say that close only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades, and ballroom dancing, we think that progress of this sort, even short of an electoral win, is significant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Factoring influence districts into the calculus also helps ease the tension between Congress's desire to permit vote dilution claims to be brought under section 2 and its intent to avoid creating a right to proportional representation.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 84, 106 S.Ct. at 2783-84 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing \"inherent tension between what Congress wished to do and what it wished to avoid\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> It is important to realize that influence districts serve these goals only to the extent that they reflect a meaningful opportunity for minority voters to participate in the political process.  Consequently, before the existence of an influence district is given significant weight in the balance, the evidence must reveal that minority voters in the district have in fact joined with other voters to elect representatives of their choice.  Moreover, the record must show that elected representatives from such a district serve, at least in part, the interests of the minority community and vie for its support</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

No. 89-110, 79 Stat. 437 (codified at 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1973-1973o).

It arises against the backdrop of the biennial elections that are held for city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The plaintiffs, two nonprofit organizations with ties to the Hispanic community and eight voters of Hispanic descent, complain that the electoral structure violates section 2 of the VRA by denying Hispanics equal opportunity to \"participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973(b).  The district court found merit in the plaintiffs' complaint with regard to councilmanic elections and granted relief.  See Vecinos De Barrio Uno v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the background, reserving a more exegetic treatment of the facts pending our discussion of specific issues.  We refer those readers who yearn for an immediate rush of details to the district court's informative opinion.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 917-25.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1963, the Holyoke city council has been composed of fifteen members, eight elected at large and seven elected by ward.  Candidates run without party labels for two-year terms.  Each voter is entitled to cast a ballot for a candidate in his or her ward, and to vote for up to eight at-large candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hispanic community in Holyoke has grown dramatically over the past two decades.  By 1990, persons of Hispanic origin accounted for 31.06% of the total population (compared to 13.8% in 1980).  Under the current districting scheme--the ward lines were last redrawn in 1992--Hispanic voters comprise a clear majority in two wards and account for nearly one-third of the population in a third ward.  Yet, while Hispanic-preferred city council candidates have prevailed in the two \"Hispanic majority\" wards, no person of Hispanic descent ever has been elected to an at-large seat.  This discrepancy crystallizes into the nub of the plaintiffs' case:  their vote dilution claim is that, while Hispanics now constitute 21.89% of Holyoke's voting age population, the electoral structure limits the Hispanic community's ability to elect the candidates its members prefer to only 14% of the available city council seats (two of fifteen).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the Hispanic vote had been impermissibly diluted.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 925-27. </span>  To remedy the perceived inequity, the court by separate order left the ward lines and representation intact, but cut back the number of at-large seats from eight to two (thus shrinking the council from fifteen to nine members, and making its electoral structure congruent with that of the school committee).  See Vecinos de Barrio Uno v. City of Holyoke, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></span>, 10 (D.Mass.1995) (Holyoke II ).   The court reasoned that, under the revised format, Hispanics probably would continue to control two of the ward seats, and that decreasing the size of the council would boost Hispanics' percentage representation to a level that would compare favorably with their percentage of the voting age population as a whole.

The city appealed and simultaneously moved for a stay.  By an unpublished order, we expedited the appeal and granted the stay.  Hence, the November 1995 elections were held under the preexisting scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bedrock on which the district court's opinion rests is its conclusion that the at-large component of the electoral structure unlawfully dilutes the Hispanic community's voting power.

However, the inference is rebuttable.  As a result, establishing the three Gingles preconditions is necessary, but not always in itself sufficient, to ensure success on a section 2 claim.  That is to say, because the inference of vote dilution can be rebutted by the force of other evidence, proof of the three preconditions, without more, will not invariably carry the day.

Put another way, the critical question in a vote dilution case is whether minority voters have an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process.

Furthermore, that question \"must still be addressed explicitly, and without isolating any other arguably relevant facts from the act of judgment.\"  De Grandy, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117876\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/117876/johnson-v-de-grandy/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It seems self-evident that the presence or absence of bias is at least \"arguably relevant\" to the question of whether a minority lacks equal electoral opportunity.  After all, a minority group's prospects for electoral success in a community riven along racial lines differ significantly from its prospects in a more unified community.  We agree with the Fifth Circuit that \"[a] tendency among whites to cast their votes on the basis of race presents a far more durable obstacle to the coalition-building upon which minority electoral success depends than disagreements over ideology.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612121\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">LULAC,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/612121/league-of-united-latin-american-citizens-council-no-4434-and-jesse/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, however, sentiments unrelated to race also can be powerful stimuli.  When it can be shown that, in a particular community, voters are moved primarily by causes unrelated to race, it is reasonable to assume that a minority-preferred candidate who embodies these values might equally be able to engender majoritarian (white) support.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gingles,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">100-01</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 2792-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Evidence that a candidate preferred by the minority group in a particular election was rejected by white voters for reasons other than those which made that candidate the preferred choice of the minority group would seem clearly relevant in answering the question whether bloc voting by white voters will consistently defeat minority candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 100, </a></span>106 S.Ct. at 2792.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that when racial antagonism is not the cause of an electoral defeat suffered by a minority candidate, the defeat does not prove a lack of electoral opportunity but a lack of whatever else it takes to be successful in politics (say, failure to support popular programmatic initiatives, or failure to reflect the majority's ideological viewpoints, or failure to appreciate the popularity of an incumbent).

This substitution permits plaintiffs to show vote dilution by proving that electoral structures \"result[ ] in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color,\" 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973(a), and, concomitantly, relieves them of the burden of proving that the structures were set in place to advance a racially discrimination purpose.  Against this mise-en-scene, some have equated Congress's adoption of the \"results\" test with an intention to foreclose any inquiry whatever into the reasons why minority groups lack opportunities for electoral participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that the 1982 amendment lends itself to this restrictive conclusion.  The now-discarded \"intent\" test specifically required plaintiffs to prove that government created or maintained the challenged electoral structure with a discriminatory purpose, actually intending that a structure would disadvantage minority voters.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110246\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mobile,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110246/mobile-v-bolden/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">62-63</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. at 1497-98.   In enacting the amendment, Congress shifted the law's focus:  plaintiffs no longer have to prove discriminatory intent but instead have to carry the burden of proving that the challenged electoral structure results in a denial of equal opportunity on account of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Properly conceived, the results test protects racial minorities against a stacked deck but does not guarantee that they will be dealt a winning hand.  Whitcomb--an opinion purportedly codified in the 1982 amendment--illustrates the point.  There, the Court discerned no denial of equal opportunity when a minority group's failure to elect its preferred candidates \"emerges more as a function of losing elections than of built-in bias\" directed by the establishment majority against the minority group.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108364\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Whitcomb,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/108364/whitcomb-v-chavis/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 91 S.Ct. at 1874.   The lesson to be learned is that, even when election returns in effect short-circuit a minority group's voting power, the electoral structure is not illegal if the defeat represents nothing more than the routine operation of political factors.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108364\"><a href=\"/opinion/108364/whitcomb-v-chavis/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   In other </a></span>words, even under the 1982 amendment, a lack of electoral success unrelated to race is not a proxy for a lack of opportunity to succeed.  Hence, VRA Sec. 2, as amended, despite its focus on results, does not require courts to ignore evidence that factors other than race are the real obstacles to the political success of a minority group.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gingles,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 2792-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"The overall vote dilution inquiry neither requires nor permits an arbitrary rule against consideration of all evidence concerning voting preferences other than statistical evidence of racial voting patterns.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, of course, that permitting inquiry into the causes of white bloc voting potentially jeopardizes the remedial purposes of the VRA in the sense that it may make proof of vote dilution more difficult.  Courts have expressed concern on this score, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 72, </a></span>106 S.Ct. at 2777-78 (opinion of Brennan, J.);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612121\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">LULAC,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/612121/league-of-united-latin-american-citizens-council-no-4434-and-jesse/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span>, and these concerns are not without foundation.  Yet, two responses spring to mind.  First, the VRA is designed to ensure that the electoral process is fair and the opportunities for access to it are equal.  Forcing courts to turn a blind eye to other causes of majoritarian bloc voting serves neither of these ends, but, rather, facilitates a back-door approach to proportional representation.  That is not a door through which Congress desired courts to pass.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973(b) (stating that nothing in the VRA \"establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we suspect that at bottom the skeptics misapprehend the nature of the showing needed to support a section 2 claim.  As amended, the statute allows plaintiffs to establish a prima facie case of vote dilution by proving the three Gingles preconditions. The second and third preconditions are designed to assay whether racial cleavages in voting patterns exist and, if so, whether those cleavages are deep enough to defeat minority-preferred candidates time and again.  If proven, these preconditions give rise to an inference that racial bias is operating through the medium of the targeted electoral structure to impair minority political opportunities.

Instead, the court must determine whether, based on the totality of the circumstances (including the original inference and the factual predicate that undergirds it), the plaintiffs have proven that the minority group was denied meaningful access to the political system on account of race.  The burden of proof at all times remains with the plaintiffs;  defendant's burden is an entry-level burden of production.  Thus, once the defendant proffers enough evidence to raise a legitimate question in regard to whether nonracial factors adequately explain racial voting patterns, the ultimate burden of persuading the factfinder that the voting patterns were engendered by race rests with the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the allocation of the burden of proof, this framework imposes a high hurdle for those who seek to defend the existing system despite meaningful statistical evidence that suggests bloc voting along racial lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652881\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jenkins,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/652881/alden-jenkins-harlan-roberts-gwendolyn-neal-v-red-clay-consolidated-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>.   We predict that cases will be rare in which plaintiffs establish the Gingles preconditions yet fail on a section 2 claim because other facts undermine the original inference.  In this regard, we emphasize that establishing vote dilution does not require the plaintiffs affirmatively to disprove every other possible explanation for racially polarized voting.  Rather, plaintiffs must simply prove that the three threshold preconditions (alone or in combination with the totality of the circumstances) are strong enough in a given case that, notwithstanding the countervailing evidence of other causative agents mustered by the defendant, the record sustains a claim that racial politics--specifically, the interaction of race and the electoral system--have resulted in significantly diminished opportunities for minority participation in elective government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having cemented into place the general framework for evaluating vote dilution claims, we shine the light of our gleaned understanding on the City's objections to the decision below.  We divide our discussion into four segments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>A. The Analytic Model.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court analyzed fifteen different races in six different election years spanning a ten-year period from 1983 through 1993.  Taking this evidence as an undifferentiated whole, the court found a pattern of racially polarized voting sufficient to support the plaintiffs' prayer for relief.  The City assigns error, positing that racially polarized voting cannot be deduced from an overview which blends data from a series of separate elections, some suspect and some unexceptionable.  The City's point is that only evidence from \"legally significant\" elections can be relevant to, or can underbrace, a finding that VRA Sec. 2 has been abridged.  Warming to this theme, the City asserts that each of the three Gingles preconditions must be shown to exist vis-a-vis a particular election before a court may mull what transpired at that election as a link in the evidentiary chain that leads to a determination of vote dilution.  If this approach were adopted, the court below, in considering whether the plaintiffs had established a pattern of racially polarized voting over the years, could not have relied upon evidence drawn from any discrete election unless the plaintiffs first proved a violation of the VRA in regard to that election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We reject the City's approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this enlightened day and age, bigots rarely advertise an intention to engage in race-conscious politics.  Not surprisingly, therefore, racially polarized voting tends to be a silent, shadowy thief of the minority's rights.  Where such activity is detected at all, the process of detection typically involves resort to a multifaceted array of evidence including demographics, election results, voting patterns, campaign conduct, and the like.  Usually, such evidence is not neatly packaged but must be pieced together bit by bit from data accumulated in a series of elections.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span> </span>(1988).  Thus, the question whether a given electoral district experiences racially polarized voting to a legally significant extent demands a series of discrete inquiries not only into election results but also into minority and white voting practices over time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this analysis exposes the principal flaw in Holyoke's thesis.  The requirement of \"legal significance\" is not a barometer for deciding what evidence of racially polarized voting may be considered;  rather, it is the benchmark against which all the evidence, taken in sum, must be measured.  And although weaknesses in plot lines siphoned from individual elections may well imperil an overall conclusion of legally significant racially polarized voting--the whole is frequently not greater than the sum of the parts--such weaknesses do not render evidence from those elections inadmissible.  It follows that reliance on such evidence does not necessarily invalidate an overall conclusion that unlawful vote dilution exists.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gingles,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 2769-70 (explaining that \"in a district where elections are shown usually to be polarized, the fact that racially polarized voting is not present in one or a few individual elections does not necessarily negate the conclusion that the district experiences legally significant bloc voting\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This paradigm is fully consistent with the reality of events.  One swallow does not a summer make, and the results of a single election are unlikely, without more, to prove the existence or nonexistence of embedded racial cleavages.  Thus, race-conscious politics (or its absence, for that matter) can more readily be seen by producing a documentary that spans a series of elections than by taking an isolated snapshot of a single election.  After all, to be legally significant, racially polarized voting in a specific community must be such that, over a period of years, whites vote sufficiently as a bloc to defeat minority candidates most of the time.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 56, </a></span>106 S.Ct. at 2769.   In order reliably to tell whether racial groups do (or do not) band together behind particular candidates with regularity, all elections in the relevant time frame (or, at least, a representative sampling of them) must be studied--not just those elections that, taken in isolation, reveal the cicatrices of racially polarized voting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this basis, we reject the City's contention that the failure to prove any one Gingles precondition in any one election eliminates that election from judicial consideration.  The preconditions are necessary to prove an overall conclusion of vote dilution, not to demonstrate the relevance vel non of particular morsels of evidence.  Hence, the court below had every right to analyze all the elections (suspect and non-suspect) in its effort to ascertain both whether (1) the Hispanic community usually coheres behind particular candidates, and (2) Holyoke's white citizens usually vote against Hispanic-preferred candidates in sufficient numbers to prevent their election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>B. Compactness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holyoke's city council model--seven ward seats and eight at-large seats--dates back more than three decades (to an era when few persons of Hispanic descent dwelt in the municipality).  Currently, the Hispanic community effectively controls two of the fifteen city council seats (Wards 1 and 2).  In addition, Hispanics constitute about 28% of the voting age population in Ward 4.  Based on these population statistics, the City strives to persuade us that the plaintiffs cannot satisfy the Gingles preconditions because Hispanics, as a group, are insufficiently compact to constitute the majority in a third ward.  We are unconvinced for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the City failed to make this claim in its brief, asserting it for the first time at oral argument.  Thinking on one's feet is a useful tool of appellate advocacy only if the thinker has a suitable foothold in the record.  Here, the thought was too little too late.  See United States v. Gertner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703980\"><a href=\"/opinion/703980/united-states-v-nancy-gertner-etc-john-doe-intervenor/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span>, 971 n. 7 (1st Cir.1995) (refusing to entertain an argument not raised in the government's appellate brief);  see also Fed.R.App.P. 28(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the City's spur-of-the-moment retort is founded on a faulty premise.  It assumes that the relevant benchmarks for matching the Hispanic population and its opportunity for access are the seven single-member wards.  This assumption is faulty because the litigation challenges Holyoke's electoral system as a whole, and, to the extent the challenge is scissile, its cynosure is not the wards but the system's at-large component--a component that allegedly dilutes the plaintiffs' opportunity for full political participation in municipal affairs.  Refined to bare essence, the plaintiffs' theory is that, because of the combined impact of the at-large electoral structure and an incipient pattern of racially polarized voting, Hispanics can only hope to elect candidates to two of the fifteen city council seats (i.e., about 14% of the seats) even though they comprise at least 22% of Holyoke's total population.  Thus, the City's emphasis on the seven wards misses the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that the wards are an irrelevancy.  A successful vote dilution challenge \"must find a reasonable alternative practice as a benchmark against which to measure the existing voting practice.\"  Holder v. Hall, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117874\"><a href=\"/opinion/117874/holder-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span> </a></span>(1994).  In that sense, the single-member districts are relevant to an assessment of the system's at-large component.  While it may be theoretically possible to analogize the plaintiffs' claim to a challenge addressed to a multimember at-large district--in which case the court would have to compare Hispanic opportunities to elect candidates to one of the eight undifferentiated at-large seats to the potential opportunities that might exist if the multimember district were divided into eight contiguous single-member districts, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117874\"><a href=\"/opinion/117874/holder-v-hall/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at ----, </a></span>114 S.Ct. at 2589 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"In a challenge to a multimember at-large system ... a court may compare it to a system of multiple single-member districts.\")--the analogy cannot be carried past its logical limits.  Here, the analogy would be imperfect because the plaintiffs' challenge is addressed to Holyoke's electoral system as a whole.  Accordingly, the district court had an obligation to consider whether that system--not just its at-large component--provides minorities with an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.

Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">925</span> </span>(\"Hispanic turnout rates in Holyoke have varied from 22% to as low as 2% over a ten-year period, ... differing considerably from election to election and from precinct to precinct.\"), the district court erred as a matter of law in declaring the Hispanic community to be politically cohesive.  In the City's view, low turnout betokens voter apathy and precludes a finding that particular candidates received significant minority support (as required to show minority political cohesion under Gingles, 478 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">56,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

They take the position that courts should frame answers to such inquiries after considering the behavior of those minority voters who actually opt to participate in the electoral process, and not gaze beyond that group (whatever its size) to count the number that sit on the sidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We walk a middle path.  A principal objective of the VRA is to provide a level playing field on which minority candidates--like all candidates--will be exposed only to the routine vicissitudes of the electoral process, not to special impediments arising out of the intersection of race and the electoral system.  So, if a defeat at the polls (or even a string of defeats) is caused by, say, a candidate's lack of merit or a campaign's lack of focus, the Voting Rights Act is not infringed.  See Whitfield v. Democratic Party of State of Ark., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532989\"><a href=\"/opinion/532989/sam-whitfield-jr-and-linda-whitfield-pl-perkins-julious-mcgruder/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1423</span></a></span>, 1430 (8th Cir.1989) (explaining that a \"causal connection between the challenged practice ... and the diluted voting power of the minority must be established\").  By like token, if the defeat of minority candidates occurs because the votes of the members of the minority community are scattered due to their diverse interests, then the requisite causal connection is lacking.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">51,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under such circumstances, the interaction of race with the electoral system cannot justly be blamed for a minority group's lack of success at the polls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of low voter turnout, the electoral system may not always be so easily absolved.  For one thing, even with a modest turnout, the actual votes cast may be probative of minority cohesion if a sufficiently strong pattern emerges.  See, e.g., United States v. Dallas County Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439178\"><a href=\"/opinion/439178/united-states-v-dallas-county-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1529</span></a></span>, 1536 n. 4 (11th Cir.1984).  For another thing, low voter turnout in the minority community sometimes may result from the interaction of the electoral system with the effects of past discrimination, which together operate to discourage meaningful electoral participation.  In such instances, low turnout itself may actually be probative of vote dilution.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gingles,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 2776 (opinion of Brennan, J.);   see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516042\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gomez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/516042/dolores-cruz-gomez-patricia-leal-and-waldo-rodriguez-plaintiffs-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1416</span> </a></span>n. 4 (suggesting that voter apathy traceable to past discrimination is \"evidence of minority voters' lack of ability to participate effectively in the political process\");  Kirksey v.

When low turnout results from the very problems that the Voting Rights Act is intended to ameliorate, it would be mindless for courts to ignore the evidence of minority cohesion that can be culled from the actual ballot tallies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say, as the plaintiffs would have it, either that low voter turnout is altogether irrelevant to a vote dilution inquiry, or that courts should look only to actual voting results.  The cause of poor turnout is often difficult to detect.  If minority voters have not made reasonable efforts to organize and participate in the electoral system, courts cannot accurately gauge the effects of the system on the minority group's political aspirations.  See City of <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Columbia,</span> <span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">415-16</span></span>.   Furthermore, low turnout sometimes may be an indicium of ebbing community support for a particular minority candidate.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 418-19. </span>  Hence, evidence of this nature may--or may not--be probative on the issue of minority cohesion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, the question of whether low minority voter turnout helps or hurts a claim of vote dilution, and the related question of whether actual votes cast provide a sufficient (or better) measure of minority political cohesion without regard to turnout, both depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.  Consequently, courts cannot resort to the easy visibility of a bright-line rule.  On this delicate, fact-sensitive issue, only a case-by-case approach satisfactorily permits courts to peel away the layers and conduct the functional vote dilution inquiry that the VRA requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the district court made reasonably detailed findings concerning the relationship between depressed turnout among Hispanics and the structural attributes of Holyoke's electoral system.  The court determined that the City imposed--or neglected to remove--a variety of obstacles to Hispanic political participation.  The court mentioned, inter alia, the City's niggardly deployment of bilingual registrars and poll workers, its removal from voter registration rolls of Hispanics who did not fill out English-language census forms, and its failure to print ballot information posters in Spanish.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Holyoke,</span> <span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">925</span></span>.   In the court's estimation, these deficiencies, along with downtrodden socioeconomic conditions, accounted for the low turnout among Hispanic voters.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  And to </span>cap matters, the court found that the actual turnout, though small, was adequate to reflect political cohesion in the Hispanic community.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that these findings are supportable.  In a vote dilution case characterized by meager turnout among minority voters, plaintiffs need not show that the sole cause of low numbers is the interaction between racial divisions in the community and identifiable elements of the electoral system.  It is sufficient if the plaintiffs persuade the trial court that considerations implicating race contributed substantially to repressing minority participation.  In light of the aggregate facts and circumstances, coupled with the district court's explicit findings, we believe that the plaintiffs satisfied this burden here.  Thus, the evidence of low Hispanic turnout does not undercut the court's ultimate conclusion that the plaintiffs established minority political cohesion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>D. Adequacy of the Findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City's most telling point involves the lower court's application of relevant legal principles to discerned facts.  In condoning the necessary appraisal, we are mindful that a district judge sitting without a jury cannot paint with too broad a brush.  Rule 52(a) requires the judge to make findings of fact and conclusions of law that are sufficiently detailed to permit a reviewing court to ascertain the factual core of, and the legal foundation for, the rulings below.  See Touch v. Master Unit Die Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195825\"><a href=\"/opinion/195825/touch-v-master-unit-die/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1995);  Pearson v.

Vote dilution claims are often marked by a significant degree of complexity.  Typically, the resolution of such claims demands a careful sifting of imbricated, highly ramified fact patterns.  The legal principles that must be applied are convoluted, and they almost always touch upon constitutional precepts, together with important issues of federalism and the separation of powers.  Accordingly, a trial court that decides a vote dilution case must be scrupulous in chronicling the relevant facts and delineating the linkages between those facts and the ultimate conclusion of vote dilution vel non.

Despite the district judge's obvious investment of time and effort in the proceedings below, and his thoughtful analysis of difficult legal issues, the findings of fact in the instant case fail to satisfy these demanding criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any claim brought under VRA Sec. 2, the Gingles preconditions are central to the plaintiffs' success.  Here, the trial court sounded an uncertain trumpet in respect to both the second and third preconditions.  This uncertainty stems from a lack of congruence between the court's subsidiary findings anent the particular elections it studied and its overall findings of minority cohesion and white bloc voting in Holyoke.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court analyzed fifteen elections in which Hispanic candidates ran for office.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Of these, only four were at-large elections;  the rest were ward elections for either city council or school committee seats.  In four of the eleven ward elections, Hispanic candidates ran unopposed.  These elections reveal little about either minority cohesion or white bloc voting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The district court found neither minority cohesion behind Hispanic candidates nor racially polarized voting in seven of the eleven elections in which Hispanic candidates ran against non-Hispanic opponents.  The court found minority cohesion in the four remaining elections, and found white bloc voting only in the three that occurred before 1988.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Holyoke,</span> <span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The finding also seems to contradict the district court's conclusion that the plaintiffs established the second and third Gingles preconditions.  Of course, it is possible that the apparent contradiction can be explained away:  we recognize that determining whether racial bloc voting exists is not merely an arithmetic exercise that consists of toting up columns of numbers, and nothing more.  To the contrary, the district court should not confine itself to raw numbers, but must make a practical, commonsense assay of all the evidence.  See Magnolia Bar Ass'n, Inc. v. Lee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608102\"><a href=\"/opinion/608102/magnolia-bar-association-inc-v-roy-noble-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, 1147 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court not only glossed over the raw numbers but also failed to clarify why evidence reflecting racially polarized voting in at most three or four elections (out of eleven) justified a finding of vote dilution.  While we are unprepared to say, here and now, that such a finding is incorrect as a matter of law, we cannot accept it without a better articulated rationale.  Thus, because we are unable to follow the district judge's thought processes in this regard, we must return the case to him for a more detailed explication of his reasoning.

During the decade analyzed by the court, 1983 to 1993, the embryonic Hispanic community grew to maturity, gathering both numbers and political muscle.  Hispanic leaders mounted a \"successful community-based voter registration drive\" in the mid-1980s and boosted voter turnout dramatically.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Holyoke,</span> <span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The ultimate question in any section 2 case must be posed in the present tense, not the past tense.  The court must determine whether the challenged electoral structure deprives a racial minority of equal opportunity to participate in the political process at present.   Though past elections may be probative of racially polarized voting, they become less so as environmental change occurs.  In particular, elections that provide insights into past history are less probative than those that mirror the current political reality.

Though we do not quarrel with the court's decision to consider evidence from the ward elections in analyzing racial polarization in the at-large elections--as we have <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">indicated</span> supra</span>, a court has a duty to ponder all available evidence concerning racially polarized voting that promises to cast light on the factors at work in a particular electoral scheme, see, e.g., Citizens for a Better Gretna v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the district court's opinion is well-considered and in many respects deftly navigates the marshy terrain of voting rights jurisprudence.  Yet, at the risk of seeming unappreciative of a job well done, we believe the court's opinion lacks essential clarity in its factual findings.  For one thing, the court neither acknowledges nor discusses critical evidence that appears to contradict its ultimate conclusion of vote dilution.  For another thing, it never adequately explains the relevance of some evidence upon which it relies quite heavily to support this conclusion.  And, finally, it omits any meaningful mention of potentially salient factors (such as influence districts).  Rather than guess at the missing elements, we think that the course of prudence is to vacate and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We leave the procedure to be followed on remand to the lower court's informed discretion, without endeavoring to set an outer limit on its range of options.  See Lussier v. Runyon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692275\"><a href=\"/opinion/692275/thomas-r-lussier-v-marvin-runyon-united-states-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span>, 1115 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span> </span>(1995).  At a minimum, the court must discuss the evidence we have identified as troubling (or as possibly overlooked) and explain the relationship of this evidence to the issue of vote dilution.  The court need not stop there, however;  it is free to reopen the record, to take additional evidence, and/or to reconsider all (or any part) of its findings in light of the comments contained in this opinion.  To this end, while we neither require nor anticipate an entirely new trial, the court in its discretion may permit the parties to supplement the existing record with additional facts (including, but not limited to, evidence gleaned from the new round of municipal elections that have recently been completed).  See Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2577 (2d ed. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful that, in addition to the assignments of error that we have discussed, the City strenuously objects to the remedy fashioned by the court below.  We do not address this objection today.  If the district court, after further consideration, again finds that Holyoke's electoral structure violates section 2 of the VRA--and we do not intimate any expectancy in this regard--we anticipate that it will then revisit the question of how best to mold an appropriate remedy.  Withal--and, perhaps, at the expense of remarking the obvious--we offer two brief bits of general guidance that may be helpful if this contingency materializes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the court must be sure to analyze the question of remedy in light of any new findings that it makes on remand.  Second, the court now has--and should take advantage of--the luxury of time.  The court originally attempted to craft a remedy in time for the 1995 municipal elections.  That cycle has turned, and the next is well in the future.  Given this window of opportunity, the option of choice (assuming that the court finds a section 2 transgression) is to give the defendant the first chance to assemble a remedial plan.  We think it is a fundamental tenet of voting rights law that, time permitting, a federal court should defer in the first instance to an affected state's or city's choice among legally permissible remedies.

Worcester County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678514\"><a href=\"/opinion/678514/honiss-w-cane-jr-v-worcester-county-maryland-george-m-hurley-john-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span>, 927 (4th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The case at bar, for example, involves the voting patterns of the majority (loosely termed \"white\") and the specific minority symbolized by the plaintiffs (loosely termed \"Hispanics\").  Concededly, this taxonomy is imprecise;  for example, not all people who are considered \"Hispanic\" necessarily consider themselves \"non-white.\"   To that extent, then, the phrase \"white bloc voting,\" though used repeatedly throughout the decided cases, may be somewhat inaccurate or even slightly misleading.  Similarly, VRA Sec. 2 applies to denials of the right to vote on account of either race or color, yet the opinions harp on the phrase \"racially polarized voting.\"   To that extent, the idiom of the case law may neglect potentially important distinctions between the concepts of \"race\" and \"color.\"   While acknowledging these limitations, we can think of no universal solution, and, thus, take refuge in the pat terminology</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Such factors might include, for example, organizational disarray, lack of funds, want of campaign experience, the unattractiveness of particular candidates, or the universal popularity of an opponent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The proceedings below illustrate this point.

But evidence exhumed from \"white only\" elections may still be relevant in assessing the totality of the circumstances in a vote dilution case, especially if it tends to rebut the evidence of cohesion or white bloc voting extracted from \"mixed\" elections.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652881\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jenkins,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/652881/alden-jenkins-harlan-roberts-gwendolyn-neal-v-red-clay-consolidated-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1128</span></a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the district court implied that blank ballots cast in three of these four elections (the 1989 and 1993 school committee elections in Ward 2, and the 1993 city council race in the same ward) evinced white bloc voting.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Holyoke,</span> <span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">923-24</span></span>.   But the record furnishes no foundation for the implication that white voters cast blank ballots as a protest against unopposed Hispanic candidates.  In 1989, for example, the highest percentage of blank ballots was recorded in the precinct that had the highest percentage of Hispanic voters</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The district court also found that the minority community had cohered behind a non-Hispanic candidate, Elaine Pluta, in her successful 1991 bid for an at-large seat on the city council.  In fact, Pluta ranked ahead of a Hispanic candidate on Hispanic voters' ballots.  However, she received strong support from non-Hispanic voters as well;  that segment of the electorate ranked her fifth (out of sixteen) among at-large candidates.  Thus, while there may have been minority cohesion behind Pluta, the record reflects no evidence of white bloc voting against the candidate that minority voters preferred</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Success is, of course, relative;  the Hispanic candidate came close but nevertheless lost.  While some might say that close only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades, and ballroom dancing, we think that progress of this sort, even short of an electoral win, is significant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Factoring influence districts into the calculus also helps ease the tension between Congress's desire to permit vote dilution claims to be brought under section 2 and its intent to avoid creating a right to proportional representation.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gingles,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 2783-84 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing \"inherent tension between what Congress wished to do and what it wished to avoid\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> It is important to realize that influence districts serve these goals only to the extent that they reflect a meaningful opportunity for minority voters to participate in the political process.  Consequently, before the existence of an influence district is given significant weight in the balance, the evidence must reveal that minority voters in the district have in fact joined with other voters to elect representatives of their choice.  Moreover, the record must show that elected representatives from such a district serve, at least in part, the interests of the minority community and vie for its support</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
