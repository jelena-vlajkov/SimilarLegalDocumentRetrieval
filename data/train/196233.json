THE FACTS AND THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r          I.  THE FACTS AND THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r\n\n          The facts are set out in the district  court's opinion,\r\n\nsee Pye v.

Mass.  1995), and it  would serve  no useful  purpose to\r\n\nrehearse  them  here.   We  content  ourselves  with  a decurtate\r\n\nsummary, presented in a manner that recognizes the statutory edge\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Section 10(l) provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          Whenever it is  charged that  any person  has\r\n          engaged  in  an  unfair  labor  practice  [as\r\n          defined  in other sections  of the NLRA], the\r\n          preliminary  investigation  of   such  charge\r\n          shall be  made forthwith .  . . .   If, after\r\n          such investigation,  the officer  or regional\r\n          attorney to whom  the matter may  be referred\r\n          has reasonable  cause to believe  such charge\r\n          is true and that a complaint should issue, he\r\n          shall,  on behalf of  the Board, petition any\r\n          [appropriate] United States  district court .\r\n          . . for appropriate injunctive relief pending\r\n          the  final  adjudication  of  the Board  with\r\n          respect to such matter.\r\n\n29  U.S.C.    160(l) (1988).    The same  statute authorizes  the\r\ndistrict court to grant such  injunctive relief \"as it deems just\r\nand proper . . . .\"  Id.\r                                  \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n enjoyed  by  petitioner-appellee,  the Regional  Director  of the\r\n\nNational Labor  Relations Board  (NLRB or  Board), in  connection\r\n\nwith the resolution of disputed factual issues and the inferences\r\n\nthat may be drawn therefrom.\r\n\n          In  November  of 1994,  respondent-appellant  Teamsters\r\n\nLocal  Union No.  122  (the  Union), then  embroiled  in a  labor\r\n\ndispute with  August  A.  Busch  &amp;  Co.  of  Massachusetts,  Inc.\r\n\n(Busch),  organized  three  group shopping  trips.    During each\r\n\nouting, Union members descended, in droves and in concert, upon a\r\n\ndesignated retail establishment and engaged in multiple rounds of\r\n\npenny-ante purchasing, buying  small, inexpensive  items such  as\r\n\npacks of chewing gum or bags of  potato chips and paying for them\r\n\n(more  often than  not) with  bills of  large denomination.   The\r\n\nsequelae were predictable:   overcrowded parking  lots, congested\r\n\naisles, long checkout lines, and an  exodus of regular customers.\r\n\nAlthough some of the group shoppers adorned themselves with Union\r\n\nsymbols,  the record contains  virtually no proof  of objectively\r\n\nexpressive activity.  More particularly, we can find no  evidence\r\n\nsuggesting  that  the  Union, through  group  shopping,  made any\r\n\ndiscernible  attempt  to  communicate a  defined  message  to the\r\n\npublic.2\r\n\n          The three shop-ins, each involving a different retailer\r\n\nengaged  in   commerce,  occurred   at  different   locations  in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2During  one of the excursions some Union adherents remained\r\noutside  the store, holding banners aloft.  The injunction issued\r\nby the lower court does not affect that activity, and we consider\r\nit  irrelevant for  the  purpose of  determining  the issues  sub\r                                                                           \r\njudice.\r                \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n Massachusetts.   The first  incident transpired  on November  17,\r\n\nwhen  a  band  of  approximately  70  Union  members invaded  the\r\n\npremises  of  Kappy's   Liquors.    The  group   shopping  (which\r\n\nrespondent  prefers  to   call  \"affinity   group  shopping\"   or\r\n\n\"associational shopping\")  persisted for  some 45  minutes.   The\r\n\nrecord   reflects  that   at   least  one   customer,  apparently\r\n\ndiscouraged  by  the   crush  of  Union  members,   left  without\r\n\ntransacting  any  business.    The  second  shop-in  occurred  on\r\n\nNovember 23 at Wollaston  Wine.  This event also  lasted about 45\r\n\nminutes.   Approximately  125 Union  members  participated.   The\r\n\nthird incident took place on November 25 at the liquor department\r\n\nof Price Costco,  a discount house.   It involved 50 or  so Union\r\n\nmembers.  The  record does not pinpoint its duration.   All three\r\n\nepisodes began late in the afternoon (a prime time in the package\r\n\nstore trade), and  the latter two incidents occurred  on the days\r\n\nbefore  and after the Thanksgiving holiday (days that customarily\r\n\nproduce  substantial sales  for liquor  retailers).   The  record\r\n\nreveals  that on  at least  two of  the occasions  store managers\r\n\ncomplained to a Union official who was on the premises, deploring\r\n\nthe disruptive effects of the practice on their business.  On the\r\n\nthird  occasion, the  store owner  apparently  took his  concerns\r\n\ndirectly to Busch.\r\n\n          Busch displayed  little affinity for the  Union's newly\r\n\ncontrived stratagem.  It complained to the Regional Director who,\r\n\nin  turn,  initiated an  administrative  adjudicatory  process to\r\n\nexamine  whether the group  shopping constituted an  unfair labor\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n practice  prohibited  by  NLRA     8(b)(4)(ii)(B),  29  U.S.C.   \r\n\n158(b)(4)(ii)(B) (1988).   The Regional Director  theorized that,\r\n\nbecause the  Union's actual  labor dispute  was with the  primary\r\n\nemployer, Busch,  section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) expressly  prohibited it\r\n\nfrom trying to  impair the relationships of  secondary businesses\r\n\n(the retail stores) with Busch.  Resisting this line of reasoning\r\n\nand  denying any  wrongdoing, the  Union  asseverated that  these\r\n\nshop-ins were efforts to publicize  its grievance with Busch, and\r\n\nwere  thus beyond  the statute's proscriptive  reach.   The Union\r\n\nalso asseverated  that, in the  end, the group  shopping actually\r\n\nbenefitted the  retailers by  generating hundreds  of dollars  in\r\n\nsales.\r\n\n          The Regional Director refused to buy the Union's wares.\r\n\nOn  December 1,  she  invoked section  10(l)  and petitioned  for\r\n\ntemporary  injunctive  relief  in  the  federal  district  court,\r\n\nasserting that  she  had reasonable  cause  to believe  that  the\r\n\nassociational shopping  amounted to an illegal  secondary boycott\r\n\nbecause  its real  purpose was  to force  the retailers  to cease\r\n\npurchasing  beverages from Busch.  The district court, perceiving\r\n\nno  need for  an  evidentiary hearing,3  found  for the  Regional\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Section 10(l) directs that affected parties \"shall be given\r\nan opportunity  to  appear by  counsel and  present any  relevant\r\ntestimony.\"   Here,  however, the district  court found  that the\r\npapers  were sufficient.   See Pye,  875 F. Supp.  at 928 (\"Based\r                                            \r\nsimply  on the  affidavits of  the Union  representative and  the\r\nadmissions made by the Union . . ., all of the relevant facts are\r\nadmitted.\").  Although the Union's briefs appear critical of this\r\nruling, the Union  has not appealed  from it, and  we decline  to\r\naddress it  further.  See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., 916 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n731, 734  (1st Cir.  1990) (\"It is  settled in this  circuit that\r\nissues  adverted   to  on   appeal  in   a  perfunctory   manner,\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n Director.   See Pye, 875 F. Supp.  at 925-28.  In due course, the\r                             \r\n\ncourt  entered a decree  that constitutes the  actual injunction.\r\n\nIts key  provisions are  set  out in  the margin.4   This  appeal\r\n\nensued.\r\n\nII.

The section 10(l)  injunction is a special species of\r\n\nthe  labor injunction,5 designed  to halt, inter  alia, secondary\r                                                                \r\n\nactivity that the Regional Director  believes is in violation  of\r\n\nNLRA   8(b)(4)(ii)(B) until the NLRB can consider the charges and\r\n\nreach a  decision  on the  merits.

The district  court\r\n\noccupies the first tier, and just as that court must itself defer\r\n\nin  significant  measure  to  the  evaluative  judgments  of  the\r\n\nRegional Director, see,  e.g., Union de Tronquistas,  586 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n876, so,  too, must we  defer to the  district court.6   Thus, in\r\n\nthis doubly  sheltered enclave,  the judicial  task is  generally\r\n\nconfined   to  weeding   out   wholly  arbitrary   or  thoroughly\r\n\ninsupportable petitions for  relief.  See Squillacote  v. Graphic\r                                                                           \r\n\nArts Int'l Union, 540 F.2d 853, 859 (7th Cir. 1976).\r                          \r\n\n          Of  course,   an  important  reason   undergirding  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6This   layered  deference     district  court  to  Regional\r\nDirector and appellate  court to district  court   has  parallels\r\nelsewhere  in  the law.    For  example,  we have  encountered  a\r\nvirtually   identical  design   when  reviewing   district  court\r\nassessments  of  consent  decrees   under  certain  environmental\r\nstatutes.  See, e.g., United States v. DiBiase, 45 F.3d 541, 543-\r                                                        \r\n44 (1st  Cir. 1995);  United States v.

In such circumstances, we have been\r\nimpelled to note  that \"by the time [such]  consent decrees reach\r\nthis court,  they are  encased in a  double layer  of swaddling,\"\r\nDiBiase,  45  F.3d  at 544  (internal  quotation  marks omitted),\r                 \r\nreflecting not only  the district court's justifiable  mandate to\r\ndefer to administrative expertise, but also the appellate court's\r\nmandate to defer to  the trial court's factfinding  expertise and\r\nits   informed  discretion.    In  turn,  this  \"doubly  required\r\ndeference    district  court to  agency  and appellate  court  to\r\ndistrict  court   places a  heavy burden on  those who purpose to\r\nupset a  trial judge's approval  of a consent decree.\"   Cannons,\r                                                                          \r\n899 F.2d at 84.  The burden is equally heavy here.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n deferential standard of judicial review in section 10(l) cases is\r\n\nthat  neither the  district court  nor  the court  of appeals  is\r\n\nadjudicating the merits,  as such, to determine whether an unfair\r\n\nlabor practice  occurred.  To  the contrary, the courts'  role at\r\n\nthis stage is  merely to supply a stopgap, that is, to palliate a\r\n\nlikely violation detected  by the Regional Director  \"pending the\r\n\nfinal adjudication of the Board with respect to such matter.\"  29\r\n\nU.S.C.    160(l).   Consequently, a decision  in a  section 10(l)\r\n\nproceeding  is  circumscribed in  both  time and  scope,  and any\r\n\nrelief that  may be granted  is effective only while  the related\r\n\nunfair labor  practice charge is  pending before the NLRB.7   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSears, Roebuck &amp;  Co. v.

Given the design  of the statute,  the agency\r\n\nexpertise involved,  and the  two-tiered structure  of review,  a\r\n\nparty appealing  from an order  granting or refusing  a temporary\r\n\ninjunction  pursuant  to  section  10(l) confronts  the  sobering\r\n\nprospect  that  most  battles over  the  appropriateness  of such\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7Still  another reason  to accord  a  significant degree  of\r\ndeference to the claims of  the Regional Director is the strength\r\nof the congressional mandate.  See Union de Tronquistas, 586 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\nat 876.  Under the law, once the Regional Director has reasonable\r\ncause  to  believe  that  a  Union's  activity  falls  within the\r\nproscription of section  10(l), she \"shall .  . . petition .  . .\r                                                    \r\nfor appropriate injunctive  relief . . .  .\"  29 U.S.C.    160(l)\r\n(emphasis supplied).  This is in stark contrast to section 10(j),\r\nwhich grants discretion  to pursue injunctions  against employers\r\nunder specified  circumstances.   See Miller  v. California  Pac.\r                                                                           \r\nMedical  Ctr.,  19  F.3d  449,  456 (9th  Cir.  1994)  (en  banc)\r                       \r\n(recognizing  the dichotomy); see  generally Schatzki,  supra, at\r                                                                       \r\n568-71 (comparing and contrasting the provisions).\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n redress will  be won or  lost long before appellate  review takes\r\n\nhold.\r\n\n                    B.

Indeed,\r\n\n\"in  a section  10(l) case  the judicial inquiry  is only,  or at\r\n\nleast primarily, whether  there is reasonable cause  to believe a\r\n\nsection 10(l) offense has been committed.\"  Maram  v. Universidad\r                                                                           \r\n\nInteramericana de P.R., Inc., 722  F.2d 953, 958 (1st Cir. 1983).\r                                      \r\n\nOther  factors that ordinarily  inform district court  actions in\r\n\nrespect  to  temporary  injunctions are,  at  most,  of secondary\r\n\ninterest.  See id. (concluding that  \"the special importance that\r                            \r\n\nCongress attaches  to section  10(l) offenses indicates  . .  . a\r\n\nstrong presumption of irreparable harm, with the balance in favor\r\n\nof the  charging party, and  that the public interest  favors the\r\n\ninjunction\").    Hence,  the  method  of  analysis  that  governs\r\n\nappellate review  of the propriety  and scope of a  section 10(l)\r\n\ninjunction is best described as follows:\r\n\n          First, the  court must determine  whether the\r\n          Regional  Director  has reasonable  cause  to\r\n          believe that the elements  of an unfair labor\r\n          practice are  present.  In  this regard,  the\r\n          Director  need  only  show  the existence  of\r\n          credible evidence, even if disputed, together\r\n          with  reasonable  inferences,  which  support\r\n          [her] conclusions. .  . .  Second,  the court\r\n          must conclude that the legal theories  relied\r\n          upon   by  the   Director  are   not  without\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n           substance.    Finally,   it  must  find  that\r\n          temporary  injunctive  relief  is  \"just  and\r\n          proper\" in terms of effectuating the purposes\r\n          of the Act.\r\n\nUnion de Tronquistas, 586 F.2d at 876 (citations omitted).\r                              \r\n\n          Having stated the bareboned test, we next flesh out its\r\n\nthree constituent parts.\r\n\n          1.  Reasonable Cause.  The centerpiece of  the required\r                    1.  Reasonable Cause.\r                                        \r\n\nanalysis is the supportability vel non of the Regional Director's\r                                                \r\n\ndetermination that there is reasonable  cause to believe that  an\r\n\nunfair labor practice has been, or is being, committed.  The case\r\n\nlaw reveals  two principles,  in particular,  that demarcate  the\r\n\nmeaning and the margins of this requirement.\r\n\n          First,  the  Regional  Director's  evidentiary  burden,\r\n\nwhether  measured  quantitatively  or  qualitatively, is  modest.\r\n\nAlthough  courts  phrase   this  principle  in  different   ways,\r\n\nsometimes speaking in terms of the Regional Director's  burden of\r\n\nproof, see, e.g.,  Hirsch v. Building  &amp; Constr. Trades  Council,\r                                                                          \r\n\n530  F.2d  298,  302  (3d Cir.  1976)  (characterizing  burden as\r\n\n\"relatively insubstantial\"), sometimes speaking  in terms of  the\r\n\nquantum of proof,  see, e.g., Gottfried  v. Sheet Metal  Workers'\r                                                                           \r\n\nInt'l Ass'n, Etc.,  927 F.2d 926, 927 (6th  Cir. 1991) (requiring\r                           \r\n\nonly that  the Regional Director  bring forth \"some  evidence\" in\r\n\nsupport of her petition), and  sometimes speaking in terms of the\r\n\nprobative value of evidence as  opposed to its raw quantity, see,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Union de  Tronquistas, 586 F.2d at 876  (requiring that the\r                                     \r\n\nRegional Director \"show the existence of credible evidence, . . .\r\n\ntogether   with   reasonable    inferences,\"   to   support   her\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n conclusions), the  thrust of the  decided cases is uniform:   the\r\n\nRegional Director need not prove  that the respondent has in fact\r\n\nviolated  the NLRA,  but, rather,  she need  only make  a minimal\r\n\nevidentiary showing of good reason to believe  that the essential\r\n\nelements of an unfair labor practice are in view.\r\n\n          The  second principle that is germane to the reasonable\r\n\ncause  inquiry is that genuinely disputed issues of material fact\r\n\nshould be resolved at this  early stage in favor of the  Regional\r\n\nDirector's  exposition.   See Maram,  722 F.2d  at 958;  Union de\r                                                                           \r\n\nTronquistas, 586  F.2d at  876; Kaynard v.

Put another way, in proceedings under\r\n\nsection 10(l) the Regional Director  must be given the benefit of\r\n\nevery legitimate fact-based doubt.  Thus, a reviewing court \"need\r\n\nnot concern itself  with resolving conflicting evidence  if facts\r\n\nexist which  could support  the [Regional  Director's] theory  of\r\n\nliability.\"   Fleischut v.

Legal  Theory.\r                                     \r\n\nanalysis  implicates the  legal  theory  on  which  the  Regional\r\n\nDirector  relies.   The  requirement  is  straightforward:    the\r\n\nRegional   Director's  theory  need  not  be  irreproachable;  it\r\n\nsuffices if it \"is not without merit.\"  Union de Tronquistas, 586\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  877.   In other  words, the Regional  Director need  not\r\n\npersuade  the  court  then and  there  of  her theory's  ultimate\r\n\nvalidity, but she must show that the theory is presentable.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHirsch, 530  F.2d at 302  (explaining that the legal  theory upon\r                \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\n which the Regional Director proceeds must be \"substantial and not\r\n\nfrivolous\"); see also Hoeber, 939 F.2d at 123-24  (quoting Hirsch\r                                                                           \r\n\nwith  approval);  see generally  8  Theodore Kheel,  Labor  Law  \r                                                                         \r\n\n38.01[1], at 38-9 (1995).\r\n\n          3.

Thus,   temporary  injunctive  relief,   if  otherwise\r\n\nwarranted,  passes the  \"just  and  proper\" test  as  long as  it\r\n\ncomprises  a reasonable  means of  ensuring  the efficacy  of the\r\n\nBoard's final order, or preserving  the status quo, or permitting\r\n\nadministrative proceedings to go forward without undue hindrance,\r\n\nor  preventing unjustified  interruption  of  the  free  flow  of\r\n\ncommerce,  or   forestalling  the  repetition   of  unfair  labor\r\n\npractices.   See, e.g., Hoeber,  939 F.2d at 122;  Gottfried, 927\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  927; Asseo, 900  F.2d at 455; Union  de Tronquistas, 586\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  878.  In  this sense, the  purpose of the  section 10(l)\r\n\ninjunction is simply a narrower, more  specific expression of the\r\n\npurpose  underlying  preliminary injunctions  in  general.

We conclude\r\n\nthat this finding is not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          First  and foremost,  it is  reasonable  to regard  the\r\n\npractice   of  group  shopping  as  potentially  coercive.    The\r\n\ncharacter of the conduct   including  the use of all or virtually\r\n\nall  of a  store's  parking lot,  the occupation  of much  of the\r\n\ninterior shopping area,  the forbidding presence  of a throng  of\r\n\npeople acting in unison, and the fostering of long checkout lines\r\n\nthrough repeated  purchases of  small items  with  large bills   \r\n\ntends by its  very nature to  disrupt normal commercial  activity\r\n\nand, thus, to  place economic pressure on a  retail establishment\r\n\nto appease the  Union by, say, cutting back  on dealings with the\r\n\nprimary  employer.8    The  Union  counters  that,  even  so, the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The Union's insistence that the shop-ins actually generated\r\nsales for the retailers is a red herring   empirically erroneous,\r\nconceptually  incomplete, and legally irrelevant.  For one thing,\r\nsales  limited to  snacks and  individual drinks  during  a prime\r\nselling  period   scarcely  seem  economically   beneficial  when\r\ncompared  to the  retailer's  opportunity  costs,  that  is,  the\r\ndisplaced sale of liquor, wine, and other more profitable  items.\r\nSee Pye, 875 F. Supp. at  926 (\"In the regular course of  events,\r                 \r\none would expect eighty customers to spend more than four dollars\r\neach.\").   Similarly, the Union's rodomontade  utterly disregards\r\nthe  potential long-term  economic consequences of  the shop-ins,\r\nsuch as the easily envisionable loss of intimidated or frustrated\r\ncustomers.  For another thing,  it is the secondary business, not\r\nthe  Union,  that should  determine  what  is or  is  not in  the\r\nformer's  best  economic  interest.   Here,  the  record strongly\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n evidence falls  short.   Insofar as  this argument  presumes that\r\n\nmoderately obstructive conduct by a union is not alone sufficient\r\n\neither to trigger  section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) or to justify a section\r\n\n10(l)  injunction, we  accept  the  presumption.    See  National\r                                                                           \r\n\nMaritime Union of Am. v.

Because  section 8(b)(4)\r                       \r\n\nultimately  proscribes  objects  rather  than  merely  the  means\r\n\nadopted  to accomplish  them,  the  record  must  contain  enough\r\n\nevidence to permit  a finding that  the Union actually  possessed\r\n\nthe   statutorily   proscribed   object  of   forcing   secondary\r\n\nestablishments to cease doing business with the primary employer.\r\n\n          We think  that  the Regional  Director  satisfied  this\r\n\nrequirement here.

The\r\n\nUnion's conduct was undertaken in such  a way, and at such times,\r\n\nas to maximize its  obstructiveness.  And, moreover, this  effect\r\n\ncan easily be  viewed as primary  and deliberate, not  incidental\r\n\nand  accidental.  Hence,  the Regional Director  could reasonably\r\n\nhave believed  that the principal  object of the shop-ins  was to\r\n\nforce the  secondary businesses to stop trading  with the primary\r\n\nemployer.   As the  district court perspicaciously  observed, the\r\n\ngroup  shop-ins  can  reasonably be  interpreted  as  having been\r\n\ndesigned to send  a dual message to the retailers:   first, \"that\r\n\nthe Union has the ability to interfere with the  working of their\r\n\nbusiness at any time,\" and  second, that the retailers ought \"not\r\n\nto  get involved  with Busch\"  in  the ongoing  labor dispute  by\r\n\npicking up merchandise directly from Busch's warehouse.

At any rate, there\r\n\nis little or no  evidence to suggest that  the Union's object  in\r\n\nmounting  group  shop-ins   was  related  to  publicity   in  any\r\n\nmeaningful  sense, or that  the participating Union  members were\r\n\nactually engaged  in expressive activity.   In turn,  because the\r\n\ngroup shopping was not a publicity-based appeal to consumers, the\r\n\nprincipal   cases  cited   by  the   Union   which  address   the\r\n\nconstitutional and  statutory status of  such activity, DeBartolo\r                                                                           \r\n\nincluded, are  simply not  relevant to  the  disposition of  this\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n          In  the second place, section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) is in play\r\n\nas long as forcing one person to stop doing business with another\r\n\nis an  object of  the  allegedly unlawful  activity; the  statute\r               \r\n\nrequires  neither that  the proscribed  object  be the  exclusive\r\n\nobject nor even the  primary object.

Having  mulled the Regional  Director's\r\n\ntheory     that  the  Union's  group  shopping  amounted   to  an\r\n\nunlawfully coercive secondary  boycott   we  conclude that it  is\r\n\nsufficiently colorable.\r\n\n          The  legal  significance  of  the  practice   of  group\r\n\nshopping is a matter of first impression.   But, the novelty of a\r\n\nRegional Director's legal theory should rarely, in and of itself,\r\n\nforeclose  the availability  of injunctive  relief  under section\r\n\n10(l).  Novelty\r\n\ndoes  not  necessarily  signify  insubstantiality.    See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nHendrix, 592 F.2d at 442-43;  Squillacote, 540 F.2d at 858; Boire\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

The language of section 8(b)(4)(ii) \"is pragmatic in\r\n\nits application, looking  to the coercive nature  of the conduct,\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\n not  to the label which it bears.\"   Local Union No. 25, 831 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  1153   (citation  and  internal  quotation   marks  omitted).\r\n\nAlthough group shopping, as conducted  by the Union in this case,\r\n\nis a new  twist and may not  fit the traditional conception  of a\r\n\nsecondary boycott,  see, e.g., Denver Bldg. &amp; Constr.

Just  and Proper.  We come  finally to the question\r                    3.  Just  and Proper.\r                                        \r\n\nof whether the  injunctive relief structured below can  be deemed\r\n\njust  and proper  in  light  of the  relevant  factual and  legal\r\n\ncircumstances.  We conclude that it can.\r\n\n          The  district court held that injunctive relief is just\r\n\nand  proper in  this  case  because of  its  relationship to  two\r\n\nstatutory  goals:   (1) to  prevent  disruptions in  the flow  of\r\n\ncommerce, and (2) to protect innocent third parties from becoming\r\n\nembroiled  in a  labor dispute.   See Pye,  875 F. Supp.  at 928.\r                                                   \r\n\nThis  threshold   determination  rests  on  empirical  and  legal\r\n\nbedrock.  It  is indisputable that the statutory  proscription of\r\n\nsecondary  boycotts  contemplates  both  the  maintenance  of  an\r\n\nunhindered  stream of  commerce, see, e.g.,  Hoeber, 939  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n122; Union de Tronquistas, 586 F.2d at 878,  and the shielding of\r                                   \r\n\nsecondary  businesses   from  unlawful  intrusions,   see,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nInternational  Longshoremen's Ass'n, 456 U.S. at 223 n.20; Denver\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11Of course, this  ruling means only what it  says, and does\r\nnot speak to whether the Union's contrary view may prevail in the\r\nlong run.   That question is  not before us at  this time.   See,\r                                                                          \r\ne.g.,  Madden  v.

After all, \"[a] union\r                                 \r\n\nhas a right to press a recalcitrant employer within the limits of\r\n\nthe law; but, [a secondary business] has an equal and correlative\r\n\nright to  be protected from becoming a union  pawn in an end game\r\n\ndirected at some other  employer.\"  Local Union No. 25,  831 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 1152.   On  this basis, then,  temporary injunctive  relief of\r\n\nsome sort is clearly just and proper.\r\n\n          Starting from this major premise, our focus necessarily\r\n\nbecomes the  scope of  the decree that  the lower  court actually\r\n\nentered.   The  Union  tells  us that  the  decree  is vague  and\r\n\noverbroad.   We reject  this characterization.   The injunction's\r\n\nprohibitory  ambit is  quite clear  and its  contours  are rather\r\n\nspecific.     Short  of  cataloguing  each  and  every  potential\r\n\nviolation,  we  do  not see  what  further  particularization the\r\n\ndistrict court could  reasonably have inserted.   The requirement\r\n\nthat temporary injunctions be clear and specific, Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n65(d), does not  mean that they must read  like the working plans\r\n\nfor  building  hydrogen bombs.    See Pacific  Maritime  Ass'n v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nInternational  Longshoremen's &amp;  Warehousemen's  Union, 517  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1158, 1162-63 (9th Cir. 1975).\r\n\n          We likewise fail  to discern any  merit in the  Union's\r\n\nallegation of overbreadth.   The injunction carefully  proscribes\r\n\ncertain  types  of  activity,   aimed  at  secondary  businesses,\r\n\nundertaken by the Union and other denominated individuals, with a\r\n\nspecific (unlawful) intent.  No more is exigible.\r\n\n          The Union's last-ditch argument is that  the injunction\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n should  be expressly limited  in duration, particularly  since it\r\n\nwill remain operative  until the Board acts, and  that agency may\r\n\nnot reach a decision on the merits for some time.   In support of\r\n\nthis argument, the Union cites Eisenberg v. Hartz Mountain Corp.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n519 F.2d 138 (3d Cir. 1975), in which the court held that section\r\n\n10(j) injunctions, absent extraordinary  circumstances, should be\r\n\nconfined to six months in duration.  See id. at 144.  The Union's\r                                                      \r\n\nreliance on  Eisenberg is unavailing.   For one thing,  that case\r                                \r\n\ninvolves  section 10(j), not  section 10(l), and  the differences\r\n\nbetween the two provisions are not insignificant.  See supra note\r                                                                      \r\n\n7 (contrasting the  two provisions); see also Maram,  722 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n957-58  (explaining why the range of considerations affecting the\r\n\npropriety  of injunctive relief varies between sections 10(j) and\r\n\n10(l)).

There, the Eighth Circuit stated:\r\n\n\"We  find the congressional  history indicates that  Congress was\r\n\naware of the lengthy Board hearing  procedures when Section 10(l)\r\n\nwas  enacted.  Since  Congress did not  impose a time  limit on a\r\n\nSection 10(l) injunction, we find no reason why this Court should\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n impose such a limit.\"  Hendrix, 592 F.2d at 446.\r                                        \r\n\n          A  measure of adjudicatory delay is  one of the crosses\r\n\nthat contemporary  litigants must  bear.   See, e.g., Maram,  722\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d  at  960  (\"A  busy  administrative  agency  cannot  operate\r\n\novernight.  The  very fact that it must  exercise discretion, and\r\n\nthat its  decision is  entitled to  presumptive weight,  indicate\r\n\nthat  it  should  have  time  to  investigate  and  deliberate.\")\r\n\n(footnote  and citation  omitted).   Thus,  we  abjure the  Third\r\n\nCircuit's rule and hold, instead, that the question of whether an\r\n\ninjunction  issued  under  section  10(l)  should  be  temporally\r\n\nlimited    and, if so,  to what extent    is a  matter within the\r\n\nsound discretion of the district court.\r\n\n          We  add  an  eschatocol  of sorts.    By  declining the\r\n\nUnion's invitation to sponsor a per se durational rule, we  in no\r\n\nway  intend to  condone  needless  delay  in  the  administrative\r\n\nadjudicatory  process.  We anticipate that the Board will proceed\r\n\nwith dispatch  to decide the  merits of all section  10(l) cases.\r\n\nIf this prediction proves to be overly optimistic in a particular\r\n\ninstance, the Union may, if  it can make a credible showing  that\r\n\nthe Board's delay  is genuinely undue, ask the  district court to\r\n\nmodify  or dissolve the temporary  injunction.  See, e.g., Asseo,\r                                                                          \r\n\n805 F.2d at 29 (suggesting  that the Regional Director's  request\r\n\nfor  a temporary  injunction should be  taken as \"a  promise of a\r\n\nspeedy   [administrative]   disposition,   with   the   risk   of\r\n\ndissolution, or  modification, by the court, on  motion . . ., if\r\n\nthe promise  is not  kept\"); Solien, 593  F.2d at  88 (suggesting\r                                             \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n that if agency action is  unreasonably delayed in a section 10(l)\r\n\ncase,  a union  may seek  a  modification or  dissolution of  the\r\n\nchallenged injunction in the district court).\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.   The temporary injunction,  as\r\n\ngranted, is  grounded  in  the  Regional  Director's  supportable\r\n\nfinding of  reasonable cause, rests  on a credible  legal theory,\r\n\nand is suitable  in both its proscriptive reach  and its temporal\r\n\nscope.  Accordingly, we uphold it in all respects.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                27\r\r\n",

Busch  &amp;  Co.  of  Massachusetts,  Inc.\r\n\n(Busch),  organized  three  group shopping  trips.    During each\r\n\nouting, Union members descended, in droves and in concert, upon a\r\n\ndesignated retail establishment and engaged in multiple rounds of\r\n\npenny-ante purchasing, buying  small, inexpensive  items such  as\r\n\npacks of chewing gum or bags of  potato chips and paying for them\r\n\n(more  often than  not) with  bills of  large denomination.   The\r\n\nsequelae were predictable:   overcrowded parking  lots, congested\r\n\naisles, long checkout lines, and an  exodus of regular customers.\r\n\nAlthough some of the group shoppers adorned themselves with Union\r\n\nsymbols,  the record contains  virtually no proof  of objectively\r\n\nexpressive activity.  More particularly, we can find no  evidence\r\n\nsuggesting  that  the  Union, through  group  shopping,  made any\r\n\ndiscernible  attempt  to  communicate a  defined  message  to the\r\n\npublic.2\r\n\n          The three shop-ins, each involving a different retailer\r\n\nengaged  in   commerce,  occurred   at  different   locations  in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2During  one of the excursions some Union adherents remained\r\noutside  the store, holding banners aloft.  The injunction issued\r\nby the lower court does not affect that activity, and we consider\r\nit  irrelevant for  the  purpose of  determining  the issues  sub\r                                                                           \r\njudice.\r                \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n Massachusetts.   The first  incident transpired  on November  17,\r\n\nwhen  a  band  of  approximately  70  Union  members invaded  the\r\n\npremises  of  Kappy's   Liquors.    The  group   shopping  (which\r\n\nrespondent  prefers  to   call  \"affinity   group  shopping\"   or\r\n\n\"associational shopping\")  persisted for  some 45  minutes.   The\r\n\nrecord   reflects  that   at   least  one   customer,  apparently\r\n\ndiscouraged  by  the   crush  of  Union  members,   left  without\r\n\ntransacting  any  business.    The  second  shop-in  occurred  on\r\n\nNovember 23 at Wollaston  Wine.  This event also  lasted about 45\r\n\nminutes.   Approximately  125 Union  members  participated.   The\r\n\nthird incident took place on November 25 at the liquor department\r\n\nof Price Costco,  a discount house.   It involved 50 or  so Union\r\n\nmembers.  The  record does not pinpoint its duration.   All three\r\n\nepisodes began late in the afternoon (a prime time in the package\r\n\nstore trade), and  the latter two incidents occurred  on the days\r\n\nbefore  and after the Thanksgiving holiday (days that customarily\r\n\nproduce  substantial sales  for liquor  retailers).   The  record\r\n\nreveals  that on  at least  two of  the occasions  store managers\r\n\ncomplained to a Union official who was on the premises, deploring\r\n\nthe disruptive effects of the practice on their business.  On the\r\n\nthird  occasion, the  store owner  apparently  took his  concerns\r\n\ndirectly to Busch.\r\n\n          Busch displayed  little affinity for the  Union's newly\r\n\ncontrived stratagem.  It complained to the Regional Director who,\r\n\nin  turn,  initiated an  administrative  adjudicatory  process to\r\n\nexamine  whether the group  shopping constituted an  unfair labor\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n practice  prohibited  by  NLRA     8(b)(4)(ii)(B),  29  U.S.C.   \r\n\n158(b)(4)(ii)(B) (1988).   The Regional Director  theorized that,\r\n\nbecause the  Union's actual  labor dispute  was with the  primary\r\n\nemployer, Busch,  section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) expressly  prohibited it\r\n\nfrom trying to  impair the relationships of  secondary businesses\r\n\n(the retail stores) with Busch.  Resisting this line of reasoning\r\n\nand  denying any  wrongdoing, the  Union  asseverated that  these\r\n\nshop-ins were efforts to publicize  its grievance with Busch, and\r\n\nwere  thus beyond  the statute's proscriptive  reach.   The Union\r\n\nalso asseverated  that, in the  end, the group  shopping actually\r\n\nbenefitted the  retailers by  generating hundreds  of dollars  in\r\n\nsales.\r\n\n          The Regional Director refused to buy the Union's wares.\r\n\nOn  December 1,  she  invoked section  10(l)  and petitioned  for\r\n\ntemporary  injunctive  relief  in  the  federal  district  court,\r\n\nasserting that  she  had reasonable  cause  to believe  that  the\r\n\nassociational shopping  amounted to an illegal  secondary boycott\r\n\nbecause  its real  purpose was  to force  the retailers  to cease\r\n\npurchasing  beverages from Busch.  The district court, perceiving\r\n\nno  need for  an  evidentiary hearing,3  found  for the  Regional\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Section 10(l) directs that affected parties \"shall be given\r\nan opportunity  to  appear by  counsel and  present any  relevant\r\ntestimony.\"   Here,  however, the district  court found  that the\r\npapers  were sufficient.

We conclude\r\n\nthat this finding is not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          First  and foremost,  it is  reasonable  to regard  the\r\n\npractice   of  group  shopping  as  potentially  coercive.    The\r\n\ncharacter of the conduct   including  the use of all or virtually\r\n\nall  of a  store's  parking lot,  the occupation  of much  of the\r\n\ninterior shopping area,  the forbidding presence  of a throng  of\r\n\npeople acting in unison, and the fostering of long checkout lines\r\n\nthrough repeated  purchases of  small items  with  large bills   \r\n\ntends by its  very nature to  disrupt normal commercial  activity\r\n\nand, thus, to  place economic pressure on a  retail establishment\r\n\nto appease the  Union by, say, cutting back  on dealings with the\r\n\nprimary  employer.8    The  Union  counters  that,  even  so, the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The Union's insistence that the shop-ins actually generated\r\nsales for the retailers is a red herring   empirically erroneous,\r\nconceptually  incomplete, and legally irrelevant.  For one thing,\r\nsales  limited to  snacks and  individual drinks  during  a prime\r\nselling  period   scarcely  seem  economically   beneficial  when\r\ncompared  to the  retailer's  opportunity  costs,  that  is,  the\r\ndisplaced sale of liquor, wine, and other more profitable  items.\r\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1395482\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pye,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1395482/pye-v-teamsters-local-union-no-122-ibt-afl-cio/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Similarly, the Union's rodomontade  utterly disregards\r\nthe  potential long-term  economic consequences of  the shop-ins,\r\nsuch as the easily envisionable loss of intimidated or frustrated\r\ncustomers.  For another thing,  it is the secondary business, not\r\nthe  Union,  that should  determine  what  is or  is  not in  the\r\nformer's  best  economic  interest.   Here,  the  record strongly\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n evidence falls  short.

At any rate, there\r\n\nis little or no  evidence to suggest that  the Union's object  in\r\n\nmounting  group  shop-ins   was  related  to  publicity   in  any\r\n\nmeaningful  sense, or that  the participating Union  members were\r\n\nactually engaged  in expressive activity.   In turn,  because the\r\n\ngroup shopping was not a publicity-based appeal to consumers, the\r\n\nprincipal   cases  cited   by  the   Union   which  address   the\r\n\nconstitutional and  statutory status of  such activity, DeBartolo\r                                                                           \r\n\nincluded, are  simply not  relevant to  the  disposition of  this\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n          In  the second place, section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) is in play\r\n\nas long as forcing one person to stop doing business with another\r\n\nis an  object of  the  allegedly unlawful  activity; the  statute\r               \r\n\nrequires  neither that  the proscribed  object  be the  exclusive\r\n\nobject nor even the  primary object.

On  this basis, then,  temporary injunctive  relief of\r\n\nsome sort is clearly just and proper.\r\n\n          Starting from this major premise, our focus necessarily\r\n\nbecomes the  scope of  the decree that  the lower  court actually\r\n\nentered.   The  Union  tells  us that  the  decree  is vague  and\r\n\noverbroad.   We reject  this characterization.   The injunction's\r\n\nprohibitory  ambit is  quite clear  and its  contours  are rather\r\n\nspecific.     Short  of  cataloguing  each  and  every  potential\r\n\nviolation,  we  do  not see  what  further  particularization the\r\n\ndistrict court could  reasonably have inserted.   The requirement\r\n\nthat temporary injunctions be clear and specific, Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n65(d), does not  mean that they must read  like the working plans\r\n\nfor  building  hydrogen bombs.

The injunction carefully  proscribes\r\n\ncertain  types  of  activity,   aimed  at  secondary  businesses,\r\n\nundertaken by the Union and other denominated individuals, with a\r\n\nspecific (unlawful) intent.  No more is exigible.\r\n\n          The Union's last-ditch argument is that  the injunction\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n should  be expressly limited  in duration, particularly  since it\r\n\nwill remain operative  until the Board acts, and  that agency may\r\n\nnot reach a decision on the merits for some time.   In support of\r\n\nthis argument, the Union cites Eisenberg v.

The  very fact that it must  exercise discretion, and\r\n\nthat its  decision is  entitled to  presumptive weight,  indicate\r\n\nthat  it  should  have  time  to  investigate  and  deliberate.\")\r\n\n(footnote  and citation  omitted).   Thus,  we  abjure the  Third\r\n\nCircuit's rule and hold, instead, that the question of whether an\r\n\ninjunction  issued  under  section  10(l)  should  be  temporally\r\n\nlimited    and, if so,  to what extent    is a  matter within the\r\n\nsound discretion of the district court.\r\n\n          We  add  an  eschatocol  of sorts.    By  declining the\r\n\nUnion's invitation to sponsor a per se durational rule, we  in no\r\n\nway  intend to  condone  needless  delay  in  the  administrative\r\n\nadjudicatory  process.  We anticipate that the Board will proceed\r\n\nwith dispatch  to decide the  merits of all section  10(l) cases.\r\n\nIf this prediction proves to be overly optimistic in a particular\r\n\ninstance, the Union may, if  it can make a credible showing  that\r\n\nthe Board's delay  is genuinely undue, ask the  district court to\r\n\nmodify  or dissolve the temporary  injunction.

CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.   The temporary injunction,  as\r\n\ngranted, is  grounded  in  the  Regional  Director's  supportable\r\n\nfinding of  reasonable cause, rests  on a credible  legal theory,\r\n\nand is suitable  in both its proscriptive reach  and its temporal\r\n\nscope.  Accordingly, we uphold it in all respects.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                27\r\r\n</pre>",
