In  this case  ten individuals\n                           \n\nchallenge, on  a wide  variety of grounds,  their convictions\n\nand sentences following a jury  trial in the district court.1\n\nAll  ten  defendants  were  found  guilty  of  conspiring  to\n\ndistribute and  to possess with intent  to distribute cocaine\n\nand  marijuana,  in  violation  of  21  U.S.C.       846  and\n\n841(a)(1).  All defendants  except Thompson were convicted of\n\none  or  more  additional   counts  relating  to  the  ring's\n\nactivities.    For  the   reasons  that  follow,  we  reverse\n\ndefendant Grady's  conviction on one  count for  insufficient\n\nevidence  and remand for resentencing, and we sustain each of\n\nthe remaining convictions and sentences.\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\n\n     The voluminous  testimony  and other  evidence  properly\n\nintroduced at  trial, viewed in  the light most  favorable to\n\nthe verdicts, see United  States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1073, 1078-79 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492  U.S. 910 (1989),\n                                      \n\nestablished the  following facts.  In  1984, Brian Fitzgerald\n\nand Paul  Callahan--two co-conspirators who testified for the\n\ngovernment  at  trial--met  in  Walpole   penitentiary  while\n\nserving terms of imprisonment  there.  The two men  formed an\n\n                    \n\n     1The ten are Kenneth Innamorati, William Thompson, James\nGrady, Robert  DeMarco Sr.,  William Letters,  Robert Demarco\nJr., Phillip  Bargalla, James Litterio,  John Boisoneau,  and\nJoseph Gilberti.  \n\n                             -14-\n\nalliance, agreeing  that upon their release  from prison they\n\nwould begin a drug distribution network.\n\n     After their release, Callahan and Fitzgerald began  drug\n\ndealing.  In  1985, they were  approached by an  intermediary\n\nand  asked  if they  could supply  a  kilogram of  cocaine to\n\nKenneth  Innamorati  and   his  then-partner,  Noel  Bouvier.\n\nFitzgerald and  Callahan agreed to supply  the cocaine, which\n\nthey acquired  from a  source in Everett,  Massachusetts, and\n\nthen delivered  to Innamorati  in Framingham in  exchange for\n\n$55,000.   About three months later,  Fitzgerald and Callahan\n\nagreed to join forces  with Innamorati and Bouvier.   At that\n\ntime,  Innamorati's  principal  source  for  cocaine  was  an\n\nindividual in Boston.  Callahan and Fitzgerald each picked up\n\nkilograms of  cocaine from the  supplier and delivered  it to\n\nInnamorati, who weighed it, mixed it with other substances to\n\nincrease  its   volume,   and  separated   it  into   smaller\n\nquantities.  Callahan and Fitzgerald then delivered the drugs\n\nto Innamorati's customers.\n\n     After a time, Innamorati lost the services of his Boston\n\nsupplier,  and  Callahan  began  supplying   Innamorati  with\n\ncocaine from  Callahan's own sources.   Callahan made contact\n\nwith  an  individual named  Tom  Reilly in  Florida.   Reilly\n\nultimately  supplied  Callahan  and  Innamorati   with  large\n\nquantities  of cocaine and marijuana on  a regular basis from\n\nthe  summer of 1985 onward.   In June  1985, Fitzgerald hired\n\n                             -15-\n\ndefendant Grady, who drove a tractor-trailer,  to pick up the\n\ncocaine and marijuana from  Reilly in Florida and haul  it to\n\nMassachusetts.   Grady  made  this trip  about  once a  month\n\nbetween  June 1985  and February 1988,  occasionally bringing\n\ncash down to Florida to pay for prior shipments.\n\n     Callahan  and Innamorati  developed an  elaborate system\n\nfor  storage  and distribution  of  the  narcotics once  they\n\nreached  Massachusetts.   The  drugs were  stored in  several\n\ndifferent  locations.   For example,  some of the  drugs were\n\nstashed in the trunk of a  car parked in a storage unit  at a\n\nself-storage   facility   called  Hyperspace   in  Holliston,\n\nMassachusetts.  Drugs were also  stored in a rented apartment\n\nin  a  development  called  Edgewater  Hills  in  Framingham,\n\nMassachusetts.   In May  1987, a  new apartment  in Edgewater\n\nHills was  selected.   Edward Tulowiecki, an  acquaintance of\n\nInnamorati who was a star witness at trial, agreed to live in\n\nthe  apartment  and  assist  Innamorati;  Innamorati  paid  a\n\nportion of the rent for the apartment.  \n\n     This  Edgewater  Hills  apartment  became  the  base  of\n\noperations   for  much   of  the   conspirators'  activities.\n\nInnamorati and  Callahan moved  a considerable array  of drug\n\ndistribution  paraphernalia  into  the  apartment,  including\n\nscales,  a  safe and  a  freezer.   Callahan  and  Innamorati\n\nfrequently came  to  the  apartment  to deliver  or  pick  up\n\npackages of cocaine  and marijuana, or to prepare and package\n\n                             -16-\n\nthem for distribution.  Tulowiecki was  not permitted to have\n\nother guests in the apartment.\n\n     Innamorati  used  beepers  and  cellular  telephones  to\n\nfacilitate his distribution activities.   Each of the persons\n\nto whom he regularly distributed the narcotics was assigned a\n\ncode number.  To place an order, he or she would place a call\n\nto Innamorati's beeper,  and then enter  the code number  and\n\nthe quantity sought; the order  would then be transmitted  to\n\nthe  digital  display  on  Innamorati's  beeper.   Innamorati\n\npreferred   cellular  rather  than  ordinary  telephones  for\n\ncommunications  relating  to  drug  distribution,  because he\n\nbelieved that cellular telephones were more difficult to tap.\n\nWilliam  Thompson,  a former  Clinton  police  officer and  a\n\nfriend of Innamorati, acquired and installed several cellular\n\nphones for Innamorati and registered the phones in Thompson's\n\nown company name.\n\n     Innamorati distributed cocaine and marijuana to numerous\n\nindividuals  between summer 1985 and February 1988, including\n\nThompson,   William   Letters,  James   Litterio,   and  John\n\nBoisoneau;  each of  these purchasers  was assigned  a beeper\n\nnumber  in Innamorati's  system.   Callahan had  a number  of\n\ncustomers of his own during this period, including defendants\n\nRobert DeMarco Sr., Robert  DeMarco Jr., Phillip Bargalla and\n\nJoseph  Gilberti.   Generally there  was evidence  that these\n\n                             -17-\n\npersons resold  portions of  the cocaine they  purchased from\n\nCallahan or Innamorati to others.\n\n     In  November 1987  Jeffrey Scott,  a nephew  and cocaine\n\ncustomer  of Callahan  who  was  also  in debt  to  Callahan,\n\ncontacted the  Drug Enforcement  Agency (\"DEA\") and  provided\n\ninformation  about  Callahan's  activities.   This  began  an\n\nextensive covert investigation  into the  Callahan/Innamorati\n\noperation.  By late February 1988 the DEA had obtained enough\n\ninformation  to execute  a series  of search warrants  at the\n\nHyperspace facility, Fitzgerald's and  Callahan's residences,\n\nand  the Edgewater Hills apartment.   At the  latter site the\n\nagents  found  two kilograms  of  cocaine  and 75  pounds  of\n\nmarijuana,   as  well  as  drug  distribution  paraphernalia,\n\nrecords of  drugs transactions and  a small cache  of weapons\n\nand ammunition.\n\n     After a  32-day jury  trial conducted from  September to\n\nNovember  1990,  all  ten  defendants  in  this  appeal  were\n\nconvicted.  In addition  to the common conspiracy count,  all\n\ndefendants except Thompson and Bargalla were convicted of one\n\nor more  counts of  possession of cocaine  or marijuana  with\n\nintent to distribute  in violation of 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1);\n\nBargalla  was convicted  of  the lesser  included offense  of\n\nsimple possession.  In  addition, Innamorati was convicted of\n\nusing  a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense in\n\nviolation  of  18 U.S.C.     924(c)(1), and  of  conducting a\n\n                             -18-\n\ncontinuing criminal  enterprise in  violation of 21  U.S.C.  \n\n848.\n\n     The  ten  defendants  in  this  appeal  raise   numerous\n\nseparate  issues relating  either to conviction  or sentence.\n\nIn  certain instances,  claims  of error  are  made but  only\n\ncursorily discussed.  Where  appropriate we have invoked \"the\n\nsettled  appellate   rule  that  issues  adverted   to  in  a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\"  United States v. Zannino,\n                                                            \n\n895  F.2d 1,  17  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 494  U.S.  1082\n                                            \n\n(1990).  Because a  number of the claims overlap,  we discuss\n\nthem by subject.\n\n                        II.  SEVERANCE\n\n     Innamorati,  Thompson, Grady, DeMarco  Sr., DeMarco Jr.,\n\nBargalla, and Gilberti challenge the  district court's denial\n\nof their motions  to sever each of their trials from those of\n\ntheir  co-defendants.   Defendants  argue that  severance was\n\nnecessary to protect them  from prejudice and the possibility\n\nthat the jury would fail to  consider the evidence separately\n\nas to each defendant.\n\n     Prejudice  from  joinder  can  come  in  various  forms,\n\nincluding  jury confusion,  the  impact of  evidence that  is\n\nadmissible  against  only  some  defendants,  and \"spillover\"\n\neffects where the crimes of some defendants are more horrific\n\nor  better documented than the crimes of others.  But joinder\n\n                             -19-\n\nis  normally  economical--especially  where   defendants  are\n\ncharged with the same  core crime--and clear instructions can\n\noften  confine the  risk of  prejudice.   Accordingly, it  is\n\nsettled that defendants are  not entitled to severance merely\n\nbecause it would improve  their chances of acquittal; rather,\n\nsubstantial prejudice \"amounting to a miscarriage of justice\"\n\nmust  be  proved before  a  severance is  mandatory.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d 94, 96-97  (1st Cir. 1991).  We\n                   \n\nreview the refusal of a trial court to  grant a severance for\n\nabuse of discretion, United States v.  Johnson, 952 F.2d 565,\n                                              \n\n581 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied,  113 S. Ct. 58 (1992), and\n                                 \n\nwe find no such abuse in this case.\n\n     Despite the number of defendants, there is no indication\n\nof jury confusion in this case.  The government in summing up\n\nseparated the evidence as to each defendant.  The trial judge\n\ngave  the  customary   instruction,  emphasizing  that   each\n\ndefendant  must be  judged separately  based on  the evidence\n\nadmissible against that defendant.  The jury apparently found\n\nitself  capable   of  distinguishing:     it  acquitted   one\n\ndefendant--Thomas Agnitti, who is not a party to this appeal-\n\n-on the  conspiracy count and  on other counts  convicted two\n\ndefendants  (Agnitti  and Bargalla)  only on  lesser included\n\noffenses.\n\n     Innamorati aside,  none of the defendants  points to any\n\nspecific   evidence   that   significantly  inculpated   that\n\n                             -20-\n\ndefendant but was admissible only  against another defendant.\n\nIndeed,   the  core  of  the  case  was  the  alleged  common\n\nconspiracy; thus, after the necessary foundation, most of the\n\nevidence  of  wrongdoing by  one  conspirator was  admissible\n\nagainst other conspirators  as well.  Nor  is this a  case in\n\nwhich  separable  acts  of  an individual  defendant  are  so\n\ndisproportionately heinous  that there  is an  arguable taint\n\nmerely  from the association  among defendants.   In sum, for\n\neveryone apart  from  Innamorati, this  is  a  garden-variety\n\njoinder almost routine in  drug conspiracy cases.  Innamorati\n\ndoes point to evidence that he  argues was harmful to him but\n\nproperly admissible only as to another defendant, namely, the\n\ngrand  jury testimony of Thompson.   In our  view, this grand\n\njury testimony  was not  admissible against  Innamorati; but,\n\nfor  reasons discussed in part IV, we also conclude also that\n\nInnamorati is not entitled  to a reversal on account  of this\n\ntestimony. \n\n              III.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n     Thompson,   Grady,   Letters,  DeMarco   Jr.,  Bargalla,\n\nLitterio and  Gilberti argue that the  evidence introduced at\n\ntrial  was   insufficient  to  support   their  convictions.2\n\n                    \n\n     2Innamorati  also raises  this issue  in his  brief, but\nonly by asserting  in conclusory terms that  the evidence was\ninsufficient to establish his  guilt.  Ordinarily, this claim\nwould be waived but in this instance we  necessarily consider\nthe weight  of the evidence against him in part IV as part of\nour harmless error analysis.\n\n                             -21-\n\nDefendants  bear the  heavy burden  of demonstrating  that no\n\nreasonable  jury  could  have  found  them  guilty  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.  See Rivera-Santiago, 872  F.2d at 1078-79.\n                                      \n\nAn appellate court must  view the evidence in the  light most\n\nfavorable   to  the   prosecution,  \"drawing   all  plausible\n\ninferences  in  its  favor   and  resolving  all  credibility\n\ndeterminations  in line  with  the jury's  verdict.\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 730 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n112 S. Ct. 605 (1991).  We conclude that, with one exception,\n\nthe  prosecution offered  evidence  adequate to  support  the\n\nconvictions.\n\n                     A.  William Thompson\n\n     Thompson was  convicted of conspiracy to  distribute and\n\nto possess  with intent to distribute  cocaine and marijuana,\n\nin violation of 21  U.S.C.    846 and 841(a)(1).   Conviction\n\nfor conspiracy requires proof that the defendant entered into\n\nan  agreement  with  another  to  commit  a crime,  here,  an\n\nagreement   with  Innamorati   to   distribute  cocaine   and\n\nmarijuana.   United States v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942, 950 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1992).  This agreement need not be expressed; it \"may be\n\nimplicit in  a working relationship between  the parties that\n\nhas  never been  articulated  but nevertheless  amounts to  a\n\njoint criminal enterprise.\"  United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1299, 1300 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                             -22-\n\n     There was evidence--in  fact, Thompson  admitted in  his\n\ntestimony  before  the  grand  jury--that  Thompson  provided\n\n\"registry checks\" of license plates at Innamorati's request. \n\nWhen Innamorati became suspicious of vehicles that he thought\n\nwere following  him or  that were  being used  by prospective\n\ndrug purchasers, he asked  Thompson, a former police officer,\n\nto  run the plates through the state's computer registry.  If\n\nthe  registry check came back \"not on file\" or \"no response,\"\n\nInnamorati had reason to believe that the vehicle belonged to\n\na  law  enforcement  agency  and  was   being  driven  by  an\n\nundercover agent.   Thompson  also admitted that  he acquired\n\ntwo cellular telephones for  Innamorati's use which  Thompson\n\nleased in his own company's name.\n\n     Relying primarily on Direct  Sales Co. v. United States,\n                                                            \n\n319  U.S. 703,  709  (1943), Thompson  argues that  there was\n\ninsufficient evidence that  Thompson knew of the use to which\n\nInnamorati  put these  goods and  services, or  that Thompson\n\nintended  that they  be used  in that  manner.   But Thompson\n\nadmitted in testimony before the grand jury that he regularly\n\npurchased cocaine from  Innamorati when he was employed  as a\n\npolice officer from 1970 to  1978.  Tulowiecki testified that\n\nhe regularly distributed cocaine to  Thompson from Innamorati\n\nin  1987.     Thompson  was  assigned  a   beeper  number  in\n\nInnamorati's communications network.   Thompson also admitted\n\n                             -23-\n\nthat he knew that the cellular telephones he provided were to\n\nbe used to \"elude law enforcement.\"  \n\n     Thompson argues vehemently that he could not have been a\n\nfull-fledged conspirator because he was excluded from certain\n\nlocations at  which Innamorati stored his  drugs, and because\n\nCallahan  and Fitzgerald  could  not identify  him at  trial.\n\nThese  facts  do  not  defeat Thompson's  membership  in  the\n\nconspiracy.   It  is black-letter  law that  one need  not be\n\nfamiliar with every  other person  with whom he  is found  to\n\nhave conspired, nor must he participate  in the conspiracy to\n\nthe same  extent as all others.   See United States  v. Rios,\n                                                            \n\n842 F.2d 868,  873 (6th  Cir. 1988), cert.  denied, 488  U.S.\n                                                  \n\n1031  (1989); United States v.  Giry, 818 F.2d  120, 127 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 855  (1987).  Taken as a whole,\n                   \n\nthe evidence allowed  the jury  to find that  Thompson was  a\n\nknowing member of the drug conspiracy.  \n                       B.  James Grady\n\n     The   evidence  showed   that  Grady   brought  numerous\n\nshipments of  cocaine and marijuana from  Florida to Callahan\n\nand   Innamorati  in   Massachusetts.     Several  witnesses,\n\nincluding  Callahan,  Fitzgerald  and  Reilly,  described  in\n\nconsistent  detail  Grady's   practice  of  transporting  the\n\ncocaine and the cash in a tool box in the cab of his tractor-\n\ntrailer.   There was also ample evidence that Grady knew that\n\nthe shipments contained narcotics.  Fitzgerald testified that\n\nhe  told Grady that the  tool box contained  cocaine.  Reilly\n\n                             -24-\n\nrecounted one occasion on which Grady  watched while bales of\n\nmarijuana were loaded  onto his truck.  Evidence  showed that\n\nGrady  occasionally  brought  large  amounts  of  cash   from\n\nMassachusetts to Florida to pay Reilly.\n\n     In the face  of this testimony, Grady  contends that the\n\nevidence  was insufficient  to convict  him of  conspiracy to\n\ndistribute.    He argues  that  Callahan  and Innamorati  had\n\nsuppliers  other than Reilly and that even as to Reilly there\n\nwere other couriers in addition to Grady.  He also points out\n\nthat although  the conspiracy allegedly  continued from  1984\n\nuntil November  1988, the  evidence of his  participation was\n\nlimited to  the period between  June 1985 and  February 1988.\n\nBut Grady need not  have been the exclusive courier  in order\n\nto be  a conspirator, nor must  he have been involved  in the\n\nconspiracy during  the entire life  of the  operation.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  United States  v. Baines,  812 F.2d  41, 42  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1987).  We have  no trouble finding the evidence  adequate to\n\nsupport Grady's conspiracy conviction.\n\n     In addition to conspiracy Grady was also convicted under\n\ncounts  three and  four of  the  indictment of  possession of\n\ncocaine  on  February  25  and   27,  1988,  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute.    These  were  the  dates  on  which  DEA agents\n\nexecuted the  search warrants on the  Hyperspace facility and\n\nthe   Edgewater   Hills   apartment,   respectively.      The\n\ngovernment's theory  at trial  was that  Grady was guilty  of\n\n                             -25-\n\npossessing the  cocaine found  at these locations  because he\n\nhad carried that cocaine from Florida in his tractor-trailer.\n\nAlthough  Grady  was  linked  to the  cocaine  found  in  the\n\nHyperspace  facility,  we agree  with  Grady  that there  was\n\ninsufficient  evidence  that  he ever  possessed  the cocaine\n\nfound in the Edgewater Hills apartment.\n\n     Callahan  testified   that  he  gave  Grady   a  toolbox\n\ncontaining three kilograms of  cocaine in Florida on February\n\n20,  1988, and that on  February 24 he  retrieved the toolbox\n\nfrom  Grady  in Massachusetts  and  drove  to the  Hyperspace\n\nstorage  facility.  The next day, the government executed the\n\nsearch  warrant  at the  facility  and  seized exactly  three\n\nkilograms of cocaine.  It is difficult to see, therefore, how\n\nthe  cocaine  seized a  few  days  later from  the  Edgewater\n\napartment  could  also have  come  from  Grady's February  20\n\nshipment.  The government argues that Callahan also testified\n\nthat  he  brought  the  toolbox  with  him to  the  Edgewater\n\napartment after  leaving Hyperspace.    Thus, the  government\n\nsays,  \"[w]hile the evidence on  [this] score may  be open to\n\ndispute,\" that dispute was for the jury to resolve.\n\n     It  is true  that Callahan's  testimony is  unclear--one\n\ncannot  tell  whether  he   stored  the  three  kilograms  at\n\nHyperspace, or took them with him when he left there and went\n\nto  the Edgewater apartment.  But the testimony of Scott, who\n\naccompanied  Callahan,  is  clear   on  this  point.    Scott\n\n                             -26-\n\ntestified that Callahan took the cocaine  out of the toolbox,\n\nplaced it in the trunk  of the car in the  Hyperspace storage\n\ncompartment, and then left the facility with the toolbox, now\n\nemptied of its drugs.  The testimony is also clear  that only\n\nthree kilograms were  transported by Grady on  this trip, and\n\nthat exactly three kilograms were seized by federal  agents a\n\nfew days later from the Hyperspace facility.  \n\n     It is of course quite  possible, indeed likely, that  at\n\nleast some  of the cocaine  found in the  Edgewater apartment\n\nwas  a remnant  of a prior  shipment by  Grady.   But this is\n\nconjecture.  The government does not advance the theory here,\n\nnor did it  do so before the jury, and  there was evidence of\n\nother  suppliers  and  couriers.    Accordingly,  finding  no\n\nevidence  to support  Grady's conviction  for possessing  the\n\ncocaine  seized on February 27, we  reverse his conviction on\n\ncount  four.   This  may have  no  effect on  Grady's  actual\n\nsentence, since the counts were grouped and  the sentence was\n\nbased  on the  volume  of  drugs  foreseen;  but  out  of  an\n\nabundance of caution we remand his case to the district court\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n                     C.  William Letters\n\n     Letters  was convicted  of conspiracy  and one  count of\n\npossession with intent  to distribute.  He  argues that there\n\nwas insufficient  evidence to prove  he that entered  into an\n\nagreement  to distribute  narcotics.   He  concedes that  the\n\n                             -27-\n\nevidence showed a number of deliveries of cocaine to him from\n\nInnamorati (via  Tulowiecki),  in amounts  ranging from  nine\n\ngrams to, on  one occasion, as much as an  ounce (28 grams). \n\nBut Letters says that the evidence also showed that he  was a\n\nvery heavy personal user of cocaine.  He argues that there is\n\nno basis for  an inference  that he was  involved in  further\n\ndistribution of the  drugs he acquired.   Thus, according  to\n\nLetters, \"[t]he  government's  proof only  demonstrated  that\n\nLetters  was a  regular customer  of Innamorati  for personal\n\nuse.\"     We  need not  decide  when and  whether \"a  regular\n\ncustomer\" buying  for  personal use  could  be treated  as  a\n\nconspirator in a drug distribution  ring, see Moran, 984 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 1302-04,  because the evidence permitted the  jury to find\n\nthat Letters also distributed portions of the large amount of\n\ncocaine  he  purchased   from  Innamorati.    During   direct\n\nexamination of Tulowiecki, the following exchange took place:\n\n     Q.    And  how  did  you  package the  cocaine  for\n     Letters?\n\n     A.   Well, with  Bill Letters,  we would  take nine\n     grams of cocaine and  put in five grams  of cut.[3]\n     And I  grind that all  together, and it  would come\n     out  to fourteen.  And  I would put  these all into\n     individual  packages.   And  one,  another specific\n     package  for Bill  Letters  himself  that was  pure\n     cocaine.\n\n                        .   .   .   . \n\n                    \n\n     3 Various  witnesses explained  during trial  that \"cut\"\nrefers to  additives  that were  mixed  into the  cocaine  to\nincrease its volume and, potentially, its resale value.\n\n                             -28-\n\n     Q.  Why  did [Innamorati] want  you to package  the\n     cocaine this way [for Letters]?\n\n     A.   Because Billy  Letters didn't have  a scale. .\n     . .\n\n     From  Tulowiecki's reference to individual packaging and\n\nto a separate package of  cocaine \"for Bill Letters himself,\"\n\nthere  is certainly  a permissible  inference that  the other\n\nindividual  packages were  destined to  be resold  to others.\n\nThis  inference is reinforced by the use  of \"cut\" and by the\n\nlarge  volume  of cocaine  that  Letters  acquired, shown  by\n\nTulowiecki's  records to be a total of 336.5 grams of cocaine\n\nbetween June  1987 and February 1988.   Accordingly, Letters'\n\nconvictions  for  conspiring  to distribute  cocaine  and for\n\npossessing cocaine  with intent to distribute  were supported\n\nby adequate evidence.\n\n                    D.  Robert DeMarco Jr.\n\n     DeMarco  Jr. was convicted  of conspiracy and possession\n\nof  cocaine with intent  to distribute.   His  challenge goes\n\nless  to the  quantity of  the evidence  in support  of these\n\nconvictions as to its  quality.  He argues that  the evidence\n\nwas deficient because the government did not catch him in the\n\nact,  such as  by  recording his  telephone conversations  or\n\nconducting  a controlled  buy  from him,  but instead  relies\n\nentirely on \"weak circumstantial evidence.\"  The evidence may\n\nnot be overwhelming but it is sufficient.\n\n                             -29-\n\n     Both Callahan and Scott described repeated deliveries of\n\ncocaine  to DeMarco Jr.  In addition, Callahan testified that\n\nDeMarco Sr. told him that between May 1987 and February 1988,\n\nDeMarco  Jr.  was selling  ounces,  half-ounces and  quarter-\n\nounces of  cocaine to his (DeMarco  Jr.'s) various customers,\n\nand  complained that DeMarco Jr. was  putting all the profits\n\n\"up  his  nose.\"   In  addition, Scott  testified  that after\n\nCallahan  was  arrested,  DeMarco  Jr.   complained  that  he\n\n(DeMarco Jr.)  was supposed to receive the briefcase in which\n\nCallahan  had stored a quantity of cocaine to conceal it from\n\nthe DEA.  The evidence was  adequate to find that DeMarco Jr.\n\nentered into an agreement to distribute cocaine and possessed\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute it.\n\n                      E. Philip Bargalla\n\n     Bargalla was convicted of conspiracy  to distribute, but\n\nacquitted of  the substantive count of  possession of cocaine\n\nwith  intent  to distribute  (the  \"PWI\"  count) and  instead\n\nconvicted  of   the  lesser   included   offense  of   simple\n\npossession.    Bargalla  argues  that  there  was  inadequate\n\nevidence  that he entered into a conspiracy to distribute and\n\nthat,  especially  in  light  of his  acquittal  of  the  PWI\n\noffense, the conspiracy  conviction must  have resulted  from\n\nprejudicial  \"spillover.\"  Bargalla  argues that a conspiracy\n\ncannot  fairly be inferred from the  facts that Bargalla took\n\npossession of Callahan's  briefcase after Callahan's  arrest,\n\n                             -30-\n\nand was  in possession of  Callahan's car at the  time it was\n\nseized by the DEA.\n\n     The short answer is that additional evidence showed that\n\nBargalla  was a  regular purchaser  of cocaine  and marijuana\n\nfrom  Callahan and  a  distributer in  his  own right.    For\n\nexample,  Jeffrey Scott  testified  that he  made about  five\n\ndeliveries of  marijuana to  Bargalla from Callahan  in 1987,\n\nand Callahan confirmed that he sold cocaine  and marijuana to\n\nBargalla on a regular  basis beginning in late 1985  or early\n\n1986.  Moreover, there was evidence that Bargalla resold some\n\nof  the narcotics he acquired from Callahan.  Scott testified\n\nthat he saw  distribution paraphernalia -- a  small scale and\n\nchemicals  such as Inositol that are used to mix with cocaine\n\nto  increase its volume -- in Bargalla's bedroom.  Scott also\n\ntestified  that  Bargalla  complained  that people  were  not\n\npaying  him  on time  for  the  cocaine  and  marijuana  that\n\nBargalla provided them.  \n\n     This  evidence  was  more  than  sufficient  to  support\n\nBargalla's  conviction for  conspiring to  distribute cocaine\n\nand marijuana.   The  testimony concerning the  briefcase and\n\nCallahan's car merely served  to corroborate Bargalla's close\n\nrelationship with Callahan and  his organization.  The jury's\n\nfavorable treatment of him on the PWI count may or may not be\n\na  windfall but it cannot  be used to  impeach the conspiracy\n\nconviction.   See United States  v. Senibaldi, 959 F.2d 1131,\n                                             \n\n                             -31-\n\n1135 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"inconsistency in a criminal verdict is\n\nnot grounds for overturning it\").\n\n                      F.  James Litterio\n\n     Litterio  does  not  question  the  sufficiency  of  the\n\nevidence to support his  conviction for conspiracy.  Instead,\n\nhe challenges the evidence with respect to count  five, under\n\nwhich  he and  Innamorati were  convicted of  possession with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine on  or about September 2,  1987.\n\nWe find the evidence sufficient.\n\n     The  primary evidence  supporting the  possession charge\n\nwas the  testimony of Tulowiecki, who  described a four-ounce\n\npurchase  of cocaine  by  Litterio  from  Innamorati  shortly\n\nbefore  September 2,  1987.   Tulowiecki testified  in detail\n\nthat  he  and Innamorati  packaged  four  ounces of  cocaine,\n\ndelivered  the package  to Litterio,  and received  the $5300\n\npayment several  days later.  Tulowiecki  also testified that\n\nin  the course  of arranging  this transaction  Litterio said\n\nthat he wanted  the four  ounces of cocaine  for his  brother\n\nMark.    In addition,  in  January  1989 Tulowiecki  secretly\n\nrecorded  a  conversation  with Litterio  in  which  Litterio\n\nreferred to the four-ounce transaction.  \n\n     Litterio  argues at  length that  Tulowiecki's testimony\n\nwas   inherently   unreliable   and   uncorroborated.     The\n\ncredibility of  Tulowiecki's testimony  was a matter  for the\n\njury to resolve.  As it happens, there was evidence that Mark\n\n                             -32-\n\nLitterio visited James Litterio immediately  after the latter\n\nacquired the  drugs, and further evidence  that Mark Litterio\n\nwas  involved  in  the sale  of  four  ounces  of cocaine  to\n\nundercover  officers just  after James  Litterio's four-ounce\n\npurchase  from Innamorati.   The  jury could  easily conclude\n\nthat James  Litterio provided the four-ounce  package to Mark\n\nafter acquiring it from Innamorati. \n\n                     G.  Joseph Gilberti\n\n     Gilberti argues  that  evidence of  \"isolated sales\"  of\n\ncocaine from Callahan or Scott to  Gilberti is not sufficient\n\nto  convict  Gilberti of  participation  in  a conspiracy  to\n\ndistribute.   The  evidence, however,  showed more  than mere\n\n\"isolated sales;\" it showed that Gilberti was another cog  in\n\nthe Callahan/Innamorati machine. \n\n     Scott testified that  he delivered  cocaine to  Gilberti\n\nfor  Callahan   in  1986,  generally  in   one  to  two-ounce\n\nquantities.  He testified that he made approximately 25 to 50\n\ndeliveries  of  this  nature  to Gilberti  over  a  six-month\n\nperiod,   including  one   four-ounce  delivery.     Callahan\n\nconfirmed that Gilberti was one of the individuals to whom he\n\ndelivered cocaine.  Gilberti developed  a code with Scott and\n\nCallahan so  that he  could  order drugs  over the  telephone\n\nwithout detection; he would refer to \"green buckets of paint\"\n\nwhen ordering  marijuana, and  \"white buckets of  paint\" when\n\nrequesting cocaine. \n\n                             -33-\n\n     There  was also  evidence that  the distribution  of the\n\ncocaine  did  not  end  when  it  reached  Gilberti.    Scott\n\ntestified   that   he   gave   Gilberti   drug   distribution\n\nparaphernalia--  including  a scale,  ziploc  bags and  other\n\npackaging, and sudocaine, a product used to mix with cocaine-\n\n-and showed  Gilberti  how  to  use these  items.    Callahan\n\ntestified that Gilberti  told him that he, Gilberti, had been\n\ndistributing  cocaine to  an individual  named Ricky  Green. \n\nThe  evidence was adequate  to support  Gilberti's conviction\n\nfor  conspiracy  and possession  of  cocaine  with intent  to\n\ndistribute.   The same  evidence supported the  forfeiture of\n\nGilberti's property  under 21  U.S.C.    853, since  his only\n\nchallenge to that forfeiture  is that the evidence underlying\n\nthe conspiracy conviction was deficient.\n\n        IV.  GRAND JURY TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM THOMPSON\n\n     On June  22, 1988,  Thompson testified at  length before\n\nthe grand jury about the drug distribution conspiracy in this\n\ncase.  Thompson's testimony  consisted almost entirely of the\n\ngovernment's recitation of a prior statement made by Thompson\n\nto  a DEA  agent, interspersed  at intervals  with Thompson's\n\nconfirmation of  the truth of the  prior statement, sometimes\n\nwith  qualifications.   Some  of this  testimony incriminated\n\nThompson  himself,   but  a  great  deal   of  the  testimony\n\nincriminated  certain  of  his   co-defendants,  particularly\n\n                             -34-\n\nInnamorati.  Thompson was  subsequently indicted by the grand\n\njury along with the other defendants in this case.\n\n     At trial, Thompson  elected not to testify.   The court,\n\nover defendants' objections, permitted the government to read\n\ninto evidence the entire  transcript of Thompson's grand jury\n\ntestimony.   Innamorati, Grady, Boisoneau  and, surprisingly,\n\nThompson himself  claim that this testimony  was inadmissible\n\nhearsay and that its introduction was reversible  error.  The\n\ndefendants also argue that  the introduction of this evidence\n\nviolated  their   Sixth  Amendment  right   to  confront  the\n\nwitnesses against them, but this amounts to the same argument\n\ndressed in different garb.4\n\n                     A.  Admissibility  \n\n     The  basis   for  the  district  court's   admission  of\n\nThompson's grand  jury testimony  is not entirely  clear from\n\nthe record.  At one point, the court stated:\n\n     I'm going to allow . . . [the grand jury testimony]\n     in evidence and instruct the jury the conversations\n     pertaining to Thompson  are admitted at  this point\n     only against  Thompson.  Unless and  until there is\n     other   evidence  that  connects  the  other  named\n\n                    \n\n     4The  admission  of  an  out-of-court  statement falling\nwithin  a \"firmly rooted\" exception  to the hearsay rule does\nnot  violate  the Confrontation  Clause.    See Bourjaily  v.\n                                                             \nUnited States, 483 U.S. 171, 182-83 (1987);  Ohio v. Roberts,\n                                                            \n448 U.S.  56, 66 (1980).  Most courts have concluded that the\ndeclaration against interest  exception embodied  in Fed.  R.\nEvid. 804(b)(3) is a \"firmly rooted\" exception to the hearsay\nrule.  See, e.g., United States v. York, 933 F.2d 1343, 1363-\n                                       \n64 &amp; n.5  (7th Cir.), cert.  denied, 112 S.  Ct. 321  (1991).\n                                   \nThus, the  constitutional issue merges  into the  evidentiary\nquestion.\n\n                             -35-\n\n     defendants  in  this   conspiracy,  it's   excluded\n     against them.\n\nShortly  thereafter, in  response to  a renewed  objection by\n\ndefense  counsel,  the  court  ruled  that  \"the  grand  jury\n\ntestimony  of  William Thompson  is  allowed.   It's  allowed\n\nagainst Thompson.   It's a declaration  against interest, and\n\nI'll explain that to the  jury.\"  Id. at 62.   No explanation\n                                    \n\nor limiting instruction was given to the jury.\n\n     The  only argument  urged by the  United States  in this\n\nappeal to  overcome the hearsay  objection is that  the grand\n\njury  testimony was a declaration against  interest.  Fed. R.\n\nEvid.  804(b)(3)  excepts from  the  hearsay  rule, when  the\n\ndeclarant is unavailable as a witness,\n\n          [a] statement  which . . .  so far tended\n          to  subject  the  declarant  to  civil or\n          criminal   liability   .  .   .   that  a\n          reasonable  person   in  the  declarant's\n          position   would   not   have  made   the\n          statement unless believing it to be true.\n\nThompson's  invocation  of  the   Fifth  Amendment  at  trial\n\nrendered him \"unavailable\"  for purposes  of Rule  804(b)(3).\n\nSee  California v.  Green,  399 U.S.  149,  168 n.17  (1970).\n                         \n\nUnder  the  exception,  a  declaration  against  interest  is\n\nadmissible against  anyone to  whom  the statement  pertains.\n\nSee  United  States v.  Myers, 892  F.2d  642, 644  (7th Cir.\n                             \n\n1990).\n\n     Whether Thompson's  grand  jury testimony  represents  a\n\nstatement  against  penal  interest  poses the  question  how\n\n                             -36-\n\nbroadly  to define the concept  of a \"statement.\"   One could\n\ndescribe  the  entire  grand   jury  testimony  as  a  single\n\nstatement or, at the other  extreme, could subdivide a single\n\nsentence (\"John and  I robbed the  bank\") into two  different\n\nstatements to  be tested separately.   Both the  rationale of\n\nthe  exception--the   trustworthiness  of  the  unit   to  be\n\nadmitted--and our own precedents  yield no mechanical rule as\n\nto where, in between these extremes, the line is to be drawn.\n\n      A  further concern  is that,  even if  a broad  view is\n\ntaken  as to the scope of the \"statement,\" a co-defendant who\n\nconfesses to  the authorities  and inculpates another  may be\n\nseeking  to curry favor and cast the main blame upon another.\n\nThus  the \"statement\"  as a  whole may  be  very much  in the\n\ninterests of  the confessing party  who is minimizing  his or\n\nher  role.   Some  have urged  a  blanket exclusion  of  such\n\nconfessions as inherently untrustworthy; early drafts of Rule\n\n804(b)(3) excluded \"a statement or confession offered against\n\nthe  accused in  a criminal  case, made  by a  codefendant or\n\nother person implicating both himself and  the accused.\"  See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  4  Weinstein  &amp; Berger,  Weinstein's  Evidence,   \n                                                         \n\n804(b)(3) [03] at 804-152 &amp; n.42 (1992).\n\n     We need not  pursue these issues  in depth.   Thompson's\n\nlengthy grand  jury testimony contains only  a few statements\n\nthat  are  directly  against Thompson's  penal  interest--for\n\nexample,  his descriptions  of procuring the  cellular phones\n\n                             -37-\n\nand checking  license plate numbers--and even  these could be\n\ninnocent acts,  were context  ignored.  If  these inculpatory\n\nstatements of Thompson were isolated  from the rest, it would\n\nbe hard to say that the balance of the grand  jury testimony,\n\nespecially the numerous accusations against  Innamorati, were\n\nagainst   Callahan's  interest.     Thus   if  the   directly\n\ninculpatory statements are severed,  little of the grand jury\n\ntestimony would be against Thompson's interest and admissible\n\nagainst third parties.\n\n     If the inculpatory statements  are not severed, the same\n\nresult  prevails.   Taken as  a  whole the  testimony greatly\n\nminimizes Thompson's own role in any wrongdoing.  He admitted\n\na  few acts  of  logistical assistance,  doubtless hoping  to\n\nmaintain  (as  he  does   here)  that  they  were  innocently\n\nmotivated.   But the thrust  of the testimony  is that others\n\nwere  guilty of  wrongdoing from  which Thompson  himself had\n\nbeen excluded but happened to have some  knowledge.  Although\n\nlater  the extent of this  knowledge could be  turned into an\n\ninference harmful to his  interests, it is difficult  to view\n\nthe  testimony   as  a  whole  as   consciously  contrary  to\n\nThompson's self-interest at the time it was made.  \"[F]or the\n\ndeclaration to  be trustworthy the declarant  must have known\n\nit  was  against  his  interest  at  the  time  he  made  the\n\nstatement\".   Filesi v. United States, 352 F.2d 339, 343 (4th\n                                     \n\nCir. 1965).\n\n                             -38-\n\n     In  sum, the bulk of the  testimony did not qualify as a\n\ndeclaration against penal interest.  As to Thompson, anything\n\nhe said constituted  an admission  so there was  no error  in\n\nreceiving the grand jury testimony as to him.  Fed.  R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(A).   But as to  the other defendants,  most of the\n\ntestimony  was both  hearsay  and outside  the scope  of Rule\n\n804(b)(3)'s  exception.    We  need not  consider  whether  a\n\nlimiting instruction would  have been a sufficient  safeguard\n\nto allow the testimony  against Thompson but not the  others,\n\ncompare Bruton v. United  States, 319 U.S. 123  (1968), since\n                                \n\nno such instruction was given.\n\n                         B. Prejudice\n\n     Since  error was  committed in  allowing the  grand jury\n\ntestimony except as to  Thompson, the only remaining question\n\nis  whether it was prejudicial as to the other defendants who\n\ncomplain of its admission: Innamorati, Grady,  and Boisoneau.\n\nOn direct appeal, in  the case of a constitutional  error (as\n\nthis one may be viewed in light of the Confrontation Clause),\n\nthe  test for  harmless  error  is  a  demanding  one.    The\n\nappellate court  must be persuaded beyond  a reasonable doubt\n\nthat  the   jury's  verdict  was  not   attributable  to  the\n\nchallenged evidence.  See  Harrington v. California, 395 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n250, 254 (1967);  Milton v. Wainwright, 407  U.S. 371, 377-78\n                                      \n\n(1972);  United States v. Figueroa, 976  F.2d 1446, 1455 (1st\n                                  \n\nCir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1346 (1993).  \n                        \n\n                             -39-\n\n     This  test is,  and  ought to  be, stringently  applied,\n\nresolving all reasonable doubts against the government, since\n\nit comes close  to a trespass upon the jury's  function.  But\n\nthe  case law  is  clear  that,  if the  legitimate  evidence\n\nunquestionably assured  the jury's verdict of conviction, the\n\nerror in admitting other evidence is not normally grounds for\n\nreversal.  Harrington, 395 U.S. at 256; Figueroa, 976 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n1455.5    Nor  is  this  harmless  error   test  confined  to\n\ninadmissible evidence  so slight or duplicative  that one can\n\nassume that the  jury scarcely  noticed it.   The  wrongfully\n\nadmitted evidence  must be  \"quantitatively  assessed in  the\n\ncontext of  other evidence presented  . . . .\"   Sullivan, 61\n                                                         \n\nU.S.L.W. at  4519 (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante,  111 S. Ct.\n                                                \n\n1246,  1264  (1991)).   Even  where  the wrongfully  admitted\n\nevidence is singular and weighty, it can still  be \"harmless\"\n\nwhere the  legitimate evidence is overwhelming.   E.g., Clark\n                                                             \n\nv. Moran, 942 F.2d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1991).\n        \n\n     Against this background,  we conclude that  the wrongful\n\nadmission  of  the grand  jury  testimony did  not  alter the\n\ninevitable  outcome of the case against Innamorati.  We reach\n\nthis conclusion only after a  careful scrutiny of the record,\n\n                    \n\n     5Errors  that  the   Supreme  Court  deems  to   warrant\nautomatic  reversal  are  rare.     See,  e.g.,  Sullivan  v.\n                                                         \nLouisiana,   61  U.S.L.W.  4518   (June  1,  1993)  (improper\n         \nreasonable  doubt instruction);  Chapman  v. California,  386\n                                                       \nU.S.  18,  23  n.8 (1966)  (denial  of  right  to counsel  or\npartiality of trial judge).\n\n                             -40-\n\nfor  the  grand jury  testimony  inculpates  Innamorati in  a\n\nnumber  of respects  that are  neither trivial  nor literally\n\nduplicative of  other evidence.  Among  other things Thompson\n\ntestified that:\n\n     Mr.   Innamorati  sold  marijuana   while  in  high\n     school . . . .  Around 1970 . .  . [he] developed a\n     large distribution network which comprised of [sic]\n     many   residents   of   Clinton    and   Lancaster,\n     Massachusetts.\n\n     [I]n  1985  Mr.  Innamorati  was  arrested  by  the\n     Massachusetts  State Police [while in possession of\n     cocaine and  he later boasted that he] had paid his\n     attorney . . . several  thousand dollars to fix the\n     charges against Mr. Innamorati.\n\n     [I]n the fall  of 1987, [I] became aware  that both\n     Innamorati   and  Tulowiecki   purchased  automatic\n     pistols  and possessed  these  pistols when  making\n     drug  transactions.  On  several occasions, [I] saw\n     Innamorati  and  Tulowiecki before  and  after drug\n     deals and they were always carrying the pistols.\n\n     Tulowiecki  also told  [me]  that  Innamorati  sent\n     Paula [sic] Bufton  [Innamorati's companion] to the\n     corrections  facility  to  visit   Tulowiecki,  and\n     during  the  meeting, Bufton  told  Tulowiecki that\n     Innamorati put  aside one hundred  thousand dollars\n     for any legal aid that Tulowiecki would incur . . .\n     .   [Bufton told]    Tulowiecki to  be patient  and\n     don't fold.  That Tulowiecki would be taken care of\n     if he did the right thing.\n\n     Nevertheless,   the   case   against    Innamorati   was\n\noverwhelming and it is no accident that his \"insufficiency of\n\nthe  evidence\"  argument  on   this  appeal  is  confined  to\n\nconclusory assertions.  No  less than seven persons testified\n\nfrom  personal  knowledge  that  Innamorati  was  engaged  in\n\ncocaine  and marijuana  dealing, including  among others  his\n\npartners  (Callahan and  Fitzgerald),  his companion  (Pamela\n\n                             -41-\n\nBufton), and his  lieutenant and record-keeper  (Tulowiecki).\n\nDrugs and  money were  confided by Innamorati  to his  friend\n\nJames Casasanto for safe-keeping when the authorities  closed\n\nin  on  the  ring;  and drugs,  weapons,  paraphernalia,  and\n\nrecords were found in the Edgewater apartment that Tulowiecki\n\nmaintained at Innamorati's behest.  \n\n     In fact,  the case against Innamorati--who  stood at the\n\ncenter  of   the  ring's  spider  web--was   a  composite  of\n\nindividual  cases against other  ring members,  reinforced by\n\nadditional  evidence against  Innamorati.   All of  the other\n\nring members  on this  appeal played smaller  parts but  were\n\nconvicted  on the  conspiracy charge  by the  jury.   Most of\n\nthese  persons were  not  directly  implicated by  Thompson's\n\ngrand jury testimony or the testimony was at most duplicative\n\nas to them.   It defies belief that the  jury, faced with the\n\naggregate   of  evidence   against  Innamorati,   would  have\n\nacquitted him of conspiracy if  the grand jury testimony  had\n\nbeen deleted from the record.\n\n     The  remaining convictions  against Innamorati  stand on\n\nthe  same  footing.    To  establish  a  continuing  criminal\n\nenterprise under  21 U.S.C.    848, the government  needed to\n\nshow only  that Innamorati  committed a continuing  series of\n\nviolations of the federal narcotics  laws and that he managed\n\nor  organized five or more individuals.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nDavid,  940  F.2d at  732.    Without considering  Thompson's\n     \n\n                             -42-\n\ntestimony, the evidence showed continuing violations and that\n\nmore  than five persons acted at Innamorati's direction.  The\n\nindividual  possession  counts  against Innamorati  were  not\n\nsignificantly bolstered  by the  Thompson  testimony and  the\n\nweapons count--which Thompson corroborates--was  supported by\n\nample  and  untainted  evidence  from other  witnesses.    We\n\nconclude that the grand jury testimony was, as to Innamorati,\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Turning  to Boisoneau,  Thompson's grand  jury testimony\n\ncontains  only two references to him.  Near the conclusion of\n\nhis  testimony,  Thompson  identified  Boisoneau  as  one  of\n\nseveral  \"customers of  Innamorati,\" and  stated that  he was\n\npresent at  times when  Innamorati supplied cocaine  to these\n\ncustomers.    A short  time  later,  Thompson testified  that\n\nBoisoneau and  the other  \"customers\" that he  had identified\n\n\"were  just weekend users,\" as  opposed to distributors.  Id.\n                                                            \n\nat  114.    These  two  statements  were  harmless  beyond  a\n\nreasonable   doubt  in  light  of  the  abundant  independent\n\nevidence of  Boisoneau's cocaine use and  of his relationship\n\nwith Innamorati.\n\n     Tulowiecki   testified  that   Boisoneau   was  one   of\n\nInnamorati's  customers;  that   Tulowiecki  had   personally\n\ndelivered  cocaine to Boisoneau;  that Boisoneau was assigned\n\nbeeper number 004 in Innamorati's communications network; and\n\nthat  Boisoneau visited  Tulowiecki in  prison and  relayed a\n\n                             -43-\n\nmessage from Innamorati regarding the  importance of \"keeping\n\n[Tulowiecki's] mouth  shut.\"   Records kept by  Tulowiecki of\n\nInnamorati's  drug sales  showed  that Boisoneau  purchased a\n\ntotal  of  19 grams  of  cocaine between  September  1987 and\n\nJanuary 1988.   Other  witnesses, such  as Pamela  Bufton and\n\nJames  Casasanto,  also   provided  incriminating   evidence.\n\nBufton, for example,  testified that Boisoneau had aided in a\n\ndelivery of cocaine to Innamorati.\n\n     It is  fair to  say that,  as  to Boisoneau,  Thompson's\n\ntestimony (\"just  [a] weekend user[]\")  was almost favorable.\n\nThat Boisoneau was a customer no one could fairly doubt.  The\n\nadditional  detail that  made a  conspiracy  charge plausible\n\ncame  almost  entirely from  others  whom the  jury  chose to\n\nbelieve.  \n\n     Finally,  as to Grady, we have  scoured the thirty pages\n\nof Thompson's grand jury  testimony and are unable to  find a\n\nsingle  reference  to Grady.   Grady  in  his brief  does not\n\nsuggest  any way in which  he was directly  prejudiced by the\n\nadmission of this evidence.   We have no  trouble, therefore,\n\nconcluding that the admission of the grand jury testimony was\n\nharmless as to Grady.    \n\n                         V.  VARIANCE\n\n     Boisoneau argues  that  a \"variance\"  between the  facts\n\nalleged  in the  indictment  and the  facts adduced  at trial\n\nprejudiced  his ability  to defend  the charges  against him.\n\n                             -44-\n\nAlthough he uses the language of variance, Boisoneau's entire\n\nargument  is devoted  to the  contention that  the government\n\nintroduced  evidence at  trial  in addition  to the  evidence\n                                               \n\nlisted as overt acts  in the indictment and presented  to the\n\ngrand jury.\n\n     The indictment sets forth 44 paragraphs of overt acts in\n\nsupport  of the  alleged  conspiracy.   Paragraph 36  alleges\n\nthat,  between  May  1,  1987,  and  early  1988,  Tulowiecki\n\ndistributed  multi-ounce quantities of  cocaine per  month to\n\nseveral buyers,  including Boisoneau.   Paragraph 37  alleges\n\nthat Tulowiecki's  records show  that  Boisoneau purchased  a\n\ntotal of 12 grams of cocaine between September 27 and October\n\n23,  1987.   Boisoneau does not  contend that  the government\n\nfailed  to prove  these allegations  at trial.   Instead,  he\n\nargues that he was charged only with these acts, and that the\n                               \n\ngovernment   \"varied\"   from  the   indictment   by  offering\n\nadditional evidence, such as testimony that Boisoneau  placed\n\ncocaine in the trunk of a car that was to be  driven to Maine\n\nwhere Innamorati  was staying,  and testimony that  Boisoneau\n\nintroduced  Tulowiecki  to  two  individuals  who  wanted  to\n\npurchase cocaine.\n\n     Boisoneau misapprehends the  law.   The government  need\n\nnot  recite all of its evidence  in the indictment, nor is it\n\nlimited  at trial to the overt acts listed in the indictment.\n\nE.g.,  United States v. Ellender, 947 F.2d 748, 755 (5th Cir.\n                                \n\n                             -45-\n\n1991).    The indictment  charged  all  defendants, including\n\nBoisoneau,  with  engaging  in  a  conspiracy  to  distribute\n\ncocaine and  marijuana between 1984  and 1988.   The evidence\n\ncomplained of by Boisoneau falls squarely within the scope of\n\nthat  alleged conspiracy, both  temporally and substantively.\n\nThere is no variance.6 \n\n            VI.  RESTRICTIONS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n                      A.  Paul Callahan\n\n     Callahan was  originally joined  in the indictment  as a\n\nco-conspirator, but pleaded guilty  prior to trial and  was a\n\nprincipal government witness at  trial.  Defendants sought to\n\nimpeach Callahan's credibility during  cross-examination with\n\nevidence that he had engaged in a wide of variety of criminal\n\nacts throughout his life.  The jury learned from the evidence\n\nthat Callahan  had  worked  as  a safecracker,  that  he  was\n\nconvicted for a  dozen specific acts of safecracking, that he\n\nwas a bookmaker, a bank robber, a burglar, a drug dealer, and\n\na  perjurer, and that he  spent much of  his adult life--more\n\nthan  sixteen  years--in  prison.   But  the  court  excluded\n\nevidence relating to Callahan's participation in disposing of\n\n                    \n\n     6In discussing  the  supposed variance,  Boisoneau  also\nalleges that  the government  failed  to produce  exculpatory\nevidence  and  questions the  district  court's  denial of  a\nmotion  for a  bill of  particulars.   No effort  is made  to\ndevelop these issues,  however, and we  do not address  them.\nZannino, 895  F.2d at  17.   For the same  reason, we  do not\n       \ndiscuss Innamorati's  brief and conclusory  claim of improper\nvariance.\n\n                             -46-\n\nthe  bodies of  two homicide  victims in  the 1960's,  and to\n\nanother  incident  in  1970  in  which  Callahan  provided  a\n\nsilencer to another individual who later used the silencer in\n\na shooting.   Innamorati,  Thompson, Grady, DeMarco  Sr., and\n\nDeMarco Jr.  argue that this ruling  improperly limited their\n\nright of cross-examination and their Sixth Amendment right to\n\nconfront witnesses against them.\n\n     The trial judge apparently concluded that the references\n\nto the homicides and silencer,  events 20 to 30 years in  the\n\npast, were  of limited importance in  impeaching Callahan and\n\ncreated  a risk of prejudice that outweighed any benefit from\n\nthe evidence.   The use  of such ancient  evidence merely  to\n\nshow bad character for veracity is doubtful, cf. Fed R. Evid.\n                                               \n\n609(b)(10-year-old felonies presumptively  excluded), and  in\n\nthis  case  the  excluded   evidence  was  weak  and  largely\n\ncumulative  so  far as  it  cast  an  unflattering  light  on\n\nCallahan's character  for veracity.   Judgments of  this kind\n\nare  very much  within  the trial  court's  discretion.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v.  Garcia-Rosa, 876  F.2d 209,  237 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1030, vacated on other grounds,\n                                                            \n\n498  U.S. 954  (1990).   We  see  no abuse  in  excluding the\n\nevidence for this use.\n\n     There is a somewhat more substantial use that might have\n\nbeen  made of the evidence, namely,  to suggest that Callahan\n\ncould still  be  prosecuted  for  involvement  in  homicides,\n\n                             -47-\n\ngiving  the government some hold over  him.  But there was no\n\nindication when the questions were sought to be asked in this\n\ncase  that  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations   still\n\npermitted  prosecution  or,  even  if it  did,  that  federal\n\nauthorities controlled the decision as to future prosecution.\n\n It is not even clear that the prior bad acts were offered to\n\nshow that Callahan was subject to government pressure or that\n\nthis objective was squarely presented to the district judge.\n\n     In  sum,  we  do not  think  that  cross  examination of\n\nCallahan  was unreasonably  restricted.   Similarly,  since a\n\nreasonable  opportunity  to  test  Callahan's   veracity  and\n\nmotives  was   offered,  no  Confrontation  Clause  issue  is\n\npresented.     \"Once  the  defendant  has   been  afforded  a\n\nreasonable opportunity\" for such an inquiry, \"the trial judge\n\nretains broad  discretion in determining the  scope or extent\n\nof cross examination.\"  Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 237.  \n                                   \n\n                      B.  Sean McDonough\n\n     Thompson  challenges  the district  court's restrictions\n\nupon his cross-examination of  DEA agent Sean McDonough.   At\n\ntrial, McDonough  testified that the government  had lost the\n\nonly  copy  of  a  \"corrected statement\"  that  Thompson  had\n\nprovided  to  the  DEA   and  that,  according  to  Thompson,\n\ncontained material exculpatory evidence.  This  statement may\n\nhave  been  in  McDonough's  custody  at  the  time   it  was\n\nmisplaced.    On cross-examination  of  McDonough, Thompson's\n\n                             -48-\n\ncounsel  sought to show that,  in a prior  unrelated case, 86\n\nseconds  mysteriously had been  erased from an  audio tape in\n\nMcDonough's  custody.     The  trial   court  sustained   the\n\ngovernment's objection to this line of inquiry. \n\n     The intent of Thompson's  counsel in inquiring about the\n\nerased  tape  was  to  suggest  to  the  jury  that  in  both\n\ninstances--the  missing  86  seconds and  the  misplaced  DEA\n\nstatement--Agent  McDonough  had  deliberately  concealed  or\n\ndestroyed  material evidence.   Counsel  did not  proffer any\n\nproof that the missing portion of the tape had been linked to\n\nmisconduct by McDonough,  nor was there any showing  that the\n\ncorrected  statement  in  this  case  had  been  deliberately\n\nmisplaced.    Absent  a  foundation  for  this  inquiry,  the\n\ndistrict  court was  justified  under Fed.  R.  Evid. 403  in\n\nforbidding the question.\n\n  VII.  QUASHING OF SUBPOENAS OF SPRINGFIELD POLICE OFFICERS\n\n     During direct examination, government witness Scott gave\n\nthe following account of  an incident that allegedly occurred\n\nduring his cooperation with  the DEA.  On November  27, 1987,\n\nprior  to   Callahan's  agreement   to  cooperate   with  the\n\ngovernment,  two  DEA  agents   wired  Scott  with  a  hidden\n\nrecording device and brought him to  a bar to meet and record\n\na conversation with Callahan.   After the meeting, the agents\n\nagreed  to allow  Scott  to stop  by  his girlfriend's  house\n\nbefore returning to  DEA headquarters.   Scott went into  the\n\n                             -49-\n\nhouse--leaving the agents waiting in the car outside--and was\n\narrested by officers of the Springfield police department who\n\ncoincidentally were raiding the house as part of an unrelated\n\ninvestigation.\n\n     According to  Scott's  testimony, one  officer  searched\n\nScott  and found  nothing.   Then  a second  officer searched\n\nScott  and purported  to find  vials of  cocaine.   Scott was\n\ntaken to  police headquarters and charged  with possession of\n\ncocaine with intent to  distribute.  Scott testified that  he\n\ndid  not have any cocaine in his possession on this occasion,\n\nand  would never  have carried  cocaine  in such  a situation\n\nsince he knew it was standard procedure for the DEA agents to\n\nsearch him  thoroughly each time he returned  to the vehicle.\n\nScott testified that after  being released by the Springfield\n\npolice officers he contacted the DEA agents to complain about\n\nthe  arrest--he thought at first  that the arrest  had been a\n\nploy by the DEA, in conjunction with  the Springfield police,\n\nto  get him  \"under their  thumb\"--and that  subsequently the\n\ncharges were dismissed and he was not prosecuted.7\n\n     Following  this  testimony,  several  of  the defendants\n\nsought to  subpoena the Springfield police  officers involved\n\nin this  incident in an  attempt to  prove that Scott  did in\n\n                    \n\n     7The DEA agents testified  that they too were approached\nby Springfield police officers while waiting in their  car in\nfront  of the house.   Not wanting to  expose Scott's role in\nthe investigation, they quickly departed.\n\n                             -50-\n\nfact possess cocaine  on that  evening.   The district  court\n\nquashed  the subpoenas, finding  that the  proposed testimony\n\nwas inadmissible  under Fed. R. Evid.  608(b), which provides\n\nthat \"[s]pecific  instances of the conduct of  a witness, for\n\nthe  purposes  of  attacking   or  supporting  the   witness'\n\ncredibility, other than conviction of a crime as  provided in\n\nrule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\" \n\n     Defendants  argue that the  officers' proposed testimony\n\nwas not excluded by  Rule 608(b), because defendants did  not\n\nseek merely to impeach Scott's credibility through  extrinsic\n\nevidence of a  prior bad act but also sought  to contradict a\n\nspecific assertion  made by him during  his direct testimony,\n\nthereby showing  that he had lied before the jury in the very\n\ncase.   Nevertheless, the  proposed contradiction  involved a\n\nmatter collateral to the main issues in this trial, since the\n\nSpringfield  incident did not in  any way involve  any of the\n\ndefendants  or the charges against them.  A court may, indeed\n\nnormally does,  preclude a party from  proving with extrinsic\n\nevidence that a witness lied in court on a collateral matter.\n\nSee  United States  v. Tejada,  886 F.2d  483, 489  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1989); Walker v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 412 F.2d 60, 63\n                                            \n\n(2d  Cir. 1969).  Here,  the district court  was justified in\n\npreventing  a major detour  into this  essentially irrelevant\n\nepisode.  \n\n                             -51-\n\n     Defendants  say that the Springfield officers' testimony\n\nwas  relevant because it  showed that Scott  continued to use\n   \n\ncocaine  even  after  his  cooperation with  the  DEA,  which\n\nrebutted his  testimony that he contacted the  DEA because he\n\n\"knew what  we were doing  was totally and  completely wrong\"\n\nand wanted \"to  make things  right.\"  But  Scott admitted  on\n\ncross-examination that he used cocaine long after he began to\n\ncooperate  with the DEA, in fact up  until a couple of months\n\nprior to the  trial.   Thus, the Springfield  episode was  at\n\nbest cumulative evidence, and given the diversion involved to\n\nprocure it,  properly excluded as duplicative  on this issue.\n\nAny  claim by  Scott  as to  the  purity  of his  motive  was\n\nundoubtedly  discounted  by  the jury  since  Scott  received\n\n$250,000 from the government, as well as other benefits.\n\n         VIII.  BELATED PRODUCTION OF DEA NOTES, AND \n               TESTIMONY OF DEA AGENT O'BRIEN \n\n     Edward O'Brien was a  DEA agent who was involved  in the\n\nearly investigation  of this case, but  subsequently left the\n\nDEA  under  some sort  of  cloud;  the circumstances  of  his\n\ndeparture  from  the  agency  are  unclear.    Early  in  the\n\nproceedings,  the court  granted  the government's  motion to\n\nexclude any reference to O'Brien at trial, stating:  \"I don't\n\nwant  him  coming  in  and the  government  being  prejudiced\n\nagainst [sic] because they  had an agent who turned  out bad.\n\nSo we will kick that out.\"  \n\n                             -52-\n\n     On  the fifth  day of  trial, after  the court  made its\n\ninitial decision to exclude O'Brien, the  government produced\n\nto defendants notes made by  DEA Agents McDonough and O'Brien\n\nduring their  initial debriefing of Scott.   Contained within\n\nthese documents  was a  notation that arguably  reads \"driver\n\nfor Fitzgerald = Wall.\"   Grady argued that the  notes tended\n\nto exculpate him,  since he  was accused of  being the  truck\n\ndriver for the  conspiracy.   His theory was  that the  notes\n\nindicated that  the truck  driver was actually  an individual\n\nnamed  Wally  Barrett,  whose  name  had  surfaced  on  other\n\noccasions during the trial.\n\n     Grady questioned  Agent McDonough about the notation but\n\nMcDonough testified that he was not present during the entire\n\ndebriefing,  that he  believed this  particular notation  was\n\nmade  by Agent O'Brien, and that  he (McDonough) knew nothing\n\nabout it.  Grady then asked the court either for dismissal or\n\na mistrial based on the belated disclosure of the exculpatory\n\nevidence  or,  alternatively, for  permission  to call  Agent\n\nO'Brien in light of these new developments.  The court denied\n\nboth  of  these requests.    Grady  argues,  first, that  the\n\nbelated  disclosure  of  the  DEA  notes  violated  Brady  v.\n                                                         \n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and deprived him of fair trial;\n        \n\nand  second,  that the  court's  exclusion  of Agent  O'Brien\n\nfurther compounded this violation. \n\n                             -53-\n\n     We   agree  that   the   \"Wall\"   notation   constituted\n\nexculpatory  evidence  within  the  meaning  of  Brady.    It\n                                                      \n\nprovided  Grady  with  a  basis  for  arguing,  or  at  least\n\ndeveloping evidence  to show, that \"Wally\" and  not Grady was\n\nthe truck driver.   However, in cases  of belated disclosure,\n\nas  opposed   to  outright  non-disclosure,   of  exculpatory\n\nevidence,  \"the  critical  inquiry  is  .  .  .  whether  the\n\ntardiness  prevented  defense  counsel  from   employing  the\n\nmaterial to good effect.\"   United States v. Devin,  918 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n280,  290 (1st Cir. 1990).   Here, the  notation was produced\n\nearly in the trial, well before the start of defendants' case\n\n(indeed, prior to cross-examination of the government's first\n\nwitness).   We do not  believe that Grady  was prevented from\n\nmaking good use of the information or otherwise prejudiced by\n\nthe delay.8  \n\n     Although Grady  argues that  he was prejudiced  by being\n\ndeprived  of  the  opportunity  to  investigate  the   \"Wall\"\n\nreference  prior to trial, he never asked the trial court for\n\na  continuance to allow him to investigate the reference.  We\n\nhave  held it  \"incumbent  upon a  party  faced with  such  a\n\nsituation to  ask explicitly  that the  court grant  the time\n\n                    \n\n     8There is  no indication that the  notation was withheld\nin  bad  faith  or  deliberately suppressed.    The  disputed\nnotation consists of  one line in a  voluminous collection of\nnotes; the notation  itself is difficult  to decipher and  is\nsubject to different readings.   Its exculpatory nature--even\nassuming  defendants'  reading  is  the  correct  one--is not\nimmediately apparent.\n\n                             -54-\n\nneeded to regroup, or waive the point . . . .\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n493  U.S. 862 (1989).   Nor has Grady  described any specific\n\navenue of investigation that would have been pursued had  the\n\nnotation been  disclosed earlier.   Accordingly, we  conclude\n\nthat the  belated disclosure of  the \"Wall\" notation  did not\n\nprejudice Grady and does not entitle him to a new trial.    \n\n     Grady  contends that at  the very  least he  should have\n\nbeen permitted to call Agent O'Brien to the stand to question\n\nhim  about  the  notation.    The  government's   unsupported\n\nresponse that  O'Brien \"likely  had little to  add concerning\n\nthe  notes of  the Jeffrey  Scott debriefing\"  is not  at all\n\ncomforting.   What O'Brien might have added is that Scott did\n\nsay  that   the  driver   referred  to  was   Wally  Barrett,\n\ninformation  that  would  be  helpful  to  Grady  if it  were\n                                                    \n\nadmissible for its  truth.  But Scott's statements to O'Brien\n\nduring the debriefing would have been inadmissible hearsay if\n\noffered for their truth  (as opposed to impeachment).   Thus,\n\nthe  exclusion  of O'Brien  did not  prejudice Grady  in this\n\nrespect.\n\n     The  only apparent  use that  Grady could  have made  at\n\ntrial  of  the \"Wall\"  notation  would have  been  to impeach\n\nJeffrey Scott's testimony.   Scott testified that  he did not\n\nknow the name of Innamorati's driver; Grady could  have asked\n\nhim on cross-examination whether  he recalled telling the DEA\n\n                             -55-\n\nthat  the  driver's name  was Wally.    Grady sought  to call\n\nO'Brien  to the stand to question him about the notation, but\n       \n\nhe  never  sought  to  recall   Scott  for  further  cross  -\n\nexamination  once the notes were produced.  If Scott had been\n\nasked about the  \"Wall\" statement and denied  making it, then\n\nGrady might have been  entitled to call O'Brien in  an effort\n\nto prove that  Scott in fact made the  statement.  Absent any\n\neffort by  Grady  to cross-examine  Scott  on the  point,  we\n\ncannot  see  how  the  court's  refusal  to  involve  O'Brien\n\nprejudiced Grady.9\n\n                   IX.  PAYMENTS TO WITNESS\n\n     Scott,  a key  witness  for  the  prosecution,  received\n\n$250,000  from   the  government  prior  to   trial  for  his\n\ncooperation  as   well  as  immunity  from   prosecution  and\n\nenrollment in  the federal  witness protection program.   The\n\n$250,000  payment was  made pursuant  to a  DEA  program that\n\nawards  twenty  percent  of  the value  of  seized  assets to\n\nparties  who are  instrumental in  successful investigations.\n\n                    \n\n     9Grady also complains of  the district court's denial of\nhis motion for a mistrial based on a violation of the court's\nsequestration  order.    The   violation  occurred  when  the\ngovernment  permitted  Fitzgerald  and Callahan  to  converse\ntogether   in  the   prosecutor's  office   after  Callahan's\ntestimony but prior to Fitzgerald's.  The district court held\na voir dire, rebuked the government, but refused to declare a\nmistrial.   Briefly addressing this issue,  Grady provides no\npersuasive explanation for his  claim of prejudice and  we do\nnot  think that  the  trial court  abused  its discretion  in\ndenying  the mistrial motion.  See United States v. Rossetti,\n                                                            \n768 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n                             -56-\n\nGilberti argues that these benefits conferred upon Scott were\n\nso  likely  to  induce   perjury  that  they  infringed  upon\n\ndefendants'  right  to a  fair trial,  and  he points  to our\n\ndictum in United  States v.  Dailey, 759 F.2d  192 (1st  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1985),  that  \"we  can think  of  no  instance  in which  the\n\ngovernment would  be justified  in making a  promised benefit\n\ncontingent  upon  the return  of  an indictment  or  a guilty\n\nverdict.\"  Id. at 210 (footnote omitted).\n             \n\n     Subsequently in  United States  v. Cresta, 825  F.2d 538\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1987),  cert. denied,  486 U.S.  1042 (1988),  this\n                              \n\ncourt upheld  an agreement much like  that in this case.   In\n\nCresta  a government  witness was  promised $50,000  from the\n      \n\nsale  of a vessel that was to  be seized and forfeited to the\n\ngovernment as a result of  the witness's cooperation.  Cresta\n                                                             \n\nrelied  upon the facts that  the terms of  the agreement were\n\ndisclosed   to  defense  counsel   and  explored   on  cross-\n\nexamination;  there  was  substantial  corroboration  of  the\n\nwitness's  testimony; and  the court  admonished the  jury to\n\nweigh carefully the credibility of accomplice testimony.  See\n                                                             \n\nid. at 546.10\n  \n\n     Those same facts are present in this case.  The terms of\n\nthe   agreement   were  not   concealed;  to   the  contrary,\n\n                    \n\n     10See also United States  v. Wilson, 904 F.2d  656 (11th\n                                        \nCir.  1990)  (testimony  by government  witnesses  who  could\npotentially recover up to $11 million held not to violate due\nprocess), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 250 (1991).\n                      \n\n                             -57-\n\ndefendants'   counsel  questioned  Scott  closely  about  his\n\narrangements  with the  government, and  argued at  length in\n\nclosing that Scott should be disbelieved as a result of them.\n\n There was evidence to  corroborate virtually every aspect of\n\nScott's  testimony.   And the  court instructed  the jury  to\n\nconsider  carefully any  inducements or  advantages that  any\n\nwitnesses  had received.   Finally,  the $250,000  payment to\n\nScott was  completed  several days  prior to  trial, and  the\n\npayment was  thus not directly  dependent upon the  result of\n\nScott's testimony in court.\n\n     Clearly  such  immense  payments  are  troubling.    The\n\npayments  may be  for  \"information,\" rather  than for  later\n\ntestimony or convictions,  but the steps  are linked and  the\n\ninducement  to testify  in accordance  with prior  reports is\n\nobvious.   Yet  defendants are  regularly convicted  based on\n\ntestimony secured  by the prosecutor's decision  to reduce or\n\ndismiss charges  against testifying co-defendants.   In fact,\n\nCongress has enacted statutes  that directly reward those who\n\ndisclose  misconduct   and  who  doubtless  testify  for  the\n\n                             -58-\n\ngovernment in the  ensuing trials.11   In all events,  Cresta\n                                                             \n\nis the governing law in this circuit and controls this case.\n\n               X.  COMMENTS BY THE PROSECUTION \n\n     Boisoneau alleges  that he  was  unfairly prejudiced  by\n\nimproper  comments made  by  the  prosecutor  during  closing\n\nargument.  First, Boisoneau  challenges the following passage\n\nfrom  the prosecutor's rebuttal argument  at the close of the\n\ncase,  in   which  the  prosecutor  sought   to  justify  the\n\ngovernment's $250,000  payment to  Scott in exchange  for his\n\ncooperation:\n\n     What did the  government know before  Jeffrey Scott\n     walked  into  the [DEA]  in  contrast  to what  the\n     government  knew  as  a result  of  Jeffrey Scott's\n     cooperation?   And even on pure  dollars and cents,\n     consider  the amount  of forfeitures,  the seizures\n     that it led to.  But go beyond that, because if you\n     do a  cost benefit analysis you  must also consider\n     the cost  that was saved to  society by dismantling\n     an    operation like  the  one  you've heard  about\n     here. . . . \n\nBoisoneau made  no objection  to these remarks  during trial,\n\nand our review is therefore limited to plain error.

See, e.g., 31\n                                                         \nU.S.C.    3730(d) (providing for an award of up to 10 percent\nof  the proceeds of suit to any individual whose provision of\ninformation leads to government's recovery of funds under the\nFalse  Claims  Act,  31 U.S.C.     3729);  26  U.S.C.    7623\n(providing  for Secretary  of  Treasury to  make awards  \"for\ndetecting  and  bringing  to  punishment  persons  guilty  of\nviolating the internal revenue laws\").\n\n                             -59-\n\n     Boisoneau now argues that the prosecutor's statement was\n\nan improper allusion to facts not in the evidence, namely, to\n\nsome  actual   cost-benefit  analysis  commissioned   by  the\n\ngovernment  showing the  advantages and disadvantages  of the\n\npayment to Scott.   These remarks do  not suggest to  us that\n\nsome actual  cost-benefit analysis was undertaken:   they are\n\nnothing more  than an argument, using  the latest fashionable\n\njargon, that  the  payment was  reasonable  in light  of  the\n\nresults obtained.  The  prosecutor's own language--\"if you do\n                                                          \n\na cost benefit analysis\"--shows that he was merely suggesting\n\na way for the jury to look at the payment.\n\n     Boisoneau also  objects to the prosecutor's statement in\n\nclosing  that  the  trial  judge alone  would  determine  the\n\nsentences for each of the cooperating witnesses, and that the\n\njury  therefore  should not  think  that  the witnesses  were\n\ngetting  \"a walk.\"   Boisoneau  points out  that in  fact the\n\ngovernment had dismissed, or  elected not to assert, numerous\n\ncriminal  charges against  many of the  cooperating witnesses\n\nand also had promised to make motions for downward departures\n\nwith  respect to  certain  witnesses.   Therefore,  Boisoneau\n\nargues,  the  government in  fact  had  far more  significant\n\ninfluence  on  the  witnesses'  ultimate sentences  than  the\n\nprosecutor's disclaimers would suggest.\n\n     We agree that the  prosecutor's statement told only half\n\nthe story, but it is usually the function of opposing counsel\n\n                             -60-\n\nto remind the jury of the other half.   Indeed, witnesses are\n\nnormally cross-examined as to just such inducements.  Perhaps\n\nin some instances a prosecutor's incomplete version of events\n\nmight  involve   so  much   distortion   that  a   cautionary\n\ninstruction  by the trial judge  would be required.   In this\n\ninstance,  no  objection  was  made  at  the  trial  nor  any\n\ninstruction sought, and there is no \"plain error\" here in the\n\ncourt's failure to give  such an instruction sua sponte.   We\n                                                       \n\nhave   similarly  examined   Boisoneau's   other  claims   of\n\nprejudicial  error arising  out  of the  prosecutor's closing\n\narguments and find them unpersuasive.\n\n     Nor do  we see any  merit in Thompson's  suggestion that\n\nthe   prosecutor's   closing   argument  contained   improper\n\n\"vouching\" for the government's  witnesses.  The line between\n\nthe  legitimate  argument  that  a   witness's  testimony  is\n\ncredible and improper \"vouching\"  is often a hazy one,  to be\n\npoliced by the trial court in the first instance.  See United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

Here, at worst  the challenged\n      \n\nremarks  --  for  example, the  prosecutor's  statement  that\n\n\"[t]he  testimony  of the  witnesses  in  this case  is  well\n\ncorroborated  . .  . [a]nd  as a  result, you  know that  the\n\nwitness's  testimony  is true\"  --  fell  in the  grey  area.\n\nThompson  did not  object  to the  remarks  at trial  when  a\n\n                             -61-\n\ncurative instruction might have been given, and we think that\n\nis the end of the matter.\n\n              XI.  FAILURE TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE\n\n     Thompson   argues  that  his  due  process  rights  were\n\nviolated by  the government's failure to preserve exculpatory\n\nevidence,  specifically  a  DEA-6   form  prepared  by  Agent\n\nMcDonough summarizing an interview with Thompson.  It appears\n\nthat McDonough  interviewed Thompson  on March 10,  1988, and\n\nthen memorialized the interview  on the DEA-6 form.   On June\n\n22,  1988, just  prior  to Thompson's  appearance before  the\n\ngrand jury,  McDonough again met with  Thompson, and Thompson\n\nmade  certain handwritten  corrections on  the form  and then\n\nsigned it.  In  the grand jury, the government  attorney read\n\neach  statement on the DEA-6 form to Thompson, and then asked\n\nThompson to confirm the truth of the statement.  Thompson did\n\nso, making some  modifications or corrections.  The form with\n\nThompson's handwritten  corrections was lost  after the grand\n\njury appearance.\n\n     Thompson filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the\n\nground that the DEA-6 form  as corrected by him prior to  the\n\ngrand jury appearance was  material exculpatory evidence, and\n\nthat  the  government's  failure  to preserve  that  evidence\n\ndeprived him  of a fair trial.  This motion was denied by the\n\nmagistrate judge  to whom it  was referred.   The  magistrate\n\njudge's report advised the parties that pursuant to the local\n\n                             -62-\n\nrules the failure  to file written  objections to the  report\n\nwithin ten  days \"shall preclude further  appellate review by\n\nthe Court of  Appeals.\"   Thompson failed to  file a  written\n\nobjection.   The issue, therefore, was waived.  See Thomas v.\n                                                          \n\nArn, 474  U.S. 140,  155 (1985);  United States  v. Valencia-\n                                                             \n\nCopete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986).\n      \n\n     Although we  will address waived issues  where necessary\n\nto prevent  a miscarriage  of justice, we  certainly perceive\n\nnone  here.    The   corrected  DEA-6  form  was  essentially\n\npreserved by  the grand  jury testimony itself,  during which\n\nthe government attorney  went through the  form line-by-line.\n\nThe transcript of this  grand jury testimony was read  to the\n\njury at trial.  \n\n                   XII.  JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n     Several  defendants--Thompson,   Letters,  Litterio  and\n\nBoisoneau--challenge  various aspects of the district court's\n\ncharge to the jury.  \n\n     First, Thompson  argues that the court  erred by denying\n\nhis request for an instruction stating that the motor vehicle\n\nlicenses and registrations were public documents.  As already\n\nnoted, one of the crucial pieces of evidence linking Thompson\n\nto the conspiracy was his provision to Innamorati of registry\n\nchecks on the license plates  of vehicles of which Innamorati\n\nwas  suspicious.  Thompson asked  that the jury  be told that\n\n\"as a matter of law, motor vehicle licenses and registrations\n\n                             -63-\n\nare public  documents, and disclosure of  their contents does\n\nnot, in itself, violate the law.\"\n\n     The only  case on the  point cited in  Thompson's brief,\n\nDoe   v. Registrar of Motor Vehicles,  26 Mass. App. Ct. 415,\n                                    \n\n528 N.E.2d  880 (1988),  actually stands for  the proposition\n\nthat the motor vehicle  registry is not prima facie  a public\n                                                   \n\nrecord.  In any event, the government did not charge Thompson\n\nwith  stealing government secrets;  it was  enough for  it to\n\nshow that  Thompson's behavior in facilitating  access to the\n\nregistry  was part of the conspiracy.  There is no indication\n\nthat the instructions  as a whole misled the jury  as to what\n\nwas needed to convict on the conspiracy count.\n\n     Second, Thompson challenges the district court's refusal\n\nto instruct  that \"mere proof of  a buyer-seller relationship\n\nis  not enough  to convict  one as  a co-conspirator  on drug\n\nconspiracy  charges.\"    This   instruction  is  at  best  an\n\nincomplete statement of the law of conspiracy.   Depending on\n\nthe  surrounding  circumstances, a  buyer-seller relationship\n\ncould, in some cases, be the very core of a drug distribution\n\nconspiracy.   See  Moran,  894 F.2d  at  1302-04.   For  this\n                        \n\nreason,   courts  that   have  approved   the  \"buyer-seller\"\n\ninstruction  have restricted  its use to  cases in  which the\n\nevidence showed only  a single  or a very  limited number  of\n\nsales for personal  use.   See United States  v. Canino,  949\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 928, 941 (7th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1701,\n                                           \n\n                             -64-\n\n1940  (1992); United States v. Medina, 944 F.2d 60, 65-66 (2d\n                                     \n\nCir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1508 (1992).  \n                        \n\n     In  this instance,  the  gist of  the conspiracy  charge\n\nagainst Thompson was not  his drug purchases as such  but his\n\nother  affirmative  acts--notably, procuring  cellular phones\n\nand performing license plate checks--that the government said\n\nwere knowingly designed to assist Innamorati's extensive drug\n\nring operations.   We doubt whether  the instruction Thompson\n\nsought  is well  tailored  even  for  a  case  in  which  the\n\nconspiracy  charge  focuses  on  multiple  purchases  and the\n\n\"defense\"  is personal  use.   The  instruction is  even less\n\nappropriate for the case actually presented against Thompson.\n\n     Finally, Thompson complains in  a cursory fashion of the\n\ntrial  court's responses  to several  questions posed  by the\n\njury  during  its  deliberations.     For  example,  although\n\nThompson   argues   that  a   supplementary   instruction  on\n\nconspiracy was a \"misstatement\"  of law, he fails to  tell us\n\nhow  the statement  was inaccurate.   We find  no prejudicial\n\nerror here, nor with respect to  each of Thompson's remaining\n\nobjections to the judge's handling of the jury's inquiries.\n\n     Next,  Letters   says  that  the   court's  supplemental\n\ninstruction on  the definition  of \"aiding and  abetting,\" in\n\nresponse   to  a   jury  inquiry   on  the   fourth  day   of\n\ndeliberations, failed to tell  the jury that some affirmative\n\nparticipation on the  part of the  defendant is required  for\n\n                             -65-\n\nconviction.    Letters failed  to  object  to the  challenged\n\nlanguage  at trial.   Once  again confining  our review  to a\n\nsearch  for plain  error,  we find  none.   The  supplemental\n\ninstruction adequately  informed the  jury  of the  requisite\n\nlevel  of participation  required to  convict for  aiding and\n\nabetting.  Letters' underlying concern--that the jury be told\n\nthat merely purchasing  cocaine for personal use does not aid\n\nand abet the seller's  possession with intent to distribute--\n\nwas specifically  addressed by the court  in the supplemental\n\ninstruction immediately after the portion Letters challenges.\n\n     Finally, Litterio  and  Boisoneau  claim  as  error  the\n\ndistrict court's  refusal to give their requested \"accomplice\n\ntestimony\" instruction.  From reading their briefs, one might\n\nget the impression that no \"accomplice testimony\" instruction\n\nwas  provided.   In fact,  the court  admonished the  jury at\n\nlength  on the  need  to weigh  carefully the  uncorroborated\n\ntestimony  of an  accomplice and  to consider  the advantages\n\nthat  such  witnesses might  receive  in  exchange for  their\n\ntestimony.    The  court   is  not  required  to   track  the\n\ndefendants'  requested language so long as the jury is fairly\n\ninformed of the  pertinent law, United States  v. Newton, 891\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 944, 951 (1st Cir. 1989), as it was in this instance.  \n\n  XIII.  ADMISSION OF \"DRUG LEDGER\" AND TELEPHONE SUMMARIES \n\n     Thompson devotes a half page in his brief to an argument\n\nthat  the  court  abused   its  discretion  by  allowing  the\n\n                             -66-\n\ngovernment  to  introduce two  items  of  evidence: first,  a\n\n\"ledger\" and related evidence summarizing certain of the drug\n\nsales made  by Tulowiecki; and second,  evidence of telephone\n\ncalls between various  telephone numbers associated  with the\n\nalleged  conspiracy,  as  well  as  summary  charts  of  that\n\ninformation.  \n\n     The drug  \"ledger\" was  a book maintained  by Tulowiecki\n\nfor about a month  in the fall of  1987, in which  Tulowiecki\n\nrecorded  cocaine  sales,  showing  the  purchaser  (by  code\n\nnumber), the amount  of narcotics bought,  the price and  the\n\ndate.    When not  using  the  ledger, Tulowiecki  frequently\n\nrecorded cocaine sales on  slips of paper, a number  of which\n\nwere also introduced into  evidence.  In addition, Tulowiecki\n\nprepared  for use at trial a summary of the transactions that\n\nwere  recorded in  the  ledger and  on  the slips  of  paper.\n\nDefendants did not object at trial to the introduction of the\n\nledger and  original  papers, but  they did  object when  the\n\ngovernment   sought   to   introduce  Tulowiecki's   summary.\n\nThompson's brief  does not identify any  basis for concluding\n\nthat the admission of these materials was error.\n\n     The  telephone evidence  consisted of  frequency reports\n\nshowing the number of calls between various telephone numbers\n\nof persons and businesses  associated with the conspiracy, as\n\nwell  as charts  summarizing that  information.   Many courts\n\nhave  admitted this  type  of evidence  in conspiracy  cases.\n\n                             -67-\n\nE.g.,  United States v. Porter,  821 F.2d 968,  975 (4th Cir.\n                              \n\n1987),  cert. denied, 485  U.S. 934 (1988);  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nDrougas,  748 F.2d 8, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1984).  Thompson argues\n       \n\nthat  the telephone  records  did not  identify the  specific\n\npersons  who made  or  received the  calls;  but this  merely\n\nlimits and does not eliminate their relevance.  Thompson also\n\nsays  that \"testimony  and exhibits  made it  clear  that the\n\ncompilation of numbers  [in the  government's summaries]  did\n\nnot match the phone  records.\"  But Thompson fails  either to\n\nspecify  any respects  in  which the  summary materials  were\n\ninaccurate or to cite us any such \"testimony and exhibits.\"\n\n             XIV.  \"GUILT ASSUMING HYPOTHETICALS\"\n\n     Thompson  argues that he is  entitled to a  new trial on\n\naccount  of the  prosecutor's use,  in Thompson's  phrase, of\n\n\"guilt assuming hypotheticals\" during redirect examination of\n\nLancaster  Police   Chief   Eric  Mcavene.     During   cross\n\nexamination   of  Mcavene,   Thompson's  counsel   sought  to\n\nestablish that it was  a common practice for police  officers\n\nto  run  registry checks  on  license plates,  and  that such\n\nchecks  were  done  for   many  different  reasons  including\n\nrequests  from the  public.   Mcavene admitted  that registry\n\nchecks  were conducted for a  variety of reasons  and that he\n\nwas not consulted in every instance.\n\n     In  response, government  counsel  sought to  dispel the\n\nnotion  that  registry information  was  freely disseminated.\n\n                             -68-\n\nPursuing that  theme, the  prosecutor asked Mcavene,  \"[I]f a\n\nknown drug dealer had  asked you for a Registry  check, would\n\nyou do  it for him?\"   Before  the witness could  answer, the\n\ncourt  upon objection  ruled (mistakenly) that  this question\n\nhad already been asked.   The prosecutor acquiesced and moved\n\non to his next inquiry:  \"[I]f William Thompson had asked you\n\nfor the Registry check  would you have  done it?\"  The  court\n\nsustained Thompson's objection  to this question, struck  the\n\nquestion, and denied Thompson's motion for a mistrial.\n\n     It may be a close call whether either of these questions\n\nwas improper as an implied assertion that Thompson was a drug\n\ndealer,  but we  need  not pursue  the issue.   Even  if both\n\nquestions were error,  they did not  conceivably have such  a\n\nprejudicial impact as to  require reversal.  Neither question\n\nwas answered  by  the  witness,  one was  stricken  from  the\n\nrecord,  and the  court  elsewhere instructed  the jury  that\n\nstatements of counsel are not  evidence.  The precise  limits\n\non who could obtain  registry checks was largely a  side-show\n\nand Mcavene's attitude toward disclosure was a subject raised\n\nby Thompson's own counsel.\n\n                 XV.  MARK LITTERIO EVIDENCE \n\n     Litterio argues  that the court erred  by permitting the\n\ngovernment  to  introduce  evidence  of  a  drug  transaction\n\ninvolving  Litterio's brother,  Mark Litterio,  as well  as a\n\nstatement  made by  Mark Litterio  to an  undercover officer.\n\n                             -69-\n\nLitterio was convicted under count five of the indictment for\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  The primary\n\nevidence was  Tulowiecki's testimony that  Litterio purchased\n\nfour ounces  of cocaine from Innamorati in  late August 1987.\n\nAccording to  Tulowiecki, Litterio  said at  the time  of the\n\npurchase that he was buying the cocaine for his brother Mark.\n\nTo  corroborate  this   testimony,  the  government   offered\n\ntestimony from a parade of police officers  showing that Mark\n\nLitterio  and an accomplice were involved in the sale of four\n\nounces of  cocaine just after James  Litterio's purchase from\n\nInnamorati.\n\n     Although the evidence of  the Mark Litterio  transaction\n\nwas a major detour,  the evidence was relevant to  the charge\n\nagainst  Litterio in count five.  The fact that Mark Litterio\n\nsold  four ounces of cocaine to  undercover agents just after\n\nJames  Litterio  bought  the  same  amount   from  Innamorati\n\nstrongly  corroborated  Tulowiecki's  testimony.    The  only\n\n\"prejudice\" was  the potential for distracting  the jury with\n\ndetails of an uncharged  crime, and this judgment  is largely\n\nwithin  the discretion of the trial judge.  See United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Bonneau, 970 F.2d 929, 935 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"only rarely--\n          \n\nand  in extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" should this\n\ncourt  \"reverse  a  district  court's   on-the-spot  judgment\n\nconcerning  the  relative  weighing  of  probative  value and\n\nunfair effect\").\n\n                             -70-\n\n     Litterio  also  challenges  as  hearsay  the  admission,\n\nthrough  the testimony of one of the officers involved in the\n\nMark  Litterio undercover  investigation, of  Mark Litterio's\n\ncontemporaneous  statement that  he was doing  the four-ounce\n\ncocaine  deal  with  his brother  \"Mickey\"  (James Litterio's\n\nnickname).   This statement, however, was  admissible against\n\nLitterio  under Fed.  R. Evid.  801(d)(2)(E), which  excludes\n\nfrom   the  definition   of   hearsay  \"a   statement  by   a\n\ncoconspirator  of  a  party  during  the  course  of  and  in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\"   Litterio objects that there\n\nis nothing  to show  that Mark  himself was  a member  of the\n\nInnamorati ring.  But based  on this single transaction James\n\nand Mark  Litterio were evidently engaged in  a conspiracy in\n\nwhich  James   supplied,  and  Mark  sold,   four  ounces  of\n\ncocaine.12    Mark  Litterio's  statement to  the  undercover\n\nofficers  was in  furtherance  of it.    Whether this  was  a\n\nseparate  conspiracy   or  part  of   the  larger  Innamorati\n\nconspiracy makes no difference so far as the admissibility of\n\nthe statement against James Litterio is concerned.\n\n              XVI.  REFERENCES TO \"THE DEMARCOS\"\n\n                    \n\n     12Mark  Litterio's statement itself may be considered in\ndetermining  admissibility, see  Bourjaily v.  United States,\n                                                            \n483 U.S. at 178-79,  and in addition there was  evidence that\nJames Litterio stated to  Tulowiecki that he (James Litterio)\nneeded  the four ounces for  his brother Mark,  and that Mark\nLitterio was  followed to James  Litterio's house immediately\nafter James Litterio received the drugs from Tulowiecki.\n\n                             -71-\n\n     Robert DeMarco Jr. argues that he was deprived of a fair\n\ntrial  by repeated references to \"the DeMarcos.\"  He contends\n\nthat  these   collective  references  deprived   him  of   an\n\nindividual  adjudication of  guilt or innocence,  and instead\n\ngrouped him together with his father as a single entity.\n\n     We have examined the record and conclude that the phrase\n\n\"the  DeMarcos\" was  used as  a substitute  for  \"both Robert\n\nDeMarco Sr. and Robert  DeMarco Jr.,\" and that this  was made\n\nclear  to the jury.   For  example, in  one of  the instances\n\ncited by Demarco Jr.,  Callahan testified that he distributed\n\nportions of  two half-kilograms of cocaine  to, among others,\n\n\"the Demarcos.\"   Upon counsel's objection  to the collective\n\nreference, the  prosecutor asked  whether Robert  DeMarco Sr.\n\nand Robert DeMarco  Jr. \"were  both present\" at  the time  of\n\nthis distribution, and Callahan replied, \"Yes.\"\n\n     A witness may testify that two persons jointly performed\n\na  given  act so  long as  confusion is  avoided.   Here, the\n\nwitness was merely using  the shorthand phrase \"the DeMarcos\"\n\nto  refer to \"both Robert DeMarco Sr. and Robert DeMarco Jr.\"\n\nWhen counsel  objected, the  witness made clear  his meaning.\n\nWe have examined the other instances cited by DeMarco Jr. and\n\nfind them to be equally lacking in confusion or prejudice.\n\n                 XVII.  EX PARTE PROCEEDINGS\n                                \n\n     After  the trial  concluded,  the government  discovered\n\ninformation  in its  possession that  related to  an incident\n\n                             -72-\n\nrecounted during the trial testimony of a government witness.\n\nAlthough the government believed that the information was not\n\nBrady material,  it did not  wish to conceal  the information\n     \n\nfrom  the   court  or  take  the   final  responsibility  for\n\nappraising its importance.  At  the same time, the government\n\nfeared  that   release  of  the  information   would  pose  a\n\nsubstantial danger of serious harm.\n\n     Accordingly, the government submitted the information to\n\nthe district  court ex parte,  described the reasons  for its\n                            \n\nposition  and  explained  why  it  feared  disclosure.    The\n\ndistrict court  ruled that  the information was  not material\n\nand  that the  government's justification  for non-disclosure\n\nwas  persuasive.    The   district  court  sealed  its  order\n\ncontaining these  rulings.   At no  time during  this episode\n\nwere  defendants  or  their   counsel  made  aware  of  these\n\nproceedings or of the court's order.\n\n     The government's  submission  and the  district  court's\n\norder  were forwarded  to  this  court  and  brought  to  the\n\nattention of this panel.   This court in turn issued an order\n\non  November 18, 1992,  informing all defense  counsel of the\n\nexistence  of the  ex parte  proceedings.   Not surprisingly,\n                           \n\ndefendants have  moved for disclosure of  the information, or\n\nat the very least a synopsis of the information  so that they\n\nmay argue  intelligently as to  its materiality and  the need\n\nfor disclosure.   Certain defendants also  argue that the  ex\n                                                             \n\n                             -73-\n\nparte procedures utilized by the district court deprived them\n     \n\nof a fair trial.\n\n     We sympathize  with defendants' protestations  and agree\n\nthat  the procedures  utilized in  this case  raise extremely\n\nserious  issues.  Outside of emergencies, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n                                             \n\n65(b) (temporary restraining orders), the ex parte submission\n                                                  \n\nof  information from  a party  to the  court and  the court's\n\nruling on that information without notice to or participation\n\nof  the opposing  party  is fundamentally  at  odds with  our\n\ntraditions  of jurisprudence,   Haller  v. Robbins,  409 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n857, 859  (1st Cir. 1969), and  can be justified only  in the\n\nmost  extraordinary  circumstances.   Nevertheless,  in  rare\n\nsituations  requirements  of  confidentiality   outweigh  the\n\ninterest in adversarial litigation and permit a court to rule\n\non  an  issue  in  camera  without  the  participation of  an\n                         \n\ninterested party.\n\n     For example, in United States v. Perkins,  926 F.2d 1271\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir. 1991),  the government possessed  information that\n\nwas  arguably useful  to  impeach a  government witness,  but\n\nwhose disclosure  would have jeopardized an  ongoing criminal\n\ninvestigation.   The government submitted the  information to\n\nthe district  court for  an  in camera  determination of  its\n                                      \n\nmateriality.   The court  concluded that the  information was\n\nnot material  and  need  not  be disclosed.    After  trial--\n\npresumably after the threat to the investigation had ceased--\n\n                             -74-\n\nthe  government's ex  parte submission  was unsealed  and the\n                           \n\ndefendant was for the first time apprised of the information.\n\nOn appeal we upheld the court's finding of immateriality and,\n\nimplicitly, the procedure employed.\n\n     There are  other examples.   Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 16(d)(1)\n\nexpressly  authorizes   the  court   to  deny   discovery  of\n\ninformation sought  by  a  defendant based  on  an  ex  parte\n                                                             \n\nshowing    by    the    government    of   the    need    for\n\nconfidentiality.13    The  Classified Information  Procedures\n\nAct,  18 U.S.C. App.    1-16, permits the ex parte submission\n                                                  \n\nof  affidavits by the  government in support  of a protective\n\norder  authorizing the  non-disclosure  of national  security\n\ninformation.  See United States v. Pringle, 751 F.2d 419, 427\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1984).  And under  Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154\n                                               \n\n(1978),  courts often  make  an in  camera assessment  of the\n                                          \n\nveracity of a confidential  government informant and the harm\n\nfrom revealing his identity.  See United  States v. Southard,\n                                                            \n\n700  F.2d  1, 10-11  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 464  U.S. 88\n                                               \n\n(1983).\n\n     The  present  case  is  unusual because  not  only  were\n\ndefendants denied  access to  the material  but they  did not\n\neven know of its submission to the court.  We  agree that the\n\n                    \n\n     13See e.g., United States v.  Napue, 834 F.2d 1311, 1317\n                                        \n(7th Cir.  1987)  (approving this  procedure  in  appropriate\ncases).   Rule 16(d)(1) requires  the court  to preserve  the\nrecords of the ex parte communication for the appellate court\n                       \nin the event of an appeal, as was done in this case.\n\n                             -75-\n\nsecret  submission  to  the  court is  especially  dangerous,\n\ndepriving  the  opponent even  of  the  opportunity to  argue\n\ngenerally  against the  need for  secrecy.   Yet there  is no\n\nquestion here  of  convictions  based  upon  secret  evidence\n\nfurnished to the factfinder but withheld from the defendants.\n\nWhat  the government did was to provide material to the court\n\nto permit the court to determine whether under applicable law\n\nthe material needed  to be  produced to the  other side  and,\n\ncollaterally, to  determine  whether there  was a  legitimate\n\nreason for continued secrecy in the submission.\n\n     Each  of the three  judges on this  panel has considered\n\nthe information  in this  case bearing  on these  two issues.\n\nOur standard in this inquiry was to resolve every  legitimate\n\ndoubt in favor of the defendants precisely because they could\n\nnot argue  the matter for  themselves.  We  nevertheless have\n\nconcluded that there was a substantial threat of serious harm\n\nwarranting  the initial  examination  by the  district  court\n\nwithout  notice to  defendants;  that the  threat has  abated\n\nsufficiently to justify notice to the  defendants now but not\n\nthe  disclosure  of  the  information itself;  and  that  the\n\ninformation, whether or not technically Brady material, would\n                                             \n\nnot  have significantly  assisted any  of the  defendants and\n\ncould not conceivably have altered any of the verdicts.\n\n     As  for  the  government's  action  in  submitting   the\n\ninformation   to  the   district  court  without   notice  to\n\n                             -76-\n\ndefendants, we would expect this dangerous  course to be very\n\nrare  indeed,  but  in this  instance  we  find  that it  was\n\njustified  and, given  the unimportance  of the  material, it\n\ninflicted  no prejudice on the defendants.  No doubt we could\n\nconstruct a judicial rule forbidding the government, absent a\n\nstatute  or regulation,  from making  any secret  submission.\n\nBut  we think that the interests of justice are better served\n\nby  encouraging  the government  to  let  the district  court\n\nresolve  the Brady  issue or  like questions in  close cases.\n                  \n\nDefendants  in  general would  not  gain from  a  regime that\n\nencouraged the government to decide the matter itself.  \n\n                  XVIII.  SENTENCING ISSUES\n\n                       A.  Introduction\n\n     Thompson,  DeMarco Sr., Letters,  Litterio and Boisoneau\n\nchallenge the district court's calculation of their sentences\n\nunder  the  Sentencing  Guidelines.14    Many of  defendants'\n\narguments concern  the court's  calculation of the  amount of\n\nnarcotics attributable  to each defendant.   It is  useful to\n\nsay a few words on the subject at the outset.  \n\n     Under the  Guidelines, the  sentence for  a drug-related\n\noffense hinges  substantially upon the total  amount of drugs\n\ninvolved in  that offense.    See U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(c)  (drug\n                                 \n\n                    \n\n     14The  district court  applied the  1990 version  of the\nSentencing  Guidelines  and  therefore  all  citations unless\notherwise indicated are to that version.\n\n                             -77-\n\nquantity  table).15   This determination  often turns  on the\n\n\"relevant   conduct\"  provision  of   the  Guidelines,  which\n\nprovides  that  a defendant's  base  offense  level shall  be\n\ndetermined on the basis of \"all acts and omissions  committed\n\nor  aided  and abetted  by the  defendant,  or for  which the\n\ndefendant  would  be  otherwise  accountable,  that  occurred\n\nduring the commission  of the offense of conviction  . . . .\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1).   In the case  of concerted criminal\n\nactivity, conduct \"for which the defendant would be otherwise\n\naccountable\" includes  \"conduct of others  in furtherance  of\n\nthe execution  of  the jointly-undertaken  criminal  activity\n\nthat  was  reasonably foreseeable  by  the  defendant.\"   Id.\n                                                            \n\ncomment note 1.\n\n     Thus, \"[t]he  central concept . .  . is foreseeability.\"\n\nUnited  States v.  O'Campo,  973 F.2d  1015,  1023 (1st  Cir.\n                          \n\n1992).   This means that  each member of  a drug distribution\n\nconspiracy  may  be  held  accountable at  sentencing  for  a\n\ndifferent   quantity   of   narcotics,   depending   on   the\n\ncircumstances of  each defendant's involvement.  See U.S.S.G.\n                                                    \n\n   1B1.3 comment note 1.  The foreseeability determination is\n\n                    \n\n     15Section  2D1.4   provides  that  if   a  defendant  is\nconvicted  of conspiring  to  commit an  offense involving  a\ncontrolled substance, \"the offense level shall be the same as\nif  the   object  of  the  conspiracy  or  attempt  had  been\ncompleted.\"  Section  2D1.1, in turn, sets  forth the offense\nlevels  for  the  completed  offenses  of   distribution  and\npossession with intent to distribute based primarily upon the\ndrug quantity table.\n\n                             -78-\n\ninherently fact-bound, and   \"[a] district court's finding of\n\nthe amount of drugs involved in an offense will be overturned\n\non appeal only upon a showing of clear error.\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Tracy, 989 F.2d 1279, 1287 (1st Cir. 1993).  \"[W]here more\n        \n\nthan one  reasonable inference  may be drawn  from undisputed\n\nfacts, the court's choice from among supportable alternatives\n\ncannot be clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. McCarthy, 961\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 972, 978 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n     In this case, the  court held an evidentiary hearing  to\n\ndetermine the drug quantities attributable to each defendant.\n\nCallahan  and Tulowiecki  testified regarding the  amounts of\n\nnarcotics  distributed to  certain  of the  defendants.   The\n\ncourt also  relied heavily  on detailed  pre-sentence reports\n\nprepared  by the  probation officer.   See  Fed. R.  Crim. P.\n                                          \n\n32(c).   Thereafter,  the court  issued a  memorandum opinion\n\nsetting  forth  its  factual  findings  including  \"how  much\n\ncontrolled  substance is  attributable  to each  defendant in\n\norder  to  establish his  base  offense  level for  Guideline\n\npurposes.\"  Order of July 12, 1991 at 2.  \n\n                     B.  William Thompson\n\n     Thompson first argues that  the Sentencing Guidelines do\n\nnot apply to him because the principal evidence against him--\n\nthe  provision  of  registry  checks  and  cellular  phones--\n\noccurred  prior   to  November  1987,   when  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  took  effect.    Thompson waived  this  claim  by\n\n                             -79-\n\nfailing  to  make  it during  the  sentencing  process.   See\n                                                             \n\nFigueroa, 976 F.2d  at 1462.   In any  event, the  Guidelines\n        \n\napplied  to Thompson, because he  was a member  of an ongoing\n\nconspiracy  that continued  past  the effective  date of  the\n\nGuidelines  and   Thompson  did   not  withdraw  before   the\n\nGuidelines became  effective.   See United States  v. Thomas,\n                                                            \n\n895 F.2d 51, 57 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     Thompson next contests  the calculation of the  quantity\n\nof  drugs for which he is accountable.   Thompson's principal\n\ncontributions to the venture  did not lie in  particular drug\n\ntransactions  but  rather in  the  provision  of services  to\n\nInnamorati.     Thompson   helped  Innamorati   set   up  his\n\ncommunications network and ran  license plate registry checks\n\non prospective customers, and  Thompson knew Innamorati was a\n\nlarge-scale distributor.   Innamorati himself was responsible\n\nfor the  importation  and distribution  of  approximately  16\n\nkilograms of cocaine and 450 pounds of marijuana.\n\n     The   pre-sentence   report   concluded  that   Thompson\n\npurchased  small  quantities  of  cocaine  for  personal  use\n\namounting  to  approximately  46 grams.    Further,  Thompson\n\nadmitted before the grand  jury that he had been  aware since\n\n1983 or  1984 that  Innamorati was distributing  cocaine, and\n\nthat  he  often  was   present  in  Innamorati's  house  when\n\nInnamorati  possessed large  amounts  of cocaine.   Based  on\n\nthese  facts, the  probation  officer (and  later the  court)\n\n                             -80-\n\ndetermined that  it was reasonable to  conclude that Thompson\n\ncould have  foreseen that Innamorati was  dealing in multiple\n\nkilograms.   Recognizing  that it  was engaged  in a  \"highly\n\nspeculative  task,\" the  probation  officer  determined  that\n\nThompson  could  reasonably  have foreseen  3.2  kilograms of\n\ncocaine, based  on the cocaine  purchased and the  cocaine he\n\npersonally saw in Innamorati's house.\n\n     We  think the 3.2 kilogram finding is  at the low end of\n\nthe range  of figures that might reasonably have been chosen.\n\nThompson   knowingly   assisted   Innamorati's    drug   ring\n\noperations, well  aware that  Innamorati was involved  in the\n\nimportation and distribution of large amounts of cocaine.  He\n\nsaw  large caches  of cocaine in  Innamorati's home  and made\n\npurchases  for  himself,  and   the  district  court  treated\n\nThompson favorably by  limiting his  accountability to  these\n\namounts.  The  computation of what  Thompson himself saw  and\n\nbought  is   necessarily  an   estimate  but  is   hardly  an\n\nimplausible one.  We see no error.\n\n     Thompson  argues that  the court  wrongly  increased his\n\nbase offense level under U.S.S.G.   3B1.3, which provides for\n\na two-level  enhancement if \"the defendant  abused a position\n\nof  public  or  private  trust  .   .  .  in  a  manner  that\n\nsignificantly  facilitated the  commission or  concealment of\n\nthe offense.\"  The  court based this enhancement on  the fact\n\nthat Thompson  had worked as a  Massachusetts Registry police\n\n                             -81-\n\nofficer from 1978 until  some time around 1985 and  used that\n\nposition  to gain access to the registry computer and provide\n\nlicense plate checks to Innamorati.  \n\n     Employment   as  a   registry  police   officer  clearly\n\nqualifies as a  \"position of public .  . . trust\"  within the\n\nmeaning  of the Guideline.  E.g., United States v. Rehal, 940\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1, 5  (1st Cir.  1991) (police sergeant).   Although  we\n\nhave found no case law on point, we do not believe it matters\n\nthat Thompson was no longer employed with the registry at the\n\ntime he provided the information to Innamorati, so long as he\n\nabused the access that his former position afforded him.  The\n\nGuideline itself does  not limit its application  to cases in\n\nwhich  the  defendant  is  employed  at  the  time,  and  the\n\nunderlying policy appears to apply to this case.  \n\n     If and when others among the public could gain access to\n\nmotor  vehicle information  in the  registry is  not entirely\n\nclear.  But the evidence  at trial indicated that  Thompson's\n\nprior employment  made it  easier for  Innamorati  to do  so.\n\nThere was police testimony that it was improper for anyone to\n\nperform  a check without  a valid law  enforcement purpose, a\n\ntest that Thompson's activities clearly  did not meet.  Given\n\nthese facts,  we do  not  believe that  the sentencing  judge\n\ncommitted clear  error by  concluding that Thompson  abused a\n\nposition of public trust.  See Rehal, 940 F.2d at 5 (applying\n                                    \n\n                             -82-\n\n\"clearly  erroneous\" standard  of  review  to  abuse-of-trust\n\nadjustment under section 3B1.3).\n\n     Finally, Thompson argues that the court erred by failing\n\nto   award  him   a  four-level   reduction  as   a  \"minimal\n\nparticipant\" under section 3B1.2(a).  A \"minimal\" participant\n\nis defined as one who is \"plainly among the least culpable of\n\nthose involved in the conduct of a group.\"  U.S.S.G.    3B1.2\n\ncomment note 1.  A \"minor\" participant\"-- defined as one \"who\n\nis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role\n\ncould  not be described as minimal,\" id. (n.3) -- is entitled\n                                       \n\nto  a two-level  reduction under  U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(b).   The\n\nGuideline  also  permits the  court  to  award a  three-level\n\ndecrease to persons whose participation was more than minimal\n\nbut less than minor.     The four-level \"minimal participant\"\n\nadjustment  was  intended to  be  applied  \"infrequently\"; an\n\nexample given is an  individual recruited as a courier  for a\n\nsingle transaction  in  an larger  enterprise.   Id. note  2.\n                                                   \n\nHere, the  court concluded that  Thompson was not  a \"minimal\n\nparticipant\" in  light of  his substantial assistance  to and\n\nclose association  with Innamorati.   At the  same time,  the\n\ncourt  found   that  Thompson   played  a  limited   role  in\n\nInnamorati's  overall  distribution activities,  and  was not\n\nshown  to have  cocaine  himself or  to  have shared  in  the\n\nprofits.    The court  was  reasonable,  indeed generous,  in\n\n                             -83-\n\nawarding Thompson a three-level reduction for persons falling\n\nin between the \"minimal\" and \"minor\" participant categories.\n\n                    C.  Robert DeMarco Sr.\n\n     DeMarco Sr. challenges the court's determination that he\n\nis accountable for  4.25 kilograms of cocaine.   This finding\n\nwas  based on  the  testimony of  Callahan at  the sentencing\n\nhearing that he  distributed an average of a quarter kilogram\n\nof cocaine per month to DeMarco Sr. from January 1987 through\n\nFebruary 1988.  It is unclear whether  Callahan was including\n\nin this \"average\"  one or  both of  two initial  one-kilogram\n\nsales  to DeMarco Sr.   But the district  judge resolved that\n\nuncertainty  by  concluding that  one  of  the kilograms  was\n\nincluded  in the  average  and  the  other  was  not.    This\n\nconclusion  was  not  clearly erroneous.    Indeed,  Callahan\n\ntestified:\n\n     I  would say the second  full kilo was  part of the\n     average.  But conservatively  speaking, I would say\n     you could  exclude the  first kilo and  the average\n     would still be quarter kilo a month.\n\nThus,  the sum of 4.25 kilograms was derived by totalling the\n\nquarter  kilogram sales over  a thirteen-month  period (which\n\namounts to  3.25 kilograms),  and then adding  the additional\n\none-kilogram  sale.   Although  there  were discrepancies  in\n\nCallahan's testimony as to  the quantities and dates of  drug\n\nsales  to  DeMarco  Sr.,   \"the  court's  choice  from  among\n\nsupportable alternatives  cannot be clearly erroneous.\"   See\n                                                             \n\nMcCarthy, 961 F.2d at 978.\n        \n\n                             -84-\n\n     DeMarco  Sr.  also  argues  that the  court  abused  its\n\ndiscretion by  failing to  award him the  reductions provided\n\nunder  section 3B1.2  to  \"minor\" or  \"minimal\" participants.\n\nThe district  court was justified in  concluding that DeMarco\n\nSr. was a  major customer whose monthly  purchases of quarter\n\nkilograms of cocaine  for more  than a year  helped keep  the\n\nconspiracy in  operation.   Indeed, as the  government points\n\nout, only two  of the  defendants--Innamorati and  Grady--had\n\nmore cocaine  attributed to  them at sentencing  than DeMarco\n\nSr.   We  find no  error in  the court's  refusal to  grant a\n\ndownward adjustment.\n\n                     D.  William Letters\n\n     The  court found  that Letters  was responsible  for 510\n\ngrams of cocaine.  This  was less than a third of  the amount\n\nattributed to  Letters by the probation  officer.  Tulowiecki\n\ntestified at trial  that he delivered  quarter, half or  full\n\nounces of cocaine at least weekly and often several times per\n\nweek  to  Letters between  January  1987  and February  1988.\n\nTaking an average of one ounce or 28 grams per week over this\n\nfourteen-month period, the probation officer  determined that\n\nLetters  should be  held responsible  for approximately  1588\n\ngrams.   For reasons that are unexplained,  the court reduced\n\nthis amount to 510 grams.  The court's reduction did not have\n\na corresponding  effect on Letters'  sentence, however, since\n\n                             -85-\n\nthe Guidelines supply the  same base offense level of  26 for\n\nany quantity between 500 grams and two kilograms. \n\n     Despite Tulowiecki's testimony,  Letters points out that\n\nthe  chart prepared  from Tulowiecki's drug  ledger reflected\n\nthe sale of only 336.5  grams of cocaine to Letters.   But it\n\nwas clear  from Tulowiecki's testimony  at trial  and at  the\n\nsentencing hearing  that the chart was  incomplete; it showed\n\nonly sales over a  limited period of time and for which there\n\nwere  written records, not all sales.  The chart showed sales\n\nto  Letters only for the  period June 1987  to February 1988,\n\nwhereas Tulowiecki  testified that  deliveries  were made  to\n\nLetters starting in January 1987.  In sum, although the basis\n\nfor the court's calculation of 510 grams does not appear from\n\nthe  record, the  evidence  supported a  determination of  at\n\nleast that amount.\n\n     Letters also challenges the calculation of  his criminal\n\nhistory category.    On March  30,  1990, while  Letters  was\n\nreleased  on bail pending trial in this case, he was arrested\n\nfor possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  Letters\n\nwas convicted of that offense in April 1991 and was serving a\n\nsentence on that conviction at the time of sentencing in this\n\ncase.    This  new  conviction  increased  Letters'  criminal\n\nhistory  by three  points  pursuant to  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(a),\n\nwhich  directs the district court  to \"add 3  points for each\n\nprior  sentence of  imprisonment exceeding  one year  and one\n\n                             -86-\n\nmonth.\"    Combined with  other  pertinent  information, this\n\nincrease  gave  Letters a  total  of  seven criminal  points,\n\nplacing him in Criminal History Category IV.\n\n     Letters now  argues that  the March 1990  offense should\n\nnot have been  included in the calculation  because under the\n\nGuidelines \"prior sentences imposed  in related cases\" are to\n\nbe  treated   as  one   sentence  in  the   criminal  history\n\ncomputation. U.S.S.G.    4A1.2(a)(2).  Letters contends  that\n\nthe March  1990 offense was  \"related\" to the  conspiracy for\n\nwhich he was convicted in this case, and therefore should not\n\nhave been separately  considered in determining  his criminal\n\nhistory.   Letters, however,  did not  make this  argument at\n\nsentencing, in  response to  the calculation of  his criminal\n\nhistory  in  the Pre-sentence  report  or  at the  sentencing\n\nhearing  before  the  district   court.    The  argument  was\n\ntherefore  waived.  See Figueroa, 976 F.2d at 1462.  Contrary\n                                \n\nto   Letters'  brief,  the   statutory  provision  permitting\n\nappellate  review   of  sentencing   errors,   18  U.S.C.    \n\n3742(e)(1),  does  not  disturb the  long-standing  rule that\n\nclaims must first be  made in the district court  to preserve\n\nthem for review.16\n\n                    \n\n     16Even  if  the  issue had  not  been  waived,  there is\nsubstantial  reason  to  believe  that  Letters'  March  1990\noffense occurred after the  end of the Innamorati conspiracy.\nThe DEA search warrants were executed in February 1988 and by\nMarch  1988  Innamorati  was   in  prison  on  a  state-court\nconviction.   \n\n                             -87-\n\n                      E.  James Litterio\n\n     Litterio  contends that there  was insufficient evidence\n\nto  support the  district  court's determination  that he  is\n\nresponsible for  1.7 kilograms of cocaine.   The 1.7 kilogram\n\nfigure is  based on Tulowiecki's testimony  that he delivered\n\nsmall amounts  of cocaine to  Litterio several  times a  week\n\nbetween  January   1987  and   February  1988  (based   on  a\n\nconservative estimate of 10 grams per week,  the total amount\n\nwas fixed at 600  grams); on evidence that Litterio  provided\n\nfour ounces (112 grams)  of cocaine to his brother  Mark that\n\nwere  then sold  to  undercover agents;  and on  Tulowiecki's\n\ntestimony  that  soon  after  the  four-ounce  deal  Litterio\n\nordered an  additional kilogram  of cocaine  from Innamorati,\n\nalthough the  deal was canceled  when it was  discovered that\n\nundercover officers might be involved. \n\n     Although  Litterio argues  that  he should  not be  held\n\nresponsible for  cocaine that he purchased  for personal use,\n\nthis confuses  the standard for criminal  liability with that\n\nfor  sentencing accountability.   Purchases  by an  addict or\n\ncasual user for personal use may not automatically make one a\n\nmember of a conspiracy to distribute.  The situation is quite\n\ndifferent where, as here, the evidence shows that there was a\n\nconspiracy and that a defendant was a member.  At that point,\n\nthat defendant's  purchases for personal use  are relevant in\n\n                             -88-\n\ndetermining  the quantity  of drugs  that the  defendant knew\n\nwere distributed by the conspiracy.\n\n                      F.  John Boisoneau\n\n     The court held Boisoneau responsible for 316.52 grams of\n\ncocaine and  sentenced him  to 33 months  imprisonment, which\n\nwas at the bottom  of the applicable range.   The calculation\n\nof 316 grams included approximately 250 grams of cocaine that\n\nBoisoneau  observed  on  one  occasion   while  visiting  the\n\nEdgewater Hills safehouse.  When Boisoneau saw this \"hunk\" of\n\ncocaine he told Innamorati to put it away because it made him\n\nnervous.  Boisoneau argues  that in light of his  reaction to\n\nthe 250 grams of cocaine it was unreasonable for the court to\n\nhold him accountable for that amount at sentencing.\n\n     The standard in  computing the quantity of  drugs is the\n\namount  of  cocaine  that  Boisoneau reasonably  should  have\n\nforeseen  to have  been embraced  by the  conspiracy  that he\n\nentered.   See O'Campo, 973 F.2d  at 1026.  The  250 grams of\n                      \n\ncocaine  that Boisoneau observed in Innamorati's safehouse is\n\nreasonably  included  in  determining  the  total  amount  of\n\ncocaine  that Boisoneau  could have  foreseen, regardless  of\n\nwhether  the amount made him nervous.  If there were evidence\n\nthat Boisoneau effectively withdrew from the conspiracy after\n\nhe  saw the  \"hunk\" and  realized the  scope of  Innamorati's\n\noperation,  this would be a  different case, but  there is no\n\nevidence of any such withdrawal.\n\n                             -89-\n\n                            * * *\n\n     In  these  ten appeals,  somewhere  between  50 and  100\n\npoints were  raised by individual  defendants, although there\n\nis  some  overlap.   We  have addressed  those  that appeared\n\nsubstantial  and we  have  considered  without  discussion  a\n\nnumber of others that were plainly without merit, were raised\n\nin a perfunctory fashion, or both.  Because of the number  of\n\nclaims, the defendants' briefs  were reviewed again after the\n\nopinion was prepared to  make certain that no claim  of error\n\nwas overlooked.     The  judgments  are affirmed  except that\n                                                             \n\nthe judgment of conviction  of defendant Grady on Count  4 is\n                                                             \n\nvacated and his case is remanded for resentencing. \n                                                 \n\n                             -90-\n",

In  1984, Brian Fitzgerald\n\nand Paul  Callahan--two co-conspirators who testified for the\n\ngovernment  at  trial--met  in  Walpole   penitentiary  while\n\nserving terms of imprisonment  there.  The two men  formed an\n\n                    \n\n     1The ten are Kenneth Innamorati, William Thompson, James\nGrady, Robert  DeMarco Sr.,  William Letters,  Robert Demarco\nJr., Phillip  Bargalla, James Litterio,  John Boisoneau,  and\nJoseph Gilberti.  \n\n                             -14-\n\nalliance, agreeing  that upon their release  from prison they\n\nwould begin a drug distribution network.\n\n     After their release, Callahan and Fitzgerald began  drug\n\ndealing.  In  1985, they were  approached by an  intermediary\n\nand  asked  if they  could supply  a  kilogram of  cocaine to\n\nKenneth  Innamorati  and   his  then-partner,  Noel  Bouvier.\n\nFitzgerald and  Callahan agreed to supply  the cocaine, which\n\nthey acquired  from a  source in Everett,  Massachusetts, and\n\nthen delivered  to Innamorati  in Framingham in  exchange for\n\n$55,000.   About three months later,  Fitzgerald and Callahan\n\nagreed to join forces  with Innamorati and Bouvier.   At that\n\ntime,  Innamorati's  principal  source  for  cocaine  was  an\n\nindividual in Boston.  Callahan and Fitzgerald each picked up\n\nkilograms of  cocaine from the  supplier and delivered  it to\n\nInnamorati, who weighed it, mixed it with other substances to\n\nincrease  its   volume,   and  separated   it  into   smaller\n\nquantities.  Callahan and Fitzgerald then delivered the drugs\n\nto Innamorati's customers.\n\n     After a time, Innamorati lost the services of his Boston\n\nsupplier,  and  Callahan  began  supplying   Innamorati  with\n\ncocaine from  Callahan's own sources.   Callahan made contact\n\nwith  an  individual named  Tom  Reilly in  Florida.   Reilly\n\nultimately  supplied  Callahan  and  Innamorati   with  large\n\nquantities  of cocaine and marijuana on  a regular basis from\n\nthe  summer of 1985 onward.   In June  1985, Fitzgerald hired\n\n                             -15-\n\ndefendant Grady, who drove a tractor-trailer,  to pick up the\n\ncocaine and marijuana from  Reilly in Florida and haul  it to\n\nMassachusetts.   Grady  made  this trip  about  once a  month\n\nbetween  June 1985  and February 1988,  occasionally bringing\n\ncash down to Florida to pay for prior shipments.\n\n     Callahan  and Innamorati  developed an  elaborate system\n\nfor  storage  and distribution  of  the  narcotics once  they\n\nreached  Massachusetts.   The  drugs were  stored in  several\n\ndifferent  locations.   For example,  some of the  drugs were\n\nstashed in the trunk of a  car parked in a storage unit  at a\n\nself-storage   facility   called  Hyperspace   in  Holliston,\n\nMassachusetts.  Drugs were also  stored in a rented apartment\n\nin  a  development  called  Edgewater  Hills  in  Framingham,\n\nMassachusetts.   In May  1987, a  new apartment  in Edgewater\n\nHills was  selected.   Edward Tulowiecki, an  acquaintance of\n\nInnamorati who was a star witness at trial, agreed to live in\n\nthe  apartment  and  assist  Innamorati;  Innamorati  paid  a\n\nportion of the rent for the apartment.  \n\n     This  Edgewater  Hills  apartment  became  the  base  of\n\noperations   for  much   of  the   conspirators'  activities.\n\nInnamorati and  Callahan moved  a considerable array  of drug\n\ndistribution  paraphernalia  into  the  apartment,  including\n\nscales,  a  safe and  a  freezer.   Callahan  and  Innamorati\n\nfrequently came  to  the  apartment  to deliver  or  pick  up\n\npackages of cocaine  and marijuana, or to prepare and package\n\n                             -16-\n\nthem for distribution.  Tulowiecki was  not permitted to have\n\nother guests in the apartment.\n\n     Innamorati  used  beepers  and  cellular  telephones  to\n\nfacilitate his distribution activities.   Each of the persons\n\nto whom he regularly distributed the narcotics was assigned a\n\ncode number.  To place an order, he or she would place a call\n\nto Innamorati's beeper,  and then enter  the code number  and\n\nthe quantity sought; the order  would then be transmitted  to\n\nthe  digital  display  on  Innamorati's  beeper.   Innamorati\n\npreferred   cellular  rather  than  ordinary  telephones  for\n\ncommunications  relating  to  drug  distribution,  because he\n\nbelieved that cellular telephones were more difficult to tap.\n\nWilliam  Thompson,  a former  Clinton  police  officer and  a\n\nfriend of Innamorati, acquired and installed several cellular\n\nphones for Innamorati and registered the phones in Thompson's\n\nown company name.\n\n     Innamorati distributed cocaine and marijuana to numerous\n\nindividuals  between summer 1985 and February 1988, including\n\nThompson,   William   Letters,  James   Litterio,   and  John\n\nBoisoneau;  each of  these purchasers  was assigned  a beeper\n\nnumber  in Innamorati's  system.   Callahan had  a number  of\n\ncustomers of his own during this period, including defendants\n\nRobert DeMarco Sr., Robert  DeMarco Jr., Phillip Bargalla and\n\nJoseph  Gilberti.   Generally there  was evidence  that these\n\n                             -17-\n\npersons resold  portions of  the cocaine they  purchased from\n\nCallahan or Innamorati to others.\n\n     In  November 1987  Jeffrey Scott,  a nephew  and cocaine\n\ncustomer  of Callahan  who  was  also  in debt  to  Callahan,\n\ncontacted the  Drug Enforcement  Agency (\"DEA\") and  provided\n\ninformation  about  Callahan's  activities.   This  began  an\n\nextensive covert investigation  into the  Callahan/Innamorati\n\noperation.  By late February 1988 the DEA had obtained enough\n\ninformation  to execute  a series  of search warrants  at the\n\nHyperspace facility, Fitzgerald's and  Callahan's residences,\n\nand  the Edgewater Hills apartment.   At the  latter site the\n\nagents  found  two kilograms  of  cocaine  and 75  pounds  of\n\nmarijuana,   as  well  as  drug  distribution  paraphernalia,\n\nrecords of  drugs transactions and  a small cache  of weapons\n\nand ammunition.\n\n     After a  32-day jury  trial conducted from  September to\n\nNovember  1990,  all  ten  defendants  in  this  appeal  were\n\nconvicted.  In addition  to the common conspiracy count,  all\n\ndefendants except Thompson and Bargalla were convicted of one\n\nor more  counts of  possession of cocaine  or marijuana  with\n\nintent to distribute  in violation of 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1);\n\nBargalla  was convicted  of  the lesser  included offense  of\n\nsimple possession.  In  addition, Innamorati was convicted of\n\nusing  a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense in\n\nviolation  of  18 U.S.C.     924(c)(1), and  of  conducting a\n\n                             -18-\n\ncontinuing criminal  enterprise in  violation of 21  U.S.C.  \n\n848.\n\n     The  ten  defendants  in  this  appeal  raise   numerous\n\nseparate  issues relating  either to conviction  or sentence.\n\nIn  certain instances,  claims  of error  are  made but  only\n\ncursorily discussed.  Where  appropriate we have invoked \"the\n\nsettled  appellate   rule  that  issues  adverted   to  in  a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\"  United States v. Zannino,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  17  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">1082</span>\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">                                            \n\n(1990).  Because a  number of the claims overlap,  we discuss\n\nthem by subject.\n\n                        II.  SEVERANCE\n\n     Innamorati,  Thompson, Grady, DeMarco  Sr., DeMarco Jr.,\n\nBargalla, and Gilberti challenge the  district court's denial\n\nof their motions  to sever each of their trials from those of\n\ntheir  co-defendants.   Defendants  argue that  severance was\n\nnecessary to protect them  from prejudice and the possibility\n\nthat the jury would fail to  consider the evidence separately\n\nas to each defendant.\n\n     Prejudice  from  joinder  can  come  in  various  forms,\n\nincluding  jury confusion,  the  impact of  evidence that  is\n\nadmissible  against  only  some  defendants,  and \"spillover\"\n\neffects where the crimes of some defendants are more horrific\n\nor  better documented than the crimes of others.  But joinder\n\n                             -19-\n\nis  normally  economical--especially  where   defendants  are\n\ncharged with the same  core crime--and clear instructions can\n\noften  confine the  risk of  prejudice.   Accordingly, it  is\n\nsettled that defendants are  not entitled to severance merely\n\nbecause it would improve  their chances of acquittal; rather,\n\nsubstantial prejudice \"amounting to a miscarriage of justice\"\n\nmust  be  proved before  a  severance is  mandatory.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Sabatino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567584\"><a href=\"/opinion/567584/united-states-v-diane-sabatino-united-states-of-america-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96-97  (1st Cir. 1991).  We\n                   \n\nreview the refusal of a trial court to  grant a severance for\n\nabuse of discretion, United States v.  Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                              \n\n581 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1992), and\n                                 \n\nwe find no such abuse in this case.\n\n     Despite the number of defendants, there is no indication\n\nof jury confusion in this case.  The government in summing up\n\nseparated the evidence as to each defendant.  The trial judge\n\ngave  the  customary   instruction,  emphasizing  that   each\n\ndefendant  must be  judged separately  based on  the evidence\n\nadmissible against that defendant.  The jury apparently found\n\nitself  capable   of  distinguishing:     it  acquitted   one\n\ndefendant--Thomas Agnitti, who is not a party to this appeal-\n\n-on the  conspiracy count and  on other counts  convicted two\n\ndefendants  (Agnitti  and Bargalla)  only on  lesser included\n\noffenses.\n\n     Innamorati aside,  none of the defendants  points to any\n\nspecific   evidence   that   significantly  inculpated   that\n\n                             -20-\n\ndefendant but was admissible only  against another defendant.\n\nIndeed,   the  core  of  the  case  was  the  alleged  common\n\nconspiracy; thus, after the necessary foundation, most of the\n\nevidence  of  wrongdoing by  one  conspirator was  admissible\n\nagainst other conspirators  as well.  Nor  is this a  case in\n\nwhich  separable  acts  of  an individual  defendant  are  so\n\ndisproportionately heinous  that there  is an  arguable taint\n\nmerely  from the association  among defendants.   In sum, for\n\neveryone apart  from  Innamorati, this  is  a  garden-variety\n\njoinder almost routine in  drug conspiracy cases.  Innamorati\n\ndoes point to evidence that he  argues was harmful to him but\n\nproperly admissible only as to another defendant, namely, the\n\ngrand  jury testimony of Thompson.   In our  view, this grand\n\njury testimony  was not  admissible against  Innamorati; but,\n\nfor  reasons discussed in part IV, we also conclude also that\n\nInnamorati is not entitled  to a reversal on account  of this\n\ntestimony. \n\n              III.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n     Thompson,   Grady,   Letters,  DeMarco   Jr.,  Bargalla,\n\nLitterio and  Gilberti argue that the  evidence introduced at\n\ntrial  was   insufficient  to  support   their  convictions.2\n\n                    \n\n     2Innamorati  also raises  this issue  in his  brief, but\nonly by asserting  in conclusory terms that  the evidence was\ninsufficient to establish his  guilt.  Ordinarily, this claim\nwould be waived but in this instance we  necessarily consider\nthe weight  of the evidence against him in part IV as part of\nour harmless error analysis.\n\n                             -21-\n\nDefendants  bear the  heavy burden  of demonstrating  that no\n\nreasonable  jury  could  have  found  them  guilty  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.

If\n\nthe  registry check came back \"not on file\" or \"no response,\"\n\nInnamorati had reason to believe that the vehicle belonged to\n\na  law  enforcement  agency  and  was   being  driven  by  an\n\nundercover agent.

But Thompson\n\nadmitted in testimony before the grand jury that he regularly\n\npurchased cocaine from  Innamorati when he was employed  as a\n\npolice officer from 1970 to  1978.  Tulowiecki testified that\n\nhe regularly distributed cocaine to  Thompson from Innamorati\n\nin  1987.     Thompson  was  assigned  a   beeper  number  in\n\nInnamorati's communications network.   Thompson also admitted\n\n                             -23-\n\nthat he knew that the cellular telephones he provided were to\n\nbe used to \"elude law enforcement.\"  \n\n     Thompson argues vehemently that he could not have been a\n\nfull-fledged conspirator because he was excluded from certain\n\nlocations at  which Innamorati stored his  drugs, and because\n\nCallahan  and Fitzgerald  could  not identify  him at  trial.\n\nThese  facts  do  not  defeat Thompson's  membership  in  the\n\nconspiracy.   It  is black-letter  law that  one need  not be\n\nfamiliar with every  other person  with whom he  is found  to\n\nhave conspired, nor must he participate  in the conspiracy to\n\nthe same  extent as all others.

Taken as a whole,\n                   \n\nthe evidence allowed  the jury  to find that  Thompson was  a\n\nknowing member of the drug conspiracy.  \n                       B.  James Grady\n\n     The   evidence  showed   that  Grady   brought  numerous\n\nshipments of  cocaine and marijuana from  Florida to Callahan\n\nand   Innamorati  in   Massachusetts.     Several  witnesses,\n\nincluding  Callahan,  Fitzgerald  and  Reilly,  described  in\n\nconsistent  detail  Grady's   practice  of  transporting  the\n\ncocaine and the cash in a tool box in the cab of his tractor-\n\ntrailer.   There was also ample evidence that Grady knew that\n\nthe shipments contained narcotics.  Fitzgerald testified that\n\nhe  told Grady that the  tool box contained  cocaine.  Reilly\n\n                             -24-\n\nrecounted one occasion on which Grady  watched while bales of\n\nmarijuana were loaded  onto his truck.  Evidence  showed that\n\nGrady  occasionally  brought  large  amounts  of  cash   from\n\nMassachusetts to Florida to pay Reilly.\n\n     In the face  of this testimony, Grady  contends that the\n\nevidence  was insufficient  to convict  him of  conspiracy to\n\ndistribute.    He argues  that  Callahan  and Innamorati  had\n\nsuppliers  other than Reilly and that even as to Reilly there\n\nwere other couriers in addition to Grady.  He also points out\n\nthat although  the conspiracy allegedly  continued from  1984\n\nuntil November  1988, the  evidence of his  participation was\n\nlimited to  the period between  June 1985 and  February 1988.\n\nBut Grady need not  have been the exclusive courier  in order\n\nto be  a conspirator, nor must  he have been involved  in the\n\nconspiracy during  the entire life  of the  operation.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  United States  v. Baines,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483545\"><a href=\"/opinion/483545/united-states-v-robert-s-baines/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1987).  We have  no trouble finding the evidence  adequate to\n\nsupport Grady's conspiracy conviction.\n\n     In addition to conspiracy Grady was also convicted under\n\ncounts  three and  four of  the  indictment of  possession of\n\ncocaine  on  February  25  and   27,  1988,  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute.    These  were  the  dates  on  which  DEA agents\n\nexecuted the  search warrants on the  Hyperspace facility and\n\nthe   Edgewater   Hills   apartment,   respectively.      The\n\ngovernment's theory  at trial  was that  Grady was guilty  of\n\n                             -25-\n\npossessing the  cocaine found  at these locations  because he\n\nhad carried that cocaine from Florida in his tractor-trailer.\n\nAlthough  Grady  was  linked  to the  cocaine  found  in  the\n\nHyperspace  facility,  we agree  with  Grady  that there  was\n\ninsufficient  evidence  that  he ever  possessed  the cocaine\n\nfound in the Edgewater Hills apartment.\n\n     Callahan  testified   that  he  gave  Grady   a  toolbox\n\ncontaining three kilograms of  cocaine in Florida on February\n\n20,  1988, and that on  February 24 he  retrieved the toolbox\n\nfrom  Grady  in Massachusetts  and  drove  to the  Hyperspace\n\nstorage  facility.  The next day, the government executed the\n\nsearch  warrant  at the  facility  and  seized exactly  three\n\nkilograms of cocaine.  It is difficult to see, therefore, how\n\nthe  cocaine  seized a  few  days  later from  the  Edgewater\n\napartment  could  also have  come  from  Grady's February  20\n\nshipment.  The government argues that Callahan also testified\n\nthat  he  brought  the  toolbox  with  him to  the  Edgewater\n\napartment after  leaving Hyperspace.    Thus, the  government\n\nsays,  \"[w]hile the evidence on  [this] score may  be open to\n\ndispute,\" that dispute was for the jury to resolve.\n\n     It  is true  that Callahan's  testimony is  unclear--one\n\ncannot  tell  whether  he   stored  the  three  kilograms  at\n\nHyperspace, or took them with him when he left there and went\n\nto  the Edgewater apartment.  But the testimony of Scott, who\n\naccompanied  Callahan,  is  clear   on  this  point.    Scott\n\n                             -26-\n\ntestified that Callahan took the cocaine  out of the toolbox,\n\nplaced it in the trunk  of the car in the  Hyperspace storage\n\ncompartment, and then left the facility with the toolbox, now\n\nemptied of its drugs.  The testimony is also clear  that only\n\nthree kilograms were  transported by Grady on  this trip, and\n\nthat exactly three kilograms were seized by federal  agents a\n\nfew days later from the Hyperspace facility.  \n\n     It is of course quite  possible, indeed likely, that  at\n\nleast some  of the cocaine  found in the  Edgewater apartment\n\nwas  a remnant  of a prior  shipment by  Grady.   But this is\n\nconjecture.  The government does not advance the theory here,\n\nnor did it  do so before the jury, and  there was evidence of\n\nother  suppliers  and  couriers.    Accordingly,  finding  no\n\nevidence  to support  Grady's conviction  for possessing  the\n\ncocaine  seized on February 27, we  reverse his conviction on\n\ncount  four.   This  may have  no  effect on  Grady's  actual\n\nsentence, since the counts were grouped and  the sentence was\n\nbased  on the  volume  of  drugs  foreseen;  but  out  of  an\n\nabundance of caution we remand his case to the district court\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n                     C.  William Letters\n\n     Letters  was convicted  of conspiracy  and one  count of\n\npossession with intent  to distribute.  He  argues that there\n\nwas insufficient  evidence to prove  he that entered  into an\n\nagreement  to distribute  narcotics.   He  concedes that  the\n\n                             -27-\n\nevidence showed a number of deliveries of cocaine to him from\n\nInnamorati (via  Tulowiecki),  in amounts  ranging from  nine\n\ngrams to, on  one occasion, as much as an  ounce (28 grams). \n\nBut Letters says that the evidence also showed that he  was a\n\nvery heavy personal user of cocaine.  He argues that there is\n\nno basis for  an inference  that he was  involved in  further\n\ndistribution of the  drugs he acquired.   Thus, according  to\n\nLetters, \"[t]he  government's  proof only  demonstrated  that\n\nLetters  was a  regular customer  of Innamorati  for personal\n\nuse.\"     We  need not  decide  when and  whether \"a  regular\n\ncustomer\" buying  for  personal use  could  be treated  as  a\n\nconspirator in a drug distribution  ring, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Moran,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                   \n\nat <span class=\"page\">1302-04</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  because the evidence permitted the  jury to find\n\nthat Letters also distributed portions of the large amount of\n\ncocaine  he  purchased   from  Innamorati.    During   direct\n\nexamination of Tulowiecki, the following exchange took place:\n\n     Q.    And  how  did  you  package the  cocaine  for\n     Letters?\n\n     A.   Well, with  Bill Letters,  we would  take nine\n     grams of cocaine and  put in five grams  of cut.[3]\n     And I  grind that all  together, and it  would come\n     out  to fourteen.  And  I would put  these all into\n     individual  packages.   And  one,  another specific\n     package  for Bill  Letters  himself  that was  pure\n     cocaine.\n\n                        .   .   .   . \n\n                    \n\n     3 Various  witnesses explained  during trial  that \"cut\"\nrefers to  additives  that were  mixed  into the  cocaine  to\nincrease its volume and, potentially, its resale value.\n\n                             -28-\n\n     Q.  Why  did [Innamorati] want  you to package  the\n     cocaine this way [for Letters]?\n\n     A.   Because Billy  Letters didn't have  a scale. .\n     . .\n\n     From  Tulowiecki's reference to individual packaging and\n\nto a separate package of  cocaine \"for Bill Letters himself,\"\n\nthere  is certainly  a permissible  inference that  the other\n\nindividual  packages were  destined to  be resold  to others.\n\nThis  inference is reinforced by the use  of \"cut\" and by the\n\nlarge  volume  of cocaine  that  Letters  acquired, shown  by\n\nTulowiecki's  records to be a total of 336.5 grams of cocaine\n\nbetween June  1987 and February 1988.   Accordingly, Letters'\n\nconvictions  for  conspiring  to distribute  cocaine  and for\n\npossessing cocaine  with intent to distribute  were supported\n\nby adequate evidence.\n\n                    D.  Robert DeMarco Jr.\n\n     DeMarco  Jr. was convicted  of conspiracy and possession\n\nof  cocaine with intent  to distribute.   His  challenge goes\n\nless  to the  quantity of  the evidence  in support  of these\n\nconvictions as to its  quality.  He argues that  the evidence\n\nwas deficient because the government did not catch him in the\n\nact,  such as  by  recording his  telephone conversations  or\n\nconducting  a controlled  buy  from him,  but instead  relies\n\nentirely on \"weak circumstantial evidence.\"  The evidence may\n\nnot be overwhelming but it is sufficient.\n\n                             -29-\n\n     Both Callahan and Scott described repeated deliveries of\n\ncocaine  to DeMarco Jr.  In addition, Callahan testified that\n\nDeMarco Sr. told him that between May 1987 and February 1988,\n\nDeMarco  Jr.  was selling  ounces,  half-ounces and  quarter-\n\nounces of  cocaine to his (DeMarco  Jr.'s) various customers,\n\nand  complained that DeMarco Jr. was  putting all the profits\n\n\"up  his  nose.\"   In  addition, Scott  testified  that after\n\nCallahan  was  arrested,  DeMarco  Jr.   complained  that  he\n\n(DeMarco Jr.)  was supposed to receive the briefcase in which\n\nCallahan  had stored a quantity of cocaine to conceal it from\n\nthe DEA.  The evidence was  adequate to find that DeMarco Jr.\n\nentered into an agreement to distribute cocaine and possessed\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute it.\n\n                      E. Philip Bargalla\n\n     Bargalla was convicted of conspiracy  to distribute, but\n\nacquitted of  the substantive count of  possession of cocaine\n\nwith  intent  to distribute  (the  \"PWI\"  count) and  instead\n\nconvicted  of   the  lesser   included   offense  of   simple\n\npossession.    Bargalla  argues  that  there  was  inadequate\n\nevidence  that he entered into a conspiracy to distribute and\n\nthat,  especially  in  light  of his  acquittal  of  the  PWI\n\noffense, the conspiracy  conviction must  have resulted  from\n\nprejudicial  \"spillover.\"  Bargalla  argues that a conspiracy\n\ncannot  fairly be inferred from the  facts that Bargalla took\n\npossession of Callahan's  briefcase after Callahan's  arrest,\n\n                             -30-\n\nand was  in possession of  Callahan's car at the  time it was\n\nseized by the DEA.\n\n     The short answer is that additional evidence showed that\n\nBargalla  was a  regular purchaser  of cocaine  and marijuana\n\nfrom  Callahan and  a  distributer in  his  own right.    For\n\nexample,  Jeffrey Scott  testified  that he  made about  five\n\ndeliveries of  marijuana to  Bargalla from Callahan  in 1987,\n\nand Callahan confirmed that he sold cocaine  and marijuana to\n\nBargalla on a regular  basis beginning in late 1985  or early\n\n1986.  Moreover, there was evidence that Bargalla resold some\n\nof  the narcotics he acquired from Callahan.  Scott testified\n\nthat he saw  distribution paraphernalia -- a  small scale and\n\nchemicals  such as Inositol that are used to mix with cocaine\n\nto  increase its volume -- in Bargalla's bedroom.  Scott also\n\ntestified  that  Bargalla  complained  that people  were  not\n\npaying  him  on time  for  the  cocaine  and  marijuana  that\n\nBargalla provided them.  \n\n     This  evidence  was  more  than  sufficient  to  support\n\nBargalla's  conviction for  conspiring to  distribute cocaine\n\nand marijuana.   The  testimony concerning the  briefcase and\n\nCallahan's car merely served  to corroborate Bargalla's close\n\nrelationship with Callahan and  his organization.  The jury's\n\nfavorable treatment of him on the PWI count may or may not be\n\na  windfall but it cannot  be used to  impeach the conspiracy\n\nconviction.   See United States  v. Senibaldi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580294\"><a href=\"/opinion/580294/united-states-v-leonard-t-senibaldi/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n                             -31-\n\n1135 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"inconsistency in a criminal verdict is\n\nnot grounds for overturning it\").\n\n                      F.  James Litterio\n\n     Litterio  does  not  question  the  sufficiency  of  the\n\nevidence to support his  conviction for conspiracy.  Instead,\n\nhe challenges the evidence with respect to count  five, under\n\nwhich  he and  Innamorati were  convicted of  possession with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine on  or about September 2,  1987.\n\nWe find the evidence sufficient.\n\n     The  primary evidence  supporting the  possession charge\n\nwas the  testimony of Tulowiecki, who  described a four-ounce\n\npurchase  of cocaine  by  Litterio  from  Innamorati  shortly\n\nbefore  September 2,  1987.   Tulowiecki testified  in detail\n\nthat  he  and Innamorati  packaged  four  ounces of  cocaine,\n\ndelivered  the package  to Litterio,  and received  the $5300\n\npayment several  days later.  Tulowiecki  also testified that\n\nin  the course  of arranging  this transaction  Litterio said\n\nthat he wanted  the four  ounces of cocaine  for his  brother\n\nMark.    In addition,  in  January  1989 Tulowiecki  secretly\n\nrecorded  a  conversation  with Litterio  in  which  Litterio\n\nreferred to the four-ounce transaction.  \n\n     Litterio  argues at  length that  Tulowiecki's testimony\n\nwas   inherently   unreliable   and   uncorroborated.     The\n\ncredibility of  Tulowiecki's testimony  was a matter  for the\n\njury to resolve.  As it happens, there was evidence that Mark\n\n                             -32-\n\nLitterio visited James Litterio immediately  after the latter\n\nacquired the  drugs, and further evidence  that Mark Litterio\n\nwas  involved  in  the sale  of  four  ounces  of cocaine  to\n\nundercover  officers just  after James  Litterio's four-ounce\n\npurchase  from Innamorati.   The  jury could  easily conclude\n\nthat James  Litterio provided the four-ounce  package to Mark\n\nafter acquiring it from Innamorati. \n\n                     G.  Joseph Gilberti\n\n     Gilberti argues  that  evidence of  \"isolated sales\"  of\n\ncocaine from Callahan or Scott to  Gilberti is not sufficient\n\nto  convict  Gilberti of  participation  in  a conspiracy  to\n\ndistribute.   The  evidence, however,  showed more  than mere\n\n\"isolated sales;\" it showed that Gilberti was another cog  in\n\nthe Callahan/Innamorati machine. \n\n     Scott testified that  he delivered  cocaine to  Gilberti\n\nfor  Callahan   in  1986,  generally  in   one  to  two-ounce\n\nquantities.  He testified that he made approximately 25 to 50\n\ndeliveries  of  this  nature  to Gilberti  over  a  six-month\n\nperiod,   including  one   four-ounce  delivery.     Callahan\n\nconfirmed that Gilberti was one of the individuals to whom he\n\ndelivered cocaine.  Gilberti developed  a code with Scott and\n\nCallahan so  that he  could  order drugs  over the  telephone\n\nwithout detection; he would refer to \"green buckets of paint\"\n\nwhen ordering  marijuana, and  \"white buckets of  paint\" when\n\nrequesting cocaine. \n\n                             -33-\n\n     There  was also  evidence that  the distribution  of the\n\ncocaine  did  not  end  when  it  reached  Gilberti.    Scott\n\ntestified   that   he   gave   Gilberti   drug   distribution\n\nparaphernalia--  including  a scale,  ziploc  bags and  other\n\npackaging, and sudocaine, a product used to mix with cocaine-\n\n-and showed  Gilberti  how  to  use these  items.    Callahan\n\ntestified that Gilberti  told him that he, Gilberti, had been\n\ndistributing  cocaine to  an individual  named Ricky  Green. \n\nThe  evidence was adequate  to support  Gilberti's conviction\n\nfor  conspiracy  and possession  of  cocaine  with intent  to\n\ndistribute.   The same  evidence supported the  forfeiture of\n\nGilberti's property  under 21  U.S.C.    853, since  his only\n\nchallenge to that forfeiture  is that the evidence underlying\n\nthe conspiracy conviction was deficient.\n\n        IV.  GRAND JURY TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM THOMPSON\n\n     On June  22, 1988,  Thompson testified at  length before\n\nthe grand jury about the drug distribution conspiracy in this\n\ncase.  Thompson's testimony  consisted almost entirely of the\n\ngovernment's recitation of a prior statement made by Thompson\n\nto  a DEA  agent, interspersed  at intervals  with Thompson's\n\nconfirmation of  the truth of the  prior statement, sometimes\n\nwith  qualifications.   Some  of this  testimony incriminated\n\nThompson  himself,   but  a  great  deal   of  the  testimony\n\nincriminated  certain  of  his   co-defendants,  particularly\n\n                             -34-\n\nInnamorati.  Thompson was  subsequently indicted by the grand\n\njury along with the other defendants in this case.\n\n     At trial, Thompson  elected not to testify.   The court,\n\nover defendants' objections, permitted the government to read\n\ninto evidence the entire  transcript of Thompson's grand jury\n\ntestimony.   Innamorati, Grady, Boisoneau  and, surprisingly,\n\nThompson himself  claim that this testimony  was inadmissible\n\nhearsay and that its introduction was reversible  error.  The\n\ndefendants also argue that  the introduction of this evidence\n\nviolated  their   Sixth  Amendment  right   to  confront  the\n\nwitnesses against them, but this amounts to the same argument\n\ndressed in different garb.4\n\n                     A.  Admissibility  \n\n     The  basis   for  the  district  court's   admission  of\n\nThompson's grand  jury testimony  is not entirely  clear from\n\nthe record.  At one point, the court stated:\n\n     I'm going to allow . . . [the grand jury testimony]\n     in evidence and instruct the jury the conversations\n     pertaining to Thompson  are admitted at  this point\n     only against  Thompson.  Unless and  until there is\n     other   evidence  that  connects  the  other  named\n\n                    \n\n     4The  admission  of  an  out-of-court  statement falling\nwithin  a \"firmly rooted\" exception  to the hearsay rule does\nnot  violate  the Confrontation  Clause.

Both the  rationale of\n\nthe  exception--the   trustworthiness  of  the  unit   to  be\n\nadmitted--and our own precedents  yield no mechanical rule as\n\nto where, in between these extremes, the line is to be drawn.\n\n      A  further concern  is that,  even if  a broad  view is\n\ntaken  as to the scope of the \"statement,\" a co-defendant who\n\nconfesses to  the authorities  and inculpates another  may be\n\nseeking  to curry favor and cast the main blame upon another.\n\nThus  the \"statement\"  as a  whole may  be  very much  in the\n\ninterests of  the confessing party  who is minimizing  his or\n\nher  role.   Some  have urged  a  blanket exclusion  of  such\n\nconfessions as inherently untrustworthy; early drafts of Rule\n\n804(b)(3) excluded \"a statement or confession offered against\n\nthe  accused in  a criminal  case, made  by a  codefendant or\n\nother person implicating both himself and  the accused.\"  See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  4  Weinstein  &amp; Berger,  Weinstein's  Evidence,   \n                                                         \n\n804(b)(3) [03] at 804-152 &amp; n.42 (1992).\n\n     We need not  pursue these issues  in depth.   Thompson's\n\nlengthy grand  jury testimony contains only  a few statements\n\nthat  are  directly  against Thompson's  penal  interest--for\n\nexample,  his descriptions  of procuring the  cellular phones\n\n                             -37-\n\nand checking  license plate numbers--and even  these could be\n\ninnocent acts,  were context  ignored.  If  these inculpatory\n\nstatements of Thompson were isolated  from the rest, it would\n\nbe hard to say that the balance of the grand  jury testimony,\n\nespecially the numerous accusations against  Innamorati, were\n\nagainst   Callahan's  interest.     Thus   if  the   directly\n\ninculpatory statements are severed,  little of the grand jury\n\ntestimony would be against Thompson's interest and admissible\n\nagainst third parties.\n\n     If the inculpatory statements  are not severed, the same\n\nresult  prevails.   Taken as  a  whole the  testimony greatly\n\nminimizes Thompson's own role in any wrongdoing.  He admitted\n\na  few acts  of  logistical assistance,  doubtless hoping  to\n\nmaintain  (as  he  does   here)  that  they  were  innocently\n\nmotivated.   But the thrust  of the testimony  is that others\n\nwere  guilty of  wrongdoing from  which Thompson  himself had\n\nbeen excluded but happened to have some  knowledge.  Although\n\nlater  the extent of this  knowledge could be  turned into an\n\ninference harmful to his  interests, it is difficult  to view\n\nthe  testimony   as  a  whole  as   consciously  contrary  to\n\nThompson's self-interest at the time it was made.  \"[F]or the\n\ndeclaration to  be trustworthy the declarant  must have known\n\nit  was  against  his  interest  at  the  time  he  made  the\n\nstatement\".

Among  other things Thompson\n\ntestified that:\n\n     Mr.   Innamorati  sold  marijuana   while  in  high\n     school . . . .  Around 1970 . .  . [he] developed a\n     large distribution network which comprised of [sic]\n     many   residents   of   Clinton    and   Lancaster,\n     Massachusetts.\n\n     [I]n  1985  Mr.  Innamorati  was  arrested  by  the\n     Massachusetts  State Police [while in possession of\n     cocaine and  he later boasted that he] had paid his\n     attorney . . . several  thousand dollars to fix the\n     charges against Mr. Innamorati.\n\n     [I]n the fall  of 1987, [I] became aware  that both\n     Innamorati   and  Tulowiecki   purchased  automatic\n     pistols  and possessed  these  pistols when  making\n     drug  transactions.  On  several occasions, [I] saw\n     Innamorati  and  Tulowiecki before  and  after drug\n     deals and they were always carrying the pistols.\n\n     Tulowiecki  also told  [me]  that  Innamorati  sent\n     Paula [sic] Bufton  [Innamorati's companion] to the\n     corrections  facility  to  visit   Tulowiecki,  and\n     during  the  meeting, Bufton  told  Tulowiecki that\n     Innamorati put  aside one hundred  thousand dollars\n     for any legal aid that Tulowiecki would incur . . .\n     .   [Bufton told]    Tulowiecki to  be patient  and\n     don't fold.  That Tulowiecki would be taken care of\n     if he did the right thing.\n\n     Nevertheless,   the   case   against    Innamorati   was\n\noverwhelming and it is no accident that his \"insufficiency of\n\nthe  evidence\"  argument  on   this  appeal  is  confined  to\n\nconclusory assertions.  No  less than seven persons testified\n\nfrom  personal  knowledge  that  Innamorati  was  engaged  in\n\ncocaine  and marijuana  dealing, including  among others  his\n\npartners  (Callahan and  Fitzgerald),  his companion  (Pamela\n\n                             -41-\n\nBufton), and his  lieutenant and record-keeper  (Tulowiecki).\n\nDrugs and  money were  confided by Innamorati  to his  friend\n\nJames Casasanto for safe-keeping when the authorities  closed\n\nin  on  the  ring;  and drugs,  weapons,  paraphernalia,  and\n\nrecords were found in the Edgewater apartment that Tulowiecki\n\nmaintained at Innamorati's behest.  \n\n     In fact,  the case against Innamorati--who  stood at the\n\ncenter  of   the  ring's  spider  web--was   a  composite  of\n\nindividual  cases against other  ring members,  reinforced by\n\nadditional  evidence against  Innamorati.   All of  the other\n\nring members  on this  appeal played smaller  parts but  were\n\nconvicted  on the  conspiracy charge  by the  jury.   Most of\n\nthese  persons were  not  directly  implicated by  Thompson's\n\ngrand jury testimony or the testimony was at most duplicative\n\nas to them.   It defies belief that the  jury, faced with the\n\naggregate   of  evidence   against  Innamorati,   would  have\n\nacquitted him of conspiracy if  the grand jury testimony  had\n\nbeen deleted from the record.\n\n     The  remaining convictions  against Innamorati  stand on\n\nthe  same  footing.    To  establish  a  continuing  criminal\n\nenterprise under  21 U.S.C.    848, the government  needed to\n\nshow only  that Innamorati  committed a continuing  series of\n\nviolations of the federal narcotics  laws and that he managed\n\nor  organized five or more individuals.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">David,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.    Without considering  Thompson's\n     \n\n                             -42-\n\ntestimony, the evidence showed continuing violations and that\n\nmore  than five persons acted at Innamorati's direction.  The\n\nindividual  possession  counts  against Innamorati  were  not\n\nsignificantly bolstered  by the  Thompson  testimony and  the\n\nweapons count--which Thompson corroborates--was  supported by\n\nample  and  untainted  evidence  from other  witnesses.    We\n\nconclude that the grand jury testimony was, as to Innamorati,\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Turning  to Boisoneau,  Thompson's grand  jury testimony\n\ncontains  only two references to him.  Near the conclusion of\n\nhis  testimony,  Thompson  identified  Boisoneau  as  one  of\n\nseveral  \"customers of  Innamorati,\" and  stated that  he was\n\npresent at  times when  Innamorati supplied cocaine  to these\n\ncustomers.    A short  time  later,  Thompson testified  that\n\nBoisoneau and  the other  \"customers\" that he  had identified\n\n\"were  just weekend users,\" as  opposed to distributors.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n                                                            \n\nat  114. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   These  two  statements  were  harmless  beyond  a\n\nreasonable   doubt  in  light  of  the  abundant  independent\n\nevidence of  Boisoneau's cocaine use and  of his relationship\n\nwith Innamorati.\n\n     Tulowiecki   testified  that   Boisoneau   was  one   of\n\nInnamorati's  customers;  that   Tulowiecki  had   personally\n\ndelivered  cocaine to Boisoneau;  that Boisoneau was assigned\n\nbeeper number 004 in Innamorati's communications network; and\n\nthat  Boisoneau visited  Tulowiecki in  prison and  relayed a\n\n                             -43-\n\nmessage from Innamorati regarding the  importance of \"keeping\n\n[Tulowiecki's] mouth  shut.\"   Records kept by  Tulowiecki of\n\nInnamorati's  drug sales  showed  that Boisoneau  purchased a\n\ntotal  of  19 grams  of  cocaine between  September  1987 and\n\nJanuary 1988.   Other  witnesses, such  as Pamela  Bufton and\n\nJames  Casasanto,  also   provided  incriminating   evidence.\n\nBufton, for example,  testified that Boisoneau had aided in a\n\ndelivery of cocaine to Innamorati.\n\n     It is  fair to  say that,  as  to Boisoneau,  Thompson's\n\ntestimony (\"just  [a] weekend user[]\")  was almost favorable.\n\nThat Boisoneau was a customer no one could fairly doubt.  The\n\nadditional  detail that  made a  conspiracy  charge plausible\n\ncame  almost  entirely from  others  whom the  jury  chose to\n\nbelieve.  \n\n     Finally,  as to Grady, we have  scoured the thirty pages\n\nof Thompson's grand jury  testimony and are unable to  find a\n\nsingle  reference  to Grady.   Grady  in  his brief  does not\n\nsuggest  any way in which  he was directly  prejudiced by the\n\nadmission of this evidence.   We have no  trouble, therefore,\n\nconcluding that the admission of the grand jury testimony was\n\nharmless as to Grady.    \n\n                         V.  VARIANCE\n\n     Boisoneau argues  that  a \"variance\"  between the  facts\n\nalleged  in the  indictment  and the  facts adduced  at trial\n\nprejudiced  his ability  to defend  the charges  against him.\n\n                             -44-\n\nAlthough he uses the language of variance, Boisoneau's entire\n\nargument  is devoted  to the  contention that  the government\n\nintroduced  evidence at  trial  in addition  to the  evidence\n                                               \n\nlisted as overt acts  in the indictment and presented  to the\n\ngrand jury.\n\n     The indictment sets forth 44 paragraphs of overt acts in\n\nsupport  of the  alleged  conspiracy.   Paragraph 36  alleges\n\nthat,  between  May  1,  1987,  and  early  1988,  Tulowiecki\n\ndistributed  multi-ounce quantities of  cocaine per  month to\n\nseveral buyers,  including Boisoneau.   Paragraph 37  alleges\n\nthat Tulowiecki's  records show  that  Boisoneau purchased  a\n\ntotal of 12 grams of cocaine between September 27 and October\n\n23,  1987.   Boisoneau does not  contend that  the government\n\nfailed  to prove  these allegations  at trial.   Instead,  he\n\nargues that he was charged only with these acts, and that the\n                               \n\ngovernment   \"varied\"   from  the   indictment   by  offering\n\nadditional evidence, such as testimony that Boisoneau  placed\n\ncocaine in the trunk of a car that was to be  driven to Maine\n\nwhere Innamorati  was staying,  and testimony that  Boisoneau\n\nintroduced  Tulowiecki  to  two  individuals  who  wanted  to\n\npurchase cocaine.\n\n     Boisoneau misapprehends the  law.   The government  need\n\nnot  recite all of its evidence  in the indictment, nor is it\n\nlimited  at trial to the overt acts listed in the indictment.\n\nE.g.,  United States v.

The indictment  charged  all  defendants, including\n\nBoisoneau,  with  engaging  in  a  conspiracy  to  distribute\n\ncocaine and  marijuana between 1984  and 1988.   The evidence\n\ncomplained of by Boisoneau falls squarely within the scope of\n\nthat  alleged conspiracy, both  temporally and substantively.\n\nThere is no variance.6 \n\n            VI.  RESTRICTIONS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n                      A.  Paul Callahan\n\n     Callahan was  originally joined  in the indictment  as a\n\nco-conspirator, but pleaded guilty  prior to trial and  was a\n\nprincipal government witness at  trial.  Defendants sought to\n\nimpeach Callahan's credibility during  cross-examination with\n\nevidence that he had engaged in a wide of variety of criminal\n\nacts throughout his life.  The jury learned from the evidence\n\nthat Callahan  had  worked  as  a safecracker,  that  he  was\n\nconvicted for a  dozen specific acts of safecracking, that he\n\nwas a bookmaker, a bank robber, a burglar, a drug dealer, and\n\na  perjurer, and that he  spent much of  his adult life--more\n\nthan  sixteen  years--in  prison.   But  the  court  excluded\n\nevidence relating to Callahan's participation in disposing of\n\n                    \n\n     6In discussing  the  supposed variance,  Boisoneau  also\nalleges that  the government  failed  to produce  exculpatory\nevidence  and  questions the  district  court's  denial of  a\nmotion  for a  bill of  particulars.   No effort  is made  to\ndevelop these issues,  however, and we  do not address  them.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Zannino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

We  see  no abuse  in  excluding the\n\nevidence for this use.\n\n     There is a somewhat more substantial use that might have\n\nbeen  made of the evidence, namely,  to suggest that Callahan\n\ncould still  be  prosecuted  for  involvement  in  homicides,\n\n                             -47-\n\ngiving  the government some hold over  him.  But there was no\n\nindication when the questions were sought to be asked in this\n\ncase  that  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations   still\n\npermitted  prosecution  or,  even  if it  did,  that  federal\n\nauthorities controlled the decision as to future prosecution.\n\n It is not even clear that the prior bad acts were offered to\n\nshow that Callahan was subject to government pressure or that\n\nthis objective was squarely presented to the district judge.\n\n     In  sum,  we  do not  think  that  cross  examination of\n\nCallahan  was unreasonably  restricted.   Similarly,  since a\n\nreasonable  opportunity  to  test  Callahan's   veracity  and\n\nmotives  was   offered,  no  Confrontation  Clause  issue  is\n\npresented.     \"Once  the  defendant  has   been  afforded  a\n\nreasonable opportunity\" for such an inquiry, \"the trial judge\n\nretains broad  discretion in determining the  scope or extent\n\nof cross examination.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524260\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Garcia-Rosa,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524260/united-states-v-blanca-garcia-rosa-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  \n                                   \n\n                      B.  Sean McDonough\n\n     Thompson  challenges  the district  court's restrictions\n\nupon his cross-examination of  DEA agent Sean McDonough.   At\n\ntrial, McDonough  testified that the government  had lost the\n\nonly  copy  of  a  \"corrected statement\"  that  Thompson  had\n\nprovided  to  the  DEA   and  that,  according  to  Thompson,\n\ncontained material exculpatory evidence.  This  statement may\n\nhave  been  in  McDonough's  custody  at  the  time   it  was\n\nmisplaced.    On cross-examination  of  McDonough, Thompson's\n\n                             -48-\n\ncounsel  sought to show that,  in a prior  unrelated case, 86\n\nseconds  mysteriously had been  erased from an  audio tape in\n\nMcDonough's  custody.     The  trial   court  sustained   the\n\ngovernment's objection to this line of inquiry. \n\n     The intent of Thompson's  counsel in inquiring about the\n\nerased  tape  was  to  suggest  to  the  jury  that  in  both\n\ninstances--the  missing  86  seconds and  the  misplaced  DEA\n\nstatement--Agent  McDonough  had  deliberately  concealed  or\n\ndestroyed  material evidence.   Counsel  did not  proffer any\n\nproof that the missing portion of the tape had been linked to\n\nmisconduct by McDonough,  nor was there any showing  that the\n\ncorrected  statement  in  this  case  had  been  deliberately\n\nmisplaced.    Absent  a  foundation  for  this  inquiry,  the\n\ndistrict  court was  justified  under Fed.  R.  Evid. 403  in\n\nforbidding the question.\n\n  VII.  QUASHING OF SUBPOENAS OF SPRINGFIELD POLICE OFFICERS\n\n     During direct examination, government witness Scott gave\n\nthe following account of  an incident that allegedly occurred\n\nduring his cooperation with  the DEA.  On November  27, 1987,\n\nprior  to   Callahan's  agreement   to  cooperate   with  the\n\ngovernment,  two  DEA  agents   wired  Scott  with  a  hidden\n\nrecording device and brought him to  a bar to meet and record\n\na conversation with Callahan.   After the meeting, the agents\n\nagreed  to allow  Scott  to stop  by  his girlfriend's  house\n\nbefore returning to  DEA headquarters.   Scott went into  the\n\n                             -49-\n\nhouse--leaving the agents waiting in the car outside--and was\n\narrested by officers of the Springfield police department who\n\ncoincidentally were raiding the house as part of an unrelated\n\ninvestigation.\n\n     According to  Scott's  testimony, one  officer  searched\n\nScott  and found  nothing.   Then  a second  officer searched\n\nScott  and purported  to find  vials of  cocaine.   Scott was\n\ntaken to  police headquarters and charged  with possession of\n\ncocaine with intent to  distribute.  Scott testified that  he\n\ndid  not have any cocaine in his possession on this occasion,\n\nand  would never  have carried  cocaine  in such  a situation\n\nsince he knew it was standard procedure for the DEA agents to\n\nsearch him  thoroughly each time he returned  to the vehicle.\n\nScott testified that after  being released by the Springfield\n\npolice officers he contacted the DEA agents to complain about\n\nthe  arrest--he thought at first  that the arrest  had been a\n\nploy by the DEA, in conjunction with  the Springfield police,\n\nto  get him  \"under their  thumb\"--and that  subsequently the\n\ncharges were dismissed and he was not prosecuted.7\n\n     Following  this  testimony,  several  of  the defendants\n\nsought to  subpoena the Springfield police  officers involved\n\nin this  incident in an  attempt to  prove that Scott  did in\n\n                    \n\n     7The DEA agents testified  that they too were approached\nby Springfield police officers while waiting in their  car in\nfront  of the house.   Not wanting to  expose Scott's role in\nthe investigation, they quickly departed.\n\n                             -50-\n\nfact possess cocaine  on that  evening.   The district  court\n\nquashed  the subpoenas, finding  that the  proposed testimony\n\nwas inadmissible  under Fed. R. Evid.  608(b), which provides\n\nthat \"[s]pecific  instances of the conduct of  a witness, for\n\nthe  purposes  of  attacking   or  supporting  the   witness'\n\ncredibility, other than conviction of a crime as  provided in\n\nrule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\" \n\n     Defendants  argue that the  officers' proposed testimony\n\nwas not excluded by  Rule 608(b), because defendants did  not\n\nseek merely to impeach Scott's credibility through  extrinsic\n\nevidence of a  prior bad act but also sought  to contradict a\n\nspecific assertion  made by him during  his direct testimony,\n\nthereby showing  that he had lied before the jury in the very\n\ncase.   Nevertheless, the  proposed contradiction  involved a\n\nmatter collateral to the main issues in this trial, since the\n\nSpringfield  incident did not in  any way involve  any of the\n\ndefendants  or the charges against them.  A court may, indeed\n\nnormally does,  preclude a party from  proving with extrinsic\n\nevidence that a witness lied in court on a collateral matter.\n\nSee  United States  v.

Here,  the district court  was justified in\n\npreventing  a major detour  into this  essentially irrelevant\n\nepisode.  \n\n                             -51-\n\n     Defendants  say that the Springfield officers' testimony\n\nwas  relevant because it  showed that Scott  continued to use\n   \n\ncocaine  even  after  his  cooperation with  the  DEA,  which\n\nrebutted his  testimony that he contacted the  DEA because he\n\n\"knew what  we were doing  was totally and  completely wrong\"\n\nand wanted \"to  make things  right.\"  But  Scott admitted  on\n\ncross-examination that he used cocaine long after he began to\n\ncooperate  with the DEA, in fact up  until a couple of months\n\nprior to the  trial.   Thus, the Springfield  episode was  at\n\nbest cumulative evidence, and given the diversion involved to\n\nprocure it,  properly excluded as duplicative  on this issue.\n\nAny  claim by  Scott  as to  the  purity  of his  motive  was\n\nundoubtedly  discounted  by  the jury  since  Scott  received\n\n$250,000 from the government, as well as other benefits.\n\n         VIII.  BELATED PRODUCTION OF DEA NOTES, AND \n               TESTIMONY OF DEA AGENT O'BRIEN \n\n     Edward O'Brien was a  DEA agent who was involved  in the\n\nearly investigation  of this case, but  subsequently left the\n\nDEA  under  some sort  of  cloud;  the circumstances  of  his\n\ndeparture  from  the  agency  are  unclear.    Early  in  the\n\nproceedings,  the court  granted  the government's  motion to\n\nexclude any reference to O'Brien at trial, stating:  \"I don't\n\nwant  him  coming  in  and the  government  being  prejudiced\n\nagainst [sic] because they  had an agent who turned  out bad.\n\nSo we will kick that out.\"  \n\n                             -52-\n\n     On  the fifth  day of  trial, after  the court  made its\n\ninitial decision to exclude O'Brien, the  government produced\n\nto defendants notes made by  DEA Agents McDonough and O'Brien\n\nduring their  initial debriefing of Scott.   Contained within\n\nthese documents  was a  notation that arguably  reads \"driver\n\nfor Fitzgerald = Wall.\"   Grady argued that the  notes tended\n\nto exculpate him,  since he  was accused of  being the  truck\n\ndriver for the  conspiracy.   His theory was  that the  notes\n\nindicated that  the truck  driver was actually  an individual\n\nnamed  Wally  Barrett,  whose  name  had  surfaced  on  other\n\noccasions during the trial.\n\n     Grady questioned  Agent McDonough about the notation but\n\nMcDonough testified that he was not present during the entire\n\ndebriefing,  that he  believed this  particular notation  was\n\nmade  by Agent O'Brien, and that  he (McDonough) knew nothing\n\nabout it.  Grady then asked the court either for dismissal or\n\na mistrial based on the belated disclosure of the exculpatory\n\nevidence  or,  alternatively, for  permission  to call  Agent\n\nO'Brien in light of these new developments.  The court denied\n\nboth  of  these requests.    Grady  argues,  first, that  the\n\nbelated  disclosure  of  the  DEA  notes  violated  Brady  v.\n                                                         \n\nMaryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1963), and deprived him of fair trial;\n        \n\nand  second,  that the  court's  exclusion  of Agent  O'Brien\n\nfurther compounded this violation. \n\n                             -53-\n\n     We   agree  that   the   \"Wall\"   notation   constituted\n\nexculpatory  evidence  within  the  meaning  of  Brady.    It\n                                                      \n\nprovided  Grady  with  a  basis  for  arguing,  or  at  least\n\ndeveloping evidence  to show, that \"Wally\" and  not Grady was\n\nthe truck driver.   However, in cases  of belated disclosure,\n\nas  opposed   to  outright  non-disclosure,   of  exculpatory\n\nevidence,  \"the  critical  inquiry  is  .  .  .  whether  the\n\ntardiness  prevented  defense  counsel  from   employing  the\n\nmaterial to good effect.\"   United States v.

Here, the  notation was produced\n\nearly in the trial, well before the start of defendants' case\n\n(indeed, prior to cross-examination of the government's first\n\nwitness).   We do not  believe that Grady  was prevented from\n\nmaking good use of the information or otherwise prejudiced by\n\nthe delay.8  \n\n     Although Grady  argues that  he was prejudiced  by being\n\ndeprived  of  the  opportunity  to  investigate  the   \"Wall\"\n\nreference  prior to trial, he never asked the trial court for\n\na  continuance to allow him to investigate the reference.  We\n\nhave  held it  \"incumbent  upon a  party  faced with  such  a\n\nsituation to  ask explicitly  that the  court grant  the time\n\n                    \n\n     8There is  no indication that the  notation was withheld\nin  bad  faith  or  deliberately suppressed.    The  disputed\nnotation consists of  one line in a  voluminous collection of\nnotes; the notation  itself is difficult  to decipher and  is\nsubject to different readings.   Its exculpatory nature--even\nassuming  defendants'  reading  is  the  correct  one--is not\nimmediately apparent.\n\n                             -54-\n\nneeded to regroup, or waive the point . . . .\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Nor has Grady  described any specific\n\navenue of investigation that would have been pursued had  the\n\nnotation been  disclosed earlier.   Accordingly, we  conclude\n\nthat the  belated disclosure of  the \"Wall\" notation  did not\n\nprejudice Grady and does not entitle him to a new trial.    \n\n     Grady  contends that at  the very  least he  should have\n\nbeen permitted to call Agent O'Brien to the stand to question\n\nhim  about  the  notation.    The  government's   unsupported\n\nresponse that  O'Brien \"likely  had little to  add concerning\n\nthe  notes of  the Jeffrey  Scott debriefing\"  is not  at all\n\ncomforting.   What O'Brien might have added is that Scott did\n\nsay  that   the  driver   referred  to  was   Wally  Barrett,\n\ninformation  that  would  be  helpful  to  Grady  if it  were\n                                                    \n\nadmissible for its  truth.  But Scott's statements to O'Brien\n\nduring the debriefing would have been inadmissible hearsay if\n\noffered for their truth  (as opposed to impeachment).   Thus,\n\nthe  exclusion  of O'Brien  did not  prejudice Grady  in this\n\nrespect.\n\n     The  only apparent  use that  Grady could  have made  at\n\ntrial  of  the \"Wall\"  notation  would have  been  to impeach\n\nJeffrey Scott's testimony.   Scott testified that  he did not\n\nknow the name of Innamorati's driver; Grady could  have asked\n\nhim on cross-examination whether  he recalled telling the DEA\n\n                             -55-\n\nthat  the  driver's name  was Wally.    Grady sought  to call\n\nO'Brien  to the stand to question him about the notation, but\n       \n\nhe  never  sought  to  recall   Scott  for  further  cross  -\n\nexamination  once the notes were produced.  If Scott had been\n\nasked about the  \"Wall\" statement and denied  making it, then\n\nGrady might have been  entitled to call O'Brien in  an effort\n\nto prove that  Scott in fact made the  statement.  Absent any\n\neffort by  Grady  to cross-examine  Scott  on the  point,  we\n\ncannot  see  how  the  court's  refusal  to  involve  O'Brien\n\nprejudiced Grady.9\n\n                   IX.  PAYMENTS TO WITNESS\n\n     Scott,  a key  witness  for  the  prosecution,  received\n\n$250,000  from   the  government  prior  to   trial  for  his\n\ncooperation  as   well  as  immunity  from   prosecution  and\n\nenrollment in  the federal  witness protection program.   The\n\n$250,000  payment was  made pursuant  to a  DEA  program that\n\nawards  twenty  percent  of  the value  of  seized  assets to\n\nparties  who are  instrumental in  successful investigations.\n\n                    \n\n     9Grady also complains of  the district court's denial of\nhis motion for a mistrial based on a violation of the court's\nsequestration  order.    The   violation  occurred  when  the\ngovernment  permitted  Fitzgerald  and Callahan  to  converse\ntogether   in  the   prosecutor's  office   after  Callahan's\ntestimony but prior to Fitzgerald's.  The district court held\na voir dire, rebuked the government, but refused to declare a\nmistrial.   Briefly addressing this issue,  Grady provides no\npersuasive explanation for his  claim of prejudice and  we do\nnot  think that  the  trial court  abused  its discretion  in\ndenying  the mistrial motion.

And the  court instructed  the jury  to\n\nconsider  carefully any  inducements or  advantages that  any\n\nwitnesses  had received.   Finally,  the $250,000  payment to\n\nScott was  completed  several days  prior to  trial, and  the\n\npayment was  thus not directly  dependent upon the  result of\n\nScott's testimony in court.\n\n     Clearly  such  immense  payments  are  troubling.    The\n\npayments  may be  for  \"information,\" rather  than for  later\n\ntestimony or convictions,  but the steps  are linked and  the\n\ninducement  to testify  in accordance  with prior  reports is\n\nobvious.   Yet  defendants are  regularly convicted  based on\n\ntestimony secured  by the prosecutor's decision  to reduce or\n\ndismiss charges  against testifying co-defendants.   In fact,\n\nCongress has enacted statutes  that directly reward those who\n\ndisclose  misconduct   and  who  doubtless  testify  for  the\n\n                             -58-\n\ngovernment in the  ensuing trials.11   In all events,  Cresta\n                                                             \n\nis the governing law in this circuit and controls this case.\n\n               X.  COMMENTS BY THE PROSECUTION \n\n     Boisoneau alleges  that he  was  unfairly prejudiced  by\n\nimproper  comments made  by  the  prosecutor  during  closing\n\nargument.  First, Boisoneau  challenges the following passage\n\nfrom  the prosecutor's rebuttal argument  at the close of the\n\ncase,  in   which  the  prosecutor  sought   to  justify  the\n\ngovernment's $250,000  payment to  Scott in exchange  for his\n\ncooperation:\n\n     What did the  government know before  Jeffrey Scott\n     walked  into  the [DEA]  in  contrast  to what  the\n     government  knew  as  a result  of  Jeffrey Scott's\n     cooperation?   And even on pure  dollars and cents,\n     consider  the amount  of forfeitures,  the seizures\n     that it led to.  But go beyond that, because if you\n     do a  cost benefit analysis you  must also consider\n     the cost  that was saved to  society by dismantling\n     an    operation like  the  one  you've heard  about\n     here. . . . \n\nBoisoneau made  no objection  to these remarks  during trial,\n\nand our review is therefore limited to plain error.

These remarks do  not suggest to  us that\n\nsome actual  cost-benefit analysis was undertaken:   they are\n\nnothing more  than an argument, using  the latest fashionable\n\njargon, that  the  payment was  reasonable  in light  of  the\n\nresults obtained.  The  prosecutor's own language--\"if you do\n                                                          \n\na cost benefit analysis\"--shows that he was merely suggesting\n\na way for the jury to look at the payment.\n\n     Boisoneau also  objects to the prosecutor's statement in\n\nclosing  that  the  trial  judge alone  would  determine  the\n\nsentences for each of the cooperating witnesses, and that the\n\njury  therefore  should not  think  that  the witnesses  were\n\ngetting  \"a walk.\"   Boisoneau  points out  that in  fact the\n\ngovernment had dismissed, or  elected not to assert, numerous\n\ncriminal  charges against  many of the  cooperating witnesses\n\nand also had promised to make motions for downward departures\n\nwith  respect to  certain  witnesses.   Therefore,  Boisoneau\n\nargues,  the  government in  fact  had  far more  significant\n\ninfluence  on  the  witnesses'  ultimate sentences  than  the\n\nprosecutor's disclaimers would suggest.\n\n     We agree that the  prosecutor's statement told only half\n\nthe story, but it is usually the function of opposing counsel\n\n                             -60-\n\nto remind the jury of the other half.   Indeed, witnesses are\n\nnormally cross-examined as to just such inducements.  Perhaps\n\nin some instances a prosecutor's incomplete version of events\n\nmight  involve   so  much   distortion   that  a   cautionary\n\ninstruction  by the trial judge  would be required.   In this\n\ninstance,  no  objection  was  made  at  the  trial  nor  any\n\ninstruction sought, and there is no \"plain error\" here in the\n\ncourt's failure to give  such an instruction sua sponte.   We\n                                                       \n\nhave   similarly  examined   Boisoneau's   other  claims   of\n\nprejudicial  error arising  out  of the  prosecutor's closing\n\narguments and find them unpersuasive.\n\n     Nor do  we see any  merit in Thompson's  suggestion that\n\nthe   prosecutor's   closing   argument  contained   improper\n\n\"vouching\" for the government's  witnesses.  The line between\n\nthe  legitimate  argument  that  a   witness's  testimony  is\n\ncredible and improper \"vouching\"  is often a hazy one,  to be\n\npoliced by the trial court in the first instance.

FAILURE TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE\n\n     Thompson   argues  that  his  due  process  rights  were\n\nviolated by  the government's failure to preserve exculpatory\n\nevidence,  specifically  a  DEA-6   form  prepared  by  Agent\n\nMcDonough summarizing an interview with Thompson.  It appears\n\nthat McDonough  interviewed Thompson  on March 10,  1988, and\n\nthen memorialized the interview  on the DEA-6 form.   On June\n\n22,  1988, just  prior  to Thompson's  appearance before  the\n\ngrand jury,  McDonough again met with  Thompson, and Thompson\n\nmade  certain handwritten  corrections on  the form  and then\n\nsigned it.  In  the grand jury, the government  attorney read\n\neach  statement on the DEA-6 form to Thompson, and then asked\n\nThompson to confirm the truth of the statement.  Thompson did\n\nso, making some  modifications or corrections.  The form with\n\nThompson's handwritten  corrections was lost  after the grand\n\njury appearance.\n\n     Thompson filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the\n\nground that the DEA-6 form  as corrected by him prior to  the\n\ngrand jury appearance was  material exculpatory evidence, and\n\nthat  the  government's  failure  to preserve  that  evidence\n\ndeprived him  of a fair trial.  This motion was denied by the\n\nmagistrate judge  to whom it  was referred.   The  magistrate\n\njudge's report advised the parties that pursuant to the local\n\n                             -62-\n\nrules the failure  to file written  objections to the  report\n\nwithin ten  days \"shall preclude further  appellate review by\n\nthe Court of  Appeals.\"   Thompson failed to  file a  written\n\nobjection.   The issue, therefore, was waived.

The   corrected  DEA-6  form  was  essentially\n\npreserved by  the grand  jury testimony itself,  during which\n\nthe government attorney  went through the  form line-by-line.\n\nThe transcript of this  grand jury testimony was read  to the\n\njury at trial.  \n\n                   XII.  JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n     Several  defendants--Thompson,   Letters,  Litterio  and\n\nBoisoneau--challenge  various aspects of the district court's\n\ncharge to the jury.  \n\n     First, Thompson  argues that the court  erred by denying\n\nhis request for an instruction stating that the motor vehicle\n\nlicenses and registrations were public documents.  As already\n\nnoted, one of the crucial pieces of evidence linking Thompson\n\nto the conspiracy was his provision to Innamorati of registry\n\nchecks on the license plates  of vehicles of which Innamorati\n\nwas  suspicious.  Thompson asked  that the jury  be told that\n\n\"as a matter of law, motor vehicle licenses and registrations\n\n                             -63-\n\nare public  documents, and disclosure of  their contents does\n\nnot, in itself, violate the law.\"\n\n     The only  case on the  point cited in  Thompson's brief,\n\nDoe   v.

In any event, the government did not charge Thompson\n\nwith  stealing government secrets;  it was  enough for  it to\n\nshow that  Thompson's behavior in facilitating  access to the\n\nregistry  was part of the conspiracy.  There is no indication\n\nthat the instructions  as a whole misled the jury  as to what\n\nwas needed to convict on the conspiracy count.\n\n     Second, Thompson challenges the district court's refusal\n\nto instruct  that \"mere proof of  a buyer-seller relationship\n\nis  not enough  to convict  one as  a co-conspirator  on drug\n\nconspiracy  charges.\"    This   instruction  is  at  best  an\n\nincomplete statement of the law of conspiracy.   Depending on\n\nthe  surrounding  circumstances, a  buyer-seller relationship\n\ncould, in some cases, be the very core of a drug distribution\n\nconspiracy.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1508</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1992).  \n                        \n\n     In  this instance,  the  gist of  the conspiracy  charge\n\nagainst Thompson was not  his drug purchases as such  but his\n\nother  affirmative  acts--notably, procuring  cellular phones\n\nand performing license plate checks--that the government said\n\nwere knowingly designed to assist Innamorati's extensive drug\n\nring operations.   We doubt whether  the instruction Thompson\n\nsought  is well  tailored  even  for  a  case  in  which  the\n\nconspiracy  charge  focuses  on  multiple  purchases  and the\n\n\"defense\"  is personal  use.   The  instruction is  even less\n\nappropriate for the case actually presented against Thompson.\n\n     Finally, Thompson complains in  a cursory fashion of the\n\ntrial  court's responses  to several  questions posed  by the\n\njury  during  its  deliberations.     For  example,  although\n\nThompson   argues   that  a   supplementary   instruction  on\n\nconspiracy was a \"misstatement\"  of law, he fails to  tell us\n\nhow  the statement  was inaccurate.   We find  no prejudicial\n\nerror here, nor with respect to  each of Thompson's remaining\n\nobjections to the judge's handling of the jury's inquiries.\n\n     Next,  Letters   says  that  the   court's  supplemental\n\ninstruction on  the definition  of \"aiding and  abetting,\" in\n\nresponse   to  a   jury  inquiry   on  the   fourth  day   of\n\ndeliberations, failed to tell  the jury that some affirmative\n\nparticipation on the  part of the  defendant is required  for\n\n                             -65-\n\nconviction.    Letters failed  to  object  to the  challenged\n\nlanguage  at trial.   Once  again confining  our review  to a\n\nsearch  for plain  error,  we find  none.   The  supplemental\n\ninstruction adequately  informed the  jury  of the  requisite\n\nlevel  of participation  required to  convict for  aiding and\n\nabetting.  Letters' underlying concern--that the jury be told\n\nthat merely purchasing  cocaine for personal use does not aid\n\nand abet the seller's  possession with intent to distribute--\n\nwas specifically  addressed by the court  in the supplemental\n\ninstruction immediately after the portion Letters challenges.\n\n     Finally, Litterio  and  Boisoneau  claim  as  error  the\n\ndistrict court's  refusal to give their requested \"accomplice\n\ntestimony\" instruction.  From reading their briefs, one might\n\nget the impression that no \"accomplice testimony\" instruction\n\nwas  provided.

ADMISSION OF \"DRUG LEDGER\" AND TELEPHONE SUMMARIES \n\n     Thompson devotes a half page in his brief to an argument\n\nthat  the  court  abused   its  discretion  by  allowing  the\n\n                             -66-\n\ngovernment  to  introduce two  items  of  evidence: first,  a\n\n\"ledger\" and related evidence summarizing certain of the drug\n\nsales made  by Tulowiecki; and second,  evidence of telephone\n\ncalls between various  telephone numbers associated  with the\n\nalleged  conspiracy,  as  well  as  summary  charts  of  that\n\ninformation.  \n\n     The drug  \"ledger\" was  a book maintained  by Tulowiecki\n\nfor about a month  in the fall of  1987, in which  Tulowiecki\n\nrecorded  cocaine  sales,  showing  the  purchaser  (by  code\n\nnumber), the amount  of narcotics bought,  the price and  the\n\ndate.    When not  using  the  ledger, Tulowiecki  frequently\n\nrecorded cocaine sales on  slips of paper, a number  of which\n\nwere also introduced into  evidence.  In addition, Tulowiecki\n\nprepared  for use at trial a summary of the transactions that\n\nwere  recorded in  the  ledger and  on  the slips  of  paper.\n\nDefendants did not object at trial to the introduction of the\n\nledger and  original  papers, but  they did  object when  the\n\ngovernment   sought   to   introduce  Tulowiecki's   summary.\n\nThompson's brief  does not identify any  basis for concluding\n\nthat the admission of these materials was error.\n\n     The  telephone evidence  consisted of  frequency reports\n\nshowing the number of calls between various telephone numbers\n\nof persons and businesses  associated with the conspiracy, as\n\nwell  as charts  summarizing that  information.   Many courts\n\nhave  admitted this  type  of evidence  in conspiracy  cases.\n\n                             -67-\n\nE.g.,  United States v.

Thompson argues\n       \n\nthat  the telephone  records  did not  identify the  specific\n\npersons  who made  or  received the  calls;  but this  merely\n\nlimits and does not eliminate their relevance.  Thompson also\n\nsays  that \"testimony  and exhibits  made it  clear  that the\n\ncompilation of numbers  [in the  government's summaries]  did\n\nnot match the phone  records.\"  But Thompson fails  either to\n\nspecify  any respects  in  which the  summary materials  were\n\ninaccurate or to cite us any such \"testimony and exhibits.\"\n\n             XIV.  \"GUILT ASSUMING HYPOTHETICALS\"\n\n     Thompson  argues that he is  entitled to a  new trial on\n\naccount  of the  prosecutor's use,  in Thompson's  phrase, of\n\n\"guilt assuming hypotheticals\" during redirect examination of\n\nLancaster  Police   Chief   Eric  Mcavene.     During   cross\n\nexamination   of  Mcavene,   Thompson's  counsel   sought  to\n\nestablish that it was  a common practice for police  officers\n\nto  run  registry checks  on  license plates,  and  that such\n\nchecks  were  done  for   many  different  reasons  including\n\nrequests  from the  public.   Mcavene admitted  that registry\n\nchecks  were conducted for a  variety of reasons  and that he\n\nwas not consulted in every instance.\n\n     In  response, government  counsel  sought to  dispel the\n\nnotion  that  registry information  was  freely disseminated.\n\n                             -68-\n\nPursuing that  theme, the  prosecutor asked Mcavene,  \"[I]f a\n\nknown drug dealer had  asked you for a Registry  check, would\n\nyou do  it for him?\"   Before  the witness could  answer, the\n\ncourt  upon objection  ruled (mistakenly) that  this question\n\nhad already been asked.   The prosecutor acquiesced and moved\n\non to his next inquiry:  \"[I]f William Thompson had asked you\n\nfor the Registry check  would you have  done it?\"  The  court\n\nsustained Thompson's objection  to this question, struck  the\n\nquestion, and denied Thompson's motion for a mistrial.\n\n     It may be a close call whether either of these questions\n\nwas improper as an implied assertion that Thompson was a drug\n\ndealer,  but we  need  not pursue  the issue.   Even  if both\n\nquestions were error,  they did not  conceivably have such  a\n\nprejudicial impact as to  require reversal.  Neither question\n\nwas answered  by  the  witness,  one was  stricken  from  the\n\nrecord,  and the  court  elsewhere instructed  the jury  that\n\nstatements of counsel are not  evidence.  The precise  limits\n\non who could obtain  registry checks was largely a  side-show\n\nand Mcavene's attitude toward disclosure was a subject raised\n\nby Thompson's own counsel.\n\n                 XV.  MARK LITTERIO EVIDENCE \n\n     Litterio argues  that the court erred  by permitting the\n\ngovernment  to  introduce  evidence  of  a  drug  transaction\n\ninvolving  Litterio's brother,  Mark Litterio,  as well  as a\n\nstatement  made by  Mark Litterio  to an  undercover officer.\n\n                             -69-\n\nLitterio was convicted under count five of the indictment for\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  The primary\n\nevidence was  Tulowiecki's testimony that  Litterio purchased\n\nfour ounces  of cocaine from Innamorati in  late August 1987.\n\nAccording to  Tulowiecki, Litterio  said at  the time  of the\n\npurchase that he was buying the cocaine for his brother Mark.\n\nTo  corroborate  this   testimony,  the  government   offered\n\ntestimony from a parade of police officers  showing that Mark\n\nLitterio  and an accomplice were involved in the sale of four\n\nounces of  cocaine just after James  Litterio's purchase from\n\nInnamorati.\n\n     Although the evidence of  the Mark Litterio  transaction\n\nwas a major detour,  the evidence was relevant to  the charge\n\nagainst  Litterio in count five.  The fact that Mark Litterio\n\nsold  four ounces of cocaine to  undercover agents just after\n\nJames  Litterio  bought  the  same  amount   from  Innamorati\n\nstrongly  corroborated  Tulowiecki's  testimony.    The  only\n\n\"prejudice\" was  the potential for distracting  the jury with\n\ndetails of an uncharged  crime, and this judgment  is largely\n\nwithin  the discretion of the trial judge.

This statement, however, was  admissible against\n\nLitterio  under Fed.  R.

But based  on this single transaction James\n\nand Mark  Litterio were evidently engaged in  a conspiracy in\n\nwhich  James   supplied,  and  Mark  sold,   four  ounces  of\n\ncocaine.12    Mark  Litterio's  statement to  the  undercover\n\nofficers  was in  furtherance  of it.

For  example, in  one of  the instances\n\ncited by Demarco Jr.,  Callahan testified that he distributed\n\nportions of  two half-kilograms of cocaine  to, among others,\n\n\"the Demarcos.\"   Upon counsel's objection  to the collective\n\nreference, the  prosecutor asked  whether Robert  DeMarco Sr.\n\nand Robert DeMarco  Jr. \"were  both present\" at  the time  of\n\nthis distribution, and Callahan replied, \"Yes.\"\n\n     A witness may testify that two persons jointly performed\n\na  given  act so  long as  confusion is  avoided.   Here, the\n\nwitness was merely using  the shorthand phrase \"the DeMarcos\"\n\nto  refer to \"both Robert DeMarco Sr. and Robert DeMarco Jr.\"\n\nWhen counsel  objected, the  witness made clear  his meaning.\n\nWe have examined the other instances cited by DeMarco Jr. and\n\nfind them to be equally lacking in confusion or prejudice.\n\n                 XVII.  EX PARTE PROCEEDINGS\n                                \n\n     After  the trial  concluded,  the government  discovered\n\ninformation  in its  possession that  related to  an incident\n\n                             -72-\n\nrecounted during the trial testimony of a government witness.\n\nAlthough the government believed that the information was not\n\nBrady material,  it did not  wish to conceal  the information\n     \n\nfrom  the   court  or  take  the   final  responsibility  for\n\nappraising its importance.  At  the same time, the government\n\nfeared  that   release  of  the  information   would  pose  a\n\nsubstantial danger of serious harm.\n\n     Accordingly, the government submitted the information to\n\nthe district  court ex parte,  described the reasons  for its\n                            \n\nposition  and  explained  why  it  feared  disclosure.    The\n\ndistrict court  ruled that  the information was  not material\n\nand  that the  government's justification  for non-disclosure\n\nwas  persuasive.    The   district  court  sealed  its  order\n\ncontaining these  rulings.   At no  time during  this episode\n\nwere  defendants  or  their   counsel  made  aware  of  these\n\nproceedings or of the court's order.\n\n     The government's  submission  and the  district  court's\n\norder  were forwarded  to  this  court  and  brought  to  the\n\nattention of this panel.   This court in turn issued an order\n\non  November 18, 1992,  informing all defense  counsel of the\n\nexistence  of the  ex parte  proceedings.   Not surprisingly,\n                           \n\ndefendants have  moved for disclosure of  the information, or\n\nat the very least a synopsis of the information  so that they\n\nmay argue  intelligently as to  its materiality and  the need\n\nfor disclosure.   Certain defendants also  argue that the  ex\n                                                             \n\n                             -73-\n\nparte procedures utilized by the district court deprived them\n     \n\nof a fair trial.\n\n     We sympathize  with defendants' protestations  and agree\n\nthat  the procedures  utilized in  this case  raise extremely\n\nserious  issues.

Yet there  is no\n\nquestion here  of  convictions  based  upon  secret  evidence\n\nfurnished to the factfinder but withheld from the defendants.\n\nWhat  the government did was to provide material to the court\n\nto permit the court to determine whether under applicable law\n\nthe material needed  to be  produced to the  other side  and,\n\ncollaterally, to  determine  whether there  was a  legitimate\n\nreason for continued secrecy in the submission.\n\n     Each  of the three  judges on this  panel has considered\n\nthe information  in this  case bearing  on these  two issues.\n\nOur standard in this inquiry was to resolve every  legitimate\n\ndoubt in favor of the defendants precisely because they could\n\nnot argue  the matter for  themselves.  We  nevertheless have\n\nconcluded that there was a substantial threat of serious harm\n\nwarranting  the initial  examination  by the  district  court\n\nwithout  notice to  defendants;  that the  threat has  abated\n\nsufficiently to justify notice to the  defendants now but not\n\nthe  disclosure  of  the  information itself;  and  that  the\n\ninformation, whether or not technically Brady material, would\n                                             \n\nnot  have significantly  assisted any  of the  defendants and\n\ncould not conceivably have altered any of the verdicts.\n\n     As  for  the  government's  action  in  submitting   the\n\ninformation   to  the   district  court  without   notice  to\n\n                             -76-\n\ndefendants, we would expect this dangerous  course to be very\n\nrare  indeed,  but  in this  instance  we  find  that it  was\n\njustified  and, given  the unimportance  of the  material, it\n\ninflicted  no prejudice on the defendants.  No doubt we could\n\nconstruct a judicial rule forbidding the government, absent a\n\nstatute  or regulation,  from making  any secret  submission.\n\nBut  we think that the interests of justice are better served\n\nby  encouraging  the government  to  let  the district  court\n\nresolve  the Brady  issue or  like questions in  close cases.\n                  \n\nDefendants  in  general would  not  gain from  a  regime that\n\nencouraged the government to decide the matter itself.  \n\n                  XVIII.  SENTENCING ISSUES\n\n                       A.  Introduction\n\n     Thompson,  DeMarco Sr., Letters,  Litterio and Boisoneau\n\nchallenge the district court's calculation of their sentences\n\nunder  the  Sentencing  Guidelines.14    Many of  defendants'\n\narguments concern  the court's  calculation of the  amount of\n\nnarcotics attributable  to each defendant.   It is  useful to\n\nsay a few words on the subject at the outset.  \n\n     Under the  Guidelines, the  sentence for  a drug-related\n\noffense hinges  substantially upon the total  amount of drugs\n\ninvolved in  that offense.    See U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(c)  (drug\n                                 \n\n                    \n\n     14The  district court  applied the  1990 version  of the\nSentencing  Guidelines  and  therefore  all  citations unless\notherwise indicated are to that version.\n\n                             -77-\n\nquantity  table).15   This determination  often turns  on the\n\n\"relevant   conduct\"  provision  of   the  Guidelines,  which\n\nprovides  that  a defendant's  base  offense  level shall  be\n\ndetermined on the basis of \"all acts and omissions  committed\n\nor  aided  and abetted  by the  defendant,  or for  which the\n\ndefendant  would  be  otherwise  accountable,  that  occurred\n\nduring the commission  of the offense of conviction  . . . .\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1).   In the case  of concerted criminal\n\nactivity, conduct \"for which the defendant would be otherwise\n\naccountable\" includes  \"conduct of others  in furtherance  of\n\nthe execution  of  the jointly-undertaken  criminal  activity\n\nthat  was  reasonably foreseeable  by  the  defendant.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n                                                            \n\ncomment note </span><pre class=\"inline\">1.\n\n     Thus, \"[t]he  central concept . .  . is foreseeability.\"\n\nUnited  States v.

The\n\ncourt also  relied heavily  on detailed  pre-sentence reports\n\nprepared  by the  probation officer.   See  Fed. R.  Crim. P.\n                                          \n\n32(c).

William Thompson\n\n     Thompson first argues that  the Sentencing Guidelines do\n\nnot apply to him because the principal evidence against him--\n\nthe  provision  of  registry  checks  and  cellular  phones--\n\noccurred  prior   to  November  1987,   when  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  took  effect.    Thompson waived  this  claim  by\n\n                             -79-\n\nfailing  to  make  it during  the  sentencing  process.

Thompson's principal\n\ncontributions to the venture  did not lie in  particular drug\n\ntransactions  but  rather in  the  provision  of services  to\n\nInnamorati.     Thompson   helped  Innamorati   set   up  his\n\ncommunications network and ran  license plate registry checks\n\non prospective customers, and  Thompson knew Innamorati was a\n\nlarge-scale distributor.   Innamorati himself was responsible\n\nfor the  importation  and distribution  of  approximately  16\n\nkilograms of cocaine and 450 pounds of marijuana.\n\n     The   pre-sentence   report   concluded  that   Thompson\n\npurchased  small  quantities  of  cocaine  for  personal  use\n\namounting  to  approximately  46 grams.    Further,  Thompson\n\nadmitted before the grand  jury that he had been  aware since\n\n1983 or  1984 that  Innamorati was distributing  cocaine, and\n\nthat  he  often  was   present  in  Innamorati's  house  when\n\nInnamorati  possessed large  amounts  of cocaine.   Based  on\n\nthese  facts, the  probation  officer (and  later the  court)\n\n                             -80-\n\ndetermined that  it was reasonable to  conclude that Thompson\n\ncould have  foreseen that Innamorati was  dealing in multiple\n\nkilograms.   Recognizing  that it  was engaged  in a  \"highly\n\nspeculative  task,\" the  probation  officer  determined  that\n\nThompson  could  reasonably  have foreseen  3.2  kilograms of\n\ncocaine, based  on the cocaine  purchased and the  cocaine he\n\npersonally saw in Innamorati's house.\n\n     We  think the 3.2 kilogram finding is  at the low end of\n\nthe range  of figures that might reasonably have been chosen.\n\nThompson   knowingly   assisted   Innamorati's    drug   ring\n\noperations, well  aware that  Innamorati was involved  in the\n\nimportation and distribution of large amounts of cocaine.  He\n\nsaw  large caches  of cocaine in  Innamorati's home  and made\n\npurchases  for  himself,  and   the  district  court  treated\n\nThompson favorably by  limiting his  accountability to  these\n\namounts.  The  computation of what  Thompson himself saw  and\n\nbought  is   necessarily  an   estimate  but  is   hardly  an\n\nimplausible one.  We see no error.\n\n     Thompson  argues that  the court  wrongly  increased his\n\nbase offense level under U.S.S.G.   3B1.3, which provides for\n\na two-level  enhancement if \"the defendant  abused a position\n\nof  public  or  private  trust  .   .  .  in  a  manner  that\n\nsignificantly  facilitated the  commission or  concealment of\n\nthe offense.\"  The  court based this enhancement on  the fact\n\nthat Thompson  had worked as a  Massachusetts Registry police\n\n                             -81-\n\nofficer from 1978 until  some time around 1985 and  used that\n\nposition  to gain access to the registry computer and provide\n\nlicense plate checks to Innamorati.  \n\n     Employment   as  a   registry  police   officer  clearly\n\nqualifies as a  \"position of public .  . . trust\"  within the\n\nmeaning  of the Guideline.  E.g., United States v. Rehal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565197\"><a href=\"/opinion/565197/united-states-v-charles-rehal/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5  (1st Cir.  1991) (police sergeant).   Although  we\n\nhave found no case law on point, we do not believe it matters\n\nthat Thompson was no longer employed with the registry at the\n\ntime he provided the information to Innamorati, so long as he\n\nabused the access that his former position afforded him.  The\n\nGuideline itself does  not limit its application  to cases in\n\nwhich  the  defendant  is  employed  at  the  time,  and  the\n\nunderlying policy appears to apply to this case.  \n\n     If and when others among the public could gain access to\n\nmotor  vehicle information  in the  registry is  not entirely\n\nclear.  But the evidence  at trial indicated that  Thompson's\n\nprior employment  made it  easier for  Innamorati  to do  so.\n\nThere was police testimony that it was improper for anyone to\n\nperform  a check without  a valid law  enforcement purpose, a\n\ntest that Thompson's activities clearly  did not meet.  Given\n\nthese facts,  we do  not  believe that  the sentencing  judge\n\ncommitted clear  error by  concluding that Thompson  abused a\n\nposition of public trust.

The\n\nGuideline  also  permits the  court  to  award a  three-level\n\ndecrease to persons whose participation was more than minimal\n\nbut less than minor.

At the  same time,  the\n\ncourt  found   that  Thompson   played  a  limited   role  in\n\nInnamorati's  overall  distribution activities,  and  was not\n\nshown  to have  cocaine  himself or  to  have shared  in  the\n\nprofits.    The court  was  reasonable,  indeed generous,  in\n\n                             -83-\n\nawarding Thompson a three-level reduction for persons falling\n\nin between the \"minimal\" and \"minor\" participant categories.\n\n                    C.  Robert DeMarco Sr.\n\n     DeMarco Sr. challenges the court's determination that he\n\nis accountable for  4.25 kilograms of cocaine.   This finding\n\nwas  based on  the  testimony of  Callahan at  the sentencing\n\nhearing that he  distributed an average of a quarter kilogram\n\nof cocaine per month to DeMarco Sr. from January 1987 through\n\nFebruary 1988.  It is unclear whether  Callahan was including\n\nin this \"average\"  one or  both of  two initial  one-kilogram\n\nsales  to DeMarco Sr.   But the district  judge resolved that\n\nuncertainty  by  concluding that  one  of  the kilograms  was\n\nincluded  in the  average  and  the  other  was  not.    This\n\nconclusion  was  not  clearly erroneous.    Indeed,  Callahan\n\ntestified:\n\n     I  would say the second  full kilo was  part of the\n     average.  But conservatively  speaking, I would say\n     you could  exclude the  first kilo and  the average\n     would still be quarter kilo a month.\n\nThus,  the sum of 4.25 kilograms was derived by totalling the\n\nquarter  kilogram sales over  a thirteen-month  period (which\n\namounts to  3.25 kilograms),  and then adding  the additional\n\none-kilogram  sale.   Although  there  were discrepancies  in\n\nCallahan's testimony as to  the quantities and dates of  drug\n\nsales  to  DeMarco  Sr.,   \"the  court's  choice  from  among\n\nsupportable alternatives  cannot be clearly erroneous.\"   See\n                                                             \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581510\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">McCarthy,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/581510/united-states-v-william-e-mccarthy-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n        \n\n                             -84-\n\n     DeMarco  Sr.  also  argues  that the  court  abused  its\n\ndiscretion by  failing to  award him the  reductions provided\n\nunder  section 3B1.2  to  \"minor\" or  \"minimal\" participants.\n\nThe district  court was justified in  concluding that DeMarco\n\nSr. was a  major customer whose monthly  purchases of quarter\n\nkilograms of cocaine  for more  than a year  helped keep  the\n\nconspiracy in  operation.   Indeed, as the  government points\n\nout, only two  of the  defendants--Innamorati and  Grady--had\n\nmore cocaine  attributed to  them at sentencing  than DeMarco\n\nSr.   We  find no  error in  the court's  refusal to  grant a\n\ndownward adjustment.\n\n                     D.  William Letters\n\n     The  court found  that Letters  was responsible  for 510\n\ngrams of cocaine.  This  was less than a third of  the amount\n\nattributed to  Letters by the probation  officer.  Tulowiecki\n\ntestified at trial  that he delivered  quarter, half or  full\n\nounces of cocaine at least weekly and often several times per\n\nweek  to  Letters between  January  1987  and February  1988.\n\nTaking an average of one ounce or 28 grams per week over this\n\nfourteen-month period, the probation officer  determined that\n\nLetters  should be  held responsible  for approximately  1588\n\ngrams.   For reasons that are unexplained,  the court reduced\n\nthis amount to 510 grams.  The court's reduction did not have\n\na corresponding  effect on Letters'  sentence, however, since\n\n                             -85-\n\nthe Guidelines supply the  same base offense level of  26 for\n\nany quantity between 500 grams and two kilograms. \n\n     Despite Tulowiecki's testimony,  Letters points out that\n\nthe  chart prepared  from Tulowiecki's drug  ledger reflected\n\nthe sale of only 336.5  grams of cocaine to Letters.   But it\n\nwas clear  from Tulowiecki's testimony  at trial  and at  the\n\nsentencing hearing  that the chart was  incomplete; it showed\n\nonly sales over a  limited period of time and for which there\n\nwere  written records, not all sales.  The chart showed sales\n\nto  Letters only for the  period June 1987  to February 1988,\n\nwhereas Tulowiecki  testified that  deliveries  were made  to\n\nLetters starting in January 1987.  In sum, although the basis\n\nfor the court's calculation of 510 grams does not appear from\n\nthe  record, the  evidence  supported a  determination of  at\n\nleast that amount.\n\n     Letters also challenges the calculation of  his criminal\n\nhistory category.    On March  30,  1990, while  Letters  was\n\nreleased  on bail pending trial in this case, he was arrested\n\nfor possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  Letters\n\nwas convicted of that offense in April 1991 and was serving a\n\nsentence on that conviction at the time of sentencing in this\n\ncase.    This  new  conviction  increased  Letters'  criminal\n\nhistory  by three  points  pursuant to  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(a),\n\nwhich  directs the district court  to \"add 3  points for each\n\nprior  sentence of  imprisonment exceeding  one year  and one\n\n                             -86-\n\nmonth.\"    Combined with  other  pertinent  information, this\n\nincrease  gave  Letters a  total  of  seven criminal  points,\n\nplacing him in Criminal History Category IV.\n\n     Letters now  argues that  the March 1990  offense should\n\nnot have been  included in the calculation  because under the\n\nGuidelines \"prior sentences imposed  in related cases\" are to\n\nbe  treated   as  one   sentence  in  the   criminal  history\n\ncomputation. U.S.S.G.    4A1.2(a)(2).  Letters contends  that\n\nthe March  1990 offense was  \"related\" to the  conspiracy for\n\nwhich he was convicted in this case, and therefore should not\n\nhave been separately  considered in determining  his criminal\n\nhistory.   Letters, however,  did not  make this  argument at\n\nsentencing, in  response to  the calculation of  his criminal\n\nhistory  in  the Pre-sentence  report  or  at the  sentencing\n\nhearing  before  the  district   court.

Contrary\n                                \n\nto   Letters'  brief,  the   statutory  provision  permitting\n\nappellate  review   of  sentencing   errors,   18  U.S.C.    \n\n3742(e)(1),  does  not  disturb the  long-standing  rule that\n\nclaims must first be  made in the district court  to preserve\n\nthem for review.16\n\n                    \n\n     16Even  if  the  issue had  not  been  waived,  there is\nsubstantial  reason  to  believe  that  Letters'  March  1990\noffense occurred after the  end of the Innamorati conspiracy.\nThe DEA search warrants were executed in February 1988 and by\nMarch  1988  Innamorati  was   in  prison  on  a  state-court\nconviction.   \n\n                             -87-\n\n                      E.  James Litterio\n\n     Litterio  contends that there  was insufficient evidence\n\nto  support the  district  court's determination  that he  is\n\nresponsible for  1.7 kilograms of cocaine.   The 1.7 kilogram\n\nfigure is  based on Tulowiecki's testimony  that he delivered\n\nsmall amounts  of cocaine to  Litterio several  times a  week\n\nbetween  January   1987  and   February  1988  (based   on  a\n\nconservative estimate of 10 grams per week,  the total amount\n\nwas fixed at 600  grams); on evidence that Litterio  provided\n\nfour ounces (112 grams)  of cocaine to his brother  Mark that\n\nwere  then sold  to  undercover agents;  and on  Tulowiecki's\n\ntestimony  that  soon  after  the  four-ounce  deal  Litterio\n\nordered an  additional kilogram  of cocaine  from Innamorati,\n\nalthough the  deal was canceled  when it was  discovered that\n\nundercover officers might be involved. \n\n     Although  Litterio argues  that  he should  not be  held\n\nresponsible for  cocaine that he purchased  for personal use,\n\nthis confuses  the standard for criminal  liability with that\n\nfor  sentencing accountability.   Purchases  by an  addict or\n\ncasual user for personal use may not automatically make one a\n\nmember of a conspiracy to distribute.  The situation is quite\n\ndifferent where, as here, the evidence shows that there was a\n\nconspiracy and that a defendant was a member.  At that point,\n\nthat defendant's  purchases for personal use  are relevant in\n\n                             -88-\n\ndetermining  the quantity  of drugs  that the  defendant knew\n\nwere distributed by the conspiracy.\n\n                      F.  John Boisoneau\n\n     The court held Boisoneau responsible for 316.52 grams of\n\ncocaine and  sentenced him  to 33 months  imprisonment, which\n\nwas at the bottom  of the applicable range.   The calculation\n\nof 316 grams included approximately 250 grams of cocaine that\n\nBoisoneau  observed  on  one  occasion   while  visiting  the\n\nEdgewater Hills safehouse.  When Boisoneau saw this \"hunk\" of\n\ncocaine he told Innamorati to put it away because it made him\n\nnervous.  Boisoneau argues  that in light of his  reaction to\n\nthe 250 grams of cocaine it was unreasonable for the court to\n\nhold him accountable for that amount at sentencing.\n\n     The standard in  computing the quantity of  drugs is the\n\namount  of  cocaine  that  Boisoneau reasonably  should  have\n\nforeseen  to have  been embraced  by the  conspiracy  that he\n\nentered.

The  250 grams of\n                      \n\ncocaine  that Boisoneau observed in Innamorati's safehouse is\n\nreasonably  included  in  determining  the  total  amount  of\n\ncocaine  that Boisoneau  could have  foreseen, regardless  of\n\nwhether  the amount made him nervous.  If there were evidence\n\nthat Boisoneau effectively withdrew from the conspiracy after\n\nhe  saw the  \"hunk\" and  realized the  scope of  Innamorati's\n\noperation,  this would be a  different case, but  there is no\n\nevidence of any such withdrawal.\n\n                             -89-\n\n                            * * *\n\n     In  these  ten appeals,  somewhere  between  50 and  100\n\npoints were  raised by individual  defendants, although there\n\nis  some  overlap.
