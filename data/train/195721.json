Bernard  Kulingoski brought  a negligence\r                    Per Curiam\r                              \n\naction   against   Liquid   Transporters,   Inc.,   a  commercial\n\ntransporter, after sustaining injuries from falling off of one of\n\nits  \"hopper\" trailers.  He  alleges that Liquid Transporters was\n\nnegligent in failing to  provide a safe standing surface  to work\n\nfrom on  its trailers.   Liquid Transporters presented  a defense\n\nthat Kulingoski's employer, W.R.  Grace Co., who was not  a party\n\nto the action,  was responsible  for the accident,  based on  its\n\nfailure  to  require  its   employees  to  follow  proper  safety\n\nprecautions while loading the trailer.  A trial was held, and the\n\njury returned a verdict for  Liquid Transporters.  Kulingoski now\n\nappeals,  claiming that  the  district court  erred by  admitting\n\nevidence regarding Liquid Transporters' defense that W.R. Grace's\n\nomissions constituted  a superseding  cause of the  accident, and\n\nthen  instructing the jury with respect to this defense.  For the\n\nforegoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          A.  Facts\r                    A.  Facts\n\n          Liquid  Transporters  furnishes  trucks,  trailers  and\n\ntankers in order to  haul products on behalf of  manufacturers to\n\ndifferent  locations  throughout  the United  States  and Canada.\n\nLiquid Transporters had  a contract with  W.R. Grace, a  chemical\n\ncompany  located  in Nashua,  New  Hampshire,  pursuant to  which\n\nLiquid Transporters  would haul a dry,  powdered product produced\n\nby W.R. Grace to a Proctor &amp; Gamble plant in Ontario, Canada.  \n\n          W.R.  Grace's  security   procedures  required   Liquid\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nTransporters  to  use  the  following  system  to  transport  the\n\nchemical powder.   A Liquid Transporters' employee  would drive a\n\ntruck-tractor and trailer up to the gate of W.R. Grace, and leave\n\nthe trailer at the gate.  When W.R. Grace had completed producing\n\nthe chemical powder, one of its employees would take a W.R. Grace\n\ntruck-tractor,  hook  it up  to  the  empty Liquid  Transporters'\n\ntrailer, and bring the  trailer to a W.R. Grace  loading platform\n\narea.   W.R. Grace employees would  then load the trailer,  and a\n\nW.R.  Grace employee would then  deliver the trailer  back to the\n\nfront gate area.   A Liquid Transporters' driver would  then pick\n\nup the trailer and deliver it to Canada.  \n\n          Kulingoski worked  for W.R. Grace,  and was responsible\n\nfor loading the trailer  with the chemical powder.   W.R. Grace's\n\nordinary  procedure for loading this  type of trailer  was for an\n\nemployee  to stand on the loading area platform and push a button\n\nwhich  lowers a chute down into each of several portholes located\n\non  the  top of  the trailer.   The  trailer  is designed  with a\n\nwalkway along the side of the  top which is used when an employee\n\nloading the trailer needs to adjust  the chute.  On September 15,\n\n1990, the night of the  accident, due to the way the  trailer had\n\npreviously  been  loaded, Kulingoski  had  to  rake the  chemical\n\npowder  into the trailer's portholes.  While he was standing near\n\nthe  trailer's  front  edge   and  raking  the  chemical  powder,\n\nKulingoski fell off the trailer and was injured.\n\n          B.  Proceedings Below\r                    B.  Proceedings Below\n\n          Kulingoski  originally  brought  this  action   in  New\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nHampshire state court, and Liquid Transporters removed the action\n\nto  federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  During\n\nthe  course  of  the  trial,  Kulingoski  contended  that  Liquid\n\nTransporters was  negligent, based  on its  failure to provide  a\n\npierced  steel leveled surface on  the top of  the trailer, which\n\nwould prevent  skidding and reduce  the hazard of  slipping while\n\nworking on the trailer.   Liquid Transporters asserted  a defense\n\nthat  W.R. Grace's  failure to  require  its employees  to follow\n\nappropriate  safety procedures  when  loading the  trailer was  a\n\nsuperseding  cause  of  Kulingoski's  accident.   Throughout  the\n\ntrial, Kulingoski  opposed this  defense, claiming that  based on\n\nthe  facts of this case,  the defense was  not legally cognizable\n\nunder New Hampshire law.  Specifically, Kulingoski filed a motion\n\nin limine to exclude all  evidence regarding W.R. Grace's  unused\r                   \n\nsafety harness system.   Kulingoski also objected to the  court's\n\ndecision to instruct the  jury on the superseding  cause defense.\n\nThe  court denied the motion in limine and overruled Kulingoski's\r                                                \n\nobjections  to its jury instructions.  Following a two day trial,\n\nthe jury returned a verdict for Liquid Transporters.   Kulingoski\n\nnow appeals.\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\r                                    II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          A.  The Jury Instructions\r                    A.  The Jury Instructions\n\n          A party  is  entitled to  have  its legal  theories  on\n\ncontrolling  issues,  which  are supported  by  the  law  and the\n\nevidence, presented to the jury.  See Jerlyn Yacht Sales, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \n\nWayne  B. Roman  Yacht Brokerage,  950 F.2d  60, 68-69  (1st Cir.\r                                          \n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n1991).   When  reviewing the adequacy  of jury  instructions, the\n\nquestion is whether the trial judge gave adequate instructions on\n\neach element of the case to insure that the jury fully understood\n\nthe  issues, or  whether the  instructions tended  to  confuse or\n\nmislead the jury.  See  Davet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22,  26 (1st\r                                                    \n\nCir. 1992);  Shane v. Shane,  891 F.2d 976, 987  (1st Cir. 1989);\r                                     \n\nsee, e.g., Jerlyn Yacht Sales, 950 F.2d at 69.  An error  in jury\r                                       \n\ninstructions  will warrant reversal  of a judgment  only if, upon\n\nreview of  the record as a  whole, the error is  determined to be\n\nprejudicial.  Davet, 973 F.2d at 26; Transnational Corp. v. Rodio\r                                                                           \n\n&amp; Ursillo, Ltd., 920 F.2d 1066, 1070 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                         \n\n          The  court's instruction  to  the jury  on  superseding\n\ncause was  supported both  by the  law of  New Hampshire and  the\n\nfacts of the case.  \"New Hampshire law follows the principle that\n\na  defendant is relieved of  liability by a  superseding cause of\n\nthe accident  which he could  not reasonably  be found to  have a\n\nduty  to foresee.\"  Bellotte v.  Zayre Corp., 531 F.2d 1100, 1102\r                                                      \n\n(1st Cir.  1976) (citing  Morin v. Manchester  Housing Authority,\r                                                                          \n\n195 A.2d 243, 245 (N.H. 1963));  see Reid v. Spadone Machine Co.,\r                                                                          \n\n404 A.2d  1094, 1098-99 (N.H. 1979).  In the usual case, there is\n\nno  legal reason which prevents  a defendant from  arguing that a\n\nthird person's  negligence was  the sole  proximate cause of  the\n\nplaintiff's injury.  See Reid, 404 A.2d at 1099 (citing Murray v.\r                                                                        \n\nBullard Co., 265 A.2d 309, 312 (N.H. 1970)).  The availability of\r                     \n\nthe defense depends on the \"reasonable\" foreseeability of the act\n\nof the  third party.   Reid, 404  A.2d at 1099.   Absent  special\r                                     \n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncircumstances,  a defendant  is  not expected  to anticipate  the\n\nwrongful  conduct of  others.    See  Morin,  195  A.2d  at  245.\r                                                     \n\nAdditionally, where after a defendant commits a negligent  act, a\n\nduty  then devolves on another person in reference to such act or\n\ncondition,  and  this  person  fails to  perform  his  duty, such\n\nfailure  may be superseding cause  of any resulting  injury.  See\r                                                                           \n\ngenerally Restatement (Second)  of Torts    452; cf. Murray,  265\r                                                                     \n\nA.2d  at 312  (finding  that  charge  to  jury  with  respect  to\n\nemployer's failure  to properly  adjust machine as  a superseding\n\ncause  which  defendant manufacturer  could  not  have reasonably\n\nforeseen, was appropriate under New Hampshire law). \n\n          Liquid Transporters introduced  sufficient evidence  to\n\nsupport  a superseding  cause  defense.   Evidence introduced  at\n\ntrial permitted the jury to reasonably conclude that Kulingoski's\n\nemployer,  W.R. Grace, failed to  require its employees  to use a\n\nsafety harness while loading  trailers, like the one  involved in\n\nthis  accident.  A \"Health and Safety Coordinator\" at W.R. Grace,\n\nJames  Todd, testified  that there  was safety  harness equipment\n\navailable  in the loading dock  area at the  time of Kulingoski's\n\naccident,  but that W.R. Grace failed to require its employees to\n\nuse  this safety equipment.  W.R.  Grace's accident report stated\n\nthat the accident was  caused by Kulingoski's failure to  use and\n\nobserve   \"safety  appliance   or  regulation.\"     Additionally,\n\nKulingoski  himself  testified that  an improved  harness system,\n\nthat W.R. Grace introduced after his accident, made it \"safe\" for\n\nhim to work on the trailer.  \n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The  evidence also  indicated that  Liquid Transporters\n\ncould  not  have  reasonably  foreseen W.R.  Grace's  failure  to\n\nrequire its  employees to follow adequate  safety procedures when\n\nloading  trailers.   W.R. Grace  required Liquid  Transporters to\n\nleave its trailers outside of its plant,  and Liquid Transporters\n\nhad no opportunity to witness W.R. Grace employees loading Liquid\n\nTransporters' trailers. \n\n          On  appeal,  Kulingoski  makes  two  specific arguments\n\nchallenging  Liquid  Transporters'  superseding   cause  defense.\n\nFirst,  he argues  that the  lack of  an adequate  safety harness\n\nsystem  was not  a  cause of  the  incident, and  therefore  \"the\n\nharness  cannot be a superseding  intervening cause if  it is not\n\nfirst a cause.\"   Kulingoski's contention misconstrues the nature\n\nof  Liquid Transporters' defense,  as well  as the  law regarding\n\nsuperseding  cause.   First, Liquid  Transporters does  not argue\n\nthat the absence of the harness itself was a superseding cause of\n\nthe accident.   Rather, it  argues that W.R.  Grace's failure  to\n\nrequire that Kulingoski wear a safety harness was the superseding\n\ncause of  Kulingoski's accident.   Second, the  superseding cause\n\ndefense presumes that the defendant was originally negligent, but\n\nthat  some   unforeseeable  intervening  act  later  operates  to\n\nsupersede the  defendant's negligence.   This intervening  act is\n\nthen  deemed  to  be  the superceding  cause  of  the plaintiff's\n\ninjury.  See, e.g., Bellotte, 531 F.2d at 1102; Reid, 404 A.2d at\r                                                              \n\n1098-99; Morin, 195 A.2d  at 245.  See also  Restatement (Second)\r                                                     \n\nof Torts   440.\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          Kulingoski  also claims  that the  court's instructions\n\nregarding superseding cause  were confusing and the  jury did not\n\nunderstand  them.     Kulingoski  does  not   point  to  specific\n\nstatements  in  the jury  instructions  which  were erroneous  or\n\nconfusing.   Rather,  he bases  this assertion  on the  fact that\n\nbecause  the  jury  returned   a  verdict  in  favor  of   Liquid\n\nTransporters very quickly, this indicates that the jury must have\n\nbeen confused about the issue of superseding cause, and therefore\n\nthe court's instructions were erroneous.  We find this contention\n\nentirely  meritless.   We  have reviewed  the actual  instruction\n\ngiven to the jury, and believe that  it was an accurate statement\n\nof  New Hampshire  law  regarding superseding  cause.   There  is\n\nsimply  no  basis for  Kulingoski's  argument that  the  jury was\n\nconfused.1  Rather, Kulingoski's  contention appears to simply be\n\na reflection of his disbelief that the jury found against him.   \n\n          B.  The Admission of Evidence\r                    B.  The Admission of Evidence\n\n          Kulingoski   also  claims  that   the  court  erred  by\n\nadmitting  evidence regarding  the  safety harness.    Kulingoski\n\nrests  this contention on his belief that W.R. Grace's failure to\n\nprovide  a safety harness could not have been a superseding cause\n\nof the accident based on the law of New Hampshire. \n\n          The admission  and exclusion  of evidence  is primarily\n                    \r                              \n\n1   We  also  believe  that the  jury  was  perfectly capable  of\nunderstanding   that  New  Hampshire   has  a  no-fault  workers'\ncompensation  system,  and  that  because  W.R.  Grace  had  paid\nKulingoski workers'  compensation benefits, it  was not admitting\nfault which then relieved Liquid Transporters of liability.\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncommitted  to  the  discretion  of  the  trial  court,  and  this\n\ndetermination  will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse\n\nof  discretion.  Doty  v. Sewall, 908  F.2d 1053,  1058 (1st Cir.\r                                          \n\n1990).   Evidence is \"relevant\"  if it has  \"any tendency to make\n\nthe  existence  of  any  fact  that  is  of  consequence  to  the\n\ndetermination of the action  more probable or less probable  than\n\nit would be without the evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid.  401.  Relevant\n\nevidence is  admissible,  although it  \"may  be excluded  if  its\n\nprobative  value is  substantially  outweighed by  the danger  of\n\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\n\n. . . .\"  Fed. R. Evid. 403.  \n\n          As  noted   above,  Liquid  Transporters'   defense  of\n\nsuperseding  cause was  supported by  the law  of  New Hampshire.\n\nGiven   that  this   defense  was   legally   cognizable,  Liquid\n\nTransporters was  entitled to introduce evidence  which supported\n\nthis  defense.   Evidence  regarding the  availability of  safety\n\nequipment and the effectiveness  of such safety equipment, tended\n\nto show that W.R.

He alleges that Liquid Transporters was negligent in failing to provide a safe standing surface to work from on its trailers.  Liquid Transporters presented a defense that Kulingoski's employer, W.R. Grace Co., who was not a party to the action, was responsible for the accident, based on its failure to require its employees to follow proper safety precautions while loading the trailer.  A trial was held, and the jury returned a verdict for Liquid Transporters.  Kulingoski now appeals, claiming that the district court erred by admitting evidence regarding Liquid Transporters' defense that W.R. Grace's omissions constituted a superseding cause of the accident, and then instructing the jury with respect to this defense.  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liquid Transporters furnishes trucks, trailers and tankers in order to haul products on behalf of manufacturers to different locations throughout the United States and Canada.  Liquid Transporters had a contract with W.R. Grace, a chemical company located in Nashua, New Hampshire, pursuant to which Liquid Transporters would haul a dry, powdered product produced by W.R. Grace to a Proctor &amp; Gamble plant in Ontario, Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">W.R. Grace's security procedures required Liquid Transporters to use the following system to transport the chemical powder.  A Liquid Transporters' employee would drive a truck-tractor and trailer up to the gate of W.R. Grace, and leave the trailer at the gate.  When W.R. Grace had completed producing the chemical powder, one of its employees would take a W.R. Grace truck-tractor, hook it up to the empty Liquid Transporters' trailer, and bring the trailer to a W.R. Grace loading platform area.  W.R. Grace employees would then load the trailer, and a W.R. Grace employee would then deliver the trailer back to the front gate area.  A Liquid Transporters' driver would then pick up the trailer and deliver it to Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kulingoski worked for W.R. Grace, and was responsible for loading the trailer with the chemical powder.  W.R. Grace's ordinary procedure for loading this type of trailer was for an employee to stand on the loading area platform and push a button which lowers a chute down into each of several portholes located on the top of the trailer.  The trailer is designed with a walkway along the side of the top which is used when an employee loading the trailer needs to adjust the chute.  On September 15, 1990, the night of the accident, due to the way the trailer had previously been loaded, Kulingoski had to rake the chemical powder into the trailer's portholes.  While he was standing near the trailer's front edge and raking the chemical powder, Kulingoski fell off the trailer and was injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kulingoski originally brought this action in New Hampshire state court, and Liquid Transporters removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  During the course of the trial, Kulingoski contended that Liquid Transporters was negligent, based on its failure to provide a pierced steel leveled surface on the top of the trailer, which would prevent skidding and reduce the hazard of slipping while working on the trailer.  Liquid Transporters asserted a defense that W.R. Grace's failure to require its employees to follow appropriate safety procedures when loading the trailer was a superseding cause of Kulingoski's accident.  Throughout the trial, Kulingoski opposed this defense, claiming that based on the facts of this case, the defense was not legally cognizable under New Hampshire law.  Specifically, Kulingoski filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence regarding W.R. Grace's unused safety harness system.  Kulingoski also objected to the court's decision to instruct the jury on the superseding cause defense.  The court denied the motion in limine and overruled Kulingoski's objections to its jury instructions.  Following a two day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Liquid Transporters.  Kulingoski now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is entitled to have its legal theories on controlling issues, which are supported by the law and the evidence, presented to the jury.   See Jerlyn Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Wayne B. Roman Yacht Brokerage, 950 F.2d 60, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1991).  When reviewing the adequacy of jury instructions, the question is whether the trial judge gave adequate instructions on each element of the case to insure that the jury fully understood the issues, or whether the instructions tended to confuse or mislead the jury.   See Davet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992);   Shane v. Shane, 891 F.2d 976, 987 (1st Cir. 1989);  see, e.g., Jerlyn Yacht Sales, 950 F.2d at 69.  An error in jury instructions will warrant reversal of a judgment only if, upon review of the record as a whole, the error is determined to be prejudicial.   Davet, 973 F.2d at 26;   Transnational Corp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd., 920 F.2d 1066, 1070 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's instruction to the jury on superseding cause was supported both by the law of New Hampshire and the facts of the case.  \"New Hampshire law follows the principle that a defendant is relieved of liability by a superseding cause of the accident which he could not reasonably be found to have a duty to foresee.\"   Bellotte v. Zayre Corp., 531 F.2d 1100, 1102 (1st Cir. 1976) (citing  Morin v. Manchester Housing Authority, 195 A.2d 243, 245 (N.H. 1963));   see Reid v. Spadone Machine Co., 404 A.2d 1094, 1098-99 (N.H. 1979).  In the usual case, there is no legal reason which prevents a defendant from arguing that a third person's negligence was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.   See Reid, 404 A.2d at 1099 (citing  Murray v. Bullard Co., 265 A.2d 309, 312 (N.H. 1970)).  The availability of the defense depends on the \"reasonable\" foreseeability of the act of the third party.   Reid, 404 A.2d at 1099.  Absent special circumstances, a defendant is not expected to anticipate the wrongful conduct of others.   See Morin, 195 A.2d at 245.  Additionally, where after a defendant commits a negligent act, a duty then devolves on another person in reference to such act or condition, and this person fails to perform his duty, such failure may be superseding cause of any resulting injury.  See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 452;   cf.  Murray, 265 A.2d at 312 (finding that charge to jury with respect to employer's failure to properly adjust machine as a superseding cause which defendant manufacturer could not have reasonably foreseen, was appropriate under New Hampshire law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liquid Transporters introduced sufficient evidence to support a superseding cause defense.  Evidence introduced at trial permitted the jury to reasonably conclude that Kulingoski's employer, W.R. Grace, failed to require its employees to use a safety harness while loading trailers, like the one involved in this accident.  A \"Health and Safety Coordinator\" at W.R. Grace, James Todd, testified that there was safety harness equipment available in the loading dock area at the time of Kulingoski's accident, but that W.R. Grace failed to require its employees to use this safety equipment.  W.R. Grace's accident report stated that the accident was caused by Kulingoski's failure to use and observe \"safety appliance or regulation.\"  Additionally, Kulingoski himself testified that an improved harness system, that W.R. Grace introduced after his accident, made it \"safe\" for him to work on the trailer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also indicated that Liquid Transporters could not have reasonably foreseen W.R. Grace's failure to require its employees to follow adequate safety procedures when loading trailers.  W.R. Grace required Liquid Transporters to leave its trailers outside of its plant, and Liquid Transporters had no opportunity to witness W.R. Grace employees loading Liquid Transporters' trailers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Kulingoski makes two specific arguments challenging Liquid Transporters' superseding cause defense.  First, he argues that the lack of an adequate safety harness system was not a cause of the incident, and therefore \"the harness cannot be a superseding intervening cause if it is not first a cause.\"  Kulingoski's contention misconstrues the nature of Liquid Transporters' defense, as well as the law regarding superseding cause.  First, Liquid Transporters does not argue that the absence of the harness itself was a superseding cause of the accident.  Rather, it argues that W.R. Grace's failure to require that Kulingoski wear a safety harness was the superseding cause of Kulingoski's accident.  Second, the superseding cause defense presumes that the defendant was originally negligent, but that some unforeseeable intervening act later operates to supersede the defendant's negligence.  This intervening act is then deemed to be the superceding cause of the plaintiff's injury.   See, e.g., Bellotte, 531 F.2d at 1102;   Reid, 404 A.2d at 1098-99;  Morin, 195 A.2d at 245.  See also Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 440.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kulingoski also claims that the court's instructions regarding superseding cause were confusing and the jury did not understand them.  Kulingoski does not point to specific statements in the jury instructions which were erroneous or confusing.  Rather, he bases this assertion on the fact that because the jury returned a verdict in favor of Liquid Transporters very quickly, this indicates that the jury must have been confused about the issue of superseding cause, and therefore the court's instructions were erroneous.  We find this contention entirely meritless.  We have reviewed the actual instruction given to the jury, and believe that it was an accurate statement of New Hampshire law regarding superseding cause.  There is simply no basis for Kulingoski's argument that the jury was confused.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Rather, Kulingoski's contention appears to simply be a reflection of his disbelief that the jury found against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Admission of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kulingoski also claims that the court erred by admitting evidence regarding the safety harness.  Kulingoski rests this contention on his belief that W.R. Grace's failure to provide a safety harness could not have been a superseding cause of the accident based on the law of New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admission and exclusion of evidence is primarily committed to the discretion of the trial court, and this determination will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.   Doty v. Sewall, 908 F.2d 1053, 1058 (1st Cir. 1990).  Evidence is \"relevant\" if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 401.  Relevant evidence is admissible, although it \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\"  Fed.  R. Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Liquid Transporters' defense of superseding cause was supported by the law of New Hampshire.  Given that this defense was legally cognizable, Liquid Transporters was entitled to introduce evidence which supported this defense.  Evidence regarding the availability of safety equipment and the effectiveness of such safety equipment, tended to show that W.R. Grace's failure to require its employees to use such safety equipment was negligence, which therefore could have constituted a superseding cause of Kulingoski's accident.  Kulingoski has failed to point to any reasonable danger of unfair prejudice or confusion, which was produced by admitting the evidence, and which would justify excluding the evidence under Fed.  R. Evid. 403.  Moreover, we fail to see any reason for excluding the evidence.  Therefore, the court properly admitted the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We also believe that the jury was perfectly capable of understanding that New Hampshire has a no-fault workers' compensation system, and that because W.R. Grace had paid Kulingoski workers' compensation benefits, it was not admitting fault which then relieved Liquid Transporters of liability</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The availability of the defense depends on the \"reasonable\" foreseeability of the act of the third party.   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Reid,</span> <span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1099</span></span>.  Absent special circumstances, a defendant is not expected to anticipate the wrongful conduct of others.   See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morin,</span> <span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">245</span></span>.  Additionally, where after a defendant commits a negligent act, a duty then devolves on another person in reference to such act or condition, and this person fails to perform his duty, such failure may be superseding cause of any resulting injury.  See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 452;   cf.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Murray,</span> <span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">312</span> </span>(finding that charge to jury with respect to employer's failure to properly adjust machine as a superseding cause which defendant manufacturer could not have reasonably foreseen, was appropriate under New Hampshire law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liquid Transporters introduced sufficient evidence to support a superseding cause defense.  Evidence introduced at trial permitted the jury to reasonably conclude that Kulingoski's employer, W.R. Grace, failed to require its employees to use a safety harness while loading trailers, like the one involved in this accident.  A \"Health and Safety Coordinator\" at W.R. Grace, James Todd, testified that there was safety harness equipment available in the loading dock area at the time of Kulingoski's accident, but that W.R. Grace failed to require its employees to use this safety equipment.  W.R. Grace's accident report stated that the accident was caused by Kulingoski's failure to use and observe \"safety appliance or regulation.\"  Additionally, Kulingoski himself testified that an improved harness system, that W.R. Grace introduced after his accident, made it \"safe\" for him to work on the trailer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also indicated that Liquid Transporters could not have reasonably foreseen W.R. Grace's failure to require its employees to follow adequate safety procedures when loading trailers.  W.R. Grace required Liquid Transporters to leave its trailers outside of its plant, and Liquid Transporters had no opportunity to witness W.R. Grace employees loading Liquid Transporters' trailers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Kulingoski makes two specific arguments challenging Liquid Transporters' superseding cause defense.  First, he argues that the lack of an adequate safety harness system was not a cause of the incident, and therefore \"the harness cannot be a superseding intervening cause if it is not first a cause.\"  Kulingoski's contention misconstrues the nature of Liquid Transporters' defense, as well as the law regarding superseding cause.  First, Liquid Transporters does not argue that the absence of the harness itself was a superseding cause of the accident.  Rather, it argues that W.R. Grace's failure to require that Kulingoski wear a safety harness was the superseding cause of Kulingoski's accident.  Second, the superseding cause defense presumes that the defendant was originally negligent, but that some unforeseeable intervening act later operates to supersede the defendant's negligence.  This intervening act is then deemed to be the superceding cause of the plaintiff's injury.   See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"333976\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bellotte,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/333976/james-harold-bellotte-by-his-father-and-next-friend-james-g-bellotte/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span>;   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Reid,</span> <span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1098-99</span></span>;  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morin,</span> <span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">245</span></span>.  See also Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 440.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kulingoski also claims that the court's instructions regarding superseding cause were confusing and the jury did not understand them.  Kulingoski does not point to specific statements in the jury instructions which were erroneous or confusing.  Rather, he bases this assertion on the fact that because the jury returned a verdict in favor of Liquid Transporters very quickly, this indicates that the jury must have been confused about the issue of superseding cause, and therefore the court's instructions were erroneous.  We find this contention entirely meritless.  We have reviewed the actual instruction given to the jury, and believe that it was an accurate statement of New Hampshire law regarding superseding cause.  There is simply no basis for Kulingoski's argument that the jury was confused.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Rather, Kulingoski's contention appears to simply be a reflection of his disbelief that the jury found against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Admission of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kulingoski also claims that the court erred by admitting evidence regarding the safety harness.  Kulingoski rests this contention on his belief that W.R. Grace's failure to provide a safety harness could not have been a superseding cause of the accident based on the law of New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admission and exclusion of evidence is primarily committed to the discretion of the trial court, and this determination will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.   Doty v. Sewall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545153\"><a href=\"/opinion/545153/arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall-arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span>, 1058 (1st Cir. 1990).  Evidence is \"relevant\" if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 401.  Relevant evidence is admissible, although it \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\"  Fed.  R. Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Liquid Transporters' defense of superseding cause was supported by the law of New Hampshire.  Given that this defense was legally cognizable, Liquid Transporters was entitled to introduce evidence which supported this defense.  Evidence regarding the availability of safety equipment and the effectiveness of such safety equipment, tended to show that W.R. Grace's failure to require its employees to use such safety equipment was negligence, which therefore could have constituted a superseding cause of Kulingoski's accident.  Kulingoski has failed to point to any reasonable danger of unfair prejudice or confusion, which was produced by admitting the evidence, and which would justify excluding the evidence under Fed.  R. Evid. 403.  Moreover, we fail to see any reason for excluding the evidence.  Therefore, the court properly admitted the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We also believe that the jury was perfectly capable of understanding that New Hampshire has a no-fault workers' compensation system, and that because W.R. Grace had paid Kulingoski workers' compensation benefits, it was not admitting fault which then relieved Liquid Transporters of liability</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
