In response,  Paleo\n\nchallenged  the  constitutionality  of  his   prior  state  court\n\nconvictions that  formed the basis of  the government's requested\n\nsentence  under the  ACCA.   In support  of his  challenge, Paleo\n\nsubmitted an affidavit sworn  to by himself, stating that  he had\n\nbeen denied counsel  during critical  stages of two  of his  four\n\nprior  convictions.    The  affidavit was  supported  by  several\n\ndeficiencies in the state records.\n\n          The  district  court allowed  the challenge,  and found\n\nthat  Paleo had  been denied  counsel at  two  of his  four prior\n\nconvictions.     Accordingly,  the  district   court  denied  the\n\ngovernment's request  for  the  imposition  of  the  fifteen-year\n\nsentence under the  ACCA, and  instead imposed a  sentence of  21\n\nmonths' incarceration  and two  years of supervised  release, the\n\nmaximum sentence  allowed under  the Sentencing Guidelines.   The\n\ngovernment now appeals, claiming 1) that the district court erred\n\nas a  matter  of law  in  ruling with  respect to  Paleo's  prior\n\nconvictions,  and 2) that  the district court's  findings of fact\n\nregarding Paleo's denial of his right of counsel during his prior\r\r\n\nconvictions were clearly erroneous. \n\n          Having carefully reviewed the district court's opinion,\n\nand finding no abuse of discretion or clear  error, we reject the\n\ngovernment's arguments, and affirm.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \n\n                               -3-\r\r\n",
