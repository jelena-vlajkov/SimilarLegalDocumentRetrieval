David Mazzone, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                    \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                     Breyer, Chief Judge,\n                                        \n             Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n                                                \n\n                                        \n\n   Annemarie Hassett on brief for appellant.\n                    \n   A. John  Pappalardo, United States Attorney,  and Stephen A.\n                                                               \nHigginson, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n       \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.    Appellant Anthony  DiPrizio  appeals  his\n               \n\nsentence of 24 months imprisonment  for credit card fraud and\n\naiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C.     1029(a)(2)\n\n&amp; 2.  We vacate the sentence of the district court and remand\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n     On October 27, 1992, DiPrizio pled guilty, pursuant to a\n\nplea agreement, to one count of a three count indictment.  He\n\nwas sentenced on January 25,  1993.  At that time, the  court\n\ndetermined that the appropriate  offense level was 10.    The\n\ncourt also found that  appellant's criminal history score was\n\n13 and that  he thus had a criminal history  category of VI. \n\nThe  court sentenced  DiPrizio at  the low  end of  the 24-30\n\nmonth sentencing  range.   Appellant contends that  the court\n\nerred in  its determination of the  criminal history category\n\nbecause (1) it relied on a  conviction too old to be  counted\n\nin the criminal history score and (2)  it improperly included\n\nan   enhancement,  pursuant   to   U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(d),   for\n\nappellant's  having committed  the instant  offense  while \"a\n\nviolation  warrant from  a  prior  sentence is  outstanding.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.      4A1.1,  comment.   (n.4)  (Nov.  1992).     The\n\ngovernment,  noting  that  the  government,  the  Presentence\n\nReport,  and   the   court,  had   inadvertently   overlooked\n\nappellant's  argument made  in  the district  court, concedes\n\n                             -2-\n\nthat appellant is  correct in his  first contention and  that\n\nthe appropriate criminal history category is V.\n\n     In 1977  DiPrizio received a suspended  sentence and two\n\nyears  probation for controlled substances offenses.  Section\n\n4A1.1(c) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines instructs\n\nthat,  where no  sentence  of imprisonment  was imposed,  the\n\ncourt is to  add one point to the  criminal history score for\n\neach  prior sentence up  to a total  of four points.   In the\n\ninstant  case,  the  court  added  one  point  to  DiPrizio's\n\ncriminal history  score for this conviction.   The commentary\n\nclearly   states,  however,  that,  under     4A1.1(c),  \"[a]\n\nsentence imposed more than ten years prior to the defendant's\n\ncommencement  of   the  instant  offense  is   not  counted.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.  4A1.1,  comment. (n.3).  Since  the instant offense\n\ncommenced  on August 22, 1991, more than ten years had passed\n\nsince the 1977 sentence was imposed.  It thus should not have\n\nbeen counted in determining DiPrizio's criminal history.\n\n     We  do  not  reach  appellant's contention  that  he  is\n\nentitled  to  a further  reduction  in  his criminal  history\n\nscore.   Such  a  reduction  would  have  no  effect  on  his\n\nsentencing  range.   Given  the one  point  reduction in  his\n\ncriminal  history score due to the error in counting the 1977\n\nconviction, appellant's criminal history score is  twelve and\n\nhis  criminal history category is V.  Even if the enhancement\n\npursuant  to   4A1.1(d) were  incorrect,  appellant would  be\n\n                             -3-\n\nentitled  only  to  a one  point  reduction  in his  criminal\n\nhistory score  and thus  his criminal history  category would\n\nstill be V.1\n\n     Appellant's sentence is vacated and the case is remanded\n                                                             \n\nfor resentencing.\n\n                    \n\n1.    Appellant's  criminal history  score was  increased two\npoints pursuant to  4A1.1(d).   However, appellant  concedes,\nthat if the enhancement  were found improper, the  net effect\nwould only be a one point reduction in criminal history score\nsince the deduction of  these two points would require  a one\npoint increase under  4A1.1(e). \n\n                             -4-\n",
