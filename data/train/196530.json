(SJU), a Rhode Island accounting firm with whom\r\n\nhe was  employed as  a certified public  accountant; Sparrow,\r\n\nJohnson &amp;  Ursillo, Inc. Profit  Sharing Plan and  Trust (SJU\r\n\nPlan,  or Plan), and Steven J.  Ursillo (Ursillo), an officer\r\n\nand stockholder of  SJU and  a \"named Trustee\"  of SJU  Plan.\r\n\nCottrill  sought,  inter  alia,1  pursuant  to  the  Employee\r                                          \r\n\nRetirement Income  Security Act,  29 U.S.C.    1001  et seq.,\r                                                                       \r\n\n(ERISA), to vacate revocation  by the Plan of  his beneficial\r\n\ninterest  of $18,775.52.  Ursillo, in his capacity as trustee\r\n\nof  the  SJU  Plan, counterclaimed,  alleging  that Cottrill,\r\n\nacting  in  a  fiduciary relationship,  was  responsible  for\r\n\nlosing an investment  of $130,000 of Plan's  assets, and thus\r\n\nowed it full recompense.\r\n\n          A magistrate  judge,  in a  detailed  opinion,  had\r\n\nrecommended ruling in Cottrill's favor on motions for summary\r\n\njudgment, but  the district  court, after conducting  a bench\r\n\ntrial,  held that Cottrill was a fiduciary of the Plan within\r\n\nthe meaning of ERISA,  29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A), and therefore\r\n\nwas  responsible  to Plan  for the  loss.   It  dismissed the\r\n\ncounterclaim, however,  for failure  to prove damages.   Both\r\n\nsides  appeal.  We reverse  and remand for  entry of judgment\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Two  further counts  have been  dropped,  as a  result of\r\nwhich SJU is no longer a party.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nfor Cottrill on his complaint, and  affirm, on other grounds,\r\n\ndismissal of the Plan's counterclaim.\r\n\n          In  December of  1988, $130,000  of the  SJU Plan's\r\n\nassets were  invested, through  a partnership known  as North\r\n\nMain Street Associates One, in  which Cottrill was a partner,\r\n\nin  a  group  of  second  mortgages  held  by First  Security\r\n\nMortgage  Company.     Cottrill   effected  the   SJU  Plan's\r\n\ninvestment, as authorized by Ursillo, a named  trustee of the\r\n\nPlan.   Unhappily  Cottrill obtained  no promissory  note or,\r\n\nseemingly, any other documentation  of the investment.  First\r\n\nSecurity  paid interest  to North  Main for  a while,  but by\r\n\nDecember of 1990, the assets had apparently disappeared.2\r\n\n          Because  both the  claim and  counterclaim turn  on\r\n\nwhether Cottrill was a fiduciary with respect to the $130,000\r\n\ninvestment  at issue, we focus solely on the grounds given to\r\n\nsupport  the  court's  conclusion.    The  court  found  that\r\n\nCottrill was a fiduciary because he exercised \"both effective\r\n\nand  actual authority  and  control over  the management  and\r\n\ndisposition of  the $130,000,\"  which brought him  within the\r\n\ndefinition of a  fiduciary under ERISA as one  who \"exercises\r\n\nany authority or control respecting management or disposition\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Perhaps  the mortgages  simply  became  worthless --  the\r\nrecord is  silent.  In  any event, the  court found that  the\r\ninvestment was lost.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof  [a plan's]  assets.\"   29 U.S.C.    1002(21)(A)(i).3   It\r\n\nbased  this conclusion  on a  number of  subsidiary findings,\r\n\nincluding  that Cottrill  was  a \"principal\"  of  SJU, and  a\r\n\nparticipant  in  the SJU  profit-sharing  Plan;  that he  had\r\n\nrecommended  the  investment  to  Ursillo,   specifically  by\r\n\nreporting  that he  had  looked into  it  and the  investment\r\n\nlooked good; that he  had assumed responsibility for managing\r\n\nthe  investment and  obtaining documentation,  disbursing the\r\n\n$130,000   to  the  mortgagee   and  collecting   the  income\r\n\ngenerated; that he was  a partner in North Main,  the vehicle\r\n\nfor  making the investment, and listed himself on its account\r\n\nrecord as the partner in charge of the investment.\r\n\n          None  of these subsidiary findings, however, singly\r\n\nor  collectively, amount  to \"authority  or control  over the\r                                                                     \r\n\nmanagement  or disposition\" of the funds in question.  On the\r\n\ncontrary, this was twice contradicted by Ursillo himself, who\r\n\nstated that he, as a Plan trustee, authorized the investment.\r\n\n          The  court's reference to Cottrill as a \"principal\"\r\n\nof  SJU overlooks  the  undisputed testimony  that this  was,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.        The statue reads, in relevant part:\r\n\n          [A] person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to\r\n          the  extent  (i)  he  exercises  any  discretionary\r\n          authority   or  discretionary   control  respecting\r\n          management of  such plan or exercises any authority\r\n          or  control respecting management or disposition of\r\n          its assets . . . .\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A).\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nliterally,  a  \"letterhead\" title  for  client  purposes, but\r\n\nquite  aside from that, SJU  itself did not  manage the Plan.\r\n\nAs a  \"participant\" in the Plan  Cottrill had no powers.   It\r\n\ndid not  amount to  \"authority  over the  management\" of  the\r\n\nassets for Cottrill, with no power to invest, to recommend an\r\n\ninvestment to Ursillo as sound; nor were powers  conferred on\r\n\nhim  as a gratuitous advisor4  by the trustee's accepting his\r\n\nopinion.   Schloegel v.  Boswell, 994  F.2d 266,  271-72 (5th\r                                            \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 114 S.Ct. 440, 126 L.Ed.2d\r                               \r\n\n374 (1993)  (\"[m]ere influence over  the trustee's investment\r\n\ndecisions . . .  is not effective control over  plan assets,\"\r\n\nwhere  ultimate  decision-making  authority rests  elsewhere)\r\n\n(citing cases).   The court  made no finding,  nor could  the\r\n\nrecord  support  one,  that  authority or  control  was  ever\r\n\ndelegated or \"relinquished\" to Cottrill in authorizing him to\r\n\nexecute  the management and  disposition decision of Ursillo.\r\n\nSee id. at 271-72.\r                   \r\n\n          The   court's  finding  that  North  Main  was  the\r\n\n\"vehicle\" for the investment  was exactly correct, but  it is\r\n\nthe  driver, not  the vehicle,  that chooses  the route.   In\r\n\ncollecting and disbursing money due, Cottrill (by North Main)\r\n\nwas simply  a conduit, performing a  ministerial act directed\r\n\nby Ursillo.  Under ERISA, \"the existence of discretion [is] a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  No claim has been  made, nor is there any  evidence, that\r\nCottrill  was at  any time  a specially  paid advisor  to the\r\nPlan.  Compare 29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A)(ii). \r                          \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nsine qua non of  fiduciary duty.\"  Pohl v.  National Benefits\r                                                                         \r\n\nConsultants, Inc., 956  F.2d 126, 129 (7th Cir.  1992) (where\r                             \r\n\nplan  administrator function  was  clerical, mechanical,  and\r\n\nministerial,   it   was  not   discretionary).     Cottrill's\r\n\nmechanical duty  to  acquire \"documentation\"  evidencing  the\r\n\nmortgage assignments and  securing the authorized transaction\r\n\nbetween First Security and the Plan entailed no discretionary\r\n\ninvolvement in management of the assets.\r\n\n          So  much for  management.   We turn to  the further\r\n\nlanguage  of  subsection  (i),  concerning  exercise  of \"any\r\n\nauthority or  control  respecting .  .  . disposition  of  [a\r\n\nplan's] assets.\"  29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A)(i).  True, Cottrill\r\n\nexercised physical control when  he forwarded the $130,000 to\r\n\nFirst  Security.   Did this  constitute \"disposition\"  of the\r\n\nassets?  The  meaning of disposition  is to be judged  by its\r\n\ncompanion words.   Again,  these indicate that  the fiduciary\r\n\nexercise authority or control, i.e., discretion and judgment,\r\n\nover the disposition, not simply perform a transfer specified\r\n\nby the trustee --  a purely administrative act.   See Sommers\r                                                                         \r\n\nDrug  Stores v.  Corrigan Enterprises,  Inc., 793  F.2d 1456,\r                                                        \r\n\n1460  (5th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1034, and cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,  479  U.S. 1089  (1987)  (defendants  could be  found\r                  \r\n\nfiduciaries with  respect to  sale of  trust's stock  only if\r                                                                      \r\n\nthey controlled trustees' decision  to sell; such control not\r\n\ninferable from defendants' power to appoint trustees).\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n          In sum, there was no possible basis for the court's\r\n\nconclusion that Cottrill  was a fiduciary.  Absent  any other\r\n\nbasis for assigning him personal  liability for the loss, his\r\n\nfunds in the Plan should not have been offset against it.  We\r\n\nconclude  there was  no  issue as  to  any material  fact  to\r\n\npreclude  judgment in  favor  of Cottrill.    We reverse  and\r\n\nremand for entry of judgment in his favor on the complaint.\r\n\n          A word about the counterclaim.  The court found for\r\n\nCottrill on the ground that, given his $18,775.52 interest in\r\n\nthe Plan was  offset against  the loss, and  the balance  had\r\n\nbeen satisfied by Ursillo,  there had been no showing  of any\r\n\ndamages suffered by the Plan.   More to the point, in view of\r\n\nwhat  we have already held, there was no valid demand against\r\n\nCottrill in the first place.   On this latter basis we affirm\r\n\nthe judgment dismissing the counterclaim.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n",

(SJU), a Rhode Island accounting firm with whom\r\n\nhe was  employed as  a certified public  accountant; Sparrow,\r\n\nJohnson &amp;  Ursillo, Inc. Profit  Sharing Plan and  Trust (SJU\r\n\nPlan,  or Plan), and Steven J.  Ursillo (Ursillo), an officer\r\n\nand stockholder of  SJU and  a \"named Trustee\"  of SJU  Plan.\r\n\nCottrill  sought,  inter  alia,1  pursuant  to  the  Employee\r                                          \r\n\nRetirement Income  Security Act,  29 U.S.C.    1001  et seq.,\r                                                                       \r\n\n(ERISA), to vacate revocation  by the Plan of  his beneficial\r\n\ninterest  of $18,775.52.  Ursillo, in his capacity as trustee\r\n\nof  the  SJU  Plan, counterclaimed,  alleging  that Cottrill,\r\n\nacting  in  a  fiduciary relationship,  was  responsible  for\r\n\nlosing an investment  of $130,000 of Plan's  assets, and thus\r\n\nowed it full recompense.\r\n\n          A magistrate  judge,  in a  detailed  opinion,  had\r\n\nrecommended ruling in Cottrill's favor on motions for summary\r\n\njudgment, but  the district  court, after conducting  a bench\r\n\ntrial,  held that Cottrill was a fiduciary of the Plan within\r\n\nthe meaning of ERISA,  29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A), and therefore\r\n\nwas  responsible  to Plan  for the  loss.   It  dismissed the\r\n\ncounterclaim, however,  for failure  to prove damages.   Both\r\n\nsides  appeal.  We reverse  and remand for  entry of judgment\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Two  further counts  have been  dropped,  as a  result of\r\nwhich SJU is no longer a party.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nfor Cottrill on his complaint, and  affirm, on other grounds,\r\n\ndismissal of the Plan's counterclaim.\r\n\n          In  December of  1988, $130,000  of the  SJU Plan's\r\n\nassets were  invested, through  a partnership known  as North\r\n\nMain Street Associates One, in  which Cottrill was a partner,\r\n\nin  a  group  of  second  mortgages  held  by First  Security\r\n\nMortgage  Company.     Cottrill   effected  the   SJU  Plan's\r\n\ninvestment, as authorized by Ursillo, a named  trustee of the\r\n\nPlan.   Unhappily  Cottrill obtained  no promissory  note or,\r\n\nseemingly, any other documentation  of the investment.  First\r\n\nSecurity  paid interest  to North  Main for  a while,  but by\r\n\nDecember of 1990, the assets had apparently disappeared.2\r\n\n          Because  both the  claim and  counterclaim turn  on\r\n\nwhether Cottrill was a fiduciary with respect to the $130,000\r\n\ninvestment  at issue, we focus solely on the grounds given to\r\n\nsupport  the  court's  conclusion.    The  court  found  that\r\n\nCottrill was a fiduciary because he exercised \"both effective\r\n\nand  actual authority  and  control over  the management  and\r\n\ndisposition of  the $130,000,\"  which brought him  within the\r\n\ndefinition of a  fiduciary under ERISA as one  who \"exercises\r\n\nany authority or control respecting management or disposition\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Perhaps  the mortgages  simply  became  worthless --  the\r\nrecord is  silent.  In  any event, the  court found that  the\r\ninvestment was lost.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof  [a plan's]  assets.\"   29 U.S.C.    1002(21)(A)(i).3   It\r\n\nbased  this conclusion  on a  number of  subsidiary findings,\r\n\nincluding  that Cottrill  was  a \"principal\"  of  SJU, and  a\r\n\nparticipant  in  the SJU  profit-sharing  Plan;  that he  had\r\n\nrecommended  the  investment  to  Ursillo,   specifically  by\r\n\nreporting  that he  had  looked into  it  and the  investment\r\n\nlooked good; that he  had assumed responsibility for managing\r\n\nthe  investment and  obtaining documentation,  disbursing the\r\n\n$130,000   to  the  mortgagee   and  collecting   the  income\r\n\ngenerated; that he was  a partner in North Main,  the vehicle\r\n\nfor  making the investment, and listed himself on its account\r\n\nrecord as the partner in charge of the investment.\r\n\n          None  of these subsidiary findings, however, singly\r\n\nor  collectively, amount  to \"authority  or control  over the\r                                                                     \r\n\nmanagement  or disposition\" of the funds in question.  On the\r\n\ncontrary, this was twice contradicted by Ursillo himself, who\r\n\nstated that he, as a Plan trustee, authorized the investment.\r\n\n          The  court's reference to Cottrill as a \"principal\"\r\n\nof  SJU overlooks  the  undisputed testimony  that this  was,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.        The statue reads, in relevant part:\r\n\n          [A] person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to\r\n          the  extent  (i)  he  exercises  any  discretionary\r\n          authority   or  discretionary   control  respecting\r\n          management of  such plan or exercises any authority\r\n          or  control respecting management or disposition of\r\n          its assets . . . .\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A).\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nliterally,  a  \"letterhead\" title  for  client  purposes, but\r\n\nquite  aside from that, SJU  itself did not  manage the Plan.\r\n\nAs a  \"participant\" in the Plan  Cottrill had no powers.   It\r\n\ndid not  amount to  \"authority  over the  management\" of  the\r\n\nassets for Cottrill, with no power to invest, to recommend an\r\n\ninvestment to Ursillo as sound; nor were powers  conferred on\r\n\nhim  as a gratuitous advisor4  by the trustee's accepting his\r\n\nopinion.

The court  made no finding,  nor could  the\r\n\nrecord  support  one,  that  authority or  control  was  ever\r\n\ndelegated or \"relinquished\" to Cottrill in authorizing him to\r\n\nexecute  the management and  disposition decision of Ursillo.\r\n\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 271-72.\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">                   \r\n\n          The   court's  finding  that  North  Main  was  the\r\n\n\"vehicle\" for the investment  was exactly correct, but  it is\r\n\nthe  driver, not  the vehicle,  that chooses  the route.   In\r\n\ncollecting and disbursing money due, Cottrill (by North Main)\r\n\nwas simply  a conduit, performing a  ministerial act directed\r\n\nby Ursillo.  Under ERISA, \"the existence of discretion [is] a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  No claim has been  made, nor is there any  evidence, that\r\nCottrill  was at  any time  a specially  paid advisor  to the\r\nPlan.

Cottrill's\r\n\nmechanical duty  to  acquire \"documentation\"  evidencing  the\r\n\nmortgage assignments and  securing the authorized transaction\r\n\nbetween First Security and the Plan entailed no discretionary\r\n\ninvolvement in management of the assets.\r\n\n          So  much for  management.   We turn to  the further\r\n\nlanguage  of  subsection  (i),  concerning  exercise  of \"any\r\n\nauthority or  control  respecting .  .  . disposition  of  [a\r\n\nplan's] assets.\"  29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A)(i).  True, Cottrill\r\n\nexercised physical control when  he forwarded the $130,000 to\r\n\nFirst  Security.   Did this  constitute \"disposition\"  of the\r\n\nassets?  The  meaning of disposition  is to be judged  by its\r\n\ncompanion words.   Again,  these indicate that  the fiduciary\r\n\nexercise authority or control, i.e., discretion and judgment,\r\n\nover the disposition, not simply perform a transfer specified\r\n\nby the trustee --  a purely administrative act.

Absent  any other\r\n\nbasis for assigning him personal  liability for the loss, his\r\n\nfunds in the Plan should not have been offset against it.  We\r\n\nconclude  there was  no  issue as  to  any material  fact  to\r\n\npreclude  judgment in  favor  of Cottrill.    We reverse  and\r\n\nremand for entry of judgment in his favor on the complaint.\r\n\n          A word about the counterclaim.  The court found for\r\n\nCottrill on the ground that, given his $18,775.52 interest in\r\n\nthe Plan was  offset against  the loss, and  the balance  had\r\n\nbeen satisfied by Ursillo,  there had been no showing  of any\r\n\ndamages suffered by the Plan.   More to the point, in view of\r\n\nwhat  we have already held, there was no valid demand against\r\n\nCottrill in the first place.   On this latter basis we affirm\r\n\nthe judgment dismissing the counterclaim.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n</pre>",
