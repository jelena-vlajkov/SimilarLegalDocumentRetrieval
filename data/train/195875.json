Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                      \n                Cyr and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r                                                         \n\n                                         \n\nNydia Maria Diaz-Buxo on brief for appellants.\r                                 \nManuel A. Segarra-Vazquez on brief for appellees.\r                                     \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.  Defendants-appellees move for summary\r                                 \n\naffirmance of the district court's dismissal of this suit for\n\nlack of  subject matter jurisdiction.   The complaint alleges\n\nthat jurisdiction  exists under 28 U.S.C.    1331, because it\n\n\"arises under\" federal law.  The sole claim pleaded, however,\n\nis a cause of action in tort for legal malpractice.  \n\n          It   appears   that  defendants   once   served  as\n\nplaintiffs'  counsel  in  an  unsuccessful  adversary  action\n\ninitiated by  plaintiffs as chapter 13  debtors.  Plaintiffs'\n\nappeal from  the bankruptcy court judgment  was dismissed for\n\nfailure  to  timely  perfect  the  appeal.    Allegations  of\n\nattorney  misfeasance  made  at  that  time  to  explain  the\n\nappellate processing  delay, were referred to  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt for investigation.  In  this separate lawsuit, begun in\n\nthe  district  court  some  months   later,  plaintiffs  seek\n\n$600,000 in damages  allegedly sustained as  a result of  the\n\nmalpractice.     The   district  court   granted  defendants'\n\nunopposed  motion to  dismiss  because the  tort of  attorney\n\nmalpractice  is  a  state-created   claim  and  there  is  no\n\ndiversity of citizenship between the parties. \n\n          Without explaining their  lack of opposition below,\n\nplaintiffs here insist  that their  complaint \"arises  under\"\n\nfederal law because the legal  malpractice is alleged to have\n\noccurred in the context of a federal proceeding  and included\n\na disregard of a federally-created procedural rule. \r\r\n\n          There is  no general  federal common law  of torts,\n\nhowever.   See  O'Melveny &amp; Myers  v. FDIC, 114  S. Ct. 2048,\r                                                      \n\n2052 (1994); Erie R.R.  v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64,  78 (1938).\r                                               \n\nIn the absence of a specific statute creating a federal cause\n\nof  action,  the  traditional   right  to  relief  for  legal\n\nmalpractice is rooted in  state law.  See O'Melveny  &amp; Myers,\r                                                                        \n\n114 S. Ct. at 2055.   While federal courts  have the inherent\n\npower to  regulate the conduct of  attorneys appearing before\n\nthem, plaintiffs' assumption that violation of a federal rule\n\nor  ethical norm  automatically  creates a  federal cause  of\n\naction for damages is inconsistent with the provisions of the\n\nRules Enabling Act.   See 28 U.S.C.   2075  (bankruptcy rules\r                                     \n\nshall  not  \"abridge,  modify   or  enlarge  any  substantive\n\nright\").  This is not an extraordinary case in which reliance\n\non  state tort  law as the  rule of  decision might  create a\n\nconflict with  a substantial  federal policy.
