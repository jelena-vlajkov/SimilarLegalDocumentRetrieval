This is an  appeal from the  district\r                                \r\n\ncourt's  grant  of  summary  judgment in  favor  of  appellee\r\n\nFranklin Pierce  Law Center.   The district  court determined\r\n\nthat   appellant   Nancy    Murphy's   claim   of    handicap\r\n\ndiscrimination in  violation of    504 of  the Rehabilitation\r\n\nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C.   794, failed as a matter of law.\r\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\r                                                  \r\n\n          Murphy  suffers from diplopia,  a genetic condition\r\n\nin which weakness  in the  muscles of the  eye causes  double\r\n\nvision and problems with focusing on printed matter.  She has\r\n\nhad  two  surgeries   (one  necessitated  by   an  automobile\r\n\naccident) for this  ailment.  Murphy manages  the diplopia by\r\n\nlimiting  the amount of time spent reading and by engaging in\r\n\nmuscular  exercises prescribed  by  Dr.  John Sebestyen,  her\r\n\ntreating physician.  Nonetheless,  when Murphy applied to the\r\n\nLaw Center in 1987, she was reading without impairment.\r\n\n          Murphy  began  experiencing  academic  difficulties\r\n\nalmost as soon as she entered the Law Center.  At  the end of\r\n\nher  first year,  her G.P.A.  was 1.88  -- below  the minimum\r\n\nG.P.A. of  2.0  set by  the Law  Center.   Thus, Murphy  came\r\n\nwithin the  jurisdiction of  the Academic  Standing Committee\r\n\n(\"ASC\").     At   this  time,   Murphy  indicated   that  her\r\n\ndifficulties were due  to a thyroid condition  and poor test-\r\n\ntaking skills; she  did not  mention the diplopia.   For  her\r\r\n\nsecond  year, the ASC required Murphy to maintain a G.P.A. of\r\n\n2.0 and not to receive a grade below a C-.\r\n\n          Although Murphy  met these requirements  during the\r\n\nfall semester, she again came before the ASC as the result of\r\n\nreceiving  a  D  in  Evidence  during  the  spring  semester.\r\n\nCombined with D+ grades in two first-year courses, Murphy now\r\n\nhad more than nine credits below a C-.  This was in violation\r\n\nof  the Law  Center's general  academic regulations.   Murphy\r\n\nsubmitted an  analysis of her  situation in which  she cited,\r\n\nfor the first time, the diplopia as one of the  causes of her\r\n\nacademic problems.\r\n\n          Specifically,  Murphy  stated  that   the  diplopia\r\n\nproduced double-vision, eyestrain, pain  and headaches -- all\r\n\nof which interfered  with reading efficiency.   On the advice\r\n\nof  Dr. Sebestyen, Murphy did  not read in  the morning until\r\n\nshe had been awake for three hours, did not read or study for\r\n\nmore  than  three hours  at a  time, and  slept when  she had\r\n\ntrouble focusing.   In this letter, Murphy requested that she\r\n\nbe allowed to take  tests at three-day intervals so  that her\r\n\neyestrain  would be  reduced.   At a  meeting later  in June,\r\n\nMurphy  further  asked the  ASC to  permit  her to  take oral\r\n\nexaminations.\r\n\n          Murphy also submitted to the  ASC a letter from Dr.\r\n\nSebestyen, dated August 11, 1989.   Based on a July  12 exam,\r\n\nDr.  Sebestyen concluded  that Murphy's convergence  was poor\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nand that her eye muscles were weak.  He  recommended that she\r\n\nbreak up her reading and studying into \"well-defined segments\r\n\nof time such as  two hours at a  time, or three hours at  the\r\n\nmost.\"\r\n\n          As for  the fifth semester, the  ASC allowed Murphy\r\n\nto take only  nine credits --  the usual  minimum at the  Law\r\n\nCenter  is twelve.  The terms of Murphy's probation were that\r\n\nshe obtain  a 2.3 G.P.A., have  no grades under a  C- and not\r\n\nhave more than one course with a C- grade.  Again, Murphy did\r\n\nnot  appeal  these  terms.   At  the  end  of this  semester,\r\n\nhowever,  Murphy's G.P.A. was 1.89; she had failed one course\r\n\nand had received a D in another.\r\n\n          Murphy was dismissed from  the Law Center by letter\r\n\ndated  February 12, 1990.   The ASC stated  that its decision\r\n\nwas based on  (1) Murphy's failure  to meet the terms  of her\r\n\nprobation,   and  (2)  her   entire  academic   record  which\r\n\ndemonstrated that she lacked the ability to  complete the Law\r\n\nCenter's degree  program.  Murphy  then pursued an  appeal of\r\n\nthe  decision of the ASC.   The faculty  upheld the dismissal\r\n\nessentially finding that although  the ASC had made mistakes,\r\n\nthey  did not  affect  the question  of  Murphy's ability  to\r\n\nsatisfy the academic requirements of the JD program.   Murphy\r\n\nthen filed this action in the federal district court.\r\n\n          In granting  the motion for  summary judgment,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  concluded that  Murphy had not  presented any\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nevidence contradicting the Law Center's position that she was\r\n\ndismissed because she lacked the analytic skills necessary to\r\n\nsucceed in law  school.  Thus, the  district court concluded,\r\n\nshe  had  not  been  dismissed  \"solely  by  reason  of   her\r\n\ndisability.\"  The  court next  held that the  Law Center  was\r\n\nentitled to  summary judgment on  the ground that  Murphy was\r\n\nnot  otherwise   qualified  to   complete  the   JD  program.\r\n\nSpecifically, the court found  that Murphy had failed despite\r\n\nthe fact  that she  had received  all  of the  accommodations\r\n\nrecommended by Dr. Sebestyen.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                         II.  THE LAW\r                                                 \r\n\n          A.  Summary Judgment.\r                                          \r\n\n          Our review of an order granting summary judgment is\r\n\nplenary.  Wynne v.  Tufts Univ. School of Medicine,  976 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n791,  794 (1st  Cir.  1992) (\"Wynne  II\"), cert.  denied, 113\r                                                                    \r\n\nS.Ct. 1845 (1993).   Thus, \"we must view the entire record in\r\n\nthe  light  most hospitable  to  the  party opposing  summary\r\n\njudgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's\r\n\nfavor.\"   Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,  904 F.2d 112,  115 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1990).   If the record along with affidavits \"show that there\r\n\nis  no genuine  issue as  to any material  fact and  that the\r\n\nmoving party is  entitled to a judgment as a  matter of law,\"\r\n\nwe  will uphold the grant of  summary judgment.  Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP. 56(c); Wynne II, 976 F.2d at 794.\r                              \r\n\n          B.  The Rehabilitation Act.\r                                                \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          Section 504 provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified\r\n\nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of\r\n\nher or his disability, be excluded from the participation in,\r\n\nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to  discrimination\r\n\nunder  any program  or activity  receiving  Federal financial\r\n\nassistance . . . .\"  29 U.S.C.   794.  We have held that a   \r\n\n504 claimant must show that he or she (1) was dismissed  from\r\n\na program which receives federal funds, (2) was disabled, (3)\r\n\nbut   nonetheless  was  otherwise   qualified,  and  (4)  was\r\n\ndismissed solely because of  his or her disability.   Cook v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRhode   Island  Dept.   of  Mental  Health,   Retardation,  &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nHospitals, 10  F.3d 17, 22  (1st Cir. 1993).   The parties do\r                     \r\n\nnot dispute that Murphy  is disabled and that the  Law Center\r\n\nreceives federal funds.  The  primary question is whether (1)\r\n\nMurphy  is an  \"otherwise qualified  individual\" (2)  who was\r\n\ndismissed from the Law Center solely because of her handicap.\r\n\n          The district court found Murphy's claim wanting  on\r\n\nboth  issues.   Because  we  find  that  the  district  court\r\n\ncorrectly  determined   that  Murphy  is  not  an  \"otherwise\r\n\nqualified individual,\" we need not reach the second basis for\r\n\nthe ruling below.\r\n\n          To  be  otherwise qualified  for  retention, Murphy\r\n\nmust  demonstrate  that she  was  capable  of satisfying  the\r\n\nacademic  and technical  requirements set  by the  Law Center\r\n\nwith the help  of reasonable accommodations.  See McGregor v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nLouisiana State Univ.  Bd. of  Supervisors, 3  F.3d 850,  855\r                                                      \r\n\n(5th  Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 1103 (1994).  Thus,\r                                          \r\n\nwe  look  to  see  whether the  Law  Center  either  provided\r\n\nreasonable accommodation for  Murphy's diplopia or  reached a\r\n\nrational  conclusion that  accommodating Murphy  would unduly\r\n\ninterfere  with its academic program.  See Wynne II, 976 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat  793.     Where,  as  here,   the  facts  regarding   what\r\n\naccommodations were made are not in dispute, this question is\r\n\na  legal one.   Wynne v. Tufts Univ.  School of Medicine, 932\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1991) (en banc) (citation omitted).\r\n\n                       III.  DISCUSSION\r                                                   \r\n\n          Murphy argues that the Law Center did not engage in\r\n\nthe required analysis concerning what reasonable alternatives\r\n\nwere available  to it  for the  purpose of  accommodating her\r\n\ndiplopia.  She points to the faculty's decision affirming her\r\n\ndismissal in which the involved faculty members note that the\r\n\nASC  never   considered  Murphy  to   be  handicapped,  never\r\n\ninvestigated  the information contained in Murphy's letter of\r\n\nJune  9, 1989,  never consulted  Dr. Sebestyen  regarding the\r\n\nextent of the diplopia despite his letter of August 11, 1989,\r\n\nand never considered  the effects of the  diplopia in setting\r\n\nthe probationary  terms for Murphy's fifth  semester.  Murphy\r\n\nalso claims that the  Law Center, in fact, failed  to provide\r\n\nany of the accommodations requested by her or  recommended by\r\n\nDr. Sebestyen.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n           The  record reveals that the following adjustments\r\n\nwere made for Murphy's fifth semester -- the only time period\r\n\nto  which   504's standards apply.1  First, the ASC permitted\r\n\nMurphy to  carry a reduced credit load.   Of the four courses\r\n\nMurphy  took, one  was  a \"mini-course\"  in  which the  final\r\n\nexamination was  scheduled prior to the  regular exam period.\r\n\nThe grade in another course was based solely on written work.\r\n\nThis left two courses in which Murphy was required to sit for\r\n\nstandard  examinations.     Finally,  Murphy  requested,  and\r\n\nreceived,   an  extra   hour   in  which   to  complete   her\r\n\nexaminations.\r\n\n          We  find that  these  measures  satisfied  the  Law\r\n\nCenter's obligation to  provide reasonable accommodations  to\r\n\nMurphy.   Besides  resting and  being awake  for three  hours\r\n\nbefore reading, the only recommendation made by Dr. Sebestyen\r\n\nrelevant to  test-taking was  that Murphy  read in blocks  of\r\n\ntime no greater than two to three hours and that her tests be\r\n\nscheduled  at three-day  intervals.   We note  initially that\r\n\nthere   is   no   evidence  that   Murphy's   fifth  semester\r\n\nexaminations were  arranged in a manner  contrary to Murphy's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Because  Murphy never  informed the  Law Center  that the\r\ndiplopia was  interfering with  her ability to  perform until\r\nafter  the end of her  fourth semester, it  is not chargeable\r\nwith notice of this handicap before then.   See Wynne II, 976\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d   at  795  (to  be  liable  under     504,  an  academic\r\ninstitution  must have,  or reasonably  be expected  to have,\r\nknowledge of a student's disability) (citation omitted).\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nproposed schedule.  Thus, it appears  that she had sufficient\r\n\ntime between her examinations to permit her to rest her eyes.\r\n\n          As for  the extra  hour for  the completion  of her\r\n\nexaminations, Murphy  complains that the only  effect of this\r\n\naccommodation  was   to  lengthen  the  three-  to  four-hour\r\n\nduration  of finals  to  four  to  five  hours.    Thus,  she\r\n\nconcludes,  she was forced to exceed the limits placed on her\r\n\nby  Dr. Sebestyen.   However,  Dr. Sebestyen  never indicated\r\n\nthat Murphy  required more than the usual time for completing\r                                      \r\n\nher tests.  Thus, instead of using the extra hour to complete\r\n\nthe  examinations, we perceive no reason why Murphy could not\r\n\nhave taken the additional hour to rest her eyes  or to sleep,\r\n\nthereby following Dr. Sebestyen's specific advice.\r\n\n          Murphy  also emphasizes  that she  never was  given\r\n\noral  examinations as she had asked.  According to Murphy, in\r\n\nresponse  to  this request  and  in  an  apparent  effort  to\r\n\nunderstand the effects of Murphy's diplopia, the ASC arranged\r\n\nfor a second Evidence  examination to be administered orally.\r\n\nDue  to a mix-up, however, the test  was in written form when\r\n\nMurphy  took it.   When the ASC  set the terms  for the fifth\r\n\nsemester, it  nonetheless was  under the  mistaken impression\r\n\nthat the exam had, in fact, been oral.\r\n\n          We  do  not  find  the want  of  oral  examinations\r\n\nprobative  of a  failure  reasonably to  accommodate Murphy's\r\n\ndiplopia.    Simply, there  is  no evidence  that  Murphy had\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\ndifficulty reading for two or three hour time periods or that\r\n\nher comprehension was  reduced by having to read,  as opposed\r\n\nto   hearing,  her   examinations.     Dr.   Sebestyen  never\r\n\nrecommended   oral  examinations  or  suggested  that  Murphy\r\n\nrefrain from  reading altogether.   In short, Murphy  has not\r                   \r\n\nshown that  her performance would have  improved through oral\r\n\nexams; that is, she has not shown that she would be otherwise\r\n\nqualified if tested orally.\r\n\n          Murphy further  argues  that by  requiring  her  to\r\n\nmaintain a 2.3 grade point average in the fifth semester, the\r\n\nASC  had  demanded  more  of  her  than  of  non-probationary\r\n\nstudents (who needed  to maintain  only a 2.0  average).   In\r\n\nthis regard, Murphy  points out that  her overall average  at\r\n\nthe  end of  the fifth  semester was  2.05 --  above the  Law\r\n\nCenter's  minimum  requirement.   The  faculty  noted in  its\r\n\ndecision   upholding  Murphy's  dismissal  that  students  on\r\n\nprobation were  often required  to have grade  point averages\r\n\nhigher than the minimum.\r\n\n          Murphy did not submit any evidence showing that she\r\n\nwas  singled out or that  the ASC demanded  the higher G.P.A.\r\n\nfor  discriminatory   reasons.    Merely   requiring  special\r\n\nprobationary terms is not  sufficient to demonstrate that the\r\n\nLaw  Center failed  adequately  to accommodate  Murphy.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMcGregor,  3  F.3d  at  858  n.9,  860  (where  disabled  law\r                    \r\n\nstudent's  G.P.A.  was  above  the minimum  imposed  on  non-\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nprobationary students, but below the G.P.A.  set forth in the\r\n\nterms of  his probation,   504 did not require the law school\r\n\nto let him  proceed to his next year).   In any event, Murphy\r\n\nstill failed  to comply  with the generally  applied academic\r\n\nprovision  that a  student have  not more  than nine  credits\r\n\nbelow a C-.\r\n\n          Murphy's  most  emphatic   argument  is  that   the\r\n\ndistrict court  erred in assigning the  burdens of production\r\n\nand persuasion that the parties must meet in a Rehabilitation\r\n\nAct claim.  She correctly notes that the circuits are divided\r\n\non this question.   One  camp holds that  the plaintiff  must\r\n\nmake a prima  facie showing  that she would  be qualified  to\r\n\nparticipate in the program  if reasonable accommodations were\r\n\nmade.  The  burden then  shifts to the  defendant to  produce\r                                                                         \r\n\nevidence that reasonable accommodations were made and/or that\r\n\nthe   plaintiff's   requested  accommodations   would  unduly\r\n\ninterfere with the quality  or integrity of the program.   At\r\n\nthat  point, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to rebut\r\n\nthat evidence or show  that the institution's actions  were a\r\n\npretext for discrimination.  See, e.g., Teahan v. Metro-North\r                                                                         \r\n\nCommuter  R.  Co.,  951  F.2d 511,  515-16  (2d  Cir.  1991).\r                             \r\n\nAnother camp places on the defense the burden of  persuasion,\r                                                                        \r\n\nrather than production.  See,  e.g., Pushkin v. University of\r                                                                         \r\n\nColorado, 658 F.2d 1372, 1387 (10th Cir. 1981).  This circuit\r                    \r\n\nhas never squarely addressed the issue.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n          Murphy  argues  that  the  district  court  wrongly\r\n\napplied  the production standard  rather than  the persuasion\r\n\nstandard.    But under  any standard  she  must, at  the very\r\n\nleast, make a sufficient  prima facie case that she  would be\r\n\nqualified  with  the  aid  of  oral  examinations,  the  only\r\n\nrequested accommodation that the school did not provide.   As\r\n\nwe  noted earlier, she did  not make that  showing.  Murphy's\r\n\ntests  were administered  at intervals  of several  days, and\r\n\nthey  did not require  her to read for  more than three hours\r\n\nwithout a break.   There is no reason to  think that Murphy's\r\n\nperformance  would improve if  she were not  required to take\r\n\nwritten examinations at all.\r\n\n                       IV.  CONCLUSION\r                                                  \r\n\n          The fact  that the ASC might  not have specifically\r\n\nconsidered the effects  of Murphy's  diplopia in  determining\r\n\nwhat  accommodations  to  provide  does  not  mean  that  the\r\n\naccommodations  she actually  received were  not \"reasonable\"\r\n\nwithin the meaning of   504.  We therefore conclude that,  as\r\n\na  matter  of law,  Murphy  was not  otherwise  qualified for\r\n\nretention as a student at the Law Center.  That is, even with\r\n\nthe accommodations  provided by  the ASC,  she was  unable to\r\n\nmeet both the Law Center's degree requirements and the  terms\r\n\nof her probation.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n",

This is an  appeal from the  district\r                                \r\n\ncourt's  grant  of  summary  judgment in  favor  of  appellee\r\n\nFranklin Pierce  Law Center.   The district  court determined\r\n\nthat   appellant   Nancy    Murphy's   claim   of    handicap\r\n\ndiscrimination in  violation of    504 of  the Rehabilitation\r\n\nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C.   794, failed as a matter of law.\r\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\r                                                  \r\n\n          Murphy  suffers from diplopia,  a genetic condition\r\n\nin which weakness  in the  muscles of the  eye causes  double\r\n\nvision and problems with focusing on printed matter.  She has\r\n\nhad  two  surgeries   (one  necessitated  by   an  automobile\r\n\naccident) for this  ailment.  Murphy manages  the diplopia by\r\n\nlimiting  the amount of time spent reading and by engaging in\r\n\nmuscular  exercises prescribed  by  Dr.  John Sebestyen,  her\r\n\ntreating physician.  Nonetheless,  when Murphy applied to the\r\n\nLaw Center in 1987, she was reading without impairment.\r\n\n          Murphy  began  experiencing  academic  difficulties\r\n\nalmost as soon as she entered the Law Center.  At  the end of\r\n\nher  first year,  her G.P.A.  was 1.88  -- below  the minimum\r\n\nG.P.A. of  2.0  set by  the Law  Center.   Thus, Murphy  came\r\n\nwithin the  jurisdiction of  the Academic  Standing Committee\r\n\n(\"ASC\").     At   this  time,   Murphy  indicated   that  her\r\n\ndifficulties were due  to a thyroid condition  and poor test-\r\n\ntaking skills; she  did not  mention the diplopia.   For  her\r\r\n\nsecond  year, the ASC required Murphy to maintain a G.P.A. of\r\n\n2.0 and not to receive a grade below a C-.\r\n\n          Although Murphy  met these requirements  during the\r\n\nfall semester, she again came before the ASC as the result of\r\n\nreceiving  a  D  in  Evidence  during  the  spring  semester.\r\n\nCombined with D+ grades in two first-year courses, Murphy now\r\n\nhad more than nine credits below a C-.  This was in violation\r\n\nof  the Law  Center's general  academic regulations.   Murphy\r\n\nsubmitted an  analysis of her  situation in which  she cited,\r\n\nfor the first time, the diplopia as one of the  causes of her\r\n\nacademic problems.\r\n\n          Specifically,  Murphy  stated  that   the  diplopia\r\n\nproduced double-vision, eyestrain, pain  and headaches -- all\r\n\nof which interfered  with reading efficiency.   On the advice\r\n\nof  Dr. Sebestyen, Murphy did  not read in  the morning until\r\n\nshe had been awake for three hours, did not read or study for\r\n\nmore  than  three hours  at a  time, and  slept when  she had\r\n\ntrouble focusing.   In this letter, Murphy requested that she\r\n\nbe allowed to take  tests at three-day intervals so  that her\r\n\neyestrain  would be  reduced.   At a  meeting later  in June,\r\n\nMurphy  further  asked the  ASC to  permit  her to  take oral\r\n\nexaminations.\r\n\n          Murphy also submitted to the  ASC a letter from Dr.\r\n\nSebestyen, dated August 11, 1989.   Based on a July  12 exam,\r\n\nDr.  Sebestyen concluded  that Murphy's convergence  was poor\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nand that her eye muscles were weak.  He  recommended that she\r\n\nbreak up her reading and studying into \"well-defined segments\r\n\nof time such as  two hours at a  time, or three hours at  the\r\n\nmost.\"\r\n\n          As for  the fifth semester, the  ASC allowed Murphy\r\n\nto take only  nine credits --  the usual  minimum at the  Law\r\n\nCenter  is twelve.  The terms of Murphy's probation were that\r\n\nshe obtain  a 2.3 G.P.A., have  no grades under a  C- and not\r\n\nhave more than one course with a C- grade.  Again, Murphy did\r\n\nnot  appeal  these  terms.   At  the  end  of this  semester,\r\n\nhowever,  Murphy's G.P.A. was 1.89; she had failed one course\r\n\nand had received a D in another.\r\n\n          Murphy was dismissed from  the Law Center by letter\r\n\ndated  February 12, 1990.   The ASC stated  that its decision\r\n\nwas based on  (1) Murphy's failure  to meet the terms  of her\r\n\nprobation,   and  (2)  her   entire  academic   record  which\r\n\ndemonstrated that she lacked the ability to  complete the Law\r\n\nCenter's degree  program.  Murphy  then pursued an  appeal of\r\n\nthe  decision of the ASC.   The faculty  upheld the dismissal\r\n\nessentially finding that although  the ASC had made mistakes,\r\n\nthey  did not  affect  the question  of  Murphy's ability  to\r\n\nsatisfy the academic requirements of the JD program.   Murphy\r\n\nthen filed this action in the federal district court.\r\n\n          In granting  the motion for  summary judgment,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  concluded that  Murphy had not  presented any\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nevidence contradicting the Law Center's position that she was\r\n\ndismissed because she lacked the analytic skills necessary to\r\n\nsucceed in law  school.  Thus, the  district court concluded,\r\n\nshe  had  not  been  dismissed  \"solely  by  reason  of   her\r\n\ndisability.\"  The  court next  held that the  Law Center  was\r\n\nentitled to  summary judgment on  the ground that  Murphy was\r\n\nnot  otherwise   qualified  to   complete  the   JD  program.\r\n\nSpecifically, the court found  that Murphy had failed despite\r\n\nthe fact  that she  had received  all  of the  accommodations\r\n\nrecommended by Dr. Sebestyen.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                         II.  THE LAW\r                                                 \r\n\n          A.

The parties do\r                     \r\n\nnot dispute that Murphy  is disabled and that the  Law Center\r\n\nreceives federal funds.  The  primary question is whether (1)\r\n\nMurphy  is an  \"otherwise qualified  individual\" (2)  who was\r\n\ndismissed from the Law Center solely because of her handicap.\r\n\n          The district court found Murphy's claim wanting  on\r\n\nboth  issues.   Because  we  find  that  the  district  court\r\n\ncorrectly  determined   that  Murphy  is  not  an  \"otherwise\r\n\nqualified individual,\" we need not reach the second basis for\r\n\nthe ruling below.\r\n\n          To  be  otherwise qualified  for  retention, Murphy\r\n\nmust  demonstrate  that she  was  capable  of satisfying  the\r\n\nacademic  and technical  requirements set  by the  Law Center\r\n\nwith the help  of reasonable accommodations.

DISCUSSION\r                                                   \r\n\n          Murphy argues that the Law Center did not engage in\r\n\nthe required analysis concerning what reasonable alternatives\r\n\nwere available  to it  for the  purpose of  accommodating her\r\n\ndiplopia.  She points to the faculty's decision affirming her\r\n\ndismissal in which the involved faculty members note that the\r\n\nASC  never   considered  Murphy  to   be  handicapped,  never\r\n\ninvestigated  the information contained in Murphy's letter of\r\n\nJune  9, 1989,  never consulted  Dr. Sebestyen  regarding the\r\n\nextent of the diplopia despite his letter of August 11, 1989,\r\n\nand never considered  the effects of the  diplopia in setting\r\n\nthe probationary  terms for Murphy's fifth  semester.  Murphy\r\n\nalso claims that the  Law Center, in fact, failed  to provide\r\n\nany of the accommodations requested by her or  recommended by\r\n\nDr. Sebestyen.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n           The  record reveals that the following adjustments\r\n\nwere made for Murphy's fifth semester -- the only time period\r\n\nto  which   504's standards apply.1  First, the ASC permitted\r\n\nMurphy to  carry a reduced credit load.   Of the four courses\r\n\nMurphy  took, one  was  a \"mini-course\"  in  which the  final\r\n\nexamination was  scheduled prior to the  regular exam period.\r\n\nThe grade in another course was based solely on written work.\r\n\nThis left two courses in which Murphy was required to sit for\r\n\nstandard  examinations.     Finally,  Murphy  requested,  and\r\n\nreceived,   an  extra   hour   in  which   to  complete   her\r\n\nexaminations.\r\n\n          We  find that  these  measures  satisfied  the  Law\r\n\nCenter's obligation to  provide reasonable accommodations  to\r\n\nMurphy.   Besides  resting and  being awake  for three  hours\r\n\nbefore reading, the only recommendation made by Dr. Sebestyen\r\n\nrelevant to  test-taking was  that Murphy  read in blocks  of\r\n\ntime no greater than two to three hours and that her tests be\r\n\nscheduled  at three-day  intervals.   We note  initially that\r\n\nthere   is   no   evidence  that   Murphy's   fifth  semester\r\n\nexaminations were  arranged in a manner  contrary to Murphy's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Because  Murphy never  informed the  Law Center  that the\r\ndiplopia was  interfering with  her ability to  perform until\r\nafter  the end of her  fourth semester, it  is not chargeable\r\nwith notice of this handicap before then.

Thus, it appears  that she had sufficient\r\n\ntime between her examinations to permit her to rest her eyes.\r\n\n          As for  the extra  hour for  the completion  of her\r\n\nexaminations, Murphy  complains that the only  effect of this\r\n\naccommodation  was   to  lengthen  the  three-  to  four-hour\r\n\nduration  of finals  to  four  to  five  hours.    Thus,  she\r\n\nconcludes,  she was forced to exceed the limits placed on her\r\n\nby  Dr. Sebestyen.   However,  Dr. Sebestyen  never indicated\r\n\nthat Murphy  required more than the usual time for completing\r                                      \r\n\nher tests.  Thus, instead of using the extra hour to complete\r\n\nthe  examinations, we perceive no reason why Murphy could not\r\n\nhave taken the additional hour to rest her eyes  or to sleep,\r\n\nthereby following Dr. Sebestyen's specific advice.\r\n\n          Murphy  also emphasizes  that she  never was  given\r\n\noral  examinations as she had asked.  According to Murphy, in\r\n\nresponse  to  this request  and  in  an  apparent  effort  to\r\n\nunderstand the effects of Murphy's diplopia, the ASC arranged\r\n\nfor a second Evidence  examination to be administered orally.\r\n\nDue  to a mix-up, however, the test  was in written form when\r\n\nMurphy  took it.   When the ASC  set the terms  for the fifth\r\n\nsemester, it  nonetheless was  under the  mistaken impression\r\n\nthat the exam had, in fact, been oral.\r\n\n          We  do  not  find  the want  of  oral  examinations\r\n\nprobative  of a  failure  reasonably to  accommodate Murphy's\r\n\ndiplopia.    Simply, there  is  no evidence  that  Murphy had\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\ndifficulty reading for two or three hour time periods or that\r\n\nher comprehension was  reduced by having to read,  as opposed\r\n\nto   hearing,  her   examinations.     Dr.   Sebestyen  never\r\n\nrecommended   oral  examinations  or  suggested  that  Murphy\r\n\nrefrain from  reading altogether.   In short, Murphy  has not\r                   \r\n\nshown that  her performance would have  improved through oral\r\n\nexams; that is, she has not shown that she would be otherwise\r\n\nqualified if tested orally.\r\n\n          Murphy further  argues  that by  requiring  her  to\r\n\nmaintain a 2.3 grade point average in the fifth semester, the\r\n\nASC  had  demanded  more  of  her  than  of  non-probationary\r\n\nstudents (who needed  to maintain  only a 2.0  average).   In\r\n\nthis regard, Murphy  points out that  her overall average  at\r\n\nthe  end of  the fifth  semester was  2.05 --  above the  Law\r\n\nCenter's  minimum  requirement.   The  faculty  noted in  its\r\n\ndecision   upholding  Murphy's  dismissal  that  students  on\r\n\nprobation were  often required  to have grade  point averages\r\n\nhigher than the minimum.\r\n\n          Murphy did not submit any evidence showing that she\r\n\nwas  singled out or that  the ASC demanded  the higher G.P.A.\r\n\nfor  discriminatory   reasons.    Merely   requiring  special\r\n\nprobationary terms is not  sufficient to demonstrate that the\r\n\nLaw  Center failed  adequately  to accommodate  Murphy.

In any event, Murphy\r\n\nstill failed  to comply  with the generally  applied academic\r\n\nprovision  that a  student have  not more  than nine  credits\r\n\nbelow a C-.\r\n\n          Murphy's  most  emphatic   argument  is  that   the\r\n\ndistrict court  erred in assigning the  burdens of production\r\n\nand persuasion that the parties must meet in a Rehabilitation\r\n\nAct claim.  She correctly notes that the circuits are divided\r\n\non this question.   One  camp holds that  the plaintiff  must\r\n\nmake a prima  facie showing  that she would  be qualified  to\r\n\nparticipate in the program  if reasonable accommodations were\r\n\nmade.  The  burden then  shifts to the  defendant to  produce\r                                                                         \r\n\nevidence that reasonable accommodations were made and/or that\r\n\nthe   plaintiff's   requested  accommodations   would  unduly\r\n\ninterfere with the quality  or integrity of the program.

This circuit\r                    \r\n\nhas never squarely addressed the issue.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n          Murphy  argues  that  the  district  court  wrongly\r\n\napplied  the production standard  rather than  the persuasion\r\n\nstandard.    But under  any standard  she  must, at  the very\r\n\nleast, make a sufficient  prima facie case that she  would be\r\n\nqualified  with  the  aid  of  oral  examinations,  the  only\r\n\nrequested accommodation that the school did not provide.   As\r\n\nwe  noted earlier, she did  not make that  showing.  Murphy's\r\n\ntests  were administered  at intervals  of several  days, and\r\n\nthey  did not require  her to read for  more than three hours\r\n\nwithout a break.   There is no reason to  think that Murphy's\r\n\nperformance  would improve if  she were not  required to take\r\n\nwritten examinations at all.\r\n\n                       IV.  CONCLUSION\r                                                  \r\n\n          The fact  that the ASC might  not have specifically\r\n\nconsidered the effects  of Murphy's  diplopia in  determining\r\n\nwhat  accommodations  to  provide  does  not  mean  that  the\r\n\naccommodations  she actually  received were  not \"reasonable\"\r\n\nwithin the meaning of   504.  We therefore conclude that,  as\r\n\na  matter  of law,  Murphy  was not  otherwise  qualified for\r\n\nretention as a student at the Law Center.  That is, even with\r\n\nthe accommodations  provided by  the ASC,  she was  unable to\r\n\nmeet both the Law Center's degree requirements and the  terms\r\n\nof her probation.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n</pre>",
