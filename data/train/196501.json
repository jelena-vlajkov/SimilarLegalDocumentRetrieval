See Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland  Int'l,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc.,  49 F.3d 807, 809 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing four district\r                \r\n\ncourt  decisions in this case).   In 1993,  the United States\r\n\nDistrict Court  for the District of  Massachusetts ruled that\r\n\nBorland  had copied  Lotus  1-2-3's menu  command hierarchy;1\r\n\naccordingly, the court entered a permanent injunction against\r\n\nBorland.  Lotus  Dev. Corp.  v. Borland Int'l,  Inc., 831  F.\r                                                                \r\n\nSupp. 223, 245 (D. Mass. 1993).\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The menu command hierarchy  is the 1-2-3 program's system\r\nof operating commands (e.g.,  \"Open\"; \"Save\"; \"Delete\")  that\r\nare  arranged  in a  linked  hierarchy of  command  menus and\r\nsubmenus.   Each  menu is  a list  of commands  displayed on-\r\nscreen.  The user selects a command by highlighting it on the\r\nmenu or typing its first letter.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Borland  appealed the  infringement ruling  and the\r\n\ninjunction.  By the time  of that appeal,  the district court\r\n\nproceedings  had narrowed  the  copyright claim  to Borland's\r\n\nalleged infringement  of the  menu command hierarchy.   Lotus\r\n\ndid  not contend on appeal  that the district  court erred in\r\n\nfinding that  Borland had not  copied any  other elements  of\r\n\nLotus 1-2-3.   In March 1995, this court  ruled that the menu\r\n\ncommand hierarchy of Lotus 1-2-3 was a  \"method of operation\"\r\n\nnot protectible  by copyright,  as provided  in  17 U.S.C.   \r\n\n102(b), reversing the judgment of the  district court.  Lotus\r                                                                         \r\n\nDev.  Corp. v.  Borland Int'l,  Inc., 49  F.3d 807  (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1995).\r\n\n          Lotus  filed a  petition  for  certiorari with  the\r\n\nUnited States  Supreme Court.  While  the certiorari petition\r\n\nwas pending,  Borland filed a  motion in  the district  court\r\n\nseeking the  entry of  final judgment  in its favor,  arguing\r\n\nthat  our opinion had  rejected the only  remaining basis for\r\n\nLotus's  case.   Lotus countered  with a  motion to  stay all\r\n\nfurther  proceedings until  the Supreme  Court  either denied\r\n\ncertiorari  or  ruled  on the  merits  of  the  appeal.   The\r\n\ndistrict court denied Borland's  motion to enter judgment and\r\n\ngranted the  stay that Lotus requested, noting  in the margin\r\n\nthat \"the  pendency of the  petition for writ  of certiorari,\r\n\nwhich  raises  issues   sufficiently  meritorious  to  permit\r\n\nfurther judicial  review[,] coupled  with the absence  of any\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ncognizable  harm  to the  defendant  during  the pendency  of\r\n\ncertiorari   proceedings[,]   counsels  against   further  --\r\n\npotentially unnecessary  -- proceedings in  this court  until\r\n\nthe petition is resolved.\"\r\n\n          Borland now appeals the district court's refusal to\r\n\nenter  final judgment  and  its grant  of  a stay  until  the\r\n\nSupreme Court decided Lotus's appeal.  Apparently recognizing\r\n\nthat  this  court  might  find  these  to  be  non-appealable\r\n\ninterlocutory orders, Borland seeks in the alternative a writ\r\n\nof mandamus  directing the  district court to  enter judgment\r\n\nand  to dissolve  its  stay order.    While this  appeal  and\r\n\npetition were  pending, the Supreme Court granted certiorari,\r\n\nLotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 116 S. Ct. 39 (Sept.\r                                                   \r\n\n27, 1995), and scheduled arguments for January 1996.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                       BORLAND'S APPEAL\r                                   BORLAND'S APPEAL\r                                                   \r\n\n          Borland appeals the district court's orders denying\r\n\nBorland's motion  to  enter  judgment  and  granting  Lotus's\r\n\nmotion for a stay of proceedings.  We have significant doubts\r\n\nas  to  our jurisdiction  because  the  orders appealed  from\r\n\nappear to  be neither  \"final decisions\" reviewable  under 28\r\n\nU.S.C.   1291 nor  appealable interlocutory orders under  the\r\n\n\"collateral order\"  doctrine  of Cohen  v. Beneficial  Indus.\r                                                                         \r\n\nLoan Corp,  337 U.S. 541  (1949).  Our  jurisdictional doubts\r                     \r\n\nnotwithstanding,   we  believe  the  wisest  course  at  this\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\njuncture  is  to defer  our  decision  on the  jurisdictional\r\n\nquestions and  the merits  until the Supreme  Court announces\r\n\nits decision in this case.   See, e.g., Glater v. Eli Lilly &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.,  744 F.2d  213, 214 (1st  Cir. 1984)  (decision deferred\r               \r\n\nuntil Supreme Court decides  key issue in another case).   We\r\n\nrecognize that this appeal  will almost certainly become moot\r\n\nwhen the Supreme Court rules, but that fact counsels against,\r\n\nnot  for,  our  deciding the  appeal  now.    Thus, we  defer\r\n\ndecision on this appeal until the Supreme Court announces its\r\n\ndecision in this case.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n           BORLAND'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS\r                       BORLAND'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS\r                                                              \r\n\n          Federal  appellate  courts are  empowered  to issue\r\n\nprerogative writs  that are \"necessary or  appropriate in aid\r\n\nof their respective jurisdictions,\"  28 U.S.C.   1651(a), but\r\n\nthat power must be  used stintingly and brought to  bear only\r\n\nin  extraordinary situations.

The\r                            \r\n\nstandards  for issuance of the  writ of mandamus  are high: a\r\n\npetitioner  must  show  both  that the  challenged  order  is\r\n\npalpably erroneous  and that  he faces  some special  risk of\r\n\nirreparable  harm.  In re  Cargill, Inc., 66  F.3d 1256, 1260\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); United States v.

And, even these showings\r                               \r\n\ndo  not  necessarily require  a court's  use  of the  writ of\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nmandamus, which, as an  exceptional remedy, is to  be granted\r\n\nonly in the exercise  of sound discretion.

As  to  the  district court's  refusal  to  enter\r\n\njudgment for Borland,  we note that our mandate directed only\r\n\nthat  the judgment for Lotus be reversed.  The district court\r\n\ncomplied by vacating the  injunction.  We did not  direct the\r\n\nentry of judgment for Borland; although  that result might be\r\n\nexpected to follow  in due  course, this is  not a  situation\r\n\nwhere the court below has ignored our clear mandate.\r\n\n          As to  the stay, it would be a poor use of judicial\r\n\nresources  to conduct  further  proceedings  in the  district\r\n\ncourt at this time, given that the Supreme Court is  about to\r\n\nhear  Lotus's  appeal.    Whatever  Borland's  concern  about\r\n\ninterest on an attorney fee award, the decision when to enter\r\n\njudgment  in a  case where  the Supreme  Court has  agreed to\r\n\nreview the appeals  court's own decision  is obviously not  a\r\n\ncandidate for mandamus.\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we defer our decision in\r\n\nBorland's appeal, No. 95-1885, and we deny Borland's petition\r\n\nfor a writ of mandamus, No. 95-1793.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Petition for writ of mandamus denied.

Borland Int'l, Inc., 831 F.Supp. 223, 245 (D.Mass.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland appealed the infringement ruling and the injunction.  By the time of that appeal, the district court proceedings had narrowed the copyright claim to Borland's alleged infringement of the menu command hierarchy.  Lotus did not contend on appeal that the district court erred in finding that Borland had not copied any other elements of Lotus 1-2-3.  In March 1995, this court ruled that the menu command hierarchy of Lotus 1-2-3 was a \"method of operation\" not protectible by copyright, as provided in 17 U.S.C. Sec. 102(b), reversing the judgment of the district court.  Lotus Dev.  Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lotus filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.  While the certiorari petition was pending, Borland filed a motion in the district court seeking the entry of final judgment in its favor, arguing that our opinion had rejected the only remaining basis for Lotus's case.  Lotus countered with a motion to stay all further proceedings until the Supreme Court either denied certiorari or ruled on the merits of the appeal.  The district court denied Borland's motion to enter judgment and granted the stay that Lotus requested, noting in the margin that \"the pendency of the petition for writ of certiorari, which raises issues sufficiently meritorious to permit further judicial review[,] coupled with the absence of any cognizable harm to the defendant during the pendency of certiorari proceedings[,] counsels against further--potentially unnecessary--proceedings in this court until the petition is resolved.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland now appeals the district court's refusal to enter final judgment and its grant of a stay until the Supreme Court decided Lotus's appeal.  Apparently recognizing that this court might find these to be non-appealable interlocutory orders, Borland seeks in the alternative a writ of mandamus directing the district court to enter judgment and to dissolve its stay order.  While this appeal and petition were pending, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, Lotus Dev.  Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 116 S.Ct. 39 (Sept. 27, 1995), and scheduled arguments for January 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>BORLAND'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland appeals the district court's orders denying Borland's motion to enter judgment and granting Lotus's motion for a stay of proceedings.  We have significant doubts as to our jurisdiction because the orders appealed from appear to be neither \"final decisions\" reviewable under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 nor appealable interlocutory orders under the \"collateral order\" doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Indus.  Loan Corp, 337 U.S. 541 (1949).  Our jurisdictional doubts notwithstanding, we believe the wisest course at this juncture is to defer our decision on the jurisdictional questions and the merits until the Supreme Court announces its decision in this case.  See, e.g., Glater v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 744 F.2d 213, 214 (1st Cir.1984) (decision deferred until Supreme Court decides key issue in another case).  We recognize that this appeal will almost certainly become moot when the Supreme Court rules, but that fact counsels against, not for, our deciding the appeal now.  Thus, we defer decision on this appeal until the Supreme Court announces its decision in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>BORLAND'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal appellate courts are empowered to issue prerogative writs that are \"necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1651(a), but that power must be used stintingly and brought to bear only in extraordinary situations.  Doughty v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 6 F.3d 856, 865 (1st Cir.1993).  The standards for issuance of the writ of mandamus are high:  a petitioner must show both that the challenged order is palpably erroneous and that he faces some special risk of irreparable harm.  In re Cargill, Inc., 66 F.3d 1256, 1260 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 769 (1st Cir.1993);  Doughty, 6 F.3d at 865.  And, even these showings do not necessarily require a court's use of the writ of mandamus, which, as an exceptional remedy, is to be granted only in the exercise of sound discretion.  Cargill, 66 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This petition does not present the combination of palpable error and irreparable harm necessary to justify mandamus.  As to the district court's refusal to enter judgment for Borland, we note that our mandate directed only that the judgment for Lotus be reversed.  The district court complied by vacating the injunction.  We did not direct the entry of judgment for Borland;  although that result might be expected to follow in due course, this is not a situation where the court below has ignored our clear mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the stay, it would be a poor use of judicial resources to conduct further proceedings in the district court at this time, given that the Supreme Court is about to hear Lotus's appeal.  Whatever Borland's concern about interest on an attorney fee award, the decision when to enter judgment in a case where the Supreme Court has agreed to review the appeals court's own decision is obviously not a candidate for mandamus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we defer our decision in Borland's appeal, No. 95-1885, and we deny Borland's petition for a writ of mandamus, No. 95-1793.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petition for writ of mandamus denied.
