Petitioner Marino  was indicted  for\n                     \n\nconspiracy  to  distribute  and  possession  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute  1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1),  (b)(1)(A)(vii) and 846 (Count I),\n\nand  attempting  to  possess with  intent  to  distribute one\n\nhundred kilograms  or more  of marijuana  in violation of  21\n\nU.S.C.    841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(vii) and 846, and  18 U.S.C.  \n\n2  (Count III).   Marino  entered a  plea agreement  with the\n\ngovernment pursuant to  which he pled guilty to  Count III of\n\nthe indictment which  had been amended to delete  a reference\n\nto  the specific  quantity of  marijuana involved.   For  its\n\npart, the government agreed to dismiss Count I and  recommend\n\nthe  minimum sentence  under  Count  III  at  the  sentencing\n\nhearing.  Marino was sentenced to an eighty-two month term of\n\nincarceration, which sentence  was upheld on appeal.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Marino, 936 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1991).  Subsequently,\n                \n\nMarino  filed a motion under 18  U.S.C.   2255 to vacate, set\n\naside or correct his sentence.   The district court summarily\n\ndenied  the motion without conducting an evidentiary hearing.\n\nMarino appeals, and, finding no error, we affirm.\n\n          The  background of this case was reported in detail\n\nby this  court in  its opinion  affirming Marino's  sentence.\n\nMarino, 936 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1991).  We therefore will pause\n      \n\nonly  long enough to highlight  relevant facts in the context\n\nof Marino's two claims.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n                              I\n\n                Lack of an Evidentiary Hearing\n                                              \n\n          Marino claims  that  the district  court  erred  in\n\ndenying  his motion  without the  benefit  of an  evidentiary\n\nhearing.  Specifically, he contends that, because no rational\n\nexplanation  was provided  to  explain  his  trial  counsel's\n\n\"paradoxical\"  advice,   the  court   should  have   held  an\n\nevidentiary hearing.  The  advice to which Marino refers  was\n\nthe following:  Counsel advised Marino against going to trial\n\nbecause the jury would not believe his story that he was only\n\ninterested   in   purchasing   one   pound   of   marijuana.1\n\nSubsequently,  counsel advised  Marino to give  his one-pound\n\npurchase  claim to  the Probation  Department  in a  prepared\n\nstatement, and  to repeat it  under oath  at the  presentence\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n          Marino followed counsel's advice.   The trial judge\n\ndid not believe Marino's story, and found instead that Marino\n\n          was  involved  in   a  transaction  which\n          involved  more than  100  kilograms of  a\n\n                    \n\n1.   In a letter to petitioner, counsel stated:\n          It is obvious to me  that you will not be\n          able to testify.   In the event  you wish\n          to do so, however, that option  is yours.\n          It is my strong feeling that in the event\n          you do  testify, you would  hurt yourself\n          more than help,  and that the  government\n          could,    quite    easily,    prove   the\n          allegations necessary  to convict  you in\n          Count No.  III, based  on your own  prior\n          statement and the testimony of the  other\n          defendants.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          substance containing a  detectable amount\n          of marijuana, that  is, 500 pounds,  that\n          the   deal   was,   and   as   the   tape\n          demonstrated,  it  was  going to  be  500\n          pounds  at a time or maybe 1000 pounds at\n          a  time  until  we got  to  the  ultimate\n          amount.    So  that  I'm  satisfied  with\n          respect to the third count that there was\n          more than 100  kilos that Mr.  Marino was\n          involved with.\n\nThat finding was upheld by this court on appeal.  Marino, 936\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at  27-29.  Three consequences flowed  from the finding:\n\nfirst, Marino's  base offense  level was  set at  26; second,\n\nMarino  was not given credit for acceptance of responsibility\n\nbecause he only  acknowledged his guilt  with respect to  one\n\npound  of marijuana; and  third, the court  added a two-level\n\nupward adjustment for  obstruction of  justice, finding  that\n\nMarino had lied at the presentence evidentiary hearing and in\n\nhis  statement of acceptance  of responsibility.   This court\n\naffirmed these decisions on appeal.   Marino, 936 F.2d at 27-\n                                            \n\n32.\n\n          Marino now claims  that had he been  advised of the\n\npossible  consequences  of  his statement  to  the  Probation\n\nDepartment and his  testimony at the presentence  hearing, he\n\nwould have presented his story through  third-party witnesses\n\nrather than testifying on his own behalf.  He alleges that he\n\npresented  the  district court  with  a prima  facie  case of\n                                                    \n\nineffective  assistance  of  counsel, and  that  the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing his claim without the benefit of an\n\nevidentiary hearing.  We disagree.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Section 2255 provides that a petitioner is entitled\n\nto an evidentiary hearing on  his motion \"[u]nless the motion\n\nand the files and records  of the case conclusively show that\n\nthe prisoner  is entitled to  no relief.\"   Rule 4(b) of  the\n\nRules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings in the United States\n\nDistrict Courts provides  that \"[i]f it plainly  appears from\n\nthe face of the motion and any annexed exhibits and the prior\n\nproceedings in  the case that  the movant is not  entitled to\n\nrelief in the  district court, the judge shall  make an order\n\nfor  its  summary  dismissal  and  cause  the  movant  to  be\n\nnotified.\"  This court has summarized the rule as follows:\n\n          [A] petition can  be dismissed without  a\n          hearing if the  petitioner's allegations,\n          accepted as  true, would not  entitle the\n          petitioner   to   relief,   or   if   the\n          allegations  cannot be  accepted as  true\n          because  \"they  are contradicted  by  the\n          record,    inherently    incredible,   or\n          conclusions  rather  than  statements  of\n          fact.\"    Dziurgot  v. Luther,  897  F.2d\n                                       \n          1222, 1225 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Myatt\n                                                   \n          v. United  States,  875 F.2d  8, 11  (1st\n                           \n          Cir. 1989)).  \n\nUnited States v.  Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d  747, 749-50\n                                     \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Petitioner claims  that his  counsel's inconsistent\n\nadvice,  because it resulted  in an increase  in petitioner's\n\noffense   level,   constituted,   ipso   facto,   ineffective\n                                              \n\nassistance   of  counsel.    The  legal  standard  is  clear.\n\nPetitioner  must show  both that  counsel's performance  fell\n\nbelow  an  objective  standard  of  reasonableness  and  that\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nprejudice  resulted.

United States, 917 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n645, 648  (1st Cir.  1990).   Counsel's  performance must  be\n\nexamined  \"not in  hindsight, but  based on  what the  lawyer\n\nknew, or should have known,  at the time his tactical choices\n\nwere made and  implemented.\"  United  States v. Natanel,  938\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.  1991), cert. denied, 112 S.  Ct. 986\n                                            \n\n(1992).  The \"range of reasonable professional assistance\" is\n\nquite wide.  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.   Therefore, as\n                           \n\nthe   Supreme  Court  has   noted,  \"[j]udicial  scrutiny  of\n\ncounsel's performance must be highly deferential.\"  Id.\n                                                       \n\n          We cannot  say that  defense counsel's  performance\n\nwas unreasonable.  As the court below held,\n\n          [I]n  making   decisions  regarding   the\n          propriety of having Petitioner testify at\n          a trial and at  a presentence evidentiary\n          hearing, defense counsel  had to evaluate\n          two very distinct  sets of circumstances.\n          In  deciding that  Petitioner should  not\n          testify at trial, defense counsel had  to\n          take into account the considerable wealth\n          of  government  evidence.  .  .  .     In\n          deciding to permit  Petitioner to testify\n          at his  presentence evidentiary  hearing,\n          however, defense counsel  was required to\n          view the government's evidence in a  much\n          different light.  Although the government\n          possessed   an   abundance   of  evidence\n          linking   Petitioner   with    the   drug\n          transaction  generally, the  government's\n          evidence concerning  the specific  amount\n          involved  in  the  transaction  was  less\n          persuasive.  See United States v. Marino,\n                                                  \n          936 F.2d at 28[-29].  Given  the strength\n          of the  government's evidence  connecting\n          Petitioner  with some  sort of  marijuana\n          purchase  and  the   ambiguities  in  the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          government's   evidence  concerning   the\n          amount of  marijuana, it  cannot be  said\n          that defense counsel's  advice concerning\n          either  matter  fell below  an  objective\n          standard of reasonableness.\n\nMarino v.  United States, No.  92-0503B, Mem. and Order  at 4\n                        \n\n(D.  R.I. February 23, 1993).  Petitioner erroneously assumes\n\nthat  giving different  advice with  respect to  an  issue at\n\ndifferent stages  of a  prosecution is  per se  unreasonable.\n                                              \n\nThe district  court acted  within its  discretion in  denying\n\npetitioner's  motion  without   benefit  of  an   evidentiary\n\nhearing.    Nothing would  have  been  added  to the  court's\n\nunderstanding of the  issue by holding a  hearing, especially\n\nwhen the same  court that denied the    2255 motion heard the\n\nrelevant evidence at sentencing.\n\n          Even were we to accept petitioner's contention that\n\ncounsel's advice was unreasonable, we  fail to see how he was\n\nprejudiced   by   that  advice.     Petitioner   claims  that\n\n\"[p]rejudice in  the case  at bar  is  readily identified  in\n\nmathematical terms.  The Guideline Range  would have been 51-\n\n63  months had  the defendant  been  given consistent  advice\n\nabout not giving a statement  to the Probation Department and\n\nnot  taking the  witness stand  at the  Fatico hearing.\"   We\n                                              \n\ndisagree.   Petitioner had much  to gain by testifying.   Had\n\nthe  court believed him,  the sentencing guideline  range for\n\nthe  base offense level would  have dropped from 63-78 months\n\nto  2-8  months.   As  the  court  below held,  \"[g]iven  the\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ntremendous  reduction in sentence Petitioner stood to gain by\n\nsuccessfully challenging the  amount of marijuana, the  court\n\ncannot say that  `but for' defense  counsel's lack of  advice\n\nPetitioner  would  have   decided  not  to  testify   at  the\n\npresentence evidentiary hearing.\"   Marino v.  United States,\n                                                            \n\nNo. 92-0503B, Mem. and Order at 6.\n\n          In  sum, petitioner's  allegations,  to the  extent\n\nthey  are factual, \"would  not entitle petitioner  to relief\"\n\nunder  section  2255, Rodriguez-Rodriguez,  929 F.2d  at 749;\n                                         \n\nand, to the extent they are conclusory, need not be credited.\n\nSee id.  at 740-50.   Hence, an  evidentiary hearing  was not\n       \n\nrequired.\n\n                              II\n\n                 Amendment of the Indictment\n                                            \n\n          Count III of Marino's original indictment stated:\n\n             The Grand Jury further charges:\n             That on or about December 19, 1989, in\n          the   District   of  Rhode   Island   and\n          elsewhere, defendant  NICHOLAS R.  MARINO\n          did attempt to possess with the intent to\n          distribute  100 kilograms  or  more of  a\n          mixture   or   substance   containing   a\n          detectable   amount   of   marihuana,   a\n          Schudule [sic] I  Controlled Substance in\n          violation  of  Title  21,  United  States\n          Code,     Sections     841(a)(1)      and\n          (b)(1)(B)(vii).\n             All in  violation of Title  21, United\n          States Code,  Section 846  and Title  18,\n          United States Code, Section 2.\n\nAs part of his plea  agreement with the government, the words\n\n\"100 kilograms or more of\" were deleted  from the indictment,\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nby order of the court, prior to his entry of a plea of guilty\n\nto Count III.   The petitioner, the government  and the court\n\nall agreed  that the  amount  of marijuana  which Marino  had\n\nattempted to  purchase was not  an element of the  crime with\n\nwhich  he  had  been  charged,  but  rather  that  it  was  a\n\nsentencing  issue  to   be  determined  by  the  court  in  a\n\npresentence  evidentiary hearing  prior to  sentencing.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited  States v.

That  provision provides for a  mandatory five-year\n\nminimum  sentence for violations  of   841(a)  involving \"100\n\nkilos  or  more  of  a  mixture  or  substance  containing  a\n\ndetectable   amount   of   marijuana.\"       21   U.S.C.     \n\n841(b)(1)(B)(vii).\n\n          Although  a hypertechnical  reading of  the amended\n\nindictment could therefore lead to the conclusion that Marino\n\ndid, despite his  best efforts, plead guilty to attempting to\n\npossess more than one hundred kilos of  marijuana, we decline\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nto so read  the record.  It  is clear from the  transcript of\n\nthe plea hearing  that Marino did not intend  to plead guilty\n\nto an attempt to possess  with intent to distribute more than\n\none  pound of  marijuana.    It is  likewise  clear that  the\n\ngovernment  was  amenable  to  his  plea  of  guilty   to  an\n\nundetermined quantity  of marijuana,  and that  the issue  of\n\nquantity would be determined by the court  at a presentencing\n\nhearing.   In  the course  of  the plea  colloquy, the  court\n\ndetermined that Marino  understood:  (1) the  maximum penalty\n\nfor the crime with which he was charged; (2) that the penalty\n\nwould depend upon the amount  of marijuana that he had sought\n\nto purchase;  and, (3) that  the court  would determine  that\n\namount.\n\n          Marino now claims that the court order deleting the\n\nphrase  \"100 kilograms  or more  of\"  from Count  III of  the\n\nindictment was an  improper amendment of the  indictment, and\n\nthat, as a result, the  court was divested of jurisdiction in\n\nthe  case.    Marino  concedes  that the  quantity  of  drugs\n\ninvolved is  not an  element of an  offense charged  under 21\n\nU.S.C.   841(a).   He claims, however, that  the quantity did\n\nnot constitute mere  surplusage in the indictment  because it\n\n\"notifies the accused of the exact nature of the charge,\" and\n\nbecause \"it alerts the defendant to the applicability  of the\n\npenalty enhancement provision.\"\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          Petitioner's  claims are  without merit.   As  this\n\ncourt recapitulated in United States v. Angiulo,\n                                               \n\n             \"An  indictment  may  not  be  amended\n          except by resubmission to the grand jury,\n          unless the  change is merely  a matter of\n          form,\" but withdrawal of a portion of the\n          indictment  that  the evidence  does  not\n          support   is    not   an    impermissible\n          amendment, \"provided  nothing is  thereby\n          added  to the  indictment,  and that  the\n          remaining allegations charge an offense.\"\n\n 847  F.2d 956,  964  (1st Cir.)  (quoting  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nWinter,  663 F.2d  1120,  1139-40  (1st  Cir.  1981)),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 488 U.S. 928 (1988).  In this case, nothing was added\n      \n\nto the  indictment by  the removal of  the reference  to \"100\n\nkilos  or more of\"  marijuana, and the  remaining allegations\n\ncharged an  offense.  Indeed,  they charged the  offense with\n\nwhich  Marino had originally  been charged:   possession with\n\nintent to distribute marijuana.   Section 841(a) criminalizes\n\nthe possession with the intent to distribute  any quantity of\n                                                 \n\nmarijuana.  The quantity of  drugs involved is not an element\n\nof the crime; rather  it is an issue to be  determined by the\n\njudge at the time of sentencing.  See Barnes, 890 F.2d at 551\n                                            \n\nn.6.\n\n          Marino's  contention  that  vital  information  was\n\ndeleted  from the  indictment is  rebutted by  the fact  that\n\nCount III of the indictment, as amended, retained a reference\n\nto 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B)(vii), thereby putting  Marino on\n\nnotice  as to  the potential  applicability  of the  enhanced\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\npenalty provision.  Furthermore, the fact that the government\n\nhad  included the  \"100 kilograms  or more\"  language in  the\n\noriginal  indictment, along with  the plea colloquy,  made it\n\nclear to defendant that the government would contest Marino's\n\n\"one pound\"  story at the time  of sentencing.  It  cannot be\n\nsaid that the  amendment to the indictment resulted in unfair\n\nprejudice or surprise to Marino.  He requested the amendment,\n\nand demonstrated  an understanding  of the  implications that\n\namendment  would  have  for  the  sentencing  process.    The\n\namendment to the indictment was proper and did not divest the\n\ndistrict court of jurisdiction.\n\n                             III\n\n                          Conclusion\n                                    \n\n          Finding  no error in  the judgment of  the district\n\ncourt, the judgment is therefore summarily affirmed.

Petitioner Marino  was indicted  for\n                     \n\nconspiracy  to  distribute  and  possession  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute  1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1),  (b)(1)(A)(vii) and 846 (Count I),\n\nand  attempting  to  possess with  intent  to  distribute one\n\nhundred kilograms  or more  of marijuana  in violation of  21\n\nU.S.C.    841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(vii) and 846, and  18 U.S.C.  \n\n2  (Count III).   Marino  entered a  plea agreement  with the\n\ngovernment pursuant to  which he pled guilty to  Count III of\n\nthe indictment which  had been amended to delete  a reference\n\nto  the specific  quantity of  marijuana involved.   For  its\n\npart, the government agreed to dismiss Count I and  recommend\n\nthe  minimum sentence  under  Count  III  at  the  sentencing\n\nhearing.  Marino was sentenced to an eighty-two month term of\n\nincarceration, which sentence  was upheld on appeal.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

Specifically, he contends that, because no rational\n\nexplanation  was provided  to  explain  his  trial  counsel's\n\n\"paradoxical\"  advice,   the  court   should  have   held  an\n\nevidentiary hearing.  The  advice to which Marino refers  was\n\nthe following:  Counsel advised Marino against going to trial\n\nbecause the jury would not believe his story that he was only\n\ninterested   in   purchasing   one   pound   of   marijuana.1\n\nSubsequently,  counsel advised  Marino to give  his one-pound\n\npurchase  claim to  the Probation  Department  in a  prepared\n\nstatement, and  to repeat it  under oath  at the  presentence\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n          Marino followed counsel's advice.   The trial judge\n\ndid not believe Marino's story, and found instead that Marino\n\n          was  involved  in   a  transaction  which\n          involved  more than  100  kilograms of  a\n\n                    \n\n1.   In a letter to petitioner, counsel stated:\n          It is obvious to me  that you will not be\n          able to testify.   In the event  you wish\n          to do so, however, that option  is yours.\n          It is my strong feeling that in the event\n          you do  testify, you would  hurt yourself\n          more than help,  and that the  government\n          could,    quite    easily,    prove   the\n          allegations necessary  to convict  you in\n          Count No.  III, based  on your own  prior\n          statement and the testimony of the  other\n          defendants.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          substance containing a  detectable amount\n          of marijuana, that  is, 500 pounds,  that\n          the   deal   was,   and   as   the   tape\n          demonstrated,  it  was  going to  be  500\n          pounds  at a time or maybe 1000 pounds at\n          a  time  until  we got  to  the  ultimate\n          amount.    So  that  I'm  satisfied  with\n          respect to the third count that there was\n          more than 100  kilos that Mr.  Marino was\n          involved with.\n\nThat finding was upheld by this court on appeal.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563220\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Marino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/563220/united-states-v-nicholas-r-marino-united-states-of-america-v-peter-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">27-29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

As the court below held,\n\n          [I]n  making   decisions  regarding   the\n          propriety of having Petitioner testify at\n          a trial and at  a presentence evidentiary\n          hearing, defense counsel  had to evaluate\n          two very distinct  sets of circumstances.\n          In  deciding that  Petitioner should  not\n          testify at trial, defense counsel had  to\n          take into account the considerable wealth\n          of  government  evidence.  .  .  .     In\n          deciding to permit  Petitioner to testify\n          at his  presentence evidentiary  hearing,\n          however, defense counsel  was required to\n          view the government's evidence in a  much\n          different light.  Although the government\n          possessed   an   abundance   of  evidence\n          linking   Petitioner   with    the   drug\n          transaction  generally, the  government's\n          evidence concerning  the specific  amount\n          involved  in  the  transaction  was  less\n          persuasive.  See United States v. Marino,\n                                                  \n          936 F.2d at 28[-29].  Given  the strength\n          of the  government's evidence  connecting\n          Petitioner  with some  sort of  marijuana\n          purchase  and  the   ambiguities  in  the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          government's   evidence  concerning   the\n          amount of  marijuana, it  cannot be  said\n          that defense counsel's  advice concerning\n          either  matter  fell below  an  objective\n          standard of reasonableness.\n\nMarino v.  United States, No.  92-0503B, Mem. and Order  at 4\n                        \n\n(D.  R.I. February 23, 1993).  Petitioner erroneously assumes\n\nthat  giving different  advice with  respect to  an  issue at\n\ndifferent stages  of a  prosecution is  per se  unreasonable.\n                                              \n\nThe district  court acted  within its  discretion in  denying\n\npetitioner's  motion  without   benefit  of  an   evidentiary\n\nhearing.    Nothing would  have  been  added  to the  court's\n\nunderstanding of the  issue by holding a  hearing, especially\n\nwhen the same  court that denied the    2255 motion heard the\n\nrelevant evidence at sentencing.\n\n          Even were we to accept petitioner's contention that\n\ncounsel's advice was unreasonable, we  fail to see how he was\n\nprejudiced   by   that  advice.     Petitioner   claims  that\n\n\"[p]rejudice in  the case  at bar  is  readily identified  in\n\nmathematical terms.  The Guideline Range  would have been 51-\n\n63  months had  the defendant  been  given consistent  advice\n\nabout not giving a statement  to the Probation Department and\n\nnot  taking the  witness stand  at the  Fatico hearing.\"   We\n                                              \n\ndisagree.   Petitioner had much  to gain by testifying.   Had\n\nthe  court believed him,  the sentencing guideline  range for\n\nthe  base offense level would  have dropped from 63-78 months\n\nto  2-8  months.

That  provision provides for a  mandatory five-year\n\nminimum  sentence for violations  of   841(a)  involving \"100\n\nkilos  or  more  of  a  mixture  or  substance  containing  a\n\ndetectable   amount   of   marijuana.\"       21   U.S.C.     \n\n841(b)(1)(B)(vii).\n\n          Although  a hypertechnical  reading of  the amended\n\nindictment could therefore lead to the conclusion that Marino\n\ndid, despite his  best efforts, plead guilty to attempting to\n\npossess more than one hundred kilos of  marijuana, we decline\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nto so read  the record.  It  is clear from the  transcript of\n\nthe plea hearing  that Marino did not intend  to plead guilty\n\nto an attempt to possess  with intent to distribute more than\n\none  pound of  marijuana.    It is  likewise  clear that  the\n\ngovernment  was  amenable  to  his  plea  of  guilty   to  an\n\nundetermined quantity  of marijuana,  and that  the issue  of\n\nquantity would be determined by the court  at a presentencing\n\nhearing.   In  the course  of  the plea  colloquy, the  court\n\ndetermined that Marino  understood:  (1) the  maximum penalty\n\nfor the crime with which he was charged; (2) that the penalty\n\nwould depend upon the amount  of marijuana that he had sought\n\nto purchase;  and, (3) that  the court  would determine  that\n\namount.\n\n          Marino now claims that the court order deleting the\n\nphrase  \"100 kilograms  or more  of\"  from Count  III of  the\n\nindictment was an  improper amendment of the  indictment, and\n\nthat, as a result, the  court was divested of jurisdiction in\n\nthe  case.    Marino  concedes  that the  quantity  of  drugs\n\ninvolved is  not an  element of an  offense charged  under 21\n\nU.S.C.   841(a).   He claims, however, that  the quantity did\n\nnot constitute mere  surplusage in the indictment  because it\n\n\"notifies the accused of the exact nature of the charge,\" and\n\nbecause \"it alerts the defendant to the applicability  of the\n\npenalty enhancement provision.\"\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          Petitioner's  claims are  without merit.

Indeed,  they charged the  offense with\n\nwhich  Marino had originally  been charged:   possession with\n\nintent to distribute marijuana.   Section 841(a) criminalizes\n\nthe possession with the intent to distribute  any quantity of\n                                                 \n\nmarijuana.

Furthermore, the fact that the government\n\nhad  included the  \"100 kilograms  or more\"  language in  the\n\noriginal  indictment, along with  the plea colloquy,  made it\n\nclear to defendant that the government would contest Marino's\n\n\"one pound\"  story at the time  of sentencing.
