In  order to  overcome\n\nsuch a  defense, plaintiff  bore the burden  of demonstrating\n\nthat the law regarding a prison disciplinary board's reliance\n\non information  from  a confidential  informant was  \"clearly\n\nestablished\"  by May 1991.   See, e.g., Horta  v. Sullivan, 4\r                                                                      \n\nF.3d  2,  13 (1st  Cir. 1993).   Yet  the  sole law  to which\n\nplaintiff has  referred in this  regard is that  contained in\n\nthe so-called  \"Morris Rules\"--a set of  procedures governing\n\nprison  administration first  adopted in  1972 as  part of  a\n\nconsent  decree and  later  promulgated as  state law.   See,\r                                                                        \n\ne.g.,  Rodi v.

Travisono, 509 F.2d 1358, 1362 (1st Cir.\r                                          \n\n1975) (noting  that Morris  Rules  embody both  \"what is  ...\n\nconstitutionally  necessary and what  is not\");  Nicholson v.\r                                                                      \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.

Scherer,  468 U.S.\r                                                              \n\n183,  194   (1984)   (\"Officials  sued   for   constitutional\n\nviolations  do  not  lose  their  qualified  immunity  merely\n\nbecause    their   conduct   violates   some   statutory   or\n\nadministrative     provision.\")      (footnote     omitted).2\n\nPlaintiff's reliance on the Morris Rules provides no guidance\n\nas to what  is independently  required in this  context as  a\n\nmatter  of federal due process.  See generally, e.g., Russell\r                                                                         \n\nv.

Inasmuch as neither side has addressed the\n\ncontours  of  the constitutional  right  at  stake, we  shall\n\nlikewise decline to  do so.  See, e.g.,  Wilson v. Brown, 889\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  1195,  1196 n.3  (1st  Cir. 1989)  (plaintiff's  pro se\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  In turn, to the extent plaintiff's argument  rests on our\nholding in  Rodi that the Morris Rules  \"imbue prison inmates\r                            \nwith a  liberty interest in  remaining in the  general prison\npopulation,\"  941 F.2d at 23,  it suffices to  note that such\nopinion was issued after  the events in question here.   See,\r                                                                        \ne.g.,  id. at  30-31 (finding  such result  not to  have been\r                      \nclearly  established prior  thereto); Morgan  v. Ellerthorpe,\r                                                                        \n785 F.

We are  unable to address this contention\n\ninasmuch as  the regulations are not  in the record--although\n\nwe note  that similar arguments  have been unavailing  in the\n\npast.  See,  e.g., Cugini  v. Ventetuolo, 781  F. Supp.  107,\r                                                    \n\n112-13  (D.R.I.),  aff'd,  966  F.2d  1440  (1st  Cir.  1992)\r                                    \n\n(table); State  v.

See\r                                                                         \n\nMorris v.  Travisono,  499 F.

Although  the  magistrate-judge   recommended  that   the\nclassification   board  be  directed  to  review  plaintiff's\nstatus, the district court declined to adopt this measure.\n\n4.  Moreover, if plaintiff currently resides in \"B\" status (a\nmatter unclear  from the  record), his  classification status\nwould  have to  be reviewed  \"at least\" every  90 days.   See\r                                                                         \nMorris, 499 F.

Any grievances plaintiff might harbor\n\nregarding  his  entitlement   to  work  release   status  are\n\ncollateral to  the instant proceeding and  can, if necessary,\n\nbe pursued separately.\n\n     We have  reviewed plaintiff's remaining claims  and find\n\nthem without merit.5\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  Plaintiff  is correct that  defendant Saccoccia's failure\nto interview  witnesses was cited in  the complaint (contrary\nto the finding  made below).   Yet such  failure was  clearly\nharmless  in light  of the  magistrate's findings  as to  the\nanticipated   testimony  of  such   individuals.    In  turn,\nplaintiff's  claim  for  loss   of  \"potential  earnings\"  is\nsubsumed  within his claim for  damages, and so  is barred on\nqualified immunity grounds.  \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

In order to overcome such a defense, plaintiff bore the burden of demonstrating that the law regarding a prison disciplinary board's reliance on information from a confidential informant was \"clearly established\" by May 1991.  See, e.g., Horta v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629115\"><a href=\"/opinion/629115/debra-horta-v-charles-b-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1993).  Yet the sole law to which plaintiff has referred in this regard is that contained in the so-called \"Morris Rules\"-a set of procedures governing prison administration first adopted in 1972 as part of a consent decree and later promulgated as state law.  See, e.g., Rodi v. Ventetuolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566305\"><a href=\"/opinion/566305/stephen-gerard-rodi-v-donald-r-ventetuolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 23, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Morris Rules were designed to implement various constitutional protections, not every violation of those rules results in a claim of constitutional dimension.  See, e.g., Morris v. Travisono, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324798\"><a href=\"/opinion/324798/joseph-morris-v-anthony-travisono/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1358</span></a></span>, 1362 (1st Cir. 1975) (noting that Morris Rules embody both \"what is ... constitutionally necessary and what is not\");  Nicholson v. Moran, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></span>, 697 n.18 (D.R.I. 1993);  see also DesRosiers v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572165\"><a href=\"/opinion/572165/steven-m-desrosiers-v-john-j-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Not every breach of [the Morris Rules] will give rise to an Eighth Amendment claim.\");  cf. Davis v. Scherer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111241\"><a href=\"/opinion/111241/davis-v-scherer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 194 (1984) (\"Officials sued for constitutional violations do not lose their qualified immunity merely because their conduct violates some statutory or administrative provision.\")  (footnote omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Plaintiff's reliance on the Morris Rules provides no guidance as to what is independently required in this context as a matter of federal due process.  See generally, e.g., Russell v. Scully, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></span>, 223-24 (2d Cir. 1993) (on petition for rehearing);  Taylor v. Wallace, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559974\"><a href=\"/opinion/559974/albert-e-taylor-v-james-wallace-david-miller-dolores-ramsey/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701-02 (10th Cir. 1991) (reviewing cases); Baker v. Lyles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542870\"><a href=\"/opinion/542870/russell-c-baker-v-howard-n-lyles-warden-lawrence-carpenter-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span>, 931-33 (4th Cir. 1990);  Langton v. Berman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398207\"><a href=\"/opinion/398207/william-langton-v-louis-berman/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 235 (1st Cir. 1981).  Inasmuch as neither side has addressed the contours of the constitutional right at stake, we shall likewise decline to do so.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532520\"><a href=\"/opinion/532520/robert-s-wilson-v-john-brown-warden-aci/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span>, 1196 n.3 (1st Cir. 1989) (plaintiff's pro se status \"does not make us more inclined to interpret damage pleas further than their plain language permits\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff also challenges the district court's refusal to order that he be reclassified to minimum security/work release status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  His sole argument in this regard is that the applicable regulations endow him with an enforceable liberty interest.  We are unable to address this contention inasmuch as the regulations are not in the record-although we note that similar arguments have been unavailing in the past.  See, e.g., Cugini v. Ventetuolo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span>, 112-13 (D.R.I.), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584624\"><a href=\"/opinion/584624/whorf-karl-j-v-commissioner-department-of-corrections-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1440</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1992) (table);  State v. Pari, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></span>, 137-38 (R.I. 1989).  Nor need we decide whether the court abused its discretion in declining to direct reconsideration of plaintiff's classification status purely as a remedial measure, inasmuch as the Morris Rules themselves contemplate such relief.  See Morris v. Travisono, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871633/morris-v-travisono/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 162 (D.R.I. 1980) (directing reclassification meeting to be held \"whenever a major change in an inmate's program appears indicated\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The expungement of the disciplinary violation from plaintiff's record-which violation led to his reclassification in the first place-would obviously fall within this category.  Any grievances plaintiff might harbor regarding his entitlement to work release status are collateral to the instant proceeding and can, if necessary, be pursued separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed plaintiff's remaining claims and find them without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The current version of the rules is reproduced in Morris v.

In turn, plaintiff's claim for loss of \"potential earnings\" is subsumed within his claim for damages, and so is barred on qualified immunity grounds</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
