On April 26, 1993, while a prisoner in\n                    \n\nthe  Northeastern  Correctional  Center  (NCC),  in  Concord,\n\nMassachusetts,  Nazzaro  Scarpa  filed,  pro  se,  a lawsuit,\n\npursuant  to 42 U.S.C.    1983, against Larry  E. Dubois, the\n\nCommissioner of Correction.   Scarpa sued Dubois,  not in his\n\nofficial capacity,  but in  his individual capacity.   Scarpa\n\nalleged  that (a)  his cell  contained exposed  asbestos pipe\n\ninsulation; (b)  Dubois knew that the  insulation was ripped,\n\nbut  did nothing  to protect  Scarpa from this  exposure; (c)\n\nasbestos was blown about when his window was open; (d) Scarpa\n\nwashed white  powdery asbestos  from his face  every morning;\n\n(e)  he coughed and choked from  the asbestos; and (f) he had\n\nbeen  seen  by a  doctor,  who prescribed  medication  for an\n\ninflamed throat and  ordered a chest x-ray.1   Scarpa alleged\n\na  violation of the Eighth Amendment  (made applicable to the\n\nstates  via  the  Fourteenth  Amendment)  and requested  five\n\nmillion dollars in damages.\n\n     Scarpa  attached to  his    1983 complaint  a copy  of a\n\nletter, dated December 1992, from Howard S. Wensley, Director\n\nof  the  Division  of   Community  Sanitation  of  the  state\n\nDepartment of Public Health.  The letter was not addressed to\n\ndefendant Dubois.   Rather, it was addressed  to Jake Gadsen,\n\n                    \n\n1.  Scarpa   attached  to   his  complaint   a  label   to  a\nprescription for  tetracycline.   The label references  a Dr.\nO'Dwyer.    We  presume,  therefore, that  Dr.  O'Dwyer  also\nordered the x-ray.\n\n                             -2-\n\nAdministrator of NCC.   Defendant Dubois  was \"cc-ed\" on  the\n\nletter, as were seven governmental officials and agencies.\n\n     The  letter  recited  that  NCC had  been  inspected  on\n\nNovember 24, 1992, in accordance with public health laws  and\n\nregulations.  A 12-page \"Report of Condition\" was attached to\n\nthe letter.  The  report listed cells and other areas  of NCC\n\nwhere the inspectors had found public health code violations.\n\nThe violations  listed in  the report included,  for example,\n\nbroken window crank mechanisms,  cracked windows, lack of hot\n\nwater in a  bathroom sink,  a badly  pitted floor,  cigarette\n\nbutts on  floor, and a chipped toilet bowl.  It cited Cell 36\n\nas  having  \"asbestos pipe  insulation  ripped.\"   The  cover\n\nletter from Director Wensley  to Administrator Gadsen did not\n\ndiscuss  the  existence  of  asbestos.    It  did  state  the\n\nfollowing:\n\n               The inspection revealed the need for\n          extensive window work.   Problems include\n          broken  window crank  mechanisms, windows\n          that  won't  close  tightly, and  cracked\n          windows.  It was also noted that there is\n          water leaking through the walls  into the\n          electrical room.\n\n               In  accordance with  Section 451.404\n          of  the previously  mentioned regulations\n          please indicate next to each entry on the\n          enclosed  Report of Condition,  a plan of\n          correction.    Said  plan  of  correction\n          should  detail  the  specific steps  that\n          will  be  taken  and  the  date by  which\n          compliance should be expected.\n\n     In July 1993, Scarpa  moved to add Clare Friel,  a nurse\n\nat  NCC, and Scott McKenna, the Director of Treatment at NCC,\n\n                             -3-\n\nas additional defendants.   Simultaneously, Scarpa moved  for\n\nsummary judgment.  In addition to reiterating the allegations\n\nof his  complaint, Scarpa  alleged that he  submitted several\n\nrequests for  medical treatment, but had  \"never been called\"\n\nby Friel  and that she refused to send him for the ordered x-\n\nray.   He further alleged  that he had  received a memorandum\n\nfrom McKenna, which told  him to submit a grievance.   Scarpa\n\nstated  that he  had  done so,  but  that the  grievance  was\n\n\"disregarded\"  (not, we note, that he got no response) and he\n\nwas denied the requested treatment.\n\n     On August 10, 1993,  the district court granted Scarpa's\n\nmotion to add  Friel and  McKenna as defendants.   That  same\n\nday, the  court denied Scarpa's request  for summary judgment\n\nand  ordered   judgment  for  the  defendants,   sua  sponte.\n\nJudgment entered on August 23 and Scarpa has appealed.\n\n     We affirm.  To  succeed on a claim alleging  a violation\n\nof the Eighth Amendment, Scarpa  must show both an  objective\n\ncomponent (was the  deprivation sufficiently serious?)  and a\n\nsubjective  component   (did  the   official/s  act  with   a\n\nsufficiently culpable state of mind?).  Wilson v. Seiter, 501\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  294, 298 (1991); DesRosiers  v. Moran, 949  F.2d 15, 18\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir.  1991); Sires v. Berman,  834 F.2d 9, 12  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1987).    In  other  words, Scarpa  must  show  a  deliberate\n\nindifference to  a serious medical  need.  Wilson  v. Seiter,\n                                                            \n\n                             -4-\n\n501 U.S.  at 303; see  also Hudson v.  McMillian, 112  S. Ct.\n                                                \n\n995, 1000 (1992).2\n\n     At  best, Scarpa's  complaint  alleges only  that Dubois\n\nknew that the  piping insulation  in Cell 36  was ripped  and\n\nthat he did nothing in response.   Scarpa asks that we  infer\n\nDubois'  knowledge  from  the  fact  that  Dubois  apparently\n\nreceived  a  copy of  Director  Wensley's  letter and  report\n\ndirected  to Administrator  Gadsen.   That  report noted  the\n\nripped  insulation  in  Cell  36  among  a  12-page  list  of\n\nviolations.  That particular violation was not singled out by\n\nDirector  Wensley  in  any  manner, as  contrasted  with  the\n\nhighlighting of the  need for extensive window  repair and of\n\nleaking  water in the electrical room.  Scarpa thus asks that\n\nwe  infer  Dubois'  knowledge  from  a  report,  directed  to\n\nanother's  attention,  in  which  the   reference  to  ripped\n\nasbestos  pipe insulation in Cell  36 was subsumed among more\n\nthan 100 other notations of violations.3\n\n                    \n\n2.  We  construe  Scarpa's  complaint  as  complaining  about\nDubois'  failure to remove him  from Cell 36  and Friel's and\nMcKenna's  conduct in  treating his  medical condition.   The\nstandard remains  the same.   \"Whether one  characterizes the\ntreatment  received by [the  prisoner] as inhumane conditions\nof  confinement, failure to attend to his medical needs, or a\ncombination  of   both,  it  is  appropriate   to  apply  the\n'deliberate indifference' standard articulated in Estelle [v.\n                                                         \nGamble, 429  U.S. 97 (1976)].\"  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. at\n                                                \n303 (citation omitted).\n\n3.  There is no evidence that exposed asbestos was rampant in\nNCC.   Cell  36  was  the  only cell  in  which  ripped  pipe\ninsulation  was  noted.    Apart  from  it,  the  only  other\nreference to  asbestos in  Director Wensley's report  was the\n\n                             -5-\n\n     Even if we were  to grant that Dubois' knowledge  of the\n\nexistence  of ripped asbestos pipe insulation in Cell 36 is a\n\nreasonable inference, the mere  presence of asbestos does not\n\nviolate  the Eighth Amendment.  See, e.g., McNeil v. Lane, 16\n                                                         \n\nF.3d  123,  124-25 (7th  Cir.  1994)  (the mere  presence  of\n\nasbestos-covered   pipes  does   not  constitute   an  Eighth\n\nAmendment violation); Diaz  v. Edgar, 831  F. Supp. 621,  624\n                                    \n\n(N.D.  Ill. 1993) (same).  Scarpa failed to allege, much less\n\nshow, that Dubois knew of the dispersal of asbestos powder in\n\nCell  364 and  Scarpa's  medical complaints  and, thus,  that\n\nDubois  acted (or  his  failure to  act  was joined)  with  a\n\nsufficiently  culpable  state  of mind.    Scarpa, therefore,\n\nfailed to show deliberate indifference on Dubois' part.\n\n          In   order    to   establish   deliberate\n          indifference, the  complainant must prove\n          that the defendants  had a culpable state\n          of mind and intended wantonly  to inflict\n          pain.  The requisite state of mind may be\n          manifested by the officials'  response to\n          an inmate's  known  needs or  by  denial,\n                            \n          delay,  or  interference with  prescribed\n          health care.  While this mental state can\n          aptly be described as  \"recklessness,\" it\n          is recklessness not in the tort-law sense\n          but in the appreciably stricter criminal-\n\n                    \n\nnotation that \"friable asbestos pipe insulation\" was found in\nthe \"old boiler room\" in the basement.\n\n4.  Even granting that Director Wensley's Report of Condition\nsufficed to  give notice  to Dubois  of ripped  asbestos pipe\ninsulation in Cell 36,  that report did not  describe friable\nasbestos in  Cell 36.   Contrast the report's  description of\n\"friable asbestos  pipe insulation\"  found in the  old boiler\nroom in the basement.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          law sense, requiring actual  knowledge of\n                                     \n          impending harm, easily preventable.\n\nDesRosiers  v.  Moran, 949  F.2d  at  19 (citations  omitted)\n                     \n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     As for  defendants Friel and McKenna,  all that Scarpa's\n\nallegations  amount to is a  claim that (a)  Friel refused to\n\nsend  him for an ordered x-ray; (b) McKenna instructed him to\n\nfile a grievance; and (c) Scarpa did, but he was unhappy with\n\nthe results of that  process.5  Summary judgment in  favor of\n\nMcKenna was clearly appropriate.   McKenna informed Scarpa of\n\na  procedure by  which to  get  relief.   It  is perverse  to\n\nsuggest  that  such   conduct  could  amount  to   deliberate\n\nindifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n     And, in  the circumstances of this  case, even accepting\n\nas true for purposes  of summary judgment, the  allegation as\n\nto  Friel's  conduct, we  do not  believe  that it  meets the\n\nthreshold for  deliberate indifference  to a  serious medical\n\nneed.    Scarpa  got  some  treatment,  i.e,  the  prescribed\n\nmedication,  for  his   medical  complaints.    Although   he\n\napparently failed to receive additional ordered treatment, he\n\nwas directed to  file, and did  file, a grievance.   That the\n\ngrievance process did not  produce a renewed order for  an x-\n\n                    \n\n5.  As pointed out, supra, at 4,  Scarpa does not say that he\n                         \ngot  no response to the grievance; rather, he claims that, in\nresponse, he was denied the requested medical treatment.   In\nany event,  he does  not claim that  McKenna disregarded  the\n                                            \ngrievance.\n\n                             -7-\n\nray  suggests  to  us that  the  prescribing  doctor did  not\n\nconsider the need for an x-ray to  be a grave one.  Cf. Sires\n                                                             \n\nv.  Berman, 834 F.2d at  13 (\"Where the  dispute concerns not\n          \n\nthe absence of  help, but the  choice of a certain  course of\n\ntreatment, or  evidences  mere disagreement  with  considered\n\nmedical judgment, we will not second guess the doctors.\").\n\n     Moreover, the  purpose of  an x-ray is  not preventative\n\ntreatment, but to show a presently-existing injury.   Harm to\n\nScarpa exists  from the failure  to provide the  x-ray during\n\nhis  period of incarceration only if it resulted in a delayed\n\ndiagnosis  of injury.  We note that, subsequent to the filing\n\nof this lawsuit,  but prior  to the filing  of his  appellate\n\nbrief, Scarpa  was released from prison.   He, therefore, has\n\nhad  the opportunity to obtain  an x-ray, if  he continued to\n\nbelieve his medical condition warranted one, and to point out\n\nwhat,  if anything, of significance  was revealed by a later-\n\nobtained x-ray that would have also shown up in an earlier x-\n\nray  that was refused him.  He has  not done so.  Indeed, his\n\nbrief on appeal does  not address, with any  specificity, the\n\nalleged  failure  to provide  an  x-ray.    That omission  is\n\ntelling.   See Ryan v. Royal  Ins. Co. of Am.,  916 F.2d 731,\n                                             \n\n734  (1st Cir.  1990) (\"It  is settled  in this  circuit that\n\nissues  adverted  to  on  appeal  in  a  perfunctory  manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed  to\n\nhave been abandoned.\").\n\n                             -8-\n\n     For  the foregoing  reasons, we  affirm the  judgment in\n                                            \n\nfavor of the defendants.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                             -9-\n",

That same day, the court denied Scarpa's request for summary judgment and ordered judgment for the defendants, sua sponte.  Judgment entered on August 23 and Scarpa has appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm.  To succeed on a claim alleging a violation of the Eighth Amendment, Scarpa must show both an objective component (was the deprivation sufficiently serious?) and a subjective component (did the official/s act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind?).   Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991);   DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1991);   Sires v. Berman, 834 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1987).  In other words, Scarpa must show a deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.   Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. at 303;   see also Hudson v. McMillian, 112 S. Ct. 995, 1000 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At best, Scarpa's complaint alleges only that Dubois knew that the piping insulation in Cell 36 was ripped and that he did nothing in response.  Scarpa asks that we infer Dubois' knowledge from the fact that Dubois apparently received a copy of Director Wensley's letter and report directed to Administrator Gadsen.  That report noted the ripped insulation in Cell 36 among a 12-page list of violations.  That particular violation was not singled out by Director Wensley in any manner, as contrasted with the highlighting of the need for extensive window repair and of leaking water in the electrical room.  Scarpa thus asks that we infer Dubois' knowledge from a report, directed to another's attention, in which the reference to ripped asbestos pipe insulation in Cell 36 was subsumed among more than 100 other notations of violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to grant that Dubois' knowledge of the existence of ripped asbestos pipe insulation in Cell 36 is a reasonable inference, the mere presence of asbestos does not violate the Eighth Amendment.   See, e.g., McNeil v. Lane, 16 F.3d 123, 124-25 (7th Cir. 1994) (the mere presence of asbestos-covered pipes does not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation);   Diaz v. Edgar, 831 F. Supp. 621, 624 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (same).  Scarpa failed to allege, much less show, that Dubois knew of the dispersal of asbestos powder in Cell 36<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and Scarpa's medical complaints and, thus, that Dubois acted (or his failure to act was joined) with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.  Scarpa, therefore, failed to show deliberate indifference on Dubois' part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>In order to establish deliberate indifference, the complainant must prove that the defendants had a culpable state of mind and intended wantonly to inflict pain.  The requisite state of mind may be manifested by the officials' response to an inmate's known needs or by denial, delay, or interference with prescribed health care.  While this mental state can aptly be described as \"recklessness,\" it is recklessness not in the tort-law sense but in the appreciably stricter criminal- law sense, requiring actual knowledge of impending harm, easily preventable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DesRosiers v.

McKenna informed Scarpa of a procedure by which to get relief.  It is perverse to suggest that such conduct could amount to deliberate indifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, in the circumstances of this case, even accepting as true for purposes of summary judgment, the allegation as to Friel's conduct, we do not believe that it meets the threshold for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.  Scarpa got some treatment, i.e, the prescribed medication, for his medical complaints.  Although he apparently failed to receive additional ordered treatment, he was directed to file, and did file, a grievance.  That the grievance process did not produce a renewed order for an x-ray suggests to us that the prescribing doctor did not consider the need for an x-ray to be a grave one.   Cf. Sires v. Berman, 834 F.2d at 13 (\"Where the dispute concerns not the absence of help, but the choice of a certain course of treatment, or evidences mere disagreement with considered medical judgment, we will not second guess the doctors.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the purpose of an x-ray is not preventative treatment, but to show a presently-existing injury.  Harm to Scarpa exists from the failure to provide the x-ray during his period of incarceration only if it resulted in a delayed diagnosis of injury.  We note that, subsequent to the filing of this lawsuit, but prior to the filing of his appellate brief, Scarpa was released from prison.  He, therefore, has had the opportunity to obtain an x-ray, if he continued to believe his medical condition warranted one, and to point out what, if anything, of significance was revealed by a later-obtained x- ray that would have also shown up in an earlier x-ray that was refused him.  He has not done so.  Indeed, his brief on appeal does not address, with any specificity, the alleged failure to provide an x-ray.  That omission is telling.   See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is settled in this circuit that issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Scarpa attached to his complaint a label to a prescription for tetracycline.

Sec.  1983, against Larry E. Dubois, the Commissioner of Correction.  Scarpa sued Dubois, not in his official capacity, but in his individual capacity.  Scarpa alleged that (a) his cell contained exposed asbestos pipe insulation;  (b) Dubois knew that the insulation was ripped, but did nothing to protect Scarpa from this exposure;  (c) asbestos was blown about when his window was open;  (d) Scarpa washed white powdery asbestos from his face every morning;  (e) he coughed and choked from the asbestos;  and (f) he had been seen by a doctor, who prescribed medication for an inflamed throat and ordered a chest x-ray.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Scarpa alleged a violation of the Eighth Amendment (made applicable to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment) and requested five million dollars in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scarpa attached to his Sec. 1983 complaint a copy of a letter, dated December 1992, from Howard S. Wensley, Director of the Division of Community Sanitation of the state Department of Public Health.  The letter was not addressed to defendant Dubois.  Rather, it was addressed to Jake Gadsen, Administrator of NCC. Defendant Dubois was \"cc-ed\" on the letter, as were seven governmental officials and agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter recited that NCC had been inspected on November 24, 1992, in accordance with public health laws and regulations.  A 12-page \"Report of Condition\" was attached to the letter.  The report listed cells and other areas of NCC where the inspectors had found public health code violations.  The violations listed in the report included, for example, broken window crank mechanisms, cracked windows, lack of hot water in a bathroom sink, a badly pitted floor, cigarette butts on floor, and a chipped toilet bowl.  It cited Cell 36 as having \"asbestos pipe insulation ripped.\"  The cover letter from Director Wensley to Administrator Gadsen did not discuss the existence of asbestos.  It did state the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspection revealed the need for extensive window work.  Problems include broken window crank mechanisms, windows that won't close tightly, and cracked windows.  It was also noted that there is water leaking through the walls into the electrical room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with Section 451.404 of the previously mentioned regulations please indicate next to each entry on the enclosed Report of Condition, a plan of correction.

Simultaneously, Scarpa moved for summary judgment.  In addition to reiterating the allegations of his complaint, Scarpa alleged that he submitted several requests for medical treatment, but had \"never been called\" by Friel and that she refused to send him for the ordered x-ray.  He further alleged that he had received a memorandum from McKenna, which told him to submit a grievance.  Scarpa stated that he had done so, but that the grievance was \"disregarded\" (not, we note, that he got no response) and he was denied the requested treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 10, 1993, the district court granted Scarpa's motion to add Friel and McKenna as defendants.
