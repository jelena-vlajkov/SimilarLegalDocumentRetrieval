Freidel and Kirkpatrick  &amp; Lockhart\n                                                                  \non brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.    Plaintiff appeals a summary judgment\n                    \n\ndismissing his complaint.   He alleges that defendant company\n\nwrongfully terminated  his employment because of  his age (55\n\nyears  old)  in  violation   of  the  Age  Discrimination  in\n\nEmployment  Act, 29 U.S.C.   621 et. seq., and parallel state\n\nlaw.   The district court held that plaintiff failed to offer\n\nminimally sufficient  proof to establish a  prima facie case,\n\nand  to  rebut  defendant's   articulated  non-discriminatory\n\nreason for the employment termination. \n\n          The  undisputed facts  showed  that  plaintiff,  an\n\nexpert  in acoustical  engineering,  was hired  as a  section\n\nmanager in the engineering department of defendant's Undersea\n\nSystems  Division in  1986.   His  employment was  terminated\n\napproximately 4-1/2  years later after business  setbacks led\n\nto  an overall  reduction  in the  department's work  force.1\n\nDefendant alleged that the decision to  terminate plaintiff's\n\nemployment  was  due  to  the  company's  immediate financial\n\nsituation, in that plaintiff's expertise in acoustical theory\n\nwas not as valuable to its scaled-back business objectives as\n\nwere  the  mechanical  skills   of  the  employees  who  were\n\nretained.\n\n                    \n\n1.  There  had  been  an  earlier round  of  layoffs  in  the\nDivision,  which did not  affect the  engineering department.\nIn this  round, eleven  engineering employees were  laid off:\nsix  were older than the age of forty, and five were younger.\nThe Division was later sold to another company.  \n\n                             -2-\n\n          On appeal, plaintiff  assigns four errors.   First,\n\nhe  challenges the district court's finding that he failed to\n\nadduce sufficient  proof that during  the workforce reduction\n\n\"defendant  did  not treat  age  neutrally,  or that  younger\n\nemployees were retained in  the same position.\"  Slip  op. at\n\n4-6 &amp; n.5  (May 31, 1994) (citing  LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCo., 6 F.3d 836,  842 (1st Cir.  1993), cert. denied, 114  S.\n                                                    \n\nCt.  1398 (1994), and Hebert  v. Mohawk Rubber  Co., 872 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1104,  1111 (1st  Cir. 1989)).   Plaintiff now  concedes that\n\nthis  is a correct articulation of a necessary element of his\n\nclaim.  He argues, however, that the court actually applied a\n\ndifferent standard in the following passage, \n\n     The   only   \"fact\"    [plaintiff]   presents    in\n     satisfaction  of the  fourth  element of  his prima\n     facie case is that [co-employee] DeLara assumed the\n     title of \"Acting  Manager\" of the  Department after\n     he was terminated.  DeLara however . . . is  also a\n     member of ADEA's protected class and only two years\n     younger than [plaintiff].\n\n          The  passage clearly consists  of a straightforward\n\nevaluation  of the paucity of plaintiff's proof.  There is no\n\nsupport  for   plaintiff's  attempt   to  twist  it   into  a\n\nmisapplication  of the  law.    We  also  see  no  basis  for\n\nplaintiff's related argument that  the company's retention of\n\na  third  employee,  who  was  younger  than  the  other two,\n\n\"arguably\" satisfied plaintiff's prima facie case because all\n\nthree  employees were  \"theoretically  doing the  same work.\"\n\nWhatever the relevance of this point, it was not specifically\n\n                             -3-\n\nurged  below, and there is no fault in the court's assessment\n\nin light of the proof and arguments presented. \n\n          We  also find  no  merit in  plaintiff's  remaining\n\nassignments  of error.  First, the district court did not err\n\nin rejecting  plaintiff's argument  that \"by seeking  to save\n\nthe equivalent of Plaintiff's high salary, the Defendant  . .\n\n.  did not  treat  age  neutrally.\"    There  were  no  facts\n\nsuggesting that defendant used  plaintiff's salary as a proxy\n\nfor age  discrimination.  Indeed, the  brevity of plaintiff's\n\nemployment  with defendant,  and  the  substantial  disparity\n\nbetween his salary and that of DeLara, who was only two years\n\nyounger, belie  the correlation  which plaintiff urges.   See\n                                                             \n\nHazen Paper Co.  v. Biggins,  113 S. Ct.  1701, 1707  (1993).\n                           \n\nSecond,   the  district   court  did   not  misconstrue   the\n\napplicability  of Hazen,  and  we apprehend  no prejudice  to\n                       \n\nplaintiff in the court's style of editing quotations from the\n\nHazen  opinion.    Finally,  the  court  did  not  abuse  its\n     \n\ndiscretion  in   refusing  to  consider  any   new  facts  in\n\nplaintiff's out-of-time \"supplemental memorandum,\" and in any\n\nevent,  plaintiff points  to  no prejudice  from the  court's\n\nruling.   \n\n          Reviewing the district  court's order de novo,  and\n                                                       \n\nfinding no  substantial  question for  review,  the  judgment\n\nbelow is summarily affirmed.   See Loc. R. 27.1. \n                                  \n\n                             -4-\n",
