The  Federal\r                                                        \r\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") seeks to recover funds\r\n\nunder  several  promissory  notes once  held  by  Girod Trust\r\n\nCompany (\"GTC\"), a  failed Puerto Rico bank.   The defendants\r\n\nare  the debtor, co-debtor, sureties, and guarantors of those\r\n\nnotes.   The  district court  denied  defendants' motion  for\r\n\npartial  summary judgment and  granted the FDIC's  motion for\r\n\nsummary  judgment.  Defendants  now appeal, arguing  that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in  holding that the FDIC's  claims were\r\n\nnot barred by  the statute of limitations.  We affirm in part\r\n\nand reverse in part.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          The facts are  undisputed.  The defendants  in this\r\n\ncase  are: (1) Torrefaccion  Cafe Cialitos (\"TCC\"),  a Puerto\r\n\nRico company that processes and distributes coffee; (2) Pedro\r\n\nMaldonado-Rivera  (referred  to  by  the  district  court  as\r\n\n\"Maldonado I\"),  the president of  TCC; (3) Daisy  Ramirez de\r\n\nArellano  (\"Ramirez\"), Maldonado I's  wife and an  officer of\r\n\nTCC; (4) the legal conjugal partnership formed by Maldonado I\r\n\nand Ramirez;  and  (5)  Pedro  Maldonado-Ramirez  (\"Maldonado\r\n\nII\"), TCC's vice president.  TCC  is the debtor for the  loan\r\n\ntransactions  that are  at  the  center of  this  case.   The\r\n\nremaining  defendants  are  the  co-debtors,  sureties,   and\r\n\nguarantors of those loans.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          In  this  suit,  the  FDIC  seeks  to  collect  the\r\n\nprincipal  and interest  due from  the  following three  loan\r\n\ntransactions:\r\n\n          1.   1977  Loan Transaction  ---  On May  27, 1977,\r                                                 \r\n\nMaldonado I (personally and as president of TCC)  and Ramirez\r\n\n(personally)  executed a  loan agreement  in  favor of  Banco\r\n\nFinanciero de Ahorro  de Ponce, under which  Banco Financiero\r\n\nagreed to lend TCC $230,000.  To evidence the loan, Maldonado\r\n\nI  (personally  and   as  president  of  TCC)   executed  two\r\n\npromissory notes: Note  I, for $70,000, due on  May 30, 1992,\r\n\nand Note II, for $160,000, due  on May 30, 1984.  To  further\r\n\nsecure  payment of  the loan,  and  any other  TCC debt,  TCC\r\n\nexecuted a  pledge agreement delivering three bearer mortgage\r\n\nnotes and a  chattel mortgage.  Maldonado I  and Ramirez also\r\n\nsigned personal guaranties  for the loan.   The Farmers  Home\r\n\nAdministration  guaranteed 90% of the loan.  GTC subsequently\r\n\nentered into  an agreement to  purchase the remaining  10% of\r\n\nthe loan,  should TCC  default for a  term longer  than three\r\n\nconsecutive months.    TCC defaulted  on  the loan,  and  GTC\r\n\npurchased the loan on January 10, 1979.\r\n\n          2.   1979 Loan  Transaction ---  On March  5, 1979,\r                                                 \r\n\nTCC executed  a loan agreement  in favor of GTC,  under which\r\n\nGTC loaned TCC  $110,000.  To evidence the  loan, Maldonado I\r\n\n(as president  of TCC)  executed two  promissory notes:  Note\r\n\nIII, for $35,000 and Note IV, for $75,000.   Final payment on\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nNote III was due March 5, 1986; final payment for Note IV was\r\n\ndue March 5, 1981.   To secure payment of the loan, Maldonado\r\n\nI  (as  president   of  TCC)  executed  a   pledge  agreement\r\n\ndelivering  one  bearer  mortgage note.    Later,  to further\r\n\nsecure  the loan, Maldonado  (personally and as  president of\r\n\nTCC)  and  Ramirez  (personally)  executed  a  second  pledge\r\n\nagreement delivering another bearer mortgage note.  Maldonado\r\n\nI and Ramirez also signed personal guaranties for the loan.\r\n\n          3.   1981  Line of  Credit ---  On  April 3,  1981,\r                                                \r\n\nMaldonados I and  II (personally, and as TCC's  president and\r\n\nvice president)  executed an open-end  credit agreement  with\r\n\nGTC, under which GTC  extended to TCC a line of  credit of up\r\n\nto $250,000, to  be disbursed as cash advances  or credits to\r\n\nits  checking  account.    Maldonados  I  and  II executed  a\r\n\ncontinuing guaranty without collateral, jointly and severally\r\n\nguaranteeing to the bank the punctual payment of TCC's debts.\r\n\nUnder  the  line  of credit,  sixteen  promissory  notes were\r\n\nexecuted in 1981 and 1982, with payment due throughout 1982.\r\n\n          On July  31, 1984,  TCC  petitioned for  bankruptcy\r\n\nunder  chapter 11.   In  the petition,  GTC was  listed among\r\n\nTCC's  creditors.   On  August  16,  1984, GTC  was  declared\r\n\ninsolvent, and the FDIC was appointed its receiver, acquiring\r\n\nthe assets giving  rise to the claims in this case.  On April\r\n\n11, 1986, the TCC  bankruptcy case was dismissed.  On May 10,\r\n\n1991,  the  FDIC  brought  this  action  to  collect  on  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\npromissory notes  it had  acquired from GTC.   TCC  moved for\r\n\nsummary  judgment,  arguing that  the limitations  period for\r\n\ncollection  on the  promissory notes had  expired.   The FDIC\r\n\nopposed  the motion  and  filed its  own  motion for  summary\r\n\njudgment, which the district court granted.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Under  Puerto  Rico  law,  actions  to  collect  on\r\n\ncommercial  promissory notes  are  subject  to a  limitations\r\n\nperiod of three years from the note's date of maturity.  P.R.\r\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 10,   1908.   The running of this  limitations\r\n\nperiod,  however, is  interrupted \"by  suit  or any  judicial\r\n\nproceeding brought against the debtor,\"  P.R. Laws Ann.  tit.\r\n\n10,    1903, including bankruptcy  proceedings.  See  FDIC v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBarrera, 595 F. Supp. 894,  901 (D. P.R. 1984).  Puerto  Rico\r                   \r\n\nlaw  further provides  that interruption  of the  limitations\r\n\nperiod  \"in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all\r\n\nthe creditors  or debtors,\" P.R.  Laws Ann. tit. 31,    5304,\r\n\nand an interruption \"against the principal debtor by suit for\r\n\ndebt shall also lie against his surety.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\r\n\n31,   5305.  \r\n\n          Federal  law  establishes  an  additional  six-year\r\n\nlimitations period for  suits brought by the  FDIC to collect\r\n\non  assets it  acquires as  receiver  of a  failed bank.   12\r\n\nU.S.C.    1821  (d)(14)(A) (1988  &amp;  Supp. 1995)  (\"FIRREA\").\r\n\nThus, if  the state limitations  period has not yet  run when\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe FDIC steps in, the federal limitations period will apply.\r\n\nThe  period begins  to run  upon appointment  of the  FDIC as\r\n\nreceiver or  accrual of the  action, whichever is later.   12\r\n\nU.S.C.    1821 (d)(14)(B).   The  federal limitations  period\r\n\ndoes not, however, operate to extend claims that have already\r\n\nlapsed under the state limitations period before the FDIC has\r\n\nacquired them.  See, e.g., Barrera, 595 F. Supp. at 898.\r                                              \r\n\n          Applying these various statutory provisions to this\r\n\ncase, the district court  held that the FDIC's  claims, based\r\n\non the three  loan transactions, were all timely  filed.  The\r\n\ncourt found that the three-year  limitations period of   1908\r\n\napplied to  the three loans, commencing on  the maturity date\r\n\nof each  loan: May 30, 1992 for the  1977 loan; March 5, 1986\r\n\nfor  the 1979  loan; throughout  1982  for the  1981 line  of\r\n\ncredit.  In calculating the  maturity dates of the loans, the\r\n\ncourt looked  to the date when  the final payment was  due on\r\n\neach  loan transaction  as  a whole,  not  to the  individual\r\n\nmaturity  dates  of  the underlying  promissory  notes.   For\r\n\nexample, although  Note IV  of the 1979  loan had  a maturity\r\n\ndate of March 5, 1981, the district court considered the note\r\n\npart of  a single loan transaction, with  an overall maturity\r\n\ndate of March 5, 1986.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.   With  respect   to   Note   IV,   the   district   court\r\nalternatively found that, even if the later maturity date did\r\nnot  control and  the claim  based on  Note IV  was therefore\r\nuntimely (since  the  bankruptcy proceeding  began more  than\r\nthree years later), it was  revived through TCC's listing  of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          The court then found that TCC's bankruptcy petition\r\n\nwas  a  \"judicial proceeding\"  under     1903, and  that  the\r\n\nlimitations periods  for the claims against TCC  on all three\r\n\nloans  were tolled as of July 1984.  The court further found,\r\n\npursuant to     5304 and 5305, that the  tolling also applied\r\n\nfor suits against TCC's co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties.\r\n\nFinally,  the court found  that, once the  FDIC was appointed\r\n\nreceiver in  August 1984,  the FIRREA's  six-year limitations\r\n\nperiod came into effect, since the claims had not yet lapsed.\r\n\nUnder  12 U.S.C.   1821, the court held, FIRREA's limitations\r\n\nperiod began to run  in April 1986 at the earliest,  when TCC\r\n\nemerged from bankruptcy  and the FDIC's  claims accrued.   As\r\n\nthe suit  was filed within six years, in  May of 1991, it was\r\n\ntimely.                      III.\r\n\n          On appeal, defendants argue that the district court\r\n\nerred in holding:  (1) that the bankruptcy  proceeding tolled\r\n\nthe running  of the limitations period for claims against the\r\n\nco-debtors, sureties, and guarantors arising from Note II and\r\n\nthe notes  underlying the 1981  line of credit; and  (2) that\r\n\nthe claims  against all  defendants based on  Note IV  of the\r\n\n1979  loan transaction were  timely filed.   Defendants state\r\n\nthat they  do not appeal  from the district  court's decision\r\n\nregarding the claims based on Note  I and Note III.  As  this\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nthe claim in  the bankruptcy filing.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,\r\n 1903.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nis an appeal from a  summary judgment, we review the district\r\n\ncourt's decision de novo.  See Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343,\r                                                          \r\n\n347 (1st Cir. 1993).  Thus, we will affirm a grant of summary\r\n\njudgment if there are no  genuine issues of material fact and\r\n\nthe moving party is entitled to  judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\nFed R. Civ. P. 56(c).\r\n\nA.   Tolling of Limitations Period\r                                              \r\n\n          Defendants   argue   first   that,   although   the\r\n\nbankruptcy proceeding may have tolled  the limitations period\r\n\nfor suits against the debtor TCC, it did not toll the statute\r\n\nof limitations for suits against co-debtors, guarantors,  and\r\n\nsureties as well.  This  is so, defendants argue, because the\r\n\nautomatic  stay  provision  of the  federal  bankruptcy code,\r\n\nfound in 11 U.S.C.   362, preempts    5304 and 5305 of Puerto\r\n\nRico's  commercial code.   Defendants  argue  that, under  11\r\n\nU.S.C.   362,  a bankruptcy  proceeding automatically  stays,\r\n\nand therefore tolls  the statute of limitations  for, actions\r\n\nagainst debtors  but not against  co-debtors, guarantors,  or\r\n\nsureties.  See Austin v. Unarco Indus., Inc., 705 F.2d 1, 4-5\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. dismissed, 463  U.S. 1247 (1983).   To the\r                                        \r\n\nextent they toll the limitations period for suits against co-\r\n\ndebtors, guarantors, and sureties,  defendants argue,    5304\r\n\nand  5305 conflict  with  the bankruptcy  code  and are  thus\r\n\npreempted.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          If      5304  and 5305  are  preempted,  defendants\r\n\nargue, then the  claims against  co-debtors, guarantors,  and\r\n\nsureties  based  on   Note  II2  and  the   promissory  notes\r\n\nunderlying  the 1981  letter  of credit  are  untimely.   For\r\n\nexample, the  promissory notes  underlying the  1981 line  of\r\n\ncredit all had maturity dates in 1982.  The FDIC acquired the\r\n\nnotes  in August of  1984, before the  three-year limitations\r\n\nperiod had  lapsed.  However,  if the limitations  period for\r\n\nsuits against the  co-debtors, guarantors,  and sureties  was\r\n\nnot tolled by  the bankruptcy proceedings, then  the six-year\r\n\nFIRREA  limitations period began  running in August  of 1984,\r\n\nwhen the  FDIC acquired the  assets, not April of  1986, when\r\n\nTCC emerged from  bankruptcy.  As the claims  against the co-\r\n\ndebtors,  guarantors, and sureties  were filed more  than six\r\n\nyears later in 1991, the claims would be untimely.\r\n\n          We  find  defendants'  preemption  argument  to  be\r\n\nwithout merit.  The provisions of the federal bankruptcy code\r\n\npreempt  only  those state  laws  that are  in  conflict with\r\n\nfederal  law.   See Stellwagen  v.

True,    362 automatically  stays only  suits filed\r\n\nagainst  debtors  and  not suits  against  that  debtor's co-\r\n\ndebtors, guarantors, or  sureties.

Although defendants do  not explicitly refer to  Note II\r\nin  their argument, the argument based on the 1981 promissory\r\nnotes  is equally  applicable to  Note II.   We  consider the\r\nargument as applied to Note II,  since the result is, in  any\r\nevent, the same.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nBut this does not indicate  an inconsistency with    5304 and\r\n\n5305.  Nothing in the decisions construing   362 to stay only\r\n\nsuits against  debtors implies  that    362 precludes  states\r                                                                 \r\n\nfrom themselves staying suits against co-debtors, guarantors,\r\n\nand sureties.  These decisions hold  only that   362 does not\r                                                                         \r\n\nitself stay, nor  require the staying of, such  actions.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nAustin, 705 F.2d at 5 (recognizing that circumstances may, in\r                  \r\n\nsome  cases,  warrant  a stay  against  co-debtors  as well).\r\n\nFurthermore,  these  cases deal  with stays,  not limitations\r                                                       \r\n\nperiods; thus,  even if  a creditor may  proceed against  co-\r\n\ndebtors, guarantors,  or sureties  during the  pendency of  a\r\n\nbankruptcy  proceeding, nothing  bars a state  from extending\r\n\nthe  limitations  period  for such  suits  under  state law.3\r                                    \r\n\nPuerto  Rico is still free to  extend the limitations period,\r\n\nunder its own laws, for actions against co-debtors, sureties,\r\n\nand guarantors, as it has done under    5304 and 5305.\r\n\n          There  is no conflict between such an extension and\r\n\nthe purpose  behind    362.  By  staying actions  against the\r\n\ndebtor during bankruptcy,   362  gives the debtor a degree of\r\n\nbreathing  room,  relieving  it  of  financial  pressure  and\r\n\nallowing it to attempt repayment of  its debts or to adopt  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

See  Barrera, 595 F. Supp. at 901;\r                                                   \r\n\nFDIC v. Marco Discount House, 575 F. Supp. 730, 732 (D.  P.R.\r                                        \r\n\n1983).  Accordingly,  the district court correctly  held that\r\n\nthe  FDIC's claims  against the  co-debtors, guarantors,  and\r\n\nsureties  did  not accrue  until  April  of  1986,  when  the\r\n\nbankruptcy case  was  dismissed.   As the  claims were  filed\r\n\nwithin FIRREA's six-year limitations period, they are timely.\r\n\nB.   Note IV\r                        \r\n\n          Defendants  argue  that,  even  if  the  bankruptcy\r\n\nproceeding did  toll the  statute of  limitations for  claims\r\n\nagainst co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties, the claim based\r\n\non Note IV ($75,000) supporting the 1979 loan transaction was\r\n\nnevertheless  untimely.    Defendants  point   out  that  the\r\n\nmaturity  date on  the Note  was March  5, 1981.    Under the\r\n\nthree-year  limitations period, the claim expired on March 5,\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n1984,  several months  before the  bankruptcy proceeding  was\r\n\ninstituted and before the FDIC acquired the note.  Thus, they\r\n\nargue, neither the  tolling provisions under Puerto  Rico law\r\n\nnor the six-year  limitations period under FIRREA  apply, and\r\n\nthe claim is untimely.4  \r\n\n          The FDIC argues that  the district court  correctly\r\n\nfound that Note IV was  not a separate loan, but  merely part\r\n\nof a single, 1979 loan  transaction.  Thus, the maturity date\r\n\nfor the  Note was actually  the maturity date for  the entire\r\n\nloan, March 5, 1986, and not March 5, 1981.  In  reaching its\r\n\nconclusion, the district  court pointed in particular  to the\r\n\nfact that both  Note III and  Note IV were  part of a  single\r\n\nloan agreement,  that there was  only one application  to the\r\n\nFHA for  the loan and  guarantee stating the total  amount of\r\n\n$110,000, and that there was only one guarantee for the total\r\n\namount of the  loan.  The FDIC argues that  defendants do not\r\n\nexpressly contest  this finding on appeal, and that it should\r\n\ntherefore be affirmed.  Since the maturity date was 1986, the\r\n\nlimitations period had not run  by the time the FDIC acquired\r\n\nthe loan.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.   Defendants also argue  that the district court  erred in\r\nconcluding that TCC's  listing of the Note  in its bankruptcy\r\nschedules served to  revive the  claim under  P.R. Laws  Ann.\r\ntit. 10,    1903.   Evidently recognizing  that the  case law\r\nappears to support defendants' argument, see FDIC v. Cardona,\r                                                                        \r\n723  F.2d 132, 137 (1st Cir. 1983), the FDIC does not contest\r\nthis  argument on  appeal, relying  instead  on the  district\r\ncourt's alternate ground for the result.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          While it is true that defendants have not expressly\r\n\ncontested  the district court's conclusion on this ground, we\r\n\nfind  that  the  defendants  have  implicitly  contested  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  finding by consistently  discussing Note IV\r\n\nas a separate claim and by calculating the timeliness of that\r\n\nclaim from Note IV's date of maturity.  We  further hold that\r\n\ndefendants' argument  has merit.   We see no legal  basis for\r\n\ntreating  the  two  promissory notes  as  a  single  loan for\r\n\nstatute of limitations  purposes.  The three-year  statute of\r\n\nlimitations  applies, by its  terms, to commercial promissory\r\n\nnotes.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,   1908, (\"Actions arising\r                       \r\n\nfrom drafts shall extinguish three years after maturity . . .\r                                                                   \r\n\n.  A  similar rule  shall be applied  to commercial bills  of\r\n\nexchange and promissory notes . . . .\" (emphasis added)); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso Barrera, 595 F. Supp.  at 898; Marco Discount House, 575\r                                                                    \r\n\nF. Supp. at 731.  In this case, the 1979 loan transaction was\r\n\nsupported  by two separate promissory notes with two separate\r\n\nmaturity  dates: March  5, 1981 and  March 5, 1986.   Under a\r\n\nstraightforward application  of the statute,  the limitations\r\n\nperiods for  suits based  on the two  Notes began  running at\r\n\ndifferent times.  \r\n\n          We  see no legal  basis for importing  the maturity\r\n\ndate of Note  III into Note IV despite  the separate maturity\r\n\ndate on  the face of  Note IV.  The  fact that the  two notes\r\n\nhappened  to  be  part  of  the  same \"loan  transaction\"  is\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nimmaterial  for statute  of limitations  purposes, since  the\r\n\noperative  legal   documents  were   the  notes   themselves.\r\n\nAccordingly,  the limitations period for claims based on Note\r\n\nIV  expired three  years after  maturity, on  March 5,  1984,\r\n\nbefore it could  be interrupted by the  bankruptcy proceeding\r\n\nand  before the  FDIC acquired  the note.   The  FDIC's claim\r\n\nbased on that note is therefore untimely.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n          We  affirm  the district  court's holding  that the\r\n\nFDIC's claims  on Note  I, Note II,  Note III, and  the notes\r\n\nunderlying  the line  of credit  were all  timely filed,  but\r\n\nreverse the  district court's holding that the  claim on Note\r\n\nIV was  timely filed.  We remand to  the district court for a\r\n\nrecalculation  of  the  judgment  amount  in  light  of  this\r\n\ndecision.\r\n\n          So ordered.

To further secure payment of the loan, and any other TCC debt, TCC executed a pledge agreement delivering three bearer mortgage notes and a chattel mortgage.  Maldonado I and Ramirez also signed personal guaranties for the loan.  The Farmers Home Administration guaranteed 90% of the loan.  GTC subsequently entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 10% of the loan, should TCC default for a term longer than three consecutive months.

Final payment on Note III was due March 5, 1986;  final payment for Note IV was due March 5, 1981.  To secure payment of the loan, Maldonado I (as president of TCC) executed a pledge agreement delivering one bearer mortgage note.  Later, to further secure the loan, Maldonado (personally and as president of TCC) and Ramirez (personally) executed a second pledge agreement delivering another bearer mortgage note.

Maldonados I and II executed a continuing guaranty without collateral, jointly and severally guaranteeing to the bank the punctual payment of TCC's debts.

In the petition, GTC was listed among TCC's creditors.  On August 16, 1984, GTC was declared insolvent, and the FDIC was appointed its receiver, acquiring the assets giving rise to the claims in this case.  On April 11, 1986, the TCC bankruptcy case was dismissed.  On May 10, 1991, the FDIC brought this action to collect on the promissory notes it had acquired from GTC.  TCC moved for summary judgment, arguing that the limitations period for collection on the promissory notes had expired.  The FDIC opposed the motion and filed its own motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, actions to collect on commercial promissory notes are subject to a limitations period of three years from the note's date of maturity.

The running of this limitations period, however, is interrupted \"by suit or any judicial proceeding brought against the debtor,\" P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 1903, including bankruptcy proceedings.  See FDIC v. Barrera, 595 F.Supp. 894, 901 (D.P.R.1984).  Puerto Rico law further provides that interruption of the limitations period \"in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors,\" P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5304, and an interruption \"against the principal debtor by suit for debt shall also lie against his surety.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal law establishes an additional six-year limitations period for suits brought by the FDIC to collect on assets it acquires as receiver of a failed bank.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(14)(A) (1988 &amp; Supp.1995) (\"FIRREA\").  Thus, if the state limitations period has not yet run when the FDIC steps in, the federal limitations period will apply.  The period begins to run upon appointment of the FDIC as receiver or accrual of the action, whichever is later.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(14)(B).  The federal limitations period does not, however, operate to extend claims that have already lapsed under the state limitations period before the FDIC has acquired them.  See, e.g., Barrera, 595 F.Supp. at 898.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these various statutory provisions to this case, the district court held that the FDIC's claims, based on the three loan transactions, were all timely filed.  The court found that the three-year limitations period of Sec. 1908 applied to the three loans, commencing on the maturity date of each loan:  May 30, 1992 for the 1977 loan;  March 5, 1986 for the 1979 loan;  throughout 1982 for the 1981 line of credit.  In calculating the maturity dates of the loans, the court looked to the date when the final payment was due on each loan transaction as a whole, not to the individual maturity dates of the underlying promissory notes.  For example, although Note IV of the 1979 loan had a maturity date of March 5, 1981, the district court considered the note part of a single loan transaction, with an overall maturity date of March 5, 1986.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then found that TCC's bankruptcy petition was a \"judicial proceeding\" under Sec. 1903, and that the limitations periods for the claims against TCC on all three loans were tolled as of July 1984.  The court further found, pursuant to Secs. 5304 and 5305, that the tolling also applied for suits against TCC's co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties.  Finally, the court found that, once the FDIC was appointed receiver in August 1984, the FIRREA's six-year limitations period came into effect, since the claims had not yet lapsed.  Under 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821, the court held, FIRREA's limitations period began to run in April 1986 at the earliest, when TCC emerged from bankruptcy and the FDIC's claims accrued.  As the suit was filed within six years, in May of 1991, it was timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants argue that the district court erred in holding:  (1) that the bankruptcy proceeding tolled the running of the limitations period for claims against the co-debtors, sureties, and guarantors arising from Note II and the notes underlying the 1981 line of credit;  and (2) that the claims against all defendants based on Note IV of the 1979 loan transaction were timely filed.  Defendants state that they do not appeal from the district court's decision regarding the claims based on Note I and Note III.  As this is an appeal from a summary judgment, we review the district court's decision de novo.  See Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir.1993).  Thus, we will affirm a grant of summary judgment if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Tolling of Limitations Period</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue first that, although the bankruptcy proceeding may have tolled the limitations period for suits against the debtor TCC, it did not toll the statute of limitations for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties as well.  This is so, defendants argue, because the automatic stay provision of the federal bankruptcy code, found in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362, preempts Secs. 5304 and 5305 of Puerto Rico's commercial code.  Defendants argue that, under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362, a bankruptcy proceeding automatically stays, and therefore tolls the statute of limitations for, actions against debtors but not against co-debtors, guarantors, or sureties.  See Austin v. Unarco Indus., Inc., 705 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.), cert. dismissed, 463 U.S. 1247, 104 S.Ct. 34, 77 L.Ed.2d 1454 (1983).  To the extent they toll the limitations period for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties, defendants argue, Secs. 5304 and 5305 conflict with the bankruptcy code and are thus preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Secs. 5304 and 5305 are preempted, defendants argue, then the claims against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties based on Note II<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the promissory notes underlying the 1981 letter of credit are untimely.  For example, the promissory notes underlying the 1981 line of credit all had maturity dates in 1982.  The FDIC acquired the notes in August of 1984, before the three-year limitations period had lapsed.  However, if the limitations period for suits against the co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties was not tolled by the bankruptcy proceedings, then the six-year FIRREA limitations period began running in August of 1984, when the FDIC acquired the assets, not April of 1986, when TCC emerged from bankruptcy.  As the claims against the co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties were filed more than six years later in 1991, the claims would be untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find defendants' preemption argument to be without merit.  The provisions of the federal bankruptcy code preempt only those state laws that are in conflict with federal law.  See Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U.S. 605, 613, 38 S.Ct. 215, 217, 62 L.Ed. 507 (1918).  True, Sec. 362 automatically stays only suits filed against debtors and not suits against that debtor's co-debtors, guarantors, or sureties.  Austin, 705 F.2d at 4-5.   But this does not indicate an inconsistency with Secs. 5304 and 5305.  Nothing in the decisions construing Sec. 362 to stay only suits against debtors implies that Sec. 362 precludes states from themselves staying suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties.  These decisions hold only that Sec. 362 does not itself stay, nor require the staying of, such actions.  See Austin, 705 F.2d at 5 (recognizing that circumstances may, in some cases, warrant a stay against co-debtors as well).  Furthermore, these cases deal with stays, not limitations periods;  thus, even if a creditor may proceed against co-debtors, guarantors, or sureties during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding, nothing bars a state from extending the limitations period for such suits under state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Puerto Rico is still free to extend the limitations period, under its own laws, for actions against co-debtors, sureties, and guarantors, as it has done under Secs. 5304 and 5305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no conflict between such an extension and the purpose behind Sec. 362.  By staying actions against the debtor during bankruptcy, Sec. 362 gives the debtor a degree of breathing room, relieving it of financial pressure and allowing it to attempt repayment of its debts or to adopt a reorganization plan.  See S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 54-55 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5840-41.  In tolling the limitations period for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding against the debtor, Secs. 5304 and 5305 do not impinge upon this breathing room or otherwise detract from the protection offered the debtor by Sec. 362.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there is no conflict, Secs. 5304 and 5305 are not preempted and serve to extend the limitations period during bankruptcy proceedings for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties.  See Barrera, 595 F.Supp. at 901;  FDIC v. Marco Discount House, 575 F.Supp. 730, 732 (D.P.R.1983).  Accordingly, the district court correctly held that the FDIC's claims against the co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties did not accrue until April of 1986, when the bankruptcy case was dismissed.  As the claims were filed within FIRREA's six-year limitations period, they are timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Note IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that, even if the bankruptcy proceeding did toll the statute of limitations for claims against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties, the claim based on Note IV ($75,000) supporting the 1979 loan transaction was nevertheless untimely.  Defendants point out that the maturity date on the Note was March 5, 1981.  Under the three-year limitations period, the claim expired on March 5, 1984, several months before the bankruptcy proceeding was instituted and before the FDIC acquired the note.  Thus, they argue, neither the tolling provisions under Puerto Rico law nor the six-year limitations period under FIRREA apply, and the claim is untimely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDIC argues that the district court correctly found that Note IV was not a separate loan, but merely part of a single, 1979 loan transaction.  Thus, the maturity date for the Note was actually the maturity date for the entire loan, March 5, 1986, and not March 5, 1981.  In reaching its conclusion, the district court pointed in particular to the fact that both Note III and Note IV were part of a single loan agreement, that there was only one application to the FHA for the loan and guarantee stating the total amount of $110,000, and that there was only one guarantee for the total amount of the loan.  The FDIC argues that defendants do not expressly contest this finding on appeal, and that it should therefore be affirmed.  Since the maturity date was 1986, the limitations period had not run by the time the FDIC acquired the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that defendants have not expressly contested the district court's conclusion on this ground, we find that the defendants have implicitly contested the district court's finding by consistently discussing Note IV as a separate claim and by calculating the timeliness of that claim from Note IV's date of maturity.  We further hold that defendants' argument has merit.  We see no legal basis for treating the two promissory notes as a single loan for statute of limitations purposes.  The three-year statute of limitations applies, by its terms, to commercial promissory notes.  See P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 1908, (\"Actions arising from drafts shall extinguish three years after maturity....  A similar rule shall be applied to commercial bills of exchange and promissory notes....\"  (emphasis added));  see also Barrera, 95 F.Supp. at 898;  Marco Discount House, 575 F.Supp. at 731.   In this case, the 1979 loan transaction was supported by two separate promissory notes with two separate maturity dates:  March 5, 1981 and March 5, 1986.  Under a straightforward application of the statute, the limitations periods for suits based on the two Notes began running at different times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no legal basis for importing the maturity date of Note III into Note IV despite the separate maturity date on the face of Note IV.  The fact that the two notes happened to be part of the same \"loan transaction\" is immaterial for statute of limitations purposes, since the operative legal documents were the notes themselves.  Accordingly, the limitations period for claims based on Note IV expired three years after maturity, on March 5, 1984, before it could be interrupted by the bankruptcy proceeding and before the FDIC acquired the note.  The FDIC's claim based on that note is therefore untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's holding that the FDIC's claims on Note I, Note II, Note III, and the notes underlying the line of credit were all timely filed, but reverse the district court's holding that the claim on Note IV was timely filed.  We remand to the district court for a recalculation of the judgment amount in light of this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.

We consider the argument as applied to Note II, since the result is, in any event, the same</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For the same reason, defendants' reliance upon Camara Insular v.

Ares, 25 P.R.R. 446, 448 (1917) is misplaced, as both of those cases deal only with the impact of bankruptcy proceedings on the liability of co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties, not upon the limitations period for bringing such claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Defendants also argue that the district court erred in concluding that TCC's listing of the Note in its bankruptcy schedules served to revive the claim under P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 1903.  Evidently recognizing that the case law appears to support defendants' argument, see FDIC v. Cardona, 723 F.2d 132, 137 (1st Cir.1983), the FDIC does not contest this argument on appeal, relying instead on the district court's alternate ground for the result</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court denied defendants' motion for partial summary judgment and granted the FDIC's motion for summary judgment.

To evidence the loan, Maldonado I (personally and as president of TCC) executed two promissory notes:  Note I, for $70,000, due on May 30, 1992, and Note II, for $160,000, due on May 30, 1984.  To further secure payment of the loan, and any other TCC debt, TCC executed a pledge agreement delivering three bearer mortgage notes and a chattel mortgage.  Maldonado I and Ramirez also signed personal guaranties for the loan.  The Farmers Home Administration guaranteed 90% of the loan.  GTC subsequently entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 10% of the loan, should TCC default for a term longer than three consecutive months.  TCC defaulted on the loan, and GTC purchased the loan on January 10, 1979.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. 1979 Loan Transaction--On March 5, 1979, TCC executed a loan agreement in favor of GTC, under which GTC loaned TCC $110,000.  To evidence the loan, Maldonado I (as president of TCC) executed two promissory notes:  Note III, for $35,000 and Note IV, for $75,000.  Final payment on Note III was due March 5, 1986;  final payment for Note IV was due March 5, 1981.  To secure payment of the loan, Maldonado I (as president of TCC) executed a pledge agreement delivering one bearer mortgage note.  Later, to further secure the loan, Maldonado (personally and as president of TCC) and Ramirez (personally) executed a second pledge agreement delivering another bearer mortgage note.  Maldonado I and Ramirez also signed personal guaranties for the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. 1981 Line of Credit--On April 3, 1981, Maldonados I and II (personally, and as TCC's president and vice president) executed an open-end credit agreement with GTC, under which GTC extended to TCC a line of credit of up to $250,000, to be disbursed as cash advances or credits to its checking account.  Maldonados I and II executed a continuing guaranty without collateral, jointly and severally guaranteeing to the bank the punctual payment of TCC's debts.  Under the line of credit, sixteen promissory notes were executed in 1981 and 1982, with payment due throughout 1982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, 1984, TCC petitioned for bankruptcy under chapter 11.  In the petition, GTC was listed among TCC's creditors.  On August 16, 1984, GTC was declared insolvent, and the FDIC was appointed its receiver, acquiring the assets giving rise to the claims in this case.  On April 11, 1986, the TCC bankruptcy case was dismissed.  On May 10, 1991, the FDIC brought this action to collect on the promissory notes it had acquired from GTC.  TCC moved for summary judgment, arguing that the limitations period for collection on the promissory notes had expired.  The FDIC opposed the motion and filed its own motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, actions to collect on commercial promissory notes are subject to a limitations period of three years from the note's date of maturity.

Puerto Rico law further provides that interruption of the limitations period \"in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors,\" P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5304, and an interruption \"against the principal debtor by suit for debt shall also lie against his surety.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal law establishes an additional six-year limitations period for suits brought by the FDIC to collect on assets it acquires as receiver of a failed bank.  12 U.S.C.

The period begins to run upon appointment of the FDIC as receiver or accrual of the action, whichever is later.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(14)(B).  The federal limitations period does not, however, operate to extend claims that have already lapsed under the state limitations period before the FDIC has acquired them.

The court found that the three-year limitations period of Sec. 1908 applied to the three loans, commencing on the maturity date of each loan:  May 30, 1992 for the 1977 loan;  March 5, 1986 for the 1979 loan;  throughout 1982 for the 1981 line of credit.  In calculating the maturity dates of the loans, the court looked to the date when the final payment was due on each loan transaction as a whole, not to the individual maturity dates of the underlying promissory notes.  For example, although Note IV of the 1979 loan had a maturity date of March 5, 1981, the district court considered the note part of a single loan transaction, with an overall maturity date of March 5, 1986.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then found that TCC's bankruptcy petition was a \"judicial proceeding\" under Sec. 1903, and that the limitations periods for the claims against TCC on all three loans were tolled as of July 1984.  The court further found, pursuant to Secs. 5304 and 5305, that the tolling also applied for suits against TCC's co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties.  Finally, the court found that, once the FDIC was appointed receiver in August 1984, the FIRREA's six-year limitations period came into effect, since the claims had not yet lapsed.  Under 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821, the court held, FIRREA's limitations period began to run in April 1986 at the earliest, when TCC emerged from bankruptcy and the FDIC's claims accrued.  As the suit was filed within six years, in May of 1991, it was timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants argue that the district court erred in holding:  (1) that the bankruptcy proceeding tolled the running of the limitations period for claims against the co-debtors, sureties, and guarantors arising from Note II and the notes underlying the 1981 line of credit;  and (2) that the claims against all defendants based on Note IV of the 1979 loan transaction were timely filed.  Defendants state that they do not appeal from the district court's decision regarding the claims based on Note I and Note III.  As this is an appeal from a summary judgment, we review the district court's decision de novo.  See Pagano v.

Tolling of Limitations Period</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue first that, although the bankruptcy proceeding may have tolled the limitations period for suits against the debtor TCC, it did not toll the statute of limitations for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties as well.  This is so, defendants argue, because the automatic stay provision of the federal bankruptcy code, found in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362, preempts Secs. 5304 and 5305 of Puerto Rico's commercial code.  Defendants argue that, under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362, a bankruptcy proceeding automatically stays, and therefore tolls the statute of limitations for, actions against debtors but not against co-debtors, guarantors, or sureties.  See Austin v. Unarco Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416907\"><a href=\"/opinion/416907/margaret-austin-etc-v-unarco-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.), cert. dismissed, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To the extent they toll the limitations period for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties, defendants argue, Secs. 5304 and 5305 conflict with the bankruptcy code and are thus preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Secs. 5304 and 5305 are preempted, defendants argue, then the claims against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties based on Note II<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the promissory notes underlying the 1981 letter of credit are untimely.  For example, the promissory notes underlying the 1981 line of credit all had maturity dates in 1982.  The FDIC acquired the notes in August of 1984, before the three-year limitations period had lapsed.  However, if the limitations period for suits against the co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties was not tolled by the bankruptcy proceedings, then the six-year FIRREA limitations period began running in August of 1984, when the FDIC acquired the assets, not April of 1986, when TCC emerged from bankruptcy.  As the claims against the co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties were filed more than six years later in 1991, the claims would be untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find defendants' preemption argument to be without merit.  The provisions of the federal bankruptcy code preempt only those state laws that are in conflict with federal law.  See Stellwagen v. Clum, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99087\"><a href=\"/opinion/99087/stellwagen-v-clum/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 613, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99087\"><a href=\"/opinion/99087/stellwagen-v-clum/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span> </a></span>(1918).  True, Sec. 362 automatically stays only suits filed against debtors and not suits against that debtor's co-debtors, guarantors, or sureties.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416907\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Austin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/416907/margaret-austin-etc-v-unarco-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4-5</span></a></span>.   But this does not indicate an inconsistency with Secs. 5304 and 5305.  Nothing in the decisions construing Sec. 362 to stay only suits against debtors implies that Sec. 362 precludes states from themselves staying suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties.  These decisions hold only that Sec. 362 does not itself stay, nor require the staying of, such actions.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416907\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Austin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/416907/margaret-austin-etc-v-unarco-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">5</span> </a></span>(recognizing that circumstances may, in some cases, warrant a stay against co-debtors as well).  Furthermore, these cases deal with stays, not limitations periods;  thus, even if a creditor may proceed against co-debtors, guarantors, or sureties during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding, nothing bars a state from extending the limitations period for such suits under state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Puerto Rico is still free to extend the limitations period, under its own laws, for actions against co-debtors, sureties, and guarantors, as it has done under Secs. 5304 and 5305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no conflict between such an extension and the purpose behind Sec. 362.  By staying actions against the debtor during bankruptcy, Sec. 362 gives the debtor a degree of breathing room, relieving it of financial pressure and allowing it to attempt repayment of its debts or to adopt a reorganization plan.  See S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 54-55 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5840-41.  In tolling the limitations period for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding against the debtor, Secs. 5304 and 5305 do not impinge upon this breathing room or otherwise detract from the protection offered the debtor by Sec. 362.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there is no conflict, Secs. 5304 and 5305 are not preempted and serve to extend the limitations period during bankruptcy proceedings for suits against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties.

Accordingly, the district court correctly held that the FDIC's claims against the co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties did not accrue until April of 1986, when the bankruptcy case was dismissed.  As the claims were filed within FIRREA's six-year limitations period, they are timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Note IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that, even if the bankruptcy proceeding did toll the statute of limitations for claims against co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties, the claim based on Note IV ($75,000) supporting the 1979 loan transaction was nevertheless untimely.  Defendants point out that the maturity date on the Note was March 5, 1981.  Under the three-year limitations period, the claim expired on March 5, 1984, several months before the bankruptcy proceeding was instituted and before the FDIC acquired the note.  Thus, they argue, neither the tolling provisions under Puerto Rico law nor the six-year limitations period under FIRREA apply, and the claim is untimely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FDIC argues that the district court correctly found that Note IV was not a separate loan, but merely part of a single, 1979 loan transaction.  Thus, the maturity date for the Note was actually the maturity date for the entire loan, March 5, 1986, and not March 5, 1981.  In reaching its conclusion, the district court pointed in particular to the fact that both Note III and Note IV were part of a single loan agreement, that there was only one application to the FHA for the loan and guarantee stating the total amount of $110,000, and that there was only one guarantee for the total amount of the loan.  The FDIC argues that defendants do not expressly contest this finding on appeal, and that it should therefore be affirmed.  Since the maturity date was 1986, the limitations period had not run by the time the FDIC acquired the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that defendants have not expressly contested the district court's conclusion on this ground, we find that the defendants have implicitly contested the district court's finding by consistently discussing Note IV as a separate claim and by calculating the timeliness of that claim from Note IV's date of maturity.  We further hold that defendants' argument has merit.  We see no legal basis for treating the two promissory notes as a single loan for statute of limitations purposes.  The three-year statute of limitations applies, by its terms, to commercial promissory notes.  See P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 1908, (\"Actions arising from drafts shall extinguish three years after maturity....  A similar rule shall be applied to commercial bills of exchange and promissory notes....\"  (emphasis added));  see also <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Barrera,</span> <span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">898</span></span>;  Marco Discount <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1462147\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">House,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1462147/fed-deposit-ins-corp-v-marco-discount-house/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>.   In this case, the 1979 loan transaction was supported by two separate promissory notes with two separate maturity dates:  March 5, 1981 and March 5, 1986.  Under a straightforward application of the statute, the limitations periods for suits based on the two Notes began running at different times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no legal basis for importing the maturity date of Note III into Note IV despite the separate maturity date on the face of Note IV.  The fact that the two notes happened to be part of the same \"loan transaction\" is immaterial for statute of limitations purposes, since the operative legal documents were the notes themselves.  Accordingly, the limitations period for claims based on Note IV expired three years after maturity, on March 5, 1984, before it could be interrupted by the bankruptcy proceeding and before the FDIC acquired the note.  The FDIC's claim based on that note is therefore untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's holding that the FDIC's claims on Note I, Note II, Note III, and the notes underlying the line of credit were all timely filed, but reverse the district court's holding that the claim on Note IV was timely filed.  We remand to the district court for a recalculation of the judgment amount in light of this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.
