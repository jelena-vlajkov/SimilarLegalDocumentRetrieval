In this pending  civil rights action,  the\r                           \n\nDistrict  Attorney for Suffolk  County in Massachusetts seeks\n\nto appeal from an  order mandating that various investigative\n\nmaterials in  his  possession  be  disclosed  to  plaintiffs.\n\nBecause   we   lack   jurisdiction  to   entertain   such  an\n\ninterlocutory challenge to a discovery order, the appeal will\n\nbe dismissed.\n\n                              I.\n\n     The underlying action arises out of the investigation of\n\nWillie Bennett for the murder of Carol DiMaiti Stuart.  Eight\n\nrelatives and acquaintances  of Bennett complain  of unlawful\n\nsearches of  their homes  and seizures  of their  persons and\n\nproperty  in   connection  with   that  investigation.     In\n\nparticular,  they contend  that the  defendants--the City  of\n\nBoston, its police  commissioner and  five police  officers--\n\ncoerced   two  teenagers   into   giving   false   statements\n\nimplicating  Bennett  and  thereafter  wrongfully  used  such\n\nstatements  to   obtain  search   warrants   and  for   other\n\ninvestigative purposes.\n\n     In the course of pretrial proceedings, plaintiffs served\n\nupon the Suffolk District Attorney  (a non-party to the case)\n\na subpoena duces tecum  requesting an assortment of materials\n\npertaining  to the  murder  investigation.   Among the  items\n\nsought were  grand jury transcripts,  witness statements, and\n\nvarious  materials  concerning  witness  interviews  and  the\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nprocurement of search  warrants (e.g., police reports,  audio\r                                                 \n\nand video  tapes, transcripts,  and physical evidence).   The\n\nDistrict  Attorney moved  to quash,  arguing that  such items\n\nwere  privileged investigative materials and thus were exempt\n\nfrom disclosure.   See, e.g.,  United States v.  Cintolo, 818\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 980,  1002 (1st Cir.) (recognizing  \"qualified privilege\n\nagainst   compelled   government   disclosure  of   sensitive\n\ninvestigative  techniques\"),  cert.  denied,  484   U.S.  913\r                                                       \n\n(1987).1   Following  a  hearing, the  district court  agreed\n\nthat the grand  jury transcripts need  not be disclosed,  but\n\nordered that all non-grand-jury materials be produced subject\n\nto a  protective order.   The District Attorney  has appealed\n\nfrom the latter  portion of this  ruling, and appellees  have\n\nmoved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  \n\n                             II.\n\n     Each  of the District  Attorney's attempts  to establish\n\nappellate   jurisdiction  is  effectively   rebuffed  by  our\n\ndecision  in Corporacion  Insular de  Seguros v.  Garcia, 876\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 254 (1st Cir.  1989).  As we there  explained, discovery\n\norders, \"whether directed at  parties or at non-parties,\" are\n\ngenerally not appealable as \"final decisions\" under 28 U.S.C.\n\n  1291.   Id. at 256.   They are generally  not appealable as\r                         \n\n\"injunctions\"  under 28 U.S.C.    1292(a)(1).  Id.   And they\r                                                              \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The   District   Attorney   has  also   made   reference,\nsecondarily,  to  a  privilege  embracing  \"prosecutorial  or\ndeliberative processes or work product.\"  \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nare  generally  not appealable  under the  \"collateral order\"\n\nexception  to the final judgment  rule set forth  in Cohen v.\r                                                                      \n\nBeneficial Indus.

Such is not the case here;\n\nthe  District Attorney \"can gain the right of appeal from the\n\ndiscovery order  by defying it,  being held in  contempt, and\n\nthen  appealing  from the  contempt order,  which would  be a\n\nfinal  judgment as  to  [him].\"   Garcia,  876 F.2d  at  257;\r                                                    \n\naccord, e.g.,  Firestone Tire  &amp; Rubber  Co. v.

He relies  in this\n\nregard  on United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), where\r                                             \n\nthe Court allowed President Nixon to appeal from  a discovery\n\norder without first being cited for contempt.  It explained: \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     To  require a  President  of the  United States  to\n     place himself in the posture of disobeying an order\n     of  a  court  merely  to  trigger   the  procedural\n     mechanism  for  review  of   the  ruling  would  be\n     unseemly, and would present an unnecessary occasion\n     for   constitutional   confrontation  between   two\n     branches of the Government.\n\nId. at 691-92.  A similar argument was advanced by the Garcia\r                                                                         \n\nappellants (aides to the President of the Puerto  Rico Senate\n\nand the Puerto Rico Governor, respectively).  We deemed Nixon\r                                                                         \n\ninapplicable, describing it as a  \"unique case\" that was  not\n\n\"meant to  extend ... to  any government official  other than\n\nthe  President himself.\"  876  F.2d at 257-58.   Other courts\n\nhave  read Nixon in a  similarly narrow fashion.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nSimmons v.

See In re United States,  985 F.2d\r                                                              \n\nat 511-12; Winner, 641 F.2d at 830-31; In re Attorney General\r                                                                         \n\nof  the United  States,  596 F.2d  at  62-64.   The  District\r                                  \n\nAttorney requests, in  the alternative, that  we do the  same\n\nhere.    Assuming, without  deciding, that  the extraordinary\n\nremedy of mandamus might  on occasion be appropriate in  this\n\ncontext, we readily conclude--just  as we did in  Garcia, 876\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d at 261--that such relief is unwarranted here.  \n\n     Several factors  underlie this  conclusion.  First,  the\n\nDistrict Attorney  has satisfied  neither of  the traditional\n\nprerequisites  to  mandamus relief:  (1)  a  showing of  some\n\nspecial risk of irreparable harm, and (2) a  demonstration of\n\nclear  entitlement to  the relief  requested, i.e.,  that the\n\ndistrict  court's order  is palpably  erroneous.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nDoughty, 6 F.3d at 865; In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 656 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir.  1993).  Second, the  discovery ruling at  issue here is\n\n                    \r                                \n\nthe  appellant   State's  Attorney  fell  within   the  Nixon\r                                                                         \nexception; the  court there ended up  invoking the collateral\norder exception.

Eight relatives and acquaintances of Bennett complain of unlawful searches of their homes and seizures of their persons and property in connection with that investigation.  In particular, they contend that the defendants--the City of Boston, its police commissioner and five police officers--coerced two teenagers into giving false statements implicating Bennett and thereafter wrongfully used such statements to obtain search warrants and for other investigative purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of pretrial proceedings, plaintiffs served upon the Suffolk District Attorney (a non-party to the case) a subpoena duces tecum requesting an assortment of materials pertaining to the murder investigation.  Among the items sought were grand jury transcripts, witness statements, and various materials concerning witness interviews and the procurement of search warrants (e.g., police reports, audio and video tapes, transcripts, and physical evidence).  The District Attorney moved to quash, arguing that such items were privileged investigative materials and thus were exempt from disclosure.  See, e.g., United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 1002 (1st Cir.)  (recognizing \"qualified privilege against compelled government disclosure of sensitive investigative techniques\"), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 913, 108 S.Ct. 259, 98 L.Ed.2d 216 (1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Following a hearing, the district court agreed that the grand jury transcripts need not be disclosed, but ordered that all non-grand-jury materials be produced subject to a protective order.  The District Attorney has appealed from the latter portion of this ruling, and appellees have moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the District Attorney's attempts to establish appellate jurisdiction is effectively rebuffed by our decision in Corporacion Insular de Seguros v. Garcia, 876 F.2d 254 (1st Cir.1989).  As we there explained, discovery orders, \"whether directed at parties or at non-parties,\" are generally not appealable as \"final decisions\" under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.  Id. at 256.   They are generally not appealable as \"injunctions\" under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1).  Id.  And they are generally not appealable under the \"collateral order\" exception to the final judgment rule set forth in Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).  One of the prerequisites to invoking the Cohen exception is that the order be \"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\"  Doughty v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 6 F.3d 856, 862 (1st Cir.1993).  Such is not the case here;  the District Attorney \"can gain the right of appeal from the discovery order by defying it, being held in contempt, and then appealing from the contempt order, which would be a final judgment as to [him].\"  Garcia, 876 F.2d at 257;  accord, e.g., Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377, 101 S.Ct. 669, 675, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981);  MDK, Inc. v. Mike's Train House, Inc., 27 F.3d 116, 120-22 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 510, 130 L.Ed.2d 417 (1994);  see generally In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1004 (1st Cir.1988) (\"discovery orders rarely satisfy all four of [the Cohen ] criteria\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While acknowledging that incurring a contempt citation is the ordinary route to appellate review in this context, the District Attorney argues that his status as an elected government official and the county's chief law enforcement officer calls for a different procedure.  He relies in this regard on United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), where the Court allowed President Nixon to appeal from a discovery order without first being cited for contempt.  It explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>To require a President of the United States to place himself in the posture of disobeying an order of a court merely to trigger the procedural mechanism for review of the ruling would be unseemly, and would present an unnecessary occasion for constitutional confrontation between two branches of the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 691-92, 94 S.Ct. at 3099.   A similar argument was advanced by the Garcia appellants (aides to the President of the Puerto Rico Senate and the Puerto Rico Governor, respectively).  We deemed Nixon inapplicable, describing it as a \"unique case\" that was not \"meant to extend ... to any government official other than the President himself.\"  876 F.2d at 257-58.  Other courts have read Nixon in a similarly narrow fashion.  See, e.g., Simmons v. City of Racine, PFC, 37 F.3d 325, 328 (7th Cir.1994) (refusing to extend Nixon exception to police department officers and employees);  In re United States, 985 F.2d 510, 511 (11th Cir.)  (per curiam) (same as to FDA Commissioner), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 545, 126 L.Ed.2d 447 (1993);  Newton v. National Broadcasting Co., 726 F.2d 591, 593 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (same as to state gaming control board);  United States v. Winner, 641 F.2d 825, 830 (10th Cir.1981) (same as to Deputy Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General of United States);  In re Attorney General of the United States, 596 F.2d 58, 62 (2d Cir.)  (same as to Attorney General), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 903, 100 S.Ct. 217, 62 L.Ed.2d 141 (1979).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In several of these cases, it is true, the courts relied on the principles underlying the Nixon exception to conclude that the circumstances were sufficiently exceptional to warrant mandamus relief.  See In re United States, 985 F.2d at 511-12;  Winner, 641 F.2d at 830-31;  In re Attorney General of the United States, 596 F.2d at 62-64.   The District Attorney requests, in the alternative, that we do the same here.  Assuming, without deciding, that the extraordinary remedy of mandamus might on occasion be appropriate in this context, we readily conclude--just as we did in Garcia, 876 F.2d at 261--that such relief is unwarranted here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several factors underlie this conclusion.  First, the District Attorney has satisfied neither of the traditional prerequisites to mandamus relief:  (1) a showing of some special risk of irreparable harm, and (2) a demonstration of clear entitlement to the relief requested, i.e., that the district court's order is palpably erroneous.  See, e.g., Doughty, 6 F.3d at 865;  In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 656 (1st Cir.1993).  Second, the discovery ruling at issue here is one largely entrusted to the district court's discretion, and \"mandamus, as a general rule, will not issue to control exercises of judicial discretion.\"  In re Insurers Syndicate, 864 F.2d 208, 211 (1st Cir.1988);  accord, e.g., In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d at 1006.   Third, the possibility of a \"softened\" contempt decree involving a citation without further sanction, see, e.g., Garcia, 876 F.2d at 259 (quoting National Super Spuds, Inc. v. New York Mercantile Exchange, 591 F.2d 174, 180 (2d Cir.1979)), might go far to mitigate any \"unseemliness\" that might otherwise arise from holding the District Attorney in contempt.  Finally, the recent decision in Globe Newspaper Co. v. Police Comm'r of Boston, 419 Mass. 852, 648 N.E.2d 419 (1995), in which the Supreme Judicial Court ordered public dissemination of many of the same materials at issue here, further undercuts the propriety of ordering such extraordinary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  The temporary stay issued on March 22, 1995 is hereby dissolved.  Appellant's motion to stay the appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The District Attorney has also made reference, secondarily, to a privilege embracing \"prosecutorial or deliberative processes or work product.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the District Attorney's suggestion, Socialist Workers Party v. Grubisic, 604 F.2d 1005 (7th Cir.1979) (per curiam), on which he heavily relies, did not conclude that the appellant State's Attorney fell within the Nixon exception;  the court there ended up invoking the collateral order exception.  The same court, more recently, has applied Nixon narrowly and confined Grubisic to the \"narrow facts\" presented.  See Simmons, 37 F.3d at 328-29.   We also note that the principal case on which the Grubisic court relied--Covey Oil Co. v. Continental Oil Co., 340 F.2d 993 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 964, 85 S.Ct. 1110, 14 L.Ed.2d 155 (1965)--has since been discredited.  See, e.g., MDK, Inc., 27 F.3d at 120;  Boughton v. Cotter Corp., 10 F.3d 746, 749 (10th Cir.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Nixon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>To require a President of the United States to place himself in the posture of disobeying an order of a court merely to trigger the procedural mechanism for review of the ruling would be unseemly, and would present an unnecessary occasion for constitutional confrontation between two branches of the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 691-92, </a></span>94 S.Ct. at 3099.   A similar argument was advanced by the Garcia appellants (aides to the President of the Puerto Rico Senate and the Puerto Rico Governor, respectively).  We deemed Nixon inapplicable, describing it as a \"unique case\" that was not \"meant to extend ... to any government official other than the President <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524263\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">himself.\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/524263/corporacion-insular-de-seguros-v-hon-juan-antonio-garcia-appeal-of-dr/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">257-58</span></a></span>.

See In re United <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599392\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">States,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/599392/in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">511-12</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387319\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Winner,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/387319/united-states-v-honorable-fred-m-winner-united-states-chief-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">830-31</span></a></span>;  In re Attorney General of the United <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365453\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">States,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/365453/in-re-the-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-socialist-workers-party-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">62-64</span></a></span>.   The District Attorney requests, in the alternative, that we do the same here.  Assuming, without deciding, that the extraordinary remedy of mandamus might on occasion be appropriate in this context, we readily conclude--just as we did in Garcia, 876 F.2d at 261--that such relief is unwarranted here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several factors underlie this conclusion.  First, the District Attorney has satisfied neither of the traditional prerequisites to mandamus relief:  (1) a showing of some special risk of irreparable harm, and (2) a demonstration of clear entitlement to the relief requested, i.e., that the district court's order is palpably erroneous.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194981\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doughty,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/194981/doughty-v-underwriters/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>;  In re Pearson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604120\"><a href=\"/opinion/604120/in-re-donald-pearson/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 656 (1st Cir.1993).  Second, the discovery ruling at issue here is one largely entrusted to the district court's discretion, and \"mandamus, as a general rule, will not issue to control exercises of judicial discretion.\"  In re Insurers Syndicate, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516165\"><a href=\"/opinion/516165/in-re-insurers-syndicate-for-the-joint-underwriting-of-medico-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 211 (1st Cir.1988);  accord, e.g., In re Recticel Foam <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513181\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/513181/in-re-recticel-foam-corporation-in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>.   Third, the possibility of a \"softened\" contempt decree involving a citation without further sanction, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524263\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Garcia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524263/corporacion-insular-de-seguros-v-hon-juan-antonio-garcia-appeal-of-dr/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">259</span> </a></span>(quoting National Super Spuds, Inc. v. New York Mercantile Exchange, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362997\"><a href=\"/opinion/362997/national-super-spuds-inc-v-new-york-mercantile-exchange-commodity/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 180 (2d Cir.1979)), might go far to mitigate any \"unseemliness\" that might otherwise arise from holding the District Attorney in contempt.  Finally, the recent decision in Globe Newspaper Co. v. Police Comm'r of Boston, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span> </span>(1995), in which the Supreme Judicial Court ordered public dissemination of many of the same materials at issue here, further undercuts the propriety of ordering such extraordinary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

The same court, more recently, has applied Nixon narrowly and confined Grubisic to the \"narrow facts\" presented.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679573\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Simmons,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/679573/kenny-simmons-v-city-of-racine-pfc-police-and-fire-commission-officer/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">328-29</span></a></span>.
