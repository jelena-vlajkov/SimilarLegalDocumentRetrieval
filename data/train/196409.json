Appellant  Ocasio-Aponte  appeals   the\r                            \r\n\ndismissal of his action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.   1983, by the\r\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\r\n\non the ground that  his complaint was time barred  because it\r\n\nhad  not been filed within the applicable one year statute of\r\n\nlimitations period.  We affirm.\r\n\n     Ocasio-Aponte's action arising out of the termination of\r\n\nhis government employment was filed in federal court on April\r\n\n23, 1992.   Although his alleged injury occurred in 1988, the\r\n\nparties agree that the statute of limitations had been tolled\r\n\nby an action filed in the Commonwealth Supreme Court in 1989.\r\n\nThis action was dismissed  by the Commonwealth Superior Court\r\n\nfor failure to exhaust  administrative remedies.  The Supreme\r\n\nCourt  of  Puerto  Rico  subsequently  denied Aponte-Ocasio's\r\n\npetition  for review  and  motion for  reconsideration.   The\r\n\nparties were notified of the court's denial of the motion for\r\n\nreconsideration on  April  22, 1991.   The  Supreme Court  of\r\n\nPuerto Rico issued its  mandate to the Superior Court  on May\r\n\n1, 1991.\r\n\n     The sole  question  in this  case  is when  the  tolling\r\n\nperiod ended.  According  to Ocasio-Aponte the tolling period\r\n\nlasted  until  mandate issued;  according  to  appellees, the\r\n\nperiod lasted only  until the parties were  notified on April\r\n\n22, 1992, of the court's denial of Aponte-Ocasio's motion for\r\n\nreconsideration.  Both parties  agree that the instant action\r\r\n\nis  time barred if, but only  if, the tolling period ended on\r\n\nor before April 22, 1991.\r\n\n     State law,  here the  law of  Puerto Rico,  controls the\r\n\nquestion  of the duration of  the tolling period.

As  the district court  held,\r\n\nunder Puerto Rico law, the tolling period ends when the court\r\n\nenters a final judgment.  Duran Cepeda v. Morales Lebron, 112\r                                                                    \r\n\nD.P.R. 623, 12 Official  Translations 776, 785 (1982); Fresh-\r                                                                         \r\n\nO-Baking Co. v.

See Dominguez v. Fabian, 36  P.R.R. 509,\r                                                        \r\n\n511 (1927)  (judgment final,  for purposes of  taking appeal,\r\n\nfrom  date rendered  and filed  with court  not from  date on\r\n\nwhich mandate issues).\r\n\n     Under Puerto Rico law,  a final judgment in  the instant\r\n\ncase was rendered, at the latest, on April  22, 1991; for, on\r\n\nthat date, the parties  received formal notification from the\r\n\nPuerto  Rico  Supreme Court  that Ocasio-Aponte's  motion for\r\n\nreconsideration  had been  denied.   As  of  April 22,  1991,\r\n\ntherefore, the tolling period  was at an end and  the statute\r\n\nof  limitations  began to  run  anew.

Since the present\r                   \r\n\naction  was  filed more  than one  year  from this  date, the\r\n\ndistrict court was correct in finding it time barred.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
