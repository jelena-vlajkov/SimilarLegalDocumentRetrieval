Appellant Stephen E. McLane,\n                              \n\nGeneral  Partner  of  Auto  Engineering  Limited  Partnership\n\n(\"Auto   Engineering\"),   challenges  the   district  court's\n\ndecisions  both   to  deny  his  motion   for  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction against BMW of  North America, Inc. (\"BMW-NA\") and\n\nto grant his motion for the same for only ninety days against\n\nMercedes-Benz of North America,  Inc. (\"MB-NA\").  Finding his\n\nappeal moot, we dismiss  and remand the case to  the district\n\ncourt for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          In September 1987, a consortium of investors led by\n\nMcLane formed  Auto Engineering for the  purpose of acquiring\n\nthe assets  of Auto Engineering,  Inc. (\"AEI\").   Among those\n\nassets were Mercedes-Benz  and BMW  franchises, a  Lexington,\n\nMassachusetts,  automobile dealership  facility out  of which\n\nAEI  had   run  those   franchises,  and  real   property  in\n\nBurlington,  Massachusetts, which was purchased as the future\n\nlocation of  the Mercedes-Benz  dealership.  Having  acquired\n\nAEI's assets,  Auto Engineering,  pursuant to  its dealership\n\nagreements  with MB-NA,  moved its  Lexington-based Mercedes-\n\nBenz  dealership  to  the   Burlington  location.    The  BMW\n\ndealership  remained in  Lexington until  May 17,  1989, when\n\nBMW-NA  acceded to  Auto  Engineering's request  to move  the\n\ndealership to the Burlington premises.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Unfortunately  for  Auto Engineering,  the  move to\n\nBurlington   coincided  with  the   general  decline  in  the\n\nMassachusetts and  national economies.   Decreased automobile\n\nsales coupled with the high overhead costs of the  Burlington\n\nfacility   caused  Auto   Engineering  to   experience  heavy\n\nfinancial losses.  According to Auto Engineering, it incurred\n\ncumulative operating  losses in excess of  $4,000,000 between\n\nthe years of 1988 and 1992.\n\n          By the middle of 1991, after  having unsuccessfully\n\napplied  to   an  MB-NA  investment   program  for  financial\n\nrestructuring  assistance,  Auto Engineering  began exploring\n\nthe  possibility  of selling  the  Burlington  location.   In\n\nNovember  1991,  Auto Engineering,  without  seeking approval\n\nfrom  either franchisor,  entered  into a  purchase and  sale\n\nagreement with Circuit City Stores, Inc. (\"Circuit City\") for\n\nthe   Burlington  premises.      Shortly   thereafter,   Auto\n\nEngineering advised  MB-NA and BMW-NA that  it was proceeding\n\nwith plans to sell  the Burlington property and again  sought\n\npermission  to  return  both  dealerships  to  the  Lexington\n\nlocation.  Each company refused this request.\n\n          In  September 1992,  Auto Engineering  learned that\n\nCircuit City,  pursuant to  the purchase and  sale agreement,\n\nwould  require  it  to  vacate  the  Burlington  premises  by\n\nNovember 2,  1992.  Accordingly,  on that  date, and  without\n\nobtaining approval from  either franchisor, Auto  Engineering\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nmoved both  dealerships back to Lexington.   Considering this\n\nrelocation  a breach of  the express terms  of the dealership\n\nagreement, BMW-NA  notified Auto Engineering  by letter dated\n\nNovember  3,  1992, that  it  was  terminating the  agreement\n\neffective January  10, 1993.   The following day,  MB-NA sent\n\nAuto Engineering a similar termination letter.1\n\n          In  response to  these termination  letters, on  or\n\nabout December 10, 1992, McLane commenced an  action in state\n\ncourt seeking  to enjoin  the termination of  the franchises.\n\nThe complaint alleged, inter alia, that  BMW-NA and MB-NA had\n                                 \n\nviolated Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 93B,    4(3)(e), by  terminating\n\ntheir respective  dealer agreements \"without good cause\"2 and\n\nsought injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys' fees.\n\n          On December  18, 1992, with MB-NA's  assent, BMW-NA\n\nremoved  the action  to federal  court.   Shortly thereafter,\n\nAuto  Engineering moved  for  a preliminary  injunction.   On\n\n                    \n\n1.  Auto Engineering's dealer agreements with BMW-NA and  MB-\nNA contain clauses providing that the dealer must receive the\nwritten approval of  the manufacturers before  relocating the\ndealership to another site.\n\n2.  Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93B,   4(3)(e)  provides in pertinent\npart:\n\n          It   shall  be  deemed   a  violation  of\n          paragraph  (a) of  section  three  for  a\n          manufacturer, . .  . notwithstanding  any\n          term  or  provision  of  a  franchise  or\n          selling agreement, to cancel or terminate\n          the franchise  or selling agreement  of a\n          motor vehicle dealer without good cause .\n          . . .\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nJanuary  7, 1993, after a two-day hearing on that motion, the\n\ndistrict  court denied the motion as to BMW-NA but granted it\n\nas to  MB-NA for a period  of ninety days, expiring  on April\n\n11,  1993.3   The court also  denied Auto  Engineering's oral\n\nrequest to stay the terminations pending appeal.  On  January\n\n8, 1993, Auto  Engineering filed  a notice of  appeal and  an\n\nexpedited  motion requesting  that we  stay the  terminations\n\npending  appeal.4    On  that  date,  we  stayed  the  BMW-NA\n\ntermination for one week.  Subsequently, on January 15, 1993,\n\nwe  denied Auto  Engineering's emergency  request for  a stay\n\npending  appeal.  Accordingly,  by April 11,  1993, both BMW-\n\nNA's  and MB-NA's  termination of  Auto  Engineering's dealer\n\nagreements had become effective.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          Both BMW-NA  and  MB-NA contend  that, because  the\n\nevents which Auto Engineering sought  to enjoin have in  fact\n\n                    \n\n3.  Because MB-NA had not filed its dealer agreement with the\nAttorney General's office as required under Mass. Gen. L. ch.\n93B,    8, the court granted Auto Engineering's motion for an\ninjunction  against MB-NA  for a  period lasting  ninety days\nfrom January 7, 1993, the date of MB-NA's compliance with the\nfiling requirement.\n\n4.  MB-NA filed a cross-appeal and  a motion with this court,\nseeking relief from the portion of the district court's order\nthat delayed the effective time of the MB-NA  termination for\nninety days.  Given that the ninety days have now passed, MB-\nNA concedes that its cross-appeal is moot.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\noccurred, its appeal from  the district court's order denying\n\ninjunctive relief is moot.  We agree.\n\n          It is well  settled that an appeal  from the denial\n\nof  a motion  for a preliminary  injunction is  rendered moot\n\nwhen the act  sought to be enjoined has occurred.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nOakville  Dev. Corp.  v.

This request is\n\nnot, however, properly before us.  The district court has not\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nyet ruled on the merits of Auto Engineering's claims, nor has\n\nit  considered  such  fact-intensive  questions   as  whether\n\nreinstatement would  be appropriate, or  even possible, under\n\nthe present  circumstances.  To the extent  that the district\n\ncourt   has   addressed   the   post-termination   issue   of\n\nreinstatement at all, it  has done so only in the  context of\n\nruling  on  Auto  Engineering's  request  for  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction.  Because the district court has  not yet resolved\n\nultimate issues of liability and permanent  equitable relief,\n\nwe decline to address  them prematurely in this interlocutory\n\nappeal.5    Cf. Marilyn  T.,  803  F.2d  at 1384-85  (finding\n                           \n\nappeal  moot   and  declining   to  order  reinstatement   of\n\nappellant's   commercial  license   where  the   question  of\n\nreinstatement would  require the  court to address  issues as\n\nyet unresolved by the district court).\n\n          The sole  issue on  appeal is the  district court's\n\ndenial  of  Auto  Engineering's  request  for  an  injunction\n\npreventing BMW-NA  and  MB-NA  from  terminating  the  dealer\n\nagreements.   As  both  of those  terminations have  actually\n\noccurred, the appeal is moot.  Accordingly, we dismiss the\n                                               dismiss\n                                                      \n\n                    \n\n5.  Needless to say, on remand, the district court  will take\nsuch further  action with respect to  the reinstatement claim\nas it deems appropriate.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nappeal  and  remand  the  case for  any  further  appropriate\n             remand\n                   \n\nproceedings.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  As a general rule, when a case becomes moot on appeal, we\nvacate  the  district  court's  decision and  remand  with  a\ndirection  to   dismiss.     See,  e.g.,  United   States  v.\n                                                         \nMunsingwear,  Inc., 340  U.S.  36, 39  (1950); National  R.R.\n                                                             \nPassenger  Corp.  v.

McLane, General Partner of Auto Engineering Limited Partnership (\"Auto Engineering\"), challenges the district court's decisions both to deny his motion for a preliminary injunction against BMW of North America, Inc.  (\"BMW-NA\") and to grant his motion for the same for only ninety days against Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc.  (\"MB-NA\").  Finding his appeal moot, we dismiss and remand the case to the district court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1987, a consortium of investors led by McLane formed Auto Engineering for the purpose of acquiring the assets of Auto Engineering, Inc.  (\"AEI\").  Among those assets were Mercedes-Benz and BMW franchises, a Lexington, Massachusetts, automobile dealership facility out of which AEI had run those franchises, and real property in Burlington, Massachusetts, which was purchased as the future location of the Mercedes-Benz dealership.  Having acquired AEI's assets, Auto Engineering, pursuant to its dealership agreements with MB-NA, moved its Lexington-based Mercedes-Benz dealership to the Burlington location.  The BMW dealership remained in Lexington until May 17, 1989, when BMW-NA acceded to Auto Engineering's request to move the dealership to the Burlington premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Auto Engineering, the move to Burlington coincided with the general decline in the Massachusetts and national economies.  Decreased automobile sales coupled with the high overhead costs of the Burlington facility caused Auto Engineering to experience heavy financial losses.  According to Auto Engineering, it incurred cumulative operating losses in excess of $4,000,000 between the years of 1988 and 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the middle of 1991, after having unsuccessfully applied to an MB-NA investment program for financial restructuring assistance, Auto Engineering began exploring the possibility of selling the Burlington location.  In November 1991, Auto Engineering, without seeking approval from either franchisor, entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Circuit City Stores, Inc.  (\"Circuit City\") for the Burlington premises.  Shortly thereafter, Auto Engineering advised MB-NA and BMW-NA that it was proceeding with plans to sell the Burlington property and again sought permission to return both dealerships to the Lexington location.  Each company refused this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1992, Auto Engineering learned that Circuit City, pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, would require it to vacate the Burlington premises by November 2, 1992.  Accordingly, on that date, and without obtaining approval from either franchisor, Auto Engineering moved both dealerships back to Lexington.  Considering this relocation a breach of the express terms of the dealership agreement, BMW-NA notified Auto Engineering by letter dated November 3, 1992, that it was terminating the agreement effective January 10, 1993.  The following day, MB-NA sent Auto Engineering a similar termination letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to these termination letters, on or about December 10, 1992, McLane commenced an action in state court seeking to enjoin the termination of the franchises.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that BMW-NA and MB-NA had violated Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93B, Sec. 4(3)(e), by terminating their respective dealer agreements \"without good cause\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and sought injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1992, with MB-NA's assent, BMW-NA removed the action to federal court.  Shortly thereafter, Auto Engineering moved for a preliminary injunction.  On January 7, 1993, after a two-day hearing on that motion, the district court denied the motion as to BMW-NA but granted it as to MB-NA for a period of ninety days, expiring on April 11, 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The court also denied Auto Engineering's oral request to stay the terminations pending appeal.  On January 8, 1993, Auto Engineering filed a notice of appeal and an expedited motion requesting that we stay the terminations pending appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  On that date, we stayed the BMW-NA termination for one week.  Subsequently, on January 15, 1993, we denied Auto Engineering's emergency request for a stay pending appeal.  Accordingly, by April 11, 1993, both BMW-NA's and MB-NA's termination of Auto Engineering's dealer agreements had become effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both BMW-NA and MB-NA contend that, because the events which Auto Engineering sought to enjoin have in fact occurred, its appeal from the district court's order denying injunctive relief is moot.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that an appeal from the denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction is rendered moot when the act sought to be enjoined has occurred.  See, e.g., Oakville Dev.  Corp. v. FDIC, 986 F.2d 611, 613 (1st Cir.1993) (\"When, as will often happen, the act sought to be enjoined actually transpires, the court may thereafter be unable to fashion [ ] meaningful [relief].  In such straitened circumstances, the appeal becomes moot.\");  Railway Labor Executives Ass'n v. Chesapeake W.

This request is not, however, properly before us.  The district court has not yet ruled on the merits of Auto Engineering's claims, nor has it considered such fact-intensive questions as whether reinstatement would be appropriate, or even possible, under the present circumstances.  To the extent that the district court has addressed the post-termination issue of reinstatement at all, it has done so only in the context of ruling on Auto Engineering's request for a preliminary injunction.  Because the district court has not yet resolved ultimate issues of liability and permanent equitable relief, we decline to address them prematurely in this interlocutory appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Cf. Marilyn T., 803 F.2d at 1384-85 (finding appeal moot and declining to order reinstatement of appellant's commercial license where the question of reinstatement would require the court to address issues as yet unresolved by the district court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue on appeal is the district court's denial of Auto Engineering's request for an injunction preventing BMW-NA and MB-NA from terminating the dealer agreements.  As both of those terminations have actually occurred, the appeal is moot.  Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and remand the case for any further appropriate proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Auto Engineering's dealer agreements with BMW-NA and MB-NA contain clauses providing that the dealer must receive the written approval of the manufacturers before relocating the dealership to another site</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93B, Sec. 4(3)(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>It shall be deemed a violation of paragraph (a) of section three for a manufacturer, ... notwithstanding any term or provision of a franchise or selling agreement, to cancel or terminate the franchise or selling agreement of a motor vehicle dealer without good cause....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because MB-NA had not filed its dealer agreement with the Attorney General's office as required under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93B, Sec. 8, the court granted Auto Engineering's motion for an injunction against MB-NA for a period lasting ninety days from January 7, 1993, the date of MB-NA's compliance with the filing requirement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> MB-NA filed a cross-appeal and a motion with this court, seeking relief from the portion of the district court's order that delayed the effective time of the MB-NA termination for ninety days.

International Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, 915 F.2d 43, 48 (1st Cir.1990).

As both of those terminations have actually occurred, the appeal is moot.  Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and remand the case for any further appropriate proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Auto Engineering's dealer agreements with BMW-NA and MB-NA contain clauses providing that the dealer must receive the written approval of the manufacturers before relocating the dealership to another site</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93B, Sec. 4(3)(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>It shall be deemed a violation of paragraph (a) of section three for a manufacturer, ... notwithstanding any term or provision of a franchise or selling agreement, to cancel or terminate the franchise or selling agreement of a motor vehicle dealer without good cause....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because MB-NA had not filed its dealer agreement with the Attorney General's office as required under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93B, Sec. 8, the court granted Auto Engineering's motion for an injunction against MB-NA for a period lasting ninety days from January 7, 1993, the date of MB-NA's compliance with the filing requirement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> MB-NA filed a cross-appeal and a motion with this court, seeking relief from the portion of the district court's order that delayed the effective time of the MB-NA termination for ninety days.
