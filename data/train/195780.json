Appellant,  Luis  Rodriguez Paulino,\r                                 \n\nobjects  to  his  sentence  on  the  ground  of  the  court's\n\nerroneous perception that, in sentencing appellant below  the\n\nguideline sentencing  range, it lacked authority  to impose a\n\nsentence   lower  than   the   sentences   imposed   on   his\n\ncodefendants.1      Appellant has  only a \"very  narrow right\n\nto appeal.\" United  States v. Soltero-Lopez,  11 F.3d 18,  19\r                                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).   This court has ruled on  several occasions\n\nthat  \"we  have no  jurisdiction to  review  the extent  of a\r                                                                   \n\ndownward departure  merely because the  affected defendant is\n\ndissatisfied  with the quantification of the district court's\n\ngenerosity.\" United  States v.

Soltero-\r                                                                         \n\nLopez,  11  F.2d  at  20.    This  court  has  indicated  its\r                 \n\nwillingness to  review cases  where a defendant  alleges that\n\nthe court  mistakenly believed  it lacked legal  authority to\n\ndepart,  United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 953 (1st Cir.\r                                            \n\n1993),  or that  the court's  departure decision  exhibited a\n\n\"fundamental misunderstanding\" about how the guidelines work,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.    Appellant also  contends that  the sentence  imposed is\ninconsistent   with  the   court's  findings   regarding  his\ndiminished life  expectancy and  that home  confinement would\nhave been a suitable alternative to imprisonment.  We have no\njurisdiction to review those claims.\r\r\n\nsee   Soltero-Lopez,  supra,   or  in   other  \"extraordinary\r                                       \n\ncircumstances.\" See Pomerleau, 923 F.2d at 6.  \r                                         \n\n     Here, appellant  has arguably alleged  that the district\n\ncourt  believed  that,  in  determining  the  extent  of  its\n\ndeparture, it  lacked power  to impose  a sentence  below his\n\ncodefendants'   sentences.      This  court   therefore   has\n\njurisdiction to review  the sentence for  evidence of such  a\n\nmisunderstanding  of  the guidelines.   The  record, however,\n\ndoes  not reveal that the district court suffered from such a\n\nmisunderstanding.   The   district   court's  statements   at\n\nsentencing and  its Sentencing Findings do  not indicate that\n\nit  believed  it  lacked  the legal  authority  to  impose  a\n\nsentence  below the  codefendants'  sentences.   They  merely\n\nindicate that  the  district court  considered  codefendants'\n\nsentences to be  one relevant  factor in arriving  at a  fair\n\nsentence below the  guideline sentencing range.  This is well\n\nwithin the court's broad discretion.  See  Pighetti, 898 F.2d\r                                                               \n\nat 4 (noting that  the extent of a departure  is \"essentially\n\ndiscretionary\").   As in Soltero-Lopez, supra,  the record in\r                                                         \n\nthis case  provides scant support for  appellant's allegation\n\nthat the district court misunderstood the guidelines.\n\n     We  have  held  that   \"a  perceived  need  to  equalize\n\nsentencing  outcomes  for  similarly  situated  codefendants,\n\nwithout more,  will not permit  a departure  from a  properly\n\ncalculated  guideline sentencing  range.\"  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nWogan,  938 F.2d 1446 (1st Cir. 1991); see also United States\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Carr, 932  F.2d  67,  73 (1st  Cir.  1991).   That  rule,\r                    \n\nhowever, does not extend to  prohibit a sentencing court from\n\nconsidering   codefendants'  sentences   as  one   factor  in\n\ndetermining the extent of a departure. \n\n     The sentence  is summarily affirmed pursuant  to Loc. R.\r                                                    \n\n27.1.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
