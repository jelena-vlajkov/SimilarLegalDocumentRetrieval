Section 23(b) of  the original  Federal Power  Act, ch.\n285,     23(b), 41  Stat. 1075  (1920)  has been  amended and\ncodified  under  16 U.S.C.     817(1)  (1988) (\"Projects  not\naffecting  navigable waters;  necessity for  Federal license,\npermit or right-of-way\"). It provides:\n          Any  person,   association,  corporation,\n          State,   or  municipality   intending  to\n          construct  a dam  or other  project works\n          across, along, over, or in  any stream or\n          part thereof, other than those defined in\n          this  chapter  as  navigable waters,  and\n          over  which   Congress  has  jurisdiction\n          under its authority to  regulate commerce\n          with  foreign  nations   and  among   the\n          several   States    shall   before   such\n          construction  file  declaration  of  such\n          intention with  the Commission, whereupon\n          the  Commission   shall  cause  immediate\n          investigation     of    such     proposed\n          construction  to be  made,  and  if  upon\n          investigation  it  shall  find  that  the\n          interests   of   interstate  or   foreign\n          commerce  would  be   affected  by   such\n          proposed   construction,   such   person,\n          association,   corporation,    State   or\n          municipality    shall    not   construct,\n          maintain,  or operate  such dam  or other\n          project works until it shall have applied\n          for  and  shall have  received  a license\n          under the provisions of this chapter.  If\n          the Commission  shall not so find, and if\n          no  public  lands  or   reservations  are\n          affected,   permission   is  granted   to\n          construct such dam or other project works\n          in such stream upon compliance with State\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nFERC's \"post-1935  construction\" rule.  FERC  claims that for\n\npurposes of  Section  23(b), shutting  down  a  hydroelectric\n\nplant for twelve years after 1935  and powering it back up to\n\nits former specifications constitutes  post-1935 construction\n\nwithout  more.   Hodgson,  on  the  other hand,  claims  that\n\noperating  China Mill  after  maintaining it  over the  years\n\nuntil  its use  became profitable,  does not  amount  to such\n\nconstruction, and that even  if it does, FERC's terms  in the\n\nlicense were  unreasonable.  After reviewing  the statute and\n\npertinent  case  law,  we conclude  that  FERC  erred in  its\n\ndetermination that it had jurisdiction over China Mill.   \r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r                                                  \n\n          The  China Mill  dam  was constructed  in the  late\n\n1860's as a grist mill in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, on\n\nthe Suncook River, which is not navigable.  The site included\n\nthe dam,  diversion canal,  penstocks and turbine  which were\n\ninstalled  prior  to 1900.    China Mill  was  converted from\n\nhydromechanical  to hydroelectric  power  before 1914.    The\n\npetitioner has owned China Mill since 1970.  \n\n          Under   a  succession   of   owners,   China   Mill\n\ncontinuously produced  electricity until 1969 in  its present\n\nconfiguration.   Power  generation stopped  for approximately\n\ntwelve  years  starting in  1969.   The  parties  dispute the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n          laws.\n\nWe  shall follow  the lead  of the parties  and refer  to the\nstatute as \"Section 23(b).\"\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nnature of the  stoppage.  Petitioner  alleges that a  natural\n\ndisaster initially  led to the stoppage.   Respondent asserts\n\nthat the natural  disaster was only a log that  got caught in\n\nthe project's  machinery and  that  the true  reason for  the\n\nstoppage  was purely  economic.   During the  period of  non-\n\ngeneration,   the   production   of  power   was   apparently\n\nuneconomical  for  China  Mill.     The  cost  of  purchasing\n\nelectricity was low, and no market existed for selling excess\n\npower.   For reasons  to be  stated, the  exact cause  of the\n\nhiatus  in  the production  of  electricity  does not  affect\n\nFERC's jurisdiction.   \n\n          With the  federal enactment  of the Public  Utility\n\nRegulatory Policies Act (PURPA)2  and New Hampshire's passage\n\nof  the Limited  Electrical  Energy  Producers Act  (LEEPA),3\n\nHodgson decided that it would be again profitable  to produce\n\npower at China  Mill.   In 1981 Hodgson  started to  generate\n\npower  at China  Mill and  sold power  to the  Public Service\n\nCompany of New Hampshire.  In September of 1989 FERC directed\n\nHodgson to show why  China Mill should not be  licensed under\n\nthe  FPA.  At  first, Hodgson did  not object  to obtaining a\n\nlicense and  in fact  voluntarily applied  for one  in March,\n\n1990.  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.   16 U.S.C.    824 et seq.\r                                        \n\n3.

Hodgson   objected  to   these  conditions,\r                       \n\nespecially  challenging  the fifty  cfs requirement  which it\n\nclaims would result in an annual loss of over $68,000.  \n\n          Unhappy  with the  terms  of its  license,  Hodgson\n\nwithdrew its application4  and sought a  rehearing contesting\n\nboth  FERC's  jurisdiction  and  the terms  of  the  license.\n\nThomas Hodgson  &amp; Sons,  Inc.,  63 F.E.R.C.    61,068  (1993)\r                                         \n\n(Hodgson II).   Among its reasons for  denying the rehearing,\r                       \n\nFERC stated  that the generating  capacity of China  Mill had\n\nbeen increased, but  that even if  the capacity remained  the\n\nsame,  the project  had  been abandoned  and, therefore,  the\n\nrenewed operation constituted post-1935 construction.  Id. at\r                                                                      \n\n61,293.  Its determinative findings were as follows:\n\n               Hodgson  does  not dispute  that the\n          Suncook   River,   a  tributary   of  the\n          Merrimack  River,  is  a Commerce  Clause\n          water,  or  that   the  project   affects\n          interstate    commerce    due   to    its\n          interconnection   with   the   interstate\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.    Hodgson claims it has the right to withdraw a voluntary\nlicense  application.  FERC does  not dispute this;  so we do\nnot address it.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          electric grid.  However, Hodgson disputes\n          that the development has  undergone post-\n          1935 construction.\n\n               As   noted   above,  the   project's\n          generating  capacity  from  1934  through\n          1939  was 1,300 kW, but some time between\n          1939 and 1942 the generating capacity was\n          increased to 1,500 kW.   The installation\n          after   1935  of   additional  generating\n          capacity       constitutes      post-1935\n          construction.\n\n               Even  if  the installed  capacity of\n          the  project  were unchanged  after 1935,\n          the project would still be required to be\n          licensed.   Ordinary maintenance, repair,\n          and reconstruction  activity with respect\n          to a project constructed before 1935 does\n          not constitute post-1935 construction for\n          purposes of Section  23(b)(1).   However,\n          the   pre-1935   construction   exception\n          protects only operating projects.   Where\n          a project has been abandoned, there is no\n          basis  for  a  claim  that  the  operator\n          retains  operating  rights,  even if  the\n          operator,   after   1935,  restores   the\n          project to a  condition identical to  its\n          pre-abandonment status.  As  noted above,\r                                                               \n          the  China Mill Project  was abandoned in\r                                                               \n          the  1960s and  was  not  operated  again\r                                                               \n          until  1981.   Consequently,  the renewed\r                                                               \n          operation      constituted      post-1935\r                                                               \n          construction.   In  light of  all of  the\r                                   \n          above, we affirm  the Director's  finding\n          that  the  project  is  required   to  be\n          licensed. \n\nId. (emphasis  added; footnotes omitted).   A second petition\r               \n\nfor rehearing followed.\n\n          During this time,  Hodgson, asserting its right  to\n\ndecline the  license, petitioned  this court  for a  stay and\n\nreview  of  the terms  of the  license.   We  determined that\n\nHodgson  did not accept the  license but declined  to stay or\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfurther  review  the order  until  FERC  considered Hodgson's\n\nsecond  petition for rehearing.

The parties do not argue  that either case is in\r                     \n\nerror; rather,  they urge  that either  case controls  in the\n\nalternative.  We, however, read Aquenergy to be  an exception\r                                                     \n\nto  Puget Sound rather than an independent rule.  The holding\r                           \n\nin Aquenergy makes this clear: \r                        \n\n               Aquenergy  puts great  reliance upon\n          Puget Sound,  but it does not  help them,\r                                 \n          for we take no issue with the proposition\n          that  the magnitude  of the  work is  not\n          controlling  or  even   relevant.     The\n          relative magnitude of  the work in  Puget\r                                                               \n          Sound  may have  been comparable  to that\r                           \n          involved  here, but  the owner  had never\n          abandoned  the project.    It  had  moved\n          rather promptly  to put the  project back\n          into  partial  operation   and  in   full\n          operation  when  demand  for  its  output\n          justified it.\n               In great contrast, here, J.P Stevens\n          simply abandoned the project.  The entire\n          thing was  closed down.  The  turbine was\n          apparently removed, but the rest was left\n          for  deterioration to  take its  toll and\n          nature  to heal  her wounds.   After such\n          complete  abandonment  over  a period  of\n          more than 30 years, there is no basis for\n          a claim that the owner retained operating\n          rights.  The statute was designed to keep\n          in operation projects  existing in  1935,\n          but not to restore abandoned rights.\n\n857  F.2d  at  230.    Accordingly,  unless  the  abandonment\n\nexception applies, FERC has no jurisdiction over China Mill.\n\n           In  Hodgson  II  and  III,  FERC  ruled  that  the\r                                                \n\nabandonment   of   power   production   alone   and   without\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nconstruction  or  physical abandonment  gave  it jurisdiction\n\nunder Section 23(a) of  the FPA when a project  resumed power\n\nproduction.   FERC  stated  its jurisdictional  rationale  as\n\nfollows:\n\n          In  determining  whether abandonment  has\n          occurred   for    purposes   of   section\n          23(b)(1),  the  question  is not  .  .  .\n          whether  the  site  has   been  literally\n          abandoned and  left to fall into  a state\n          of disrepair.    Nor  is  the  amount  of\n          repair or reconstruction  work needed  to\n          put  the  project  back   into  operation\n          relevant.

We disagree for the following reasons.\n\n          First, FERC completely misunderstands the relevance\n\nof work to  a finding of  post-1935 construction.   Aquenergy\r                                                                         \n\ndoes state, \"the  magnitude of the work is  not controlling,\"\r                                       \n\n857 F.2d  at 229 (emphasis  added), but  at no time  does the\n\ncourt  there espouse  the notion that  the existence  of work\r                                                                \n\nitself is unnecessary for jurisdiction.   To the contrary the\n\ncourt states:\n\n          One must  look to the nature  of the work\n          and  the purpose  of  the  owner.   Major\n          repairs  may  involve  much  construction\n          activity,  but the project is not brought\n          within the  Commissions's jurisdiction if\n          work done in the  name of repair does not\n          so alter the project that it is no longer\n          what was there before 1935.\n\nId.\r               \n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          Second, FERC's order underestimates  the importance\n\nof  the  physical   act  needed  to  support  a   finding  of\n\nabandonment.   The  heart  of the  error  in Hodgson  II  and\r                                                                    \n\nHodgson III is that there was in fact no abandonment  as that\r                       \n\nword  is generally  understood.   Abandonment  is a  question\n\nwholly separate from the  statutory language of the FPA.   In\n\nno place does  the FPA define or refer  to the term \"abandon\"\n\nor  \"abandonment.\"  Aquenergy  goes to great  pains to stress\r                                         \n\nthe  physical abandonment that occurred in that case.  As the\n\ncourt observed, \"there  was no activity  at the project,  not\n\neven  minimal   maintenance\";  \"[t]he   powerhouse   .  .   .\n\ndisintegrated  or was  torn down\";  \"trees  had reestablished\n\nthemselves\"; and  \"nothing was done during those  30 years to\n\nimpede nature's reclamation of  what had been her own.\"   857\n\nF.2d  at 229.   Additionally,  in its  two and  one-half page\n\nopinion the  court  in  Aquenergy notes  the  period  of  the\r                                             \n\nabandonment, \"30 years,\" at least seven times, thus stressing\n\nthe  importance   of  physical  desertion  as   a  factor  in\n\nabandonment.  See id. at 229-30. \r                                 \n\n          The facts show that  China Mill was not \"abandoned\"\n\nin the  Aquenergy sense.  Workers  performed general cleaning\r                             \n\nand maintenance  during the shutdown period,  and the project\n\nrequired only minimal work to  restart.  Moreover, China Mill\n\nstill operated in some manner during the shutdown.   Although\n\nnot producing its own  power, China Mill was used  to control\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nand  monitor  external  power  to  the  factory  through  its\n\ngenerator  control  panel,  and  workers  checked that  panel\n\nmonthly.8   FERC does not assert that these or any activities\n\nconstituted construction,  and even  if they did,  we believe\n\nthat  they show  the  project was  not  abandoned within  the\n\nmeaning of Aquenergy.    We  believe  the   facts  here   are\r                                \n\nanalogous to those of Puget Sound, which we find controlling.\r                                             \n\nIn Puget Sound, a landslide destroyed a pre-1935 project, and\r                          \n\nwhen the  owner commenced  the extensive work  to reconstruct\n\nthe project, the FPC  claimed it needed a license.   557 F.2d\n\nat 1312.   The court disagreed and found  that reconstruction\n\ndid  not give the FPC  jurisdiction.  It  found that, because\n\nthe repairs  \"merely restored  the [project] to  its original\n\nspecifications  and  configuration,\"  \"[t]here  was   no  new\n\n'construction'.\"  Id. at 1316.

Hodgson III stated:\r                            \n          Hodgson submitted the affidavits of three\n          men who  worked at China  Mill at various\n          times  during  the  1960's,  1970's,  and\n          early   1980's.      According   to   the\n          affidavits,  mud  and  silt were  removed\n          from  the  power  canal;  the  penstocks,\n          turbines, and draft tubes  were inspected\n          annually;  the gates  at  the  upper  and\n          lower end of the power canal were checked\n          and cleaned annually;  and the  generator\n          control  panel  was   checked  at   least\n          monthly because it controlled the voltage\n          coming into the  manufacturing mill  from\n          the transmission lines of  Public Service\n          Company of New Hampshire. \n\n67 F.E.R.C. at 61,633 n.11.\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nbefore the defendant repaired and put into service two of the\n\nfour preexisting generators, the court found  no jurisdiction\n\nunder the FPA.   Id. at 1313.  The court held that repair and\r                                \n\nmaintenance construction on even a large scale do not  amount\n\nto post-1935  construction if the  scope of the  work remains\n\nwithin the  original specification of  the project.

There was \"[n]o\r                                 \n\nproject enlargement . . . in capacity, diversion, or physical\n\nplant,\"  no reconfiguration  since  1935 of  \"[t]he  original\n\nsites for  the power house,  the dam  and the flume,\"  and no\n\nchange in the electrical generating capacity since 1935.

There was,  therefore, just as  here, no post-1935\n\nconstruction, and so no jurisdiction in FERC.\n\n          We have reviewed FERC's own  cases addressing post-\n\n1935 construction,  none of  which were subject  to appellate\n\nreview,  and  they do  not lend  support  to FERC's  claim of\n\njurisdiction.

Based on its unexplained\n\n                              19\r\r\n\nassumption that  Congress could  not have intended  to divest\n\ninnocent owners of their \"grandfathered\"  power-plant operat-\n\ning rights merely for restoring to its original configuration\n\na facility  damaged in a natural disaster,  the Ninth Circuit\n\nresorted to an equitable  exception in interpreting the plain\n\nlanguage  of the  FPA  as precluding  the agency's  licensure\n\njurisdiction.  See Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co., 557 F.2d at\r                                                            \n\n1315.  The Ninth  Circuit panel pointed to no  statutory lan-\n\nguage  or  legislative  history  remotely  supportive of  its\n\nstrained  interpretation of  the statutory  term \"construct.\"\n\nSee id.  (merely  noting,  without  citation  to  legislative\r                   \n\nhistory, \"[w]e think Congress intended no such result\").  \n\n               As if to illustrate  the maxim that hard cases\n\nbeget bad  law, the Fourth  Circuit later extended  the error\n\npropounded in Puget Sound.  See Aquenergy Systs., 857 F.2d at\r                                                            \n\n227.

(Hodgson), appeals from a second order by respondent, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), denying Hodgson a rehearing, and from FERC's finding that the operation of Hodgson's China Mill hydroelectric plant (China Mill) came under the licensing jurisdiction of Section 23(b) of the Federal Power Act (FPA)2<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> pursuant to FERC's \"post-1935 construction\" rule.  FERC claims that for purposes of Section 23(b), shutting down a hydroelectric plant for twelve years after 1935 and powering it back up to its former specifications constitutes post-1935 construction without more.  Hodgson, on the other hand, claims that operating China Mill after maintaining it over the years until its use became profitable, does not amount to such construction, and that even if it does, FERC's terms in the license were unreasonable.  After reviewing the statute and pertinent case law, we conclude that FERC erred in its determination that it had jurisdiction over China Mill.I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The China Mill dam was constructed in the late 1860's as a grist mill in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, on the Suncook River, which is not navigable.  The site included the dam, diversion canal, penstocks and turbine which were installed prior to 1900.  China Mill was converted from hydromechanical to hydroelectric power before 1914.  The petitioner has owned China Mill since 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under a succession of owners, China Mill continuously produced electricity until 1969 in its present configuration.  Power generation stopped for approximately twelve years starting in 1969.  The parties dispute the nature of the stoppage.  Petitioner alleges that a natural disaster initially led to the stoppage.  Respondent asserts that the natural disaster was only a log that got caught in the project's machinery and that the true reason for the stoppage was purely economic.  During the period of non-generation, the production of power was apparently uneconomical for China Mill.  The cost of purchasing electricity was low, and no market existed for selling excess power.  For reasons to be stated, the exact cause of the hiatus in the production of electricity does not affect FERC's jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the federal enactment of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and New Hampshire's passage of the Limited Electrical Energy Producers Act (LEEPA),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Hodgson decided that it would be again profitable to produce power at China Mill.  In 1981 Hodgson started to generate power at China Mill and sold power to the Public Service Company of New Hampshire.  In September of 1989 FERC directed Hodgson to show why China Mill should not be licensed under the FPA.  At first, Hodgson did not object to obtaining a license and in fact voluntarily applied for one in March, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgson's spirit of cooperation was short lived.  In July, 1992, FERC issued Hodgson a license with conditions that included, inter alia, a minimum water flow of fifty cubic feet per second (cfs), an historic resource management plan, and aesthetic improvements to the mill building.  Thomas Hodgson and Sons, Inc., 60 F.E.R.C. p 62,071 (1992) (Hodgson I).   Hodgson objected to these conditions, especially challenging the fifty cfs requirement which it claims would result in an annual loss of over $68,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unhappy with the terms of its license, Hodgson withdrew its application<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and sought a rehearing contesting both FERC's jurisdiction and the terms of the license.  Thomas Hodgson &amp; Sons, Inc., 63 F.E.R.C. p 61,068, 1993 WL 258938 (1993) (Hodgson II).   Among its reasons for denying the rehearing, FERC stated that the generating capacity of China Mill had been increased, but that even if the capacity remained the same, the project had been abandoned and, therefore, the renewed operation constituted post-1935 construction.  Id. at 61,293.   Its determinative findings were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgson does not dispute that the Suncook River, a tributary of the Merrimack River, is a Commerce Clause water, or that the project affects interstate commerce due to its interconnection with the interstate electric grid.  However, Hodgson disputes that the development has undergone post-1935 construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the project's generating capacity from 1934 through 1939 was 1,300 kW, but some time between 1939 and 1942 the generating capacity was increased to 1,500 kW.  The installation after 1935 of additional generating capacity constitutes post-1935 construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the installed capacity of the project were unchanged after 1935, the project would still be required to be licensed.  Ordinary maintenance, repair, and reconstruction activity with respect to a project constructed before 1935 does not constitute post-1935 construction for purposes of Section 23(b)(1).  However, the pre-1935 construction exception protects only operating projects.  Where a project has been abandoned, there is no basis for a claim that the operator retains operating rights, even if the operator, after 1935, restores the project to a condition identical to its pre-abandonment status.  As noted above, the China Mill Project was abandoned in the 1960s and was not operated again until 1981.  Consequently, the renewed operation constituted post-1935 construction.   In light of all of the above, we affirm the Director's finding that the project is required to be licensed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added;  footnotes omitted).  A second petition for rehearing followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time, Hodgson, asserting its right to decline the license, petitioned this court for a stay and review of the terms of the license.  We determined that Hodgson did not accept the license but declined to stay or further review the order until FERC considered Hodgson's second petition for rehearing.  Hodgson v. F.E.R.C., No. 93-1503 (1st Cir.  May 14, 1993) (order denying stay of license terms).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second petition for rehearing, Thomas Hodgson &amp; Sons, Inc., 67 F.E.R.C. p 61,202 (1994) (Hodgson III), FERC again addressed the challenge to its jurisdiction.  We set forth FERC's pertinent findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construction activity in the maintenance and repair of existing continuously operating projects does not constitute post-1935 construction within the meaning of the FPA, so long as the construction activity does not result in such things as the enlargement of generating capacity or of the physical plant.  However, construction activity such as the construction or enlargement of a dam or other project works, including the enlargement of generating capacity, constitutes post-1935 construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>... [T]he installation of a new generator at the China Mill Project, of itself, did not result in an increase in generating capacity at the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 61, 632-33 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, if a hydroelectric project has been taken out of service for a number of years, then the restoration of generation at the project is the equivalent of post-1935 construction, even if the project has not been enlarged, and irrespective of how much or little reconstruction or refurbishment was involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 61,633 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether abandonment has occurred for purposes of section 23(b)(1), the question is not ... whether the site has been literally abandoned and left to fall into a state of disrepair.  Nor is the amount of repair or reconstruction work needed to put the project back into operation relevant.  Rather, abandonment for FPA purposes means that the hydroelectric generating function of the project has been abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.

This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Sec. 825l (b) which allows a party \"aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission ... [to] obtain a review of such order in the United States court of appeals for any circuit wherein the licensee ... is located.\"   In its petition, Hodgson challenges FERC's jurisdiction and, in the alternative, asks us to review the propriety of the requirements of the license which it claims are unreasonable.  Finding that FERC did not have jurisdiction, we do not reach the merits of the license requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review FERC's findings of fact for \"substantial evidence,\" and if so supported, such findings are conclusive.  Northeast Utils.  Serv. Co. v. F.E.R.C., 993 F.2d 937, 944 (1st Cir.1993).  On the other hand, \"[p]ure legal errors require no deference to agency expertise, and are reviewed de novo.\"  Id.;  see also Boston Edison Co. v. F.E.R.C., 856 F.2d 361, 363 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FERC asserts that this court owes deference to its finding of jurisdiction under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  Chevron held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>When a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom of the agency's policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challenge must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 866, 104 S.Ct. at 2793.   FERC misplaces its reliance on Chevron for two reasons.  First, in Chevron, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the Environmental Protection Agency based a policy on a reasonable construction of the Clean Air Act.  Id. at 840, 104 S.Ct. at 2780.   But here, FERC did not base its order on an interpretation of the FPA, but rather on its reading of judicial precedent.  Chevron and its progeny mandate deference \"when a court is reviewing an agency decision based on a statutory interpretation.\"  National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston &amp; Me.  Corp., 503 U.S. 407, 417, 112 S.Ct. 1394, 1401, 118 L.Ed.2d 52 (1992).  Because FERC did not base its jurisdiction on an interpretation of the statute but looked to case law, we owe its finding of jurisdiction no more deference than we would any lower court's analysis of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, deference to agency interpretations does not give an agency the final word on statutory meaning.  \"The judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.\"  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 2781 n. 9 (citations omitted).  The Supreme Court thus set out the rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p>Jurisdiction Under the FPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FPA provides FERC with broad but not ubiquitous power over hydroelectric facilities.  Originally, Section 23 of the FPA only provided that persons intending to construct projects<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> on nonnavigable waters<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> could file a declaration of intent at their discretion.  Farmington River Power Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 455 F.2d 86, 88 (2d Cir.1972).  The Federal Power Commission (FPC), FERC's predecessor, could then require a license before any construction continued.  Id.  If a person intending to construct a project on nonnavigable waters did not file a declaration, the FPC had no power to require a license.  Id. at 89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress amended the FPA in 1935, expanding the FPC's licensing jurisdiction to require that persons \"intending to construct a dam or other project works\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> on nonnavigable streams obtain a license.  16 U.S.C. Sec. 817(1) (emphasis added).  \"These words quite clearly indicate a prospective view.\"  Farmington River Power Co., 455 F.2d at 90;  Aquenergy Systs., Inc. v. F.E.R.C., 857 F.2d 227, 229 (4th Cir.1988) (same);  see also Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 557 F.2d 1311, 1315 (9th Cir.1977) (\"the statute is to apply only to projects begun after the effective date in 1935\").  It is the post-1935 construction of a project that triggers the licensing jurisdiction of Section 23(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All construction after 1935, however, does not translate into jurisdictional construction under the FPA merely because it post-dates the act.  Supplemental building after 1935 generally is not post-1935 construction if the work only maintains or restores a project to its former specifications.  Puget Sound, 557 F.2d at 1315.   Nor do \"repairs--even those of substantial nature--... confer jurisdiction over an otherwise exempt facility.\"  Id. at 1316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An exception to this rule arises where a project has been abandoned.  After the complete abandonment of a project, an owner no longer retains pre-1935 operating rights.  Aquenergy, 857 F.2d at 230.   In Aquenergy, the court determined that such abandonment occurred after more than thirty years of disuse and neglect which resulted in the project works being reduced to ruin.  Id. at 229.   Because the owner in Aquenergy abandoned the project, it no longer retained its pre-1935 operating rights.  Id. at 230.   Although Aquenergy creates an exception to Puget Sound, the court emphasized the lack of licensing jurisdiction under Section 23(b) for repairs and reconstruction without a finding of abandonment.  Citing the general rule for Section 23(b) the court stated, \"[a] project is not brought within the Commission's jurisdiction if work done in the name of repair does not so alter the project that it is no longer what was there before 1935.\"  Aquenergy, 857 F.2d at 229.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Hodgson and FERC rely on Puget Sound and Aquenergy.   The parties do not argue that either case is in error;  rather, they urge that either case controls in the alternative.  We, however, read Aquenergy to be an exception to Puget Sound rather than an independent rule.  The holding in Aquenergy makes this clear:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aquenergy puts great reliance upon Puget Sound, but it does not help them, for we take no issue with the proposition that the magnitude of the work is not controlling or even relevant.  The relative magnitude of the work in Puget Sound may have been comparable to that involved here, but the owner had never abandoned the project.  It had moved rather promptly to put the project back into partial operation and in full operation when demand for its output justified it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In great contrast, here, J.P Stevens simply abandoned the project.  The entire thing was closed down.  The turbine was apparently removed, but the rest was left for deterioration to take its toll and nature to heal her wounds.  After such complete abandonment over a period of more than 30 years, there is no basis for a claim that the owner retained operating rights.  The statute was designed to keep in operation projects existing in 1935, but not to restore abandoned rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">857 F.2d at 230.   Accordingly, unless the abandonment exception applies, FERC has no jurisdiction over China Mill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hodgson II and III, FERC ruled that the abandonment of power production alone and without construction or physical abandonment gave it jurisdiction under Section 23(a) of the FPA when a project resumed power production.  FERC stated its jurisdictional rationale as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>In determining whether abandonment has occurred for purposes of section 23(b)(1), the question is not ... whether the site has been literally abandoned and left to fall into a state of disrepair.  Nor is the amount of repair or reconstruction work needed to put the project back into operation relevant.  Rather, abandonment for FPA purposes means that the hydroelectric generating function of the project has been abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgson III, 67 F.E.R.C. at 61,633 (emphasis added;  footnote omitted).  We disagree for the following reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, FERC completely misunderstands the relevance of work to a finding of post-1935 construction.  Aquenergy does state, \"the magnitude of the work is not controlling,\" 857 F.2d at 229 (emphasis added), but at no time does the court there espouse the notion that the existence of work itself is unnecessary for jurisdiction.  To the contrary the court states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>One must look to the nature of the work and the purpose of the owner.  Major repairs may involve much construction activity, but the project is not brought within the Commission's jurisdiction if work done in the name of repair does not so alter the project that it is no longer what was there before 1935.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, FERC's order underestimates the importance of the physical act needed to support a finding of abandonment.  The heart of the error in Hodgson II and Hodgson III is that there was in fact no abandonment as that word is generally understood.  Abandonment is a question wholly separate from the statutory language of the FPA.  In no place does the FPA define or refer to the term \"abandon\" or \"abandonment.\"  Aquenergy goes to great pains to stress the physical abandonment that occurred in that case.  As the court observed, \"there was no activity at the project, not even minimal maintenance\";  \"[t]he powerhouse ... disintegrated or was torn down\";  \"trees had reestablished themselves\";  and \"nothing was done during those 30 years to impede nature's reclamation of what had been her own.\"  857 F.2d at 229.   Additionally, in its two and one-half page opinion the court in Aquenergy notes the period of the abandonment, \"30 years,\" at least seven times, thus stressing the importance of physical desertion as a factor in abandonment.  See id. at 229-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts show that China Mill was not \"abandoned\" in the Aquenergy sense.  Workers performed general cleaning and maintenance during the shutdown period, and the project required only minimal work to restart.  Moreover, China Mill still operated in some manner during the shutdown.  Although not producing its own power, China Mill was used to control and monitor external power to the factory through its generator control panel, and workers checked that panel monthly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  FERC does not assert that these or any activities constituted construction, and even if they did, we believe that they show the project was not abandoned within the meaning of Aquenergy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the facts here are analogous to those of Puget Sound, which we find controlling.  In Puget Sound, a landslide destroyed a pre-1935 project, and when the owner commenced the extensive work to reconstruct the project, the FPC claimed it needed a license.  557 F.2d at 1312.   The court disagreed and found that reconstruction did not give the FPC jurisdiction.  It found that, because the repairs \"merely restored the [project] to its original specifications and configuration,\" \"[t]here was no new 'construction'.\"  Id. at 1316.   Even though five years passed before the defendant repaired and put into service two of the four preexisting generators, the court found no jurisdiction under the FPA.  Id. at 1313.   The court held that repair and maintenance construction on even a large scale do not amount to post-1935 construction if the scope of the work remains within the original specification of the project.  Id. at 1315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puget Sound applies directly here.  There was \"[n]o project enlargement ... in capacity, diversion, or physical plant,\" no reconfiguration since 1935 of \"[t]he original sites for the power house, the dam and the flume,\" and no change in the electrical generating capacity since 1935.  Id. at 1316.   There was, therefore, just as here, no post-1935 construction, and so no jurisdiction in FERC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed FERC's own cases addressing post-1935 construction, none of which were subject to appellate review, and they do not lend support to FERC's claim of jurisdiction.  The cases either contradict FERC's current position, contradict each other or err for the same reasons we have stated.  See McRay Energy Inc., 57 F.E.R.C. p 61,061 (1991) (no jurisdiction over project after six-year period of \"abandonment\" and reinstallation of same generator and minimal repairs to return to service because actual construction is an essential element of Section 23(b) jurisdiction);  Yankee Hydro Corp., 52 F.E.R.C. p 61,074 (1990) (ten-year cessation of generation at flooded project where same generator was removed and later replaced was abandonment and required a license);  Theodore A. and Holly S.

In McRay Energy Inc., 57 F.E.R.C. p 61,061, FERC recognized that the resumption of power production at a pre-1935 project did not give rise to Section 23(b) jurisdiction absent actual physical construction.  In reaching its holding FERC accurately noted, \"actual construction or reconstruction of facilities is an essential element of the 'post-1935 construction' prong of section 23(b) jurisdiction, even when the project has been abandoned and restarted after 1935.\"  Id. at 61,234.   At China Mill not only was there no abandonment, there was no finding of any construction by FERC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of FERC assuming jurisdiction over China Mill is reversed with directions to dismiss the license application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costs awarded to petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concurrence follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CYR, Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the fallacy in relying on Puget Sound and Aquenergy for FERC's misinterpretation of the statutory term \"[post-1935] construction\" is plainly exposed in the majority opinion, it is neither necessary nor provident for the panel to embrace these decisions as First Circuit precedent, see supra at p. 16 (\"[W]e find [Puget Sound] controlling.\"), in the context of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue on appeal is straightforward:  whether the plain language of FPA Sec. 23(b)--requiring FERC licensure of a \"grandfathered\" facility only in the event there has been \"[post-1935] construct[ion]\"--encompasses circumstances in which no such construction has occurred, and the owner merely reopens intact physical structures following a period of closure?   If, as I respectfully submit, this question clearly must be answered in the negative, FERC's plea for Chevron deference is precluded, see Estey v. Commissioner of Maine Dep't of Human Servs., 21 F.3d 1198, 1201 (1st Cir.1994), and the court ought not venture further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion accedes to FERC's invitation to extend its licensure authority based on the reasoning in Puget Sound and Aquenergy.   In Puget Sound, however, the putative licensee unquestionably had \"constructed\" physical structures anew at the \"grandfathered\" power facility following a devastating natural disaster.  Based on its unexplained assumption that Congress could not have intended to divest innocent owners of their \"grandfathered\" power-plant operating rights merely for restoring to its original configuration a facility damaged in a natural disaster, the Ninth Circuit resorted to an equitable exception in interpreting the plain language of the FPA as precluding the agency's licensure jurisdiction.  See Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co., 557 F.2d at 1315.   The Ninth Circuit panel pointed to no statutory language or legislative history remotely supportive of its strained interpretation of the statutory term \"construct.\"   See id.  (merely noting, without citation to legislative history, \"[w]e think Congress intended no such result\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As if to illustrate the maxim that hard cases beget bad law, the Fourth Circuit later extended the error propounded in Puget Sound.   See Aquenergy Systs., 857 F.2d at 227.   Aquenergy Systems' actions clearly came under FERC jurisdiction for the simple reason that it had \"constructed\" anew, from the ground up, disintegrated structures (including an entire powerhouse) following a voluntary closure of the facility lasting thirty years.  Eschewing this plain language approach, the Aquenergy court attempted to accommodate the Puget Sound rationale by engaging in an \"abandonment\" analysis which overlooked the fact that the FPA contains not one word suggesting that Congress intended FERC licensure to turn on the licensee's (or predecessor's) \"abandonment\" of \"grandfathered\" pre-1935 \"operating rights.\"  Id. at 230 (merely concluding, without citation to legislative history, that \"[t]he [FPA] was designed to keep in operation projects existing in 1935, but not to restore abandoned rights\").  Quite the contrary, FPA Sec. 23(b) focuses unambiguously and exclusively on a specific event--the \"construction\" of physical structures at the \"grandfathered\" generating site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I wholeheartedly concur in the result reached by the court in the instant case, I cannot endorse its gratuitous adoption of the fallacious position advocated by FERC, that Aquenergy and Puget Sound are \"controlling.\"   Although those decisions apparently control FERC in the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, respectively, neither FERC nor the majority opinion suggests a sound reason for reaching out in obiter dicta to embrace the problematic FPA interpretations propounded in Puget Sound and Aquenergy.   Indeed, it is particularly ironic that we should strain to embrace them even though FERC itself has not seen fit to do so.  See McRay Energy, Inc., 57 F.E.R.C. p 61,061 (1991) (no FERC jurisdiction over project even after six-year \"abandonment,\" where facility reopened but no \"construction\" of facilities occurred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 23(b) of the original Federal Power Act, ch. 285, Sec. 23(b), 41 Stat. 1075 (1920) has been amended and codified under 16 U.S.C.

(Hodgson), appeals from a second order by respondent, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), denying Hodgson a rehearing, and from FERC's finding that the operation of Hodgson's China Mill hydroelectric plant (China Mill) came under the licensing jurisdiction of Section 23(b) of the Federal Power Act (FPA)2<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> pursuant to FERC's \"post-1935 construction\" rule.  FERC claims that for purposes of Section 23(b), shutting down a hydroelectric plant for twelve years after 1935 and powering it back up to its former specifications constitutes post-1935 construction without more.  Hodgson, on the other hand, claims that operating China Mill after maintaining it over the years until its use became profitable, does not amount to such construction, and that even if it does, FERC's terms in the license were unreasonable.  After reviewing the statute and pertinent case law, we conclude that FERC erred in its determination that it had jurisdiction over China Mill.I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The China Mill dam was constructed in the late 1860's as a grist mill in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, on the Suncook River, which is not navigable.  The site included the dam, diversion canal, penstocks and turbine which were installed prior to 1900.  China Mill was converted from hydromechanical to hydroelectric power before 1914.  The petitioner has owned China Mill since 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under a succession of owners, China Mill continuously produced electricity until 1969 in its present configuration.  Power generation stopped for approximately twelve years starting in 1969.  The parties dispute the nature of the stoppage.  Petitioner alleges that a natural disaster initially led to the stoppage.  Respondent asserts that the natural disaster was only a log that got caught in the project's machinery and that the true reason for the stoppage was purely economic.  During the period of non-generation, the production of power was apparently uneconomical for China Mill.  The cost of purchasing electricity was low, and no market existed for selling excess power.  For reasons to be stated, the exact cause of the hiatus in the production of electricity does not affect FERC's jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the federal enactment of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and New Hampshire's passage of the Limited Electrical Energy Producers Act (LEEPA),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Hodgson decided that it would be again profitable to produce power at China Mill.  In 1981 Hodgson started to generate power at China Mill and sold power to the Public Service Company of New Hampshire.  In September of 1989 FERC directed Hodgson to show why China Mill should not be licensed under the FPA.  At first, Hodgson did not object to obtaining a license and in fact voluntarily applied for one in March, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgson's spirit of cooperation was short lived.  In July, 1992, FERC issued Hodgson a license with conditions that included, inter alia, a minimum water flow of fifty cubic feet per second (cfs), an historic resource management plan, and aesthetic improvements to the mill building.  Thomas Hodgson and Sons, Inc., 60 F.E.R.C. p 62,071 (1992) (Hodgson I).   Hodgson objected to these conditions, especially challenging the fifty cfs requirement which it claims would result in an annual loss of over $68,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unhappy with the terms of its license, Hodgson withdrew its application<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and sought a rehearing contesting both FERC's jurisdiction and the terms of the license.  Thomas Hodgson &amp; Sons, Inc., 63 F.E.R.C. p 61,068, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">258938</span> </span>(1993) (Hodgson II).   Among its reasons for denying the rehearing, FERC stated that the generating capacity of China Mill had been increased, but that even if the capacity remained the same, the project had been abandoned and, therefore, the renewed operation constituted post-1935 construction.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 61,293. </span>  Its determinative findings were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgson does not dispute that the Suncook River, a tributary of the Merrimack River, is a Commerce Clause water, or that the project affects interstate commerce due to its interconnection with the interstate electric grid.  However, Hodgson disputes that the development has undergone post-1935 construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the project's generating capacity from 1934 through 1939 was 1,300 kW, but some time between 1939 and 1942 the generating capacity was increased to 1,500 kW.  The installation after 1935 of additional generating capacity constitutes post-1935 construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the installed capacity of the project were unchanged after 1935, the project would still be required to be licensed.  Ordinary maintenance, repair, and reconstruction activity with respect to a project constructed before 1935 does not constitute post-1935 construction for purposes of Section 23(b)(1).  However, the pre-1935 construction exception protects only operating projects.  Where a project has been abandoned, there is no basis for a claim that the operator retains operating rights, even if the operator, after 1935, restores the project to a condition identical to its pre-abandonment status.  As noted above, the China Mill Project was abandoned in the 1960s and was not operated again until 1981.  Consequently, the renewed operation constituted post-1935 construction.   In light of all of the above, we affirm the Director's finding that the project is required to be licensed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added; </span> footnotes omitted).

We determined that Hodgson did not accept the license but declined to stay or further review the order until FERC considered Hodgson's second petition for rehearing.  Hodgson v.

We set forth FERC's pertinent findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construction activity in the maintenance and repair of existing continuously operating projects does not constitute post-1935 construction within the meaning of the FPA, so long as the construction activity does not result in such things as the enlargement of generating capacity or of the physical plant.

The parties do not argue that either case is in error;  rather, they urge that either case controls in the alternative.  We, however, read Aquenergy to be an exception to Puget Sound rather than an independent rule.  The holding in Aquenergy makes this clear:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aquenergy puts great reliance upon Puget Sound, but it does not help them, for we take no issue with the proposition that the magnitude of the work is not controlling or even relevant.  The relative magnitude of the work in Puget Sound may have been comparable to that involved here, but the owner had never abandoned the project.  It had moved rather promptly to put the project back into partial operation and in full operation when demand for its output justified it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In great contrast, here, J.P Stevens simply abandoned the project.  The entire thing was closed down.  The turbine was apparently removed, but the rest was left for deterioration to take its toll and nature to heal her wounds.  After such complete abandonment over a period of more than 30 years, there is no basis for a claim that the owner retained operating rights.  The statute was designed to keep in operation projects existing in 1935, but not to restore abandoned rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">857 F.2d at 230.

FERC stated its jurisdictional rationale as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>In determining whether abandonment has occurred for purposes of section 23(b)(1), the question is not ... whether the site has been literally abandoned and left to fall into a state of disrepair.  Nor is the amount of repair or reconstruction work needed to put the project back into operation relevant.  Rather, abandonment for FPA purposes means that the hydroelectric generating function of the project has been abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgson III, 67 F.E.R.C. at 61,633 (emphasis added;  footnote omitted).  We disagree for the following reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, FERC completely misunderstands the relevance of work to a finding of post-1935 construction.  Aquenergy does state, \"the magnitude of the work is not <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511784\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">controlling,\"</span> <a href=\"/opinion/511784/aquenergy-systems-inc-as-general-partner-of-aquenergy-ii-limited/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">229</span> </a></span>(emphasis added), but at no time does the court there espouse the notion that the existence of work itself is unnecessary for jurisdiction.  To the contrary the court states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>One must look to the nature of the work and the purpose of the owner.  Major repairs may involve much construction activity, but the project is not brought within the Commission's jurisdiction if work done in the name of repair does not so alter the project that it is no longer what was there before 1935.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, FERC's order underestimates the importance of the physical act needed to support a finding of abandonment.  The heart of the error in Hodgson II and Hodgson III is that there was in fact no abandonment as that word is generally understood.  Abandonment is a question wholly separate from the statutory language of the FPA.  In no place does the FPA define or refer to the term \"abandon\" or \"abandonment.\"  Aquenergy goes to great pains to stress the physical abandonment that occurred in that case.  As the court observed, \"there was no activity at the project, not even minimal maintenance\";  \"[t]he powerhouse ... disintegrated or was torn down\";  \"trees had reestablished themselves\";  and \"nothing was done during those 30 years to impede nature's reclamation of what had been her <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511784\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">own.\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/511784/aquenergy-systems-inc-as-general-partner-of-aquenergy-ii-limited/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>.   Additionally, in its two and one-half page opinion the court in Aquenergy notes the period of the abandonment, \"30 years,\" at least seven times, thus stressing the importance of physical desertion as a factor in abandonment.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511784\"><a href=\"/opinion/511784/aquenergy-systems-inc-as-general-partner-of-aquenergy-ii-limited/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 229-30.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts show that China Mill was not \"abandoned\" in the Aquenergy sense.  Workers performed general cleaning and maintenance during the shutdown period, and the project required only minimal work to restart.  Moreover, China Mill still operated in some manner during the shutdown.  Although not producing its own power, China Mill was used to control and monitor external power to the factory through its generator control panel, and workers checked that panel monthly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  FERC does not assert that these or any activities constituted construction, and even if they did, we believe that they show the project was not abandoned within the meaning of Aquenergy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the facts here are analogous to those of Puget Sound, which we find controlling.  In Puget Sound, a landslide destroyed a pre-1935 project, and when the owner commenced the extensive work to reconstruct the project, the FPC claimed it needed a <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346933\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">license.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/346933/puget-sound-power-light-company-v-federal-power-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1312</span></a></span>.

Commissioner of Maine Dep't of Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668218\"><a href=\"/opinion/668218/debra-estey-v-commissioner-maine-department-of-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>, 1201 (1st Cir.1994), and the court ought not venture further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion accedes to FERC's invitation to extend its licensure authority based on the reasoning in Puget Sound and Aquenergy.   In Puget Sound, however, the putative licensee unquestionably had \"constructed\" physical structures anew at the \"grandfathered\" power facility following a devastating natural disaster.  Based on its unexplained assumption that Congress could not have intended to divest innocent owners of their \"grandfathered\" power-plant operating rights merely for restoring to its original configuration a facility damaged in a natural disaster, the Ninth Circuit resorted to an equitable exception in interpreting the plain language of the FPA as precluding the agency's licensure jurisdiction.  See Puget Sound Power &amp; Light <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346933\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/346933/puget-sound-power-light-company-v-federal-power-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1315</span></a></span>.   The Ninth Circuit panel pointed to no statutory language or legislative history remotely supportive of its strained interpretation of the statutory term \"construct.\"   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346933\"><a href=\"/opinion/346933/puget-sound-power-light-company-v-federal-power-commission/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  (merely noting, </a></span>without citation to legislative history, \"[w]e think Congress intended no such result\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As if to illustrate the maxim that hard cases beget bad law, the Fourth Circuit later extended the error propounded in Puget Sound.   See Aquenergy <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511784\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Systs.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/511784/aquenergy-systems-inc-as-general-partner-of-aquenergy-ii-limited/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>.   Aquenergy Systems' actions clearly came under FERC jurisdiction for the simple reason that it had \"constructed\" anew, from the ground up, disintegrated structures (including an entire powerhouse) following a voluntary closure of the facility lasting thirty years.  Eschewing this plain language approach, the Aquenergy court attempted to accommodate the Puget Sound rationale by engaging in an \"abandonment\" analysis which overlooked the fact that the FPA contains not one word suggesting that Congress intended FERC licensure to turn on the licensee's (or predecessor's) \"abandonment\" of \"grandfathered\" pre-1935 \"operating rights.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511784\"><a href=\"/opinion/511784/aquenergy-systems-inc-as-general-partner-of-aquenergy-ii-limited/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 230 </a></span>(merely concluding, without citation to legislative history, that \"[t]he [FPA] was designed to keep in operation projects existing in 1935, but not to restore abandoned rights\").  Quite the contrary, FPA Sec. 23(b) focuses unambiguously and exclusively on a specific event--the \"construction\" of physical structures at the \"grandfathered\" generating site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I wholeheartedly concur in the result reached by the court in the instant case, I cannot endorse its gratuitous adoption of the fallacious position advocated by FERC, that Aquenergy and Puget Sound are \"controlling.\"   Although those decisions apparently control FERC in the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, respectively, neither FERC nor the majority opinion suggests a sound reason for reaching out in obiter dicta to embrace the problematic FPA interpretations propounded in Puget Sound and Aquenergy.   Indeed, it is particularly ironic that we should strain to embrace them even though FERC itself has not seen fit to do so.  See McRay Energy, Inc., 57 F.E.R.C. p 61,061 (1991) (no FERC jurisdiction over project even after six-year \"abandonment,\" where facility reopened but no \"construction\" of facilities occurred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 23(b) of the original Federal Power Act, ch. 285, Sec. 23(b), 41 Stat. 1075 (1920) has been amended and codified under 16 U.S.C.
