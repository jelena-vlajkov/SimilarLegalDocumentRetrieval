Detecting no error, we affirm.\n\n                                I.\n                                  \n\n                          The Background\n                                        \n\n          On March 26, 1993, defendant-appellant  Jorge Gonzalez-\n\nVazquez (Gonzalez) pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import heroin,\n\nand conspiracy to  possess heroin with  the intent to  distribute\n\nit.   See  21 U.S.C.     963,  846, 952(a),  and 841(a)(1).   The\n         \n\ncharges  grew out of a sophisticated scheme or series of schemes,\n\nlasting   more  than  15  months,   in  which  appellant  and  23\n\ncodefendants imported  large quantities of heroin  from Hong Kong\n\ninto  the United  States,  and then  distributed  it.   Appellant\n\nplayed numerous  roles in  this elaborate plot,  sometimes buying\n\nheroin   overseas,   sometimes   purveying  drugs   domestically,\n\nsometimes  acting  as  a  courier, and  sometimes  serving  as  a\n\nbodyguard.\n\n          In return for  appellant's guilty plea,  the government\n\nagreed to recommend a sentence  at the low end  of the GSR    but\n\nthe agreement contained  no stipulation as  to the parameters  of\n\nthe  GSR.   The  government also  agreed  to drop  several  other\n\ncharges  levelled  against   appellant.    One  charge   remained\n\nunresolved:   a count accusing appellant of using or possessing a\n\nfirearm  during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, in\n\n                                2\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).1  As to that  count, the plea\n\nagreement preserved appellant's right to trial.\n\n          Approximately  four months  after tendering  his guilty\n\nplea,  appellant moved to withdraw it.  The district court denied\n\nhis  motion.    At  the disposition  hearing,  the  court invoked\n\nU.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1)  and boosted  the base offense  level (BOL)\n\nfor appellant's possession of  a dangerous weapon.2   After other\n\nadjustments had been made  and appellant's criminal history score\n\nhad  been computed,  a  GSR  of  262-327  months  emerged.    The\n\nprosecution recommended an incarcerative sentence at the nadir of\n\nthe range,  and the district  court obliged.   Apparently content\n\nnot to exact a last pound  of flesh, the government then moved to\n\ndismiss the  unresolved firearms  count.   The court granted  the\n\ngovernment's motion.  This appeal followed.\n\n                    \n\n     1The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Whoever,  during  and  in  relation  to  any  crime  of\n          violence or  drug trafficking crime  (including a crime\n          of violence  or drug  trafficking crime  which provides\n          for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a\n          deadly or dangerous weapon or device)  for which he may\n          be  prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or\n          carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n          provided   for  such   crime  of   violence,  or   drug\n          trafficking  crime, be  sentenced  to imprisonment  for\n          five years. . . . \n\n18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1)(1988). \n\n     2The applicable guideline, U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1)(Nov. 1992),\ndirects  the sentencing court, if it finds that during the course\nof the  crime  the  defendant  possessed    \"a  dangerous  weapon\n(including a firearm),\" to add two levels.\n\n                                3\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                      The Motion to Withdraw\n                                            \n\n          Appellant challenges the district court's denial of his\n\nplea-withdrawal motion,  asserting that  he advanced a  \"fair and\n\njust  reason\"  for  retracting  his  guilty  plea, and  that  the\n\ndistrict  court should have given him safe passage.  His asserted\n\nreason masquerades as a claim that, when he tendered his plea, he\n\ndid  not   fully  understand  its  consequences.     Stripped  of\n\nrhetorical  flourishes,  however,   appellant's  core   complaint\n\nappears to be  that he did not  realize that his GSR would  be so\n\nformidable.\n\n          Even prior  to the imposition of  sentence, a defendant\n\ndoes not have  an unqualified  right to withdraw  a guilty  plea.\n\nSee  United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 371 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1994);  United States  v. Buckley,  847 F.2d  991, 998  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1015 (1989).  Rather, a presentence\n                   \n\nmotion to retract a plea can be granted \"only upon an affirmative\n\nshowing of a 'fair  and just reason.'\"  Parrilla-Tirado,  22 F.3d\n                                                       \n\nat  371  (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P.  32(d)).3   The  burden  of proof\n\nrests with the  defendant.  See  United States v. De  Alba Pagan,\n                                                                \n\n    F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1994) [No. 93-2018, slip op. at 2-3];\n\nParrilla-Tirado,  22 F.3d at 371.   In deference  to the intimate\n               \n\ntri-cornered  relationship  among  trial  judge,  prosecutor, and\n\n                    \n\n     3Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) states in pertinent part:  \"If a motion\nfor withdrawal  of a plea of guilty . . . is made before sentence\nis  imposed, the court may  permit withdrawal of  the plea upon a\nshowing by the defendant of any fair and just reason.\"\n\n                                4\n\ncriminal defendant,  we review  a  district court's  denial of  a\n\nrequest to withdraw a guilty plea solely for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee  United States v.  Doyle, 981 F.2d 591,  594 (1st Cir. 1992);\n                            \n\nUnited States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1538 (1st Cir. 1989). \n                          \n\n          Federal  courts use a  multi-factor test  as an  aid in\n\nascertaining whether a proffered  reason for withdrawal meets the\n\ncriteria  of Rule  32(d).  This  test is familiar,  see, e.g., De\n                                                                 \n\nAlba Pagan,     F.3d  at     [slip op. at  2-3]; Parrilla-Tirado,\n                                                                \n\n22 F.3d  at 371; Doyle, 981  F.2d at 594; Pellerito,  878 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n1537,  and  does  not  bear  reiteration.    Instead,  we proceed\n\ndirectly to a factor-by-factor examination of appellant's plaint.\n\n          1.   Plausibility.  Appellant claims  that his decision\n          1.   Plausibility.\n                           \n\nto  plead guilty  was based  upon the  government's  agreement to\n\nrecommend a sentence at the low end of the GSR   a recommendation\n\nthat, to appellant's way of thinking, meant 210 months.  But that\n\nassumption stemmed from a miscalculation on  appellant's part   a\n\nmiscalculation  fueled by his hope that there would be no weapons\n\nenhancement.  It is a  fact of law and life, too basic to warrant\n\ncitation of authority, that  a criminal defendant cannot jettison\n\na  guilty  plea knowingly,  intelligently,  and voluntarily  made\n\nmerely because the sentencing judge calls  a tune that is not  to\n\nthe defendant's taste.  It is a corollary of this principle that,\n\nas we recently stated in a case comparable to this one, \"the fact\n\nthat a defendant  misapprehends the  likely guideline  sentencing\n\nrange  does not constitute a fair and just reason for withdrawing\n\na guilty plea.\"  De Alba Pagan,      F.3d at     [slip  op at 4];\n                              \n\n                                5\n\naccord United States  v. Williams, 919  F.2d 1451, 1456-57  (10th\n                                 \n\nCir. 1990), cert. denied,  499 U.S. 968 (1991); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nGarcia, 909 F.2d  1346, 1348  (9th Cir. 1990);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nBradley, 905 F.2d  359, 360  (11th Cir. 1990);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nStephens, 906 F.2d  251, 253  (6th Cir. 1990);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nJones, 905 F.2d  867, 868-69  (5th Cir. 1990);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nSweeney, 878 F.2d 68, 69-71 (2d Cir. 1989).\n       \n\n          This is  a particularly  weak case for  a defendant  to\n\nsuggest  that we  should bend the  rule.   The transcript  of the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing  makes it  pellucid that Gonzalez  knew at\n\nthe  time that, regardless of  the eventual outcome  of the then-\n\nunresolved  weapons charge,  he  still faced  the prospect  of an\n\nenhanced  BOL at  sentencing.   During the  hearing,  his counsel\n\nstated in open court and in appellant's presence:\n\n          I have also informed  Mr. Gonzalez that it is\n          the position  of the U.S.  attorney that,  in\n          the event  that he would be  acquitted of the\n          gun charge, that is count 23, that they could\n          ask  or it could be possible that he would be\n          found  with a  two point  enhancement  at the\n          moment of the sentencing hearing.\n\nCounsel added  that he  explained  to Gonzalez  that this  tactic\n\n\"could possibly increase  his offense level.  . . .\"   Hence, the\n\nambush of which  appellant now  complains was no  ambush at  all,\n\nbut,  rather, a  frontal  assault, with  the government's  troops\n\nmarshalled in  plain  view from  the very  onset of  hostilities.\n\nAppellant's articulated reason for  seeking to scuttle his guilty\n\nplea is, therefore, not plausible.\n\n          2.   Timing.   The timing  of  a motion  to withdraw  a\n          2.   Timing.\n                     \n\n                                6\n\nguilty  plea often serves as a gauge for measuring the legitimacy\n\nof a proffered  reason.   Belated requests, even  if made  before\n\nsentencing,    are    generally   regarded    as   afterthoughts.\n\nConsequently,  the \"longer  a  defendant waits  before moving  to\n\nwithdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order\n\nto gain  favorable consideration.\"   Parrilla-Tirado, 22  F.3d at\n                                                    \n\n373; accord Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595; Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1541.\n                                             \n\n          Here, appellant waited approximately four  months after\n\npleading  guilty  and  two  months   after  the  release  of  his\n\npresentence investigation report  (PSI Report)  before moving  to\n\nretract  his plea.4  Given the totality of the circumstances that\n\npertain here,  appellant's lassitude serves  to cast considerable\n\ndoubt  upon the legitimacy of his professed reason for seeking to\n\nchange course.\n\n          3.   Assertion of Innocence.  \"In determining whether a\n          3.   Assertion of Innocence.\n                                     \n\nproposed  plea  withdrawal  is   fair  and  just,  a  defendant's\n\nassertion  of  innocence  may  weight  the  scales  in  favor  of\n\nwithdrawal, and conversely,  the absence of a  claim of innocence\n\nweights the opposite pan of the scale.\"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d\n                                                                 \n\nat 373; accord United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449,  455 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1983).   Appellant did  not proclaim  his innocence  in his\n\nplea-withdrawal  motion.   To  the contrary,  at the  disposition\n\n                    \n\n     4The  chronology is  as follows.   Appellant pled  guilty on\nMarch   26,  1993.    New  counsel  entered  the  case  ten  days\nthereafter.  The  probation department issued  the PSI Report  on\nJune 1, 1993.   On August 9, 1993, appellant  filed his motion to\nwithdraw his guilty plea.  The district court sentenced appellant\non August 19, 1993.\n\n                                7\n\nhearing he stated;  \"I know I committed a crime and I have to pay\n\nfor it.\"   Appellant's explicit admission of  his guilt militates\n\nstrongly against disturbing the ruling below.\n\n          4.   Voluntariness.  In reviewing the merits of a plea-\n          4.   Voluntariness.\n                            \n\nwithdrawal motion, an inquiring  court must determine whether, in\n\nlight  of the  defendant's proffered  reason and any  other newly\n\ndisclosed facts, the  guilty plea can  still be deemed  voluntary\n\nand intelligent.  See United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 786-\n                                             \n\n87  (1st Cir.  1991).    Appellant  makes  no  challenge  to  the\n\nsufficiency  of the Rule 11 proceeding in this case, and, indeed,\n\nthe colloquy is a model of thoroughness.\n\n          We need go no further.   It is apparent that no hint of\n\nerror tainted the  district court's refusal to allow appellant to\n\nretract  his guilty  plea.   Consequently,  Gonzalez's conviction\n\nmust stand.\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                           The Sentence\n                                       \n\n          Appellant also challenges the district court's reliance\n\non  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(b)(1)  in  the  course  of  formulating  his\n\nsentence.    He maintains  that  his  alleged possession  of  the\n\nfirearm, and, hence, the applicability of the guideline,  was not\n\nproven by a fair preponderance of the  evidence; and that, in any\n\nevent,  the  guideline's  applicability had  to  be  demonstrated\n\nbeyond a  reasonable doubt inasmuch as the increase imposed under\n\nthe  guideline  is  in  reality  an additional  sentence,  not  a\n\nsentencing enhancement.

Sufficiency  of  the Proof.\n                                         \n\nsentencing  sortie  is effortlessly  repulsed.    In gauging  the\n\nsufficiency of the factual foundation on which a  sentence rests,\n\nwe must \"accept the findings of fact of the district court unless\n\nthey are clearly erroneous,\" while at the same time \"giv[ing] due\n\ndeference to  the district court's application  of the guidelines\n\nto  the facts.\"  18 U.S.C.    3742(e); see United States v. Ruiz,\n                                                                \n\n905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v.

This  conclusion is  reached more\n\neasily   because   of   the  Sentencing   Commission's   specific\n\ninstruction that  section 2D1.1(b)(1)  \"should be applied  if the\n\nweapon was  present,  unless it  is clearly  improbable that  the\n\nweapon was  connected with the offense.\"   U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1),\n\ncomment.  A sentencing court must,  of course, honor this type of\n\ninstruction.   See, e.g., United  States v. Fiore, 983  F.2d 1, 2\n                                                 \n\n(1st Cir.  1992)  (explaining that  the  Sentencing  Commission's\n\ninterpretation  of a  guideline should be  followed unless  it is\n\n\"arbitrary, unreasonable, inconsistent with the guideline's text,\n\nor contrary to law\"), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1830 (1993).\n                                  \n\n          Here,  the record  supports  a  finding that  appellant\n\nserved as a bodyguard while one of  his coconspirators negotiated\n\nthe terms of a proposed narcotics transaction with a confidential\n\ninformant.  It likewise supports a finding that appellant carried\n\n                                9\n\na pistol during  the encounter.5   Under these circumstances,  we\n\nmust  uphold the district court's conclusion that, on the date of\n\nappellant's  arrest, he possessed a  firearm in the  course of an\n\naborted drug transaction.  \n\n          Appellant  tries  to  stave  off  the near-irresistible\n\nforce of these findings in two ways.  First, he suggests that, to\n\nwarrant an adjustment under  U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1), the  evidence\n\nmust  establish the same panoply  of elements that  are needed to\n\nprove the statutory \"carrying and use\" of a weapon in furtherance\n\nof  a drug crime, see 18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1).6  The suggestion is\n                     \n\nfanciful, for  the guideline  can be triggered  with considerably\n\ngreater ease.\n\n          The point is readily  susceptible to illustration.  For\n\none  thing, while  mere possession  of a  firearm during  a drug-\n\ntrafficking episode does not satisfy the elements of the statute,\n\nsee United States  v. Castro-Lara,  970 F.2d 976,  983 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 2935 (1993), the reverse is often\n                   \n\ntrue under the guideline, see, e.g., Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 507 (\"Mere\n                                         \n\n                    \n\n     5The  government  suggests,  with  some  foundation  in  the\nrecord,  that  when  the  drug  deal  began  to  sour,  appellant\nattempted to use  the pistol against a federal agent.  Because we\ndo not  need to reach the  question of whether the  proof here is\nsufficient  to support a conviction  under 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1),\nwe abjure comment on the reliability of the evidence underpinning\nthis more menacing scenario.\n\n     6The  reader  will recall  that  the  grand jury  originally\ncharged appellant  under that  statute; that  the charge  was not\ncompromised  as  part of  the  plea agreement;  that  the parties\nanticipated  that  the section  924(c)(1)  count  would be  tried\nsubsequently; and  that, eventually, the  government dropped  the\ncharge. \n\n                                10\n\npossession of a firearm can trigger the two level increase; there\n\nis no requirement that  the gun actually be used  in perpetrating\n\nthe drug crime, or that such use be intended,\"); United States v.\n                                                              \n\nGreen, 889 F.2d 187, 189 (8th Cir. 1989) (similar); United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Paulino,  887 F.2d 358,  360 (1st  Cir. 1989) (similar).   For\n          \n\nanother thing,  the \"clearly  improbable\"  language quoted  above\n\nmakes a huge  difference.   Under the  statute, the  government's\n\nburden of persuasion never varies.  Under the guideline, however,\n\nonce the underlying crime and the presence of a firearm have been\n\nestablished,  the burden then shifts to the defendant to show, or\n\nat  least produce  some evidence  of, \"the  existence of  special\n\ncircumstances that would render  it 'clearly improbable' that the\n\nweapon's presence has a connection to the narcotics trafficking.\"\n\nUnited States v. Corcimiglia,  967 F.2d 724, 728 (1st  Cir. 1992)\n                            \n\n(quoting  Commentary).     This   distinction  is   of  paramount\n\nimportance here, as the record justifies a finding of possession,\n\nand appellant has  neither produced nor pointed to  the existence\n\nof any  evidence indicating  the improbability of  a facilitative\n\nnexus between the gun and the crime.\n\n          Appellant's  next effort at  annihilating the two-level\n\nincrease  amounts  to  an  attack  on  the  reliability   of  the\n\ngovernment's  proof.   The fusillade  misses the  target.   To be\n\nsure, the court's findings are based primarily on the PSI Report,\n\nwhich,  in   turn,  relies  heavily  on   grand  jury  testimony,\n\ncoconspirators'  statements, and other  hearsay.  But appellant's\n\ncastigation  of this  evidence  overlooks the  special nature  of\n\n                                11\n\nsentencing proceedings.  In  the sentencing phase of a  case, the\n\nFederal  Rules  of  Evidence  do   not  apply.    Thus,  \"[f]acts\n\ncontained  in  a  presentence  report ordinarily  are  considered\n\nreliable  evidence for  sentencing purposes.\"   United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nMorillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing cases).  By like\n       \n\ntoken,  grand  jury testimony  may  be  consulted for  sentencing\n\npurposes.  See United  States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d  33, 36\n                                               \n\n(1st  Cir.  1990) (\"The  sentencing court  is  free to  rely upon\n\noutside evidence, including hearsay  evidence that has never been\n\nsubject  to  cross-examination.\"),  cert.  denied, 500  U.S.  927\n                                                 \n\n(1991).   Particularly where, as here, the defense has adduced no\n\ncountervailing evidence,  the district court is  entitled to rely\n\nupon the PSI  Report, grand  jury testimony, and  the like.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMorillo, 8  F.3d at 872; United States v.

Use  of the  Preponderance Standard.\n                                                  \n\nfallback  position is  that,  even if  the  proof suffices  on  a\n\npreponderance standard, using that standard transgresses his  due\n\nprocess  rights.   He hinges this  claim on  the thesis  that the\n\nincrease in his sentence  attributable to the section 2D1.1(b)(1)\n\nadjustment  (agreed by  the parties  to have  been 52  months) is\n\nroughly  equivalent  to  the  length  of  the  mandatory  minimum\n\nsentence for  violating 18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1) (60  months), and,\n\ntherefore, demands proof  beyond a reasonable  doubt.  Though  we\n\ngive  appellant's counsel  high marks  for ingenuity,  his thesis\n\n                                12\n\ndoes not earn a passing grade.\n\n          In  the first  place,  appellant failed  to unfurl  the\n\nthesis  in the  lower  court.   Accordingly,  it is  procedurally\n\ndefaulted  and merits rejection on  that bias alone.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Dietz,  950  F.2d 50,  55 (1st  Cir.  1991) (\"We  have\n                \n\nrepeatedly  ruled,  in connection  with  sentencing  as in  other\n\ncontexts, that  arguments not  seasonably addressed to  the trial\n\ncourt  may not  be  raised for  the first  time  in an  appellate\n\nvenue.\") (collecting cases).\n\n          In the second place, the thesis lacks substance.  It is\n\nwell settled that  a sentencing proceeding differs  from a trial;\n\nby  definition, the  defendant's guilt  has been  established the\n\npresumption of innocence  has dissipated, and,  consequently, the\n\nprosecution need not  prove the  facts upon which  it relies  for\n\nsentencing purposes beyond a  reasonable doubt.  See McMillan  v.\n                                                             \n\nPennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79,  91 (1986); United States  v.

Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 509 (1st  Cir. 1993);\n                              \n\nsee also  Mocciola, 891 F.2d  at 17 (holding that  even the facts\n                  \n\nunderlying  a  prior  acquittal  on  a   weapons  charge  may  be\n\nconsidered by  the sentencing  court for  enhancement purposes).7\n\nWe see  no reason why  the same rule  should not apply  where, as\n\nhere, the prosecution simply dismisses the weapons count.  And we\n\nthink it  is immaterial  that, in  the plea  agreement, appellant\n\nreserved the right to trial on the statutory weapons charge.\n\n          Appellant makes a last-ditch  effort to salvage his due\n\nprocess claim.  He revives the infamous  \"Catch-22\" argument that\n\nthis  court rejected in Mocciola, but with a twist.  In Mocciola,\n                                                                \n\nthe defendant, who  was charged  with both  drug trafficking  and\n\nviolating  section  924(c), argued  that the  weapons enhancement\n\npermitted  by the  guidelines  created a  \"Catch-22\" because,  in\n\nrespect  to the firearms charge, whether he pled guilty or earned\n\nan  acquittal after trial did  not really matter.   See Mocciola,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     7Mocciola  is  a  mainstream  holding,  not,   as  appellant\n              \nportrays it, a waif  in the wilderness.  See, e.g.  United States\n                                                                 \nv.

We dismissed this  argument, reasoning that it\n\n\"misperceives the  distinction between a sentence  and a sentence\n\nenhancement.\"  Id.  at 17.  In so holding,  we commented that the\n                  \n\nguideline adjustment added only  15 months to Mocciola's sentence\n\nwhile  a  conviction  under  the  statute  would have  yielded  a\n\nmandatory 60-month consecutive sentence.\n\n          Appellant  pounces on  this comment.   He  contrasts it\n\nwith  his situation,  observing that  the additional  time tacked\n\nonto  his sentence as a  result of the  guideline enhancement (52\n\nmonths) is  nearly equal  to the prescribed  statutory punishment\n\n(60 months).   We do not believe  that this circumstance makes  a\n\nlegally relevant difference.\n\n          A sentence  is a sentence.   Conversely, an enhancement\n\nis an enhancement   here, two levels, regardless of the BOL   and\n\nthe  incremental  effect of  the  enhancement  on any  particular\n\nsentence  is  the  product of  the  interaction  of  a myriad  of\n\nfactors.   The  increase in  the  ensuing sentence,  whatever the\n\nduration, neither alters the enhancement's  fundamental character\n\nnor  bears on whether the facts underlying it must be established\n\nby a different quantum of proof.  Cf. United States v. Rehal, 940\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1, 6  (1st Cir.  1991) (holding  that enhancing  a sentence\n\nbecause of  a defendant's  perjurious testimony does  not require\n\nproof by  the same standard as a perjury charge, but need only be\n\nproved  by  a  preponderance   of  the  evidence).

See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 963, 846, 952(a), and 841(a)(1).  The charges grew out of a sophisticated scheme or series of schemes, lasting more than 15 months, in which appellant and 23 codefendants imported large quantities of heroin from Hong Kong into the United States, and then distributed it.  Appellant played numerous roles in this elaborate plot, sometimes buying heroin overseas, sometimes purveying drugs domestically, sometimes acting as a courier, and sometimes serving as a bodyguard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return for appellant's guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of the GSR--but the agreement contained no stipulation as to the parameters of the GSR.  The government also agreed to drop several other charges levelled against appellant.  One charge remained unresolved:  a count accusing appellant of using or possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As to that count, the plea agreement preserved appellant's right to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately four months after tendering his guilty plea, appellant moved to withdraw it.  The district court denied his motion.  At the disposition hearing, the court invoked U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) and boosted the base offense level (BOL) for appellant's possession of a dangerous weapon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After other adjustments had been made and appellant's criminal history score had been computed, a GSR of 262-327 months emerged.  The prosecution recommended an incarcerative sentence at the nadir of the range, and the district court obliged.  Apparently content not to exact a last pound of flesh, the government then moved to dismiss the unresolved firearms count.  The court granted the government's motion.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Motion to Withdraw</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges the district court's denial of his plea-withdrawal motion, asserting that he advanced a \"fair and just reason\" for retracting his guilty plea, and that the district court should have given him safe passage.  His asserted reason masquerades as a claim that, when he tendered his plea, he did not fully understand its consequences.  Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, however, appellant's core complaint appears to be that he did not realize that his GSR would be so formidable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even prior to the imposition of sentence, a defendant does not have an unqualified right to withdraw a guilty plea.  See United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 371 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Buckley, 847 F.2d 991, 998 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1015, 109 S.Ct. 808, 102 L.Ed.2d 798 (1989).  Rather, a presentence motion to retract a plea can be granted \"only upon an affirmative showing of a 'fair and just reason.' \"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371 (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The burden of proof rests with the defendant.  See United States v. De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir.1994);  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371.   In deference to the intimate tri-cornered relationship among trial judge, prosecutor, and criminal defendant, we review a district court's denial of a request to withdraw a guilty plea solely for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1538 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts use a multi-factor test as an aid in ascertaining whether a proffered reason for withdrawal meets the criteria of Rule 32(d).  This test is familiar, see, e.g., De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d at 126-27;  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371;  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 594;  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1537, and does not bear reiteration.  Instead, we proceed directly to a factor-by-factor examination of appellant's plaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Plausibility.   Appellant claims that his decision to plead guilty was based upon the government's agreement to recommend a sentence at the low end of the GSR--a recommendation that, to appellant's way of thinking, meant 210 months.  But that assumption stemmed from a miscalculation on appellant's part--a miscalculation fueled by his hope that there would be no weapons enhancement.  It is a fact of law and life, too basic to warrant citation of authority, that a criminal defendant cannot jettison a guilty plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made merely because the sentencing judge calls a tune that is not to the defendant's taste.  It is a corollary of this principle that, as we recently stated in a case comparable to this one, \"the fact that a defendant misapprehends the likely guideline sentencing range does not constitute a fair and just reason for withdrawing a guilty plea.\"  De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d at 127;  accord United States v. Williams, 919 F.2d 1451, 1456-57 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 968, 111 S.Ct. 1604, 113 L.Ed.2d 667 (1991);  United States v. Garcia, 909 F.2d 1346, 1348 (9th Cir.1990);  United States v. Bradley, 905 F.2d 359, 360 (11th Cir.1990);  United States v. Stephens, 906 F.2d 251, 253 (6th Cir.1990);  United States v. Jones, 905 F.2d 867, 868-69 (5th Cir.1990);  United States v. Sweeney, 878 F.2d 68, 69-71 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a particularly weak case for a defendant to suggest that we should bend the rule.  The transcript of the change-of-plea hearing makes it pellucid that Gonzalez knew at the time that, regardless of the eventual outcome of the then-unresolved weapons charge, he still faced the prospect of an enhanced BOL at sentencing.  During the hearing, his counsel stated in open court and in appellant's presence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>I have also informed Mr. Gonzalez that it is the position of the U.S. attorney that, in the event that he would be acquitted of the gun charge, that is count 23, that they could ask or it could be possible that he would be found with a two point enhancement at the moment of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel added that he explained to Gonzalez that this tactic \"could possibly increase his offense level....\"  Hence, the ambush of which appellant now complains was no ambush at all, but, rather, a frontal assault, with the government's troops marshalled in plain view from the very onset of hostilities.  Appellant's articulated reason for seeking to scuttle his guilty plea is, therefore, not plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Timing.  The timing of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea often serves as a gauge for measuring the legitimacy of a proffered reason.  Belated requests, even if made before sentencing, are generally regarded as afterthoughts.  Consequently, the \"longer a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order to gain favorable consideration.\"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373;  accord Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595;  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1541.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, appellant waited approximately four months after pleading guilty and two months after the release of his presentence investigation report (PSI Report) before moving to retract his plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Given the totality of the circumstances that pertain here, appellant's lassitude serves to cast considerable doubt upon the legitimacy of his professed reason for seeking to change course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Assertion of Innocence.  \"In determining whether a proposed plea withdrawal is fair and just, a defendant's assertion of innocence may weight the scales in favor of withdrawal, and conversely, the absence of a claim of innocence weights the opposite pan of the scale.\"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373;  accord United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 455 (1st Cir.1983).  Appellant did not proclaim his innocence in his plea-withdrawal motion.  To the contrary, at the disposition hearing he stated;  \"I know I committed a crime and I have to pay for it.\"   Appellant's explicit admission of his guilt militates strongly against disturbing the ruling below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Voluntariness.   In reviewing the merits of a plea-withdrawal motion, an inquiring court must determine whether, in light of the defendant's proffered reason and any other newly disclosed facts, the guilty plea can still be deemed voluntary and intelligent.  See United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 786-87 (1st Cir.1991).  Appellant makes no challenge to the sufficiency of the Rule 11 proceeding in this case, and, indeed, the colloquy is a model of thoroughness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  It is apparent that no hint of error tainted the district court's refusal to allow appellant to retract his guilty plea.  Consequently, Gonzalez's conviction must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also challenges the district court's reliance on U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) in the course of formulating his sentence.  He maintains that his alleged possession of the firearm, and, hence, the applicability of the guideline, was not proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence;  and that, in any event, the guideline's applicability had to be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt inasmuch as the increase imposed under the guideline is in reality an additional sentence, not a sentencing enhancement.  We do not accept either contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the Proof.   Appellant's initial sentencing sortie is effortlessly repulsed.  In gauging the sufficiency of the factual foundation on which a sentence rests, we must \"accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous,\" while at the same time \"giv[ing] due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e);  see United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the district court's factfinding survives clear-error review.  This conclusion is reached more easily because of the Sentencing Commission's specific instruction that section 2D1.1(b)(1) \"should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1), comment.  A sentencing court must, of course, honor this type of instruction.  See, e.g., United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that the Sentencing Commission's interpretation of a guideline should be followed unless it is \"arbitrary, unreasonable, inconsistent with the guideline's text, or contrary to law\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1830, 123 L.Ed.2d 458 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record supports a finding that appellant served as a bodyguard while one of his coconspirators negotiated the terms of a proposed narcotics transaction with a confidential informant.  It likewise supports a finding that appellant carried a pistol during the encounter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Under these circumstances, we must uphold the district court's conclusion that, on the date of appellant's arrest, he possessed a firearm in the course of an aborted drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant tries to stave off the near-irresistible force of these findings in two ways.  First, he suggests that, to warrant an adjustment under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1), the evidence must establish the same panoply of elements that are needed to prove the statutory \"carrying and use\" of a weapon in furtherance of a drug crime, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The suggestion is fanciful, for the guideline can be triggered with considerably greater ease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point is readily susceptible to illustration.  For one thing, while mere possession of a firearm during a drug-trafficking episode does not satisfy the elements of the statute, see United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 983 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993), the reverse is often true under the guideline, see, e.g., Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 507 (\"Mere possession of a firearm can trigger the two level increase;  there is no requirement that the gun actually be used in perpetrating the drug crime, or that such use be intended,\");  United States v. Green, 889 F.2d 187, 189 (8th Cir.1989) (similar);  United States v. Paulino, 887 F.2d 358, 360 (1st Cir.1989) (similar).  For another thing, the \"clearly improbable\" language quoted above makes a huge difference.  Under the statute, the government's burden of persuasion never varies.  Under the guideline, however, once the underlying crime and the presence of a firearm have been established, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show, or at least produce some evidence of, \"the existence of special circumstances that would render it 'clearly improbable' that the weapon's presence has a connection to the narcotics trafficking.\"  United States v. Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 728 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Commentary).  This distinction is of paramount importance here, as the record justifies a finding of possession, and appellant has neither produced nor pointed to the existence of any evidence indicating the improbability of a facilitative nexus between the gun and the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's next effort at annihilating the two-level increase amounts to an attack on the reliability of the government's proof.  The fusillade misses the target.  To be sure, the court's findings are based primarily on the PSI Report, which, in turn, relies heavily on grand jury testimony, coconspirators' statements, and other hearsay.  But appellant's castigation of this evidence overlooks the special nature of sentencing proceedings.  In the sentencing phase of a case, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply.  Thus, \"[f]acts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.\"  United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir.1993) (citing cases).  By like token, grand jury testimony may be consulted for sentencing purposes.  See United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir.1990) (\"The sentencing court is free to rely upon outside evidence, including hearsay evidence that has never been subject to cross-examination.\"), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 927, 111 S.Ct. 2039, 114 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991).  Particularly where, as here, the defense has adduced no countervailing evidence, the district court is entitled to rely upon the PSI Report, grand jury testimony, and the like.  See Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872;  United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Iguaran-Palmar, 926 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1991);  Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 508.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Use of the Preponderance Standard.   Appellant's fallback position is that, even if the proof suffices on a preponderance standard, using that standard transgresses his due process rights.  He hinges this claim on the thesis that the increase in his sentence attributable to the section 2D1.1(b)(1) adjustment (agreed by the parties to have been 52 months) is roughly equivalent to the length of the mandatory minimum sentence for violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1) (60 months), and, therefore, demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Though we give appellant's counsel high marks for ingenuity, his thesis does not earn a passing grade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, appellant failed to unfurl the thesis in the lower court.  Accordingly, it is procedurally defaulted and merits rejection on that basis alone.  See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (\"We have repeatedly ruled, in connection with sentencing as in other contexts, that arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time in an appellate venue.\")  (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the thesis lacks substance.  It is well settled that a sentencing proceeding differs from a trial;  by definition, the defendant's guilt has been established the presumption of innocence has dissipated, and, consequently, the prosecution need not prove the facts upon which it relies for sentencing purposes beyond a reasonable doubt.  See McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 91, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 2418-19, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986);  United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1289 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 441 (1st Cir.1989).  This rule does not offend due process.  See McMillan, 477 U.S. at 91, 106 S.Ct. at 2418-19;  see also United States v. Vinson, 886 F.2d 740, 742 (4th Cir.1989) (holding that in sentencing proceedings due process does not necessitate a level of proof greater than a preponderance of the evidence), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1062, 110 S.Ct. 878, 107 L.Ed.2d 961 (1990).  Inspected in this light, appellant's constitutional challenge fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does it make a significant difference that the government originally pressed charges under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1), quoted supra note 1.  After all, the fact that a defendant is not charged, or could not be convicted, under section 924(c) is not determinative of whether a weapons enhancement may be appropriate under the sentencing guidelines.  See United States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 509 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Mocciola, 891 F.2d at 17 (holding that even the facts underlying a prior acquittal on a weapons charge may be considered by the sentencing court for enhancement purposes).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We see no reason why the same rule should not apply where, as here, the prosecution simply dismisses the weapons count.  And we think it is immaterial that, in the plea agreement, appellant reserved the right to trial on the statutory weapons charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes a last-ditch effort to salvage his due process claim.  He revives the infamous \"Catch-22\" argument that this court rejected in Mocciola, but with a twist.  In Mocciola, the defendant, who was charged with both drug trafficking and violating section 924(c), argued that the weapons enhancement permitted by the guidelines created a \"Catch-22\" because, in respect to the firearms charge, whether he pled guilty or earned an acquittal after trial did not really matter.  See Mocciola, 891, F.2d at 17.   We dismissed this argument, reasoning that it \"misperceives the distinction between a sentence and a sentence enhancement.\"  Id. at 17.   In so holding, we commented that the guideline adjustment added only 15 months to Mocciola's sentence while a conviction under the statute would have yielded a mandatory 60-month consecutive sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant pounces on this comment.  He contrasts it with his situation, observing that the additional time tacked onto his sentence as a result of the guideline enhancement (52 months) is nearly equal to the prescribed statutory punishment (60 months).  We do not believe that this circumstance makes a legally relevant difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentence is a sentence.  Conversely, an enhancement is an enhancement--here, two levels, regardless of the BOL--and the incremental effect of the enhancement on any particular sentence is the product of the interaction of a myriad of factors.  The increase in the ensuing sentence, whatever the duration, neither alters the enhancement's fundamental character nor bears on whether the facts underlying it must be established by a different quantum of proof.  Cf. United States v. Rehal, 940 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that enhancing a sentence because of a defendant's perjurious testimony does not require proof by the same standard as a perjury charge, but need only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence).  In short, appellant's complaint about the length of the increment in his case might appropriately be addressed to Congress or the Sentencing Commission;  it cannot rewardingly be addressed to the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence, or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years....</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C.

Detecting no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>The Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 1993, defendant-appellant Jorge Gonzalez-Vazquez (Gonzalez) pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import heroin, and conspiracy to possess heroin with the intent to distribute it.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 963, 846, 952(a), and 841(a)(1).  The charges grew out of a sophisticated scheme or series of schemes, lasting more than 15 months, in which appellant and 23 codefendants imported large quantities of heroin from Hong Kong into the United States, and then distributed it.  Appellant played numerous roles in this elaborate plot, sometimes buying heroin overseas, sometimes purveying drugs domestically, sometimes acting as a courier, and sometimes serving as a bodyguard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return for appellant's guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of the GSR--but the agreement contained no stipulation as to the parameters of the GSR.  The government also agreed to drop several other charges levelled against appellant.  One charge remained unresolved:  a count accusing appellant of using or possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As to that count, the plea agreement preserved appellant's right to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately four months after tendering his guilty plea, appellant moved to withdraw it.  The district court denied his motion.  At the disposition hearing, the court invoked U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) and boosted the base offense level (BOL) for appellant's possession of a dangerous weapon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After other adjustments had been made and appellant's criminal history score had been computed, a GSR of 262-327 months emerged.  The prosecution recommended an incarcerative sentence at the nadir of the range, and the district court obliged.  Apparently content not to exact a last pound of flesh, the government then moved to dismiss the unresolved firearms count.  The court granted the government's motion.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Motion to Withdraw</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges the district court's denial of his plea-withdrawal motion, asserting that he advanced a \"fair and just reason\" for retracting his guilty plea, and that the district court should have given him safe passage.  His asserted reason masquerades as a claim that, when he tendered his plea, he did not fully understand its consequences.  Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, however, appellant's core complaint appears to be that he did not realize that his GSR would be so formidable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even prior to the imposition of sentence, a defendant does not have an unqualified right to withdraw a guilty plea.

Plausibility.   Appellant claims that his decision to plead guilty was based upon the government's agreement to recommend a sentence at the low end of the GSR--a recommendation that, to appellant's way of thinking, meant 210 months.  But that assumption stemmed from a miscalculation on appellant's part--a miscalculation fueled by his hope that there would be no weapons enhancement.  It is a fact of law and life, too basic to warrant citation of authority, that a criminal defendant cannot jettison a guilty plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made merely because the sentencing judge calls a tune that is not to the defendant's taste.  It is a corollary of this principle that, as we recently stated in a case comparable to this one, \"the fact that a defendant misapprehends the likely guideline sentencing range does not constitute a fair and just reason for withdrawing a guilty plea.\"  De Alba <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195565\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pagan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195565/united-states-v-de-alba-pagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>;  accord United States v.

The transcript of the change-of-plea hearing makes it pellucid that Gonzalez knew at the time that, regardless of the eventual outcome of the then-unresolved weapons charge, he still faced the prospect of an enhanced BOL at sentencing.  During the hearing, his counsel stated in open court and in appellant's presence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>I have also informed Mr. Gonzalez that it is the position of the U.S. attorney that, in the event that he would be acquitted of the gun charge, that is count 23, that they could ask or it could be possible that he would be found with a two point enhancement at the moment of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel added that he explained to Gonzalez that this tactic \"could possibly increase his offense level....\"  Hence, the ambush of which appellant now complains was no ambush at all, but, rather, a frontal assault, with the government's troops marshalled in plain view from the very onset of hostilities.  Appellant's articulated reason for seeking to scuttle his guilty plea is, therefore, not plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Timing.  The timing of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea often serves as a gauge for measuring the legitimacy of a proffered reason.  Belated requests, even if made before sentencing, are generally regarded as afterthoughts.  Consequently, the \"longer a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order to gain favorable consideration.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parrilla-Tirado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>;  accord <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doyle,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526038\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pellerito,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/526038/united-states-v-giuseppe-pellerito-aka-joseph-el-italiano-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1541</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, appellant waited approximately four months after pleading guilty and two months after the release of his presentence investigation report (PSI Report) before moving to retract his plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Given the totality of the circumstances that pertain here, appellant's lassitude serves to cast considerable doubt upon the legitimacy of his professed reason for seeking to change course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Assertion of Innocence.  \"In determining whether a proposed plea withdrawal is fair and just, a defendant's assertion of innocence may weight the scales in favor of withdrawal, and conversely, the absence of a claim of innocence weights the opposite pan of the scale.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parrilla-Tirado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>;  accord United States v.

Appellant did not proclaim his innocence in his plea-withdrawal motion.  To the contrary, at the disposition hearing he stated;  \"I know I committed a crime and I have to pay for it.\"   Appellant's explicit admission of his guilt militates strongly against disturbing the ruling below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Voluntariness.   In reviewing the merits of a plea-withdrawal motion, an inquiring court must determine whether, in light of the defendant's proffered reason and any other newly disclosed facts, the guilty plea can still be deemed voluntary and intelligent.  See United States v. Austin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571445\"><a href=\"/opinion/571445/united-states-v-michael-j-austin-united-states-v-michael-j-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span>, 786-87 (1st Cir.1991).  Appellant makes no challenge to the sufficiency of the Rule 11 proceeding in this case, and, indeed, the colloquy is a model of thoroughness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  It is apparent that no hint of error tainted the district court's refusal to allow appellant to retract his guilty plea.  Consequently, Gonzalez's conviction must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also challenges the district court's reliance on U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) in the course of formulating his sentence.  He maintains that his alleged possession of the firearm, and, hence, the applicability of the guideline, was not proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence;  and that, in any event, the guideline's applicability had to be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt inasmuch as the increase imposed under the guideline is in reality an additional sentence, not a sentencing enhancement.  We do not accept either contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the Proof.   Appellant's initial sentencing sortie is effortlessly repulsed.  In gauging the sufficiency of the factual foundation on which a sentence rests, we must \"accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous,\" while at the same time \"giv[ing] due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e);  see United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 507 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. Mocciola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the district court's factfinding survives clear-error review.  This conclusion is reached more easily because of the Sentencing Commission's specific instruction that section 2D1.1(b)(1) \"should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1), comment.  A sentencing court must, of course, honor this type of instruction.  See, e.g., United States v. Fiore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597517\"><a href=\"/opinion/597517/united-states-v-anthony-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that the Sentencing Commission's interpretation of a guideline should be followed unless it is \"arbitrary, unreasonable, inconsistent with the guideline's text, or contrary to law\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It likewise supports a finding that appellant carried a pistol during the encounter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Under these circumstances, we must uphold the district court's conclusion that, on the date of appellant's arrest, he possessed a firearm in the course of an aborted drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant tries to stave off the near-irresistible force of these findings in two ways.  First, he suggests that, to warrant an adjustment under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1), the evidence must establish the same panoply of elements that are needed to prove the statutory \"carrying and use\" of a weapon in furtherance of a drug crime, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The suggestion is fanciful, for the guideline can be triggered with considerably greater ease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point is readily susceptible to illustration.  For one thing, while mere possession of a firearm during a drug-trafficking episode does not satisfy the elements of the statute, see United States v. Castro-Lara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587572\"><a href=\"/opinion/587572/united-states-v-ramon-castro-lara-united-states-of-america-v-abraham/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span>, 983 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span> </span>(1993), the reverse is often true under the guideline, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ruiz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">507</span> </a></span>(\"Mere possession of a firearm can trigger the two level increase;  there is no requirement that the gun actually be used in perpetrating the drug crime, or that such use be intended,\");  United States v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531899\"><a href=\"/opinion/531899/united-states-v-carol-ann-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 189 (8th Cir.1989) (similar);  United States v.

For another thing, the \"clearly improbable\" language quoted above makes a huge difference.  Under the statute, the government's burden of persuasion never varies.  Under the guideline, however, once the underlying crime and the presence of a firearm have been established, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show, or at least produce some evidence of, \"the existence of special circumstances that would render it 'clearly improbable' that the weapon's presence has a connection to the narcotics trafficking.\"  United States v.

This distinction is of paramount importance here, as the record justifies a finding of possession, and appellant has neither produced nor pointed to the existence of any evidence indicating the improbability of a facilitative nexus between the gun and the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's next effort at annihilating the two-level increase amounts to an attack on the reliability of the government's proof.  The fusillade misses the target.  To be sure, the court's findings are based primarily on the PSI Report, which, in turn, relies heavily on grand jury testimony, coconspirators' statements, and other hearsay.  But appellant's castigation of this evidence overlooks the special nature of sentencing proceedings.  In the sentencing phase of a case, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply.  Thus, \"[f]acts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.\"  United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 872 (1st Cir.1993) (citing cases).

Use of the Preponderance Standard.   Appellant's fallback position is that, even if the proof suffices on a preponderance standard, using that standard transgresses his due process rights.  He hinges this claim on the thesis that the increase in his sentence attributable to the section 2D1.1(b)(1) adjustment (agreed by the parties to have been 52 months) is roughly equivalent to the length of the mandatory minimum sentence for violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1) (60 months), and, therefore, demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Though we give appellant's counsel high marks for ingenuity, his thesis does not earn a passing grade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, appellant failed to unfurl the thesis in the lower court.  Accordingly, it is procedurally defaulted and merits rejection on that basis alone.  See United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (\"We have repeatedly ruled, in connection with sentencing as in other contexts, that arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time in an appellate venue.\")  (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the thesis lacks substance.  It is well settled that a sentencing proceeding differs from a trial;  by definition, the defendant's guilt has been established the presumption of innocence has dissipated, and, consequently, the prosecution need not prove the facts upon which it relies for sentencing purposes beyond a reasonable doubt.

Pennsylvania, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Inspected in this light, appellant's constitutional challenge fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does it make a significant difference that the government originally pressed charges under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1), quoted supra note 1.  After all, the fact that a defendant is not charged, or could not be convicted, under section 924(c) is not determinative of whether a weapons enhancement may be appropriate under the sentencing guidelines.  See United States v. Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194898\"><a href=\"/opinion/194898/united-states-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 509 (1st Cir.1993);  see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mocciola,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">17</span> </a></span>(holding that even the facts underlying a prior acquittal on a weapons charge may be considered by the sentencing court for enhancement purposes).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We see no reason why the same rule should not apply where, as here, the prosecution simply dismisses the weapons count.  And we think it is immaterial that, in the plea agreement, appellant reserved the right to trial on the statutory weapons charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes a last-ditch effort to salvage his due process claim.  He revives the infamous \"Catch-22\" argument that this court rejected in Mocciola, but with a twist.  In Mocciola, the defendant, who was charged with both drug trafficking and violating section 924(c), argued that the weapons enhancement permitted by the guidelines created a \"Catch-22\" because, in respect to the firearms charge, whether he pled guilty or earned an acquittal after trial did not really matter.  See Mocciola, 891, F.2d at 17.   We dismissed this argument, reasoning that it \"misperceives the distinction between a sentence and a sentence enhancement.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 17. </a></span>  In so holding, we commented that the guideline adjustment added only 15 months to Mocciola's sentence while a conviction under the statute would have yielded a mandatory 60-month consecutive sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant pounces on this comment.  He contrasts it with his situation, observing that the additional time tacked onto his sentence as a result of the guideline enhancement (52 months) is nearly equal to the prescribed statutory punishment (60 months).  We do not believe that this circumstance makes a legally relevant difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentence is a sentence.  Conversely, an enhancement is an enhancement--here, two levels, regardless of the BOL--and the incremental effect of the enhancement on any particular sentence is the product of the interaction of a myriad of factors.  The increase in the ensuing sentence, whatever the duration, neither alters the enhancement's fundamental character nor bears on whether the facts underlying it must be established by a different quantum of proof.  Cf. United States v. Rehal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565197\"><a href=\"/opinion/565197/united-states-v-charles-rehal/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that enhancing a sentence because of a defendant's perjurious testimony does not require proof by the same standard as a perjury charge, but need only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence).  In short, appellant's complaint about the length of the increment in his case might appropriately be addressed to Congress or the Sentencing Commission;  it cannot rewardingly be addressed to the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence, or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years....</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C.

Because we do not need to reach the question of whether the proof here is sufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1), we abjure comment on the reliability of the evidence underpinning this more menacing scenario</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The reader will recall that the grand jury originally charged appellant under that statute;  that the charge was not compromised as part of the plea agreement;  that the parties anticipated that the section 924(c)(1) count would be tried subsequently;  and that, eventually, the government dropped the charge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Mocciola is a mainstream holding, not, as appellant portrays it, a waif in the wilderness.
