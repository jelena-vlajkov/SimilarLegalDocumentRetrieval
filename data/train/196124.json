On  June 8,  1984, Gilbert  Fox\r                                      \r\n\nleft  his car for repairs at Yankee Dodge, a Schenectady, New\r\n\nYork, car dealership and service shop.  Yankee Dodge gave him\r\n\na  \"loaner\"  car to  use  until the  repairs  were completed.\r\n\nLater  that  day, Fox  was involved  in  an auto  accident in\r\n\nMassachusetts while  driving the loaner car.   His passenger,\r\n\nEdgar Spurlin, was badly injured.\r\n\n     In August 1986, Spurlin filed a tort  action against Fox\r\n\nand Yankee Dodge in Massachusetts superior court based on the\r\n\naccident.   Fox was  insured by Travelers  Insurance Company,\r\n\nand Yankee  Dodge was insured by  Merchants Insurance Company\r\n\nof   New  Hampshire   under   a  \"garage   policy.\"     After\r\n\nnegotiations,  Spurlin dismissed  his  claim  against  Yankee\r\n\nDodge with prejudice.   He also negotiated  a settlement with\r\n\nTravelers for  $100,000,  the  limit  of Fox's  policy.    In\r\n\nexchange,  Spurlin released  Fox from  any liability  for the\r\n\naccident except to the  extent that Fox was covered  by other\r\n\ninsurance policies.\r\n\n     Spurlin's  case against  Fox proceeded  to trial  in the\r\n\nstate court and  resulted in  a jury verdict  of $615,000  in\r\n\nfavor  of Spurlin.  The  execution of judgment  issued in the\r\n\namount of $962,487.25,  which represented  the $615,000  jury\r\n\nverdict   plus  $436,650  in   interest,  less  the  $100,000\r\n\nsettlement  from  Travelers.    Spurlin  demanded  payment by\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nMerchants on the  ground that  Fox was an  insured under  the\r\n\nYankee Dodge garage policy.  Merchants disclaimed coverage.\r\n\n     On  July  9,  1993,  Spurlin filed  the  instant  action\r\n\nagainst Merchants in  Massachusetts superior court,  alleging\r\n\nin the first  count that his injuries  were compensable under\r\n\nMerchants'  insurance policy  and  in the  second count  that\r\n\nMerchants  had violated Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A, and Mass. Gen.\r\n\nL.  ch. 176D.   Merchants  removed the  case to  the district\r\n\ncourt based  on diversity jurisdiction.  On cross motions for\r\n\nsummary judgment, the district judge granted summary judgment\r\n\nin favor of Merchants.  Spurlin v. Merchants Ins. Co., 866 F.\r                                                                 \r\n\nSupp. 57 (D. Mass. 1994).  Spurlin now appeals.\r\n\n     The parties agree that under Massachusetts choice of law\r\n\nrules,  which bind the federal court in a diversity case, New\r\n\nYork  law governs the coverage issue.  Under the Yankee Dodge\r\n\ngarage   policy,  apparently   a  standard   form,  liability\r\n\ninsurance  is  provided  for  \"an  insured\"  in  an  accident\r\n\ninvolving a \"covered auto.\"   The loaner car is  admittedly a\r\n\ncovered auto under the policy, and  \"an insured\" includes not\r\n\nonly Yankee Dodge but also \"anyone else . . . using with your\r\n\n[Yankee Dodge's] permission a covered auto\" except:\r\n\n(3)  Your customers,  if your business is  shown in ITEM\r\n     ONE  of  the  declarations as  an  auto dealership.\r\n     However, if a customer of yours:\r\n\n          (a)  Has no other available insurance . .\r\n               ., he or she  is an insured but only\r\n               up  to  the compulsory  or financial\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n               responsibility law  limits where the\r\n               covered auto is principally garaged.\r\n\n          (b)  Has  other available insurance . . .\r\n               less   than    the   compulsory   or\r\n               financial responsibility  law limits\r\n               where    the    covered   auto    is\r\n               principally garaged, he or she is an\r\n               insured only for the amount by which\r\n               the    compulsory    or    financial\r\n               responsibility law limits exceed the\r\n               limits   of   his   or   her   other\r\n               insurance.\r\n\n     The protection  provided  to Yankee  Dodge's  customers,\r\n\nsuch as Fox, accorded  with New York insurance law  requiring\r\n\ncarriers to provide at least $10,000 in liability coverage to\r\n\n\"permissive  users\"  of  insured  vehicles.    See  Davis  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nDeFrank, 306 N.Y.S.2d 827, aff'd, 266 N.E.2d 822 (1970).  But\r                                            \r\n\nNew York law only requires such coverage for permissive users\r\n\nto  the extent  that they  are not  otherwise insured,  which\r\n\nexplains the  \"However\" proviso  in the Yankee  Dodge policy.\r\n\nFox did have  more than $10,000  in liability coverage  under\r\n\nhis own policy.\r\n\n     The district  court held that Fox, being so insured, was\r\n\nexcluded  from  \"insured\" status  by  the  plain language  of\r\n\nexception (3), quoted above.  Reviewing the interpretation of\r\n\ncontract language  de novo, Bird  v. Centennial Ins.  Co., 11\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 228  (1st Cir. 1993), we  agree.  If this  were all that\r\n\nthe  case involved, it would  be sufficient to  affirm on the\r\n\nbasis of the district court's very able opinion.  But Spurlin\r\n\noffers a counter-argument that deserves brief comment.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     Spurlin's  theory  is  that  the clause  (3),  with  its\r\n\nreference  to  an auto  dealership,  applies  only to  Yankee\r\n\nDodge's supply of new cars;  its repair work, Spurlin argues,\r\n\nis a  different phase of Yankee Dodge's  business; the loaner\r\n\ncar was supplied  to Fox as a repair customer; and clause (3)\r\n\ntherefore does not  apply to  Fox.  In  other words,  Spurlin\r\n\nwishes to read  clause (3)  as if it  excepted from  coverage\r\n\n\"your  customers to the extent that they are customers of the\r\n\nnew-car phase of your business.\"  \r\n\n     Unfortunately   for   Spurlin's  argument,   the  clause\r\n\nactually excludes \"your customers,  if your business is shown\r\n\n. .  . as an  auto dealership,\" as Yankee  Dodge clearly was.\r\n\nThe  clause  does not  purport  to divide  the  business into\r\n\nphases and  limit the exclusion to only one phase.  Nor is it\r\n\napparent  why Yankee  Dodge would  wish to  provide liability\r\n\ninsurance  to  users  of loaner  cars  in  any  phase of  its\r\n\nbusiness--a  step  that  would  ultimately  increase  its own\r\n\npremiums--over and above  the contingent minimum  required by\r\n\nNew York law.  \r\n\n     In  support  of his  reading,  Spurlin  cites two  cases\r\n\ndecided by  intermediate appellate state courts,  one decided\r\n\nover a forceful dissent.  See Stanfield v. Hartford  Accident\r                                                                         \r\n\n&amp; Indem. Co., 581 So. 2d 340 (La. Ct. App. 1991); Connecticut\r                                                                         \r\n\nIndem. Co. v. Cordasco,  535 A.2d 631 (Pa. Super.  Ct. 1987).\r                                  \r\n\nBoth courts  adopted Spurlin's  reading on similar  facts and\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nalmost  identical  policy language.   By  contrast, Merchants\r\n\ncites  a  number of  state  high  courts  that have  rejected\r\n\nStanfield's  and  Cordasco's  reasoning.    See,  e.g., Globe\r                                                                         \r\n\nIndem. Co.  v. Jordan, 634 A.2d 1279  (Me. 1993); Schoenecker\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Haines, 277 N.W.2d 782 (Wis. 1979).\r                     \r\n\n     Spurlin,  and the cases on which he relies, also cite to\r\n\nanother  provision seemingly  common to  garage policies  and\r\n\npresent in this case.  This provision  excludes from coverage\r\n\nany  covered auto \"while rented or leased to others\" but also\r\n\nprovides  that the exclusion does not apply to a covered auto\r\n\n\"you rent to one of  your customers while his or her  auto is\r\n\nleft  with you for service or  repair.\"  On its face, neither\r\n\nthe exclusion nor the exception to it has anything to do with\r\n\na case like ours since Yankee Dodge did not rent or lease the\r\n\nloaner  car to  Fox.   Nor  do  exclusions themselves  create\r\n\ncoverage.  See 13  J. Appleman, Insurance Law and  Practice  \r                                                                       \r\n\n7387, at 179 (rev. ed. 1976).\r\n\n     The  exclusion does  create  a puzzle:    it leaves  the\r\n\nimpression that a garage that rented loaner cars to customers\r\n\nduring repairs, but  was not  part of a  new car  dealership,\r\n\nmight  be  buying  liability   insurance  for  its  customers\r\n\nunlimited by clause (3).  We do not know whether such garages\r\n\nexist  or, if they do,  whether such coverage  is intended or\r\n\nthe result of a glitch.  But the exclusion does not show that\r\n\nan  auto dealership is to  be treated as  two businesses; nor\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\ndoes it alter the critical fact that Yankee Dodge  is an auto\r\n\ndealership  and, by the  express terms of  the policy, clause\r\n\n(3) \"except[s]\" from insured status  a permissive user who is\r\n\n\"a  customer\" of  an auto dealer  (apart from  the contingent\r\n\nminimum protection not here involved).\r\n\n     No state court decisions  from New York or Massachusetts\r\n\nhave been  cited to us, so we must  make our best guess as to\r\n\nwhat those courts would  say if confronted with the  split in\r\n\nauthority  on the issue  before us.   In  our view,  the more\r\n\nstraightforward reading of the policy is  that adopted by the\r\n\ndistrict  court, which  is consistent  with its  language and\r\n\nwith what we would expect the parties to the contract--Yankee\r\n\nDodge  and Merchants--to  have sought to  provide.   Nor does\r\n\nthis exclusion  conflict with  New York public  policy, since\r\n\nFox did carry his own insurance above the mandatory minimum.\r\n\n     Finally, Spurlin notes that before the tort suit against\r\n\nFox was filed, Merchants sent several checks to Spurlin under\r\n\nthe personal injury protection  provision of the Yankee Dodge\r\n\npolicy.  But we  are told, without contradiction,  that under\r\n\nNew York  law,  where  two  or  more  insurers  might  afford\r\n\ncoverage for an  accident, the first one  contacted must make\r\n\npersonal  injury  protection   payments.    Afterwards,   the\r\n\ninsurers determine  which company  is liable and  resolve the\r\n\nmatter between them by reimbursement.  Although         other\r\n\ninterpretive arguments are urged by Spurlin under the policy,\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nthe  ones we have addressed are his  best.  As for his claims\r\n\nunder  the  Massachusetts  insurance and  consumer-protection\r\n\nstatutes previously cited, the district court addressed those\r\n\nclaims and we have nothing to add to its discussion.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n",

See Davis v. DeFrank, 33 A.D.2d 236, 306 N.Y.S.2d 827, aff'd, 27 N.Y.2d 924, 318 N.Y.S.2d 142, 266 N.E.2d 822 (1970).  But New York law only requires such coverage for permissive users to the extent that they are not otherwise insured, which explains the \"However\" proviso in the Yankee Dodge policy.  Fox did have more than $10,000 in liability coverage under his own policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Fox, being so insured, was excluded from \"insured\" status by the plain language of exception (3), quoted above.  Reviewing the interpretation of contract language de novo, Bird v. Centennial Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 228 (1st Cir.1993), we agree.  If this were all that the case involved, it would be sufficient to affirm on the basis of the district court's very able opinion.  But Spurlin offers a counter-argument that deserves brief comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spurlin's theory is that the clause (3), with its reference to an auto dealership, applies only to Yankee Dodge's supply of new cars;  its repair work, Spurlin argues, is a different phase of Yankee Dodge's business;  the loaner car was supplied to Fox as a repair customer;  and clause (3) therefore does not apply to Fox.  In other words, Spurlin wishes to read clause (3) as if it excepted from coverage \"your customers to the extent that they are customers of the new-car phase of your business.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Spurlin's argument, the clause actually excludes \"your customers, if your business is shown ... as an auto dealership,\" as Yankee Dodge clearly was.  The clause does not purport to divide the business into phases and limit the exclusion to only one phase.  Nor is it apparent why Yankee Dodge would wish to provide liability insurance to users of loaner cars in any phase of its business--a step that would ultimately increase its own premiums--over and above the contingent minimum required by New York law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his reading, Spurlin cites two cases decided by intermediate appellate state courts, one decided over a forceful dissent.  See Stanfield v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 581 So.2d 340 (La.Ct.App.1991);  Connecticut Indem. Co. v. Cordasco, 369 Pa.Super. 439, 535 A.2d 631 (1987).  Both courts adopted Spurlin's reading on similar facts and almost identical policy language.  By contrast, Merchants cites a number of state high courts that have rejected Stanfield 's and Cordasco's reasoning.  See, e.g., Globe Indem. Co. v. Jordan, 634 A.2d 1279 (Me.1993);  Schoenecker v. Haines, 88 Wis.2d 665, 277 N.W.2d 782 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spurlin, and the cases on which he relies, also cite to another provision seemingly common to garage policies and present in this case.  This provision excludes from coverage any covered auto \"while rented or leased to others\" but also provides that the exclusion does not apply to a covered auto \"you rent to one of your customers while his or her auto is left with you for service or repair.\"   On its face, neither the exclusion nor the exception to it has anything to do with a case like ours since Yankee Dodge did not rent or lease the loaner car to Fox.  Nor do exclusions themselves create coverage.  See 13 J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice Sec. 7387, at 179 (rev. ed. 1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exclusion does create a puzzle:  it leaves the impression that a garage that rented loaner cars to customers during repairs, but was not part of a new car dealership, might be buying liability insurance for its customers unlimited by clause (3).  We do not know whether such garages exist or, if they do, whether such coverage is intended or the result of a glitch.  But the exclusion does not show that an auto dealership is to be treated as two businesses;  nor does it alter the critical fact that Yankee Dodge is an auto dealership and, by the express terms of the policy, clause (3) \"except[s]\" from insured status a permissive user who is \"a customer\" of an auto dealer (apart from the contingent minimum protection not here involved).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No state court decisions from New York or Massachusetts have been cited to us, so we must make our best guess as to what those courts would say if confronted with the split in authority on the issue before us.  In our view, the more straightforward reading of the policy is that adopted by the district court, which is consistent with its language and with what we would expect the parties to the contract--Yankee Dodge and Merchants--to have sought to provide.  Nor does this exclusion conflict with New York public policy, since Fox did carry his own insurance above the mandatory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Spurlin notes that before the tort suit against Fox was filed, Merchants sent several checks to Spurlin under the personal injury protection provision of the Yankee Dodge policy.  But we are told, without contradiction, that under New York law, where two or more insurers might afford coverage for an accident, the first one contacted must make personal injury protection payments.  Afterwards, the insurers determine which company is liable and resolve the matter between them by reimbursement.  Although other interpretive arguments are urged by Spurlin under the policy, the ones we have addressed are his best.  As for his claims under the Massachusetts insurance and consumer-protection statutes previously cited, the district court addressed those claims and we have nothing to add to its discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Yankee Dodge gave him a \"loaner\" car to use until the repairs were completed.  Later that day, Fox was involved in an auto accident in Massachusetts while driving the loaner car.  His passenger, Edgar Spurlin, was badly injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1986, Spurlin filed a tort action against Fox and Yankee Dodge in Massachusetts superior court based on the accident. Fox was insured by Travelers Insurance Company, and Yankee Dodge was insured by Merchants Insurance Company of New Hampshire under a \"garage policy.\"   After negotiations, Spurlin dismissed his claim against Yankee Dodge with prejudice.  He also negotiated a settlement with Travelers for $100,000, the limit of Fox's policy.  In exchange, Spurlin released Fox from any liability for the accident except to the extent that Fox was covered by other insurance policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spurlin's case against Fox proceeded to trial in the state court and resulted in a jury verdict of $615,000 in favor of Spurlin.  The execution of judgment issued in the amount of $962,487.25, which represented the $615,000 jury verdict plus $436,650 in interest, less the $100,000 settlement from Travelers.  Spurlin demanded payment by Merchants on the ground that Fox was an insured under the Yankee Dodge garage policy.  Merchants disclaimed coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 1993, Spurlin filed the instant action against Merchants in Massachusetts superior court, alleging in the first count that his injuries were compensable under Merchants' insurance policy and in the second count that Merchants had violated Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, and Mass.Gen.L. ch. 176D.  Merchants removed the case to the district court based on diversity jurisdiction.  On cross motions for summary judgment, the district judge granted summary judgment in favor of Merchants.  Spurlin v. Merchants Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span> </span>(D.Mass.1994).  Spurlin now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that under Massachusetts choice of law rules, which bind the federal court in a diversity case, New York law governs the coverage issue.  Under the Yankee Dodge garage policy, apparently a standard form, liability insurance is provided for \"an insured\" in an accident involving a \"covered auto.\"   The loaner car is admittedly a covered auto under the policy, and \"an insured\" includes not only Yankee Dodge but also \"anyone else ... using with your [Yankee Dodge's] permission a covered auto\" except:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Your customers, if your business is shown in ITEM ONE of the declarations as an auto dealership.
