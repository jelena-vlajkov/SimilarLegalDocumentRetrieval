Pro  se plaintiff  Arthur Toegemann\r                                             \n\nappeals a district  court order that requires him  to forward\n\nmonthly payments  to defense  counsel until Toegemann  pays a\n\ntotal of $1700.00 to the state of Rhode Island.  The $1700.00\n\nrepresents the  total amount  of sanctions that  the district\n\ncourt  imposed on  Toegemann  for filing  and litigating  the\n\ninstant action - the second of its kind - against the present\n\ndefendants.  We have thoroughly  reviewed the record and  the\n\nparties' briefs on appeal.  Toegemann has continuously failed\n\nto pay a sanction  which we affirmed in 1991.   See Toegemann\r                                                                         \n\nv.

He further offers\n\nno reasons why  the district court  abused its discretion  in\n\nimposing an additional $700 in sanctions since we issued that\n\ndecision.   The record indicates that  this additional sum is\n\nwholly  justified  by  Toegemann's persistent  recalcitrance.\n\nAccordingly,  the district  court's order  is affirmed.
