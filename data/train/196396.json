The  district court  found  for  most of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs and  ordered the House  to desist from  continuing its\r\n\nprevailing  practices  with  regard  to  the  interpretation  and\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   1Other  plaintiffs in the underlying action included several\r\nindividuals registered as  lobbyists for non-profit organizations\r\n(Kate  Coyne-McCoy, Harvey  Press, Scott  Nova,  Barbara Baldwin,\r\nSusan  Closter-Godoy, Steven Brown,  Barbara Colt, Donn Dibiasio,\r\nAnna Sullivan, and Marti Rosenberg), and three elected members of\r\nthe  House   (Edith  Ajello,  Barbara   Burlingame,  and  Francis\r\nGaschen).\r\n\n                              2\r\r\n\nenforcement of Rule 45.

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n        We recount the  facts \"in the light most  hospitable to\r\n\nthe verdict-winner, consistent with record support.\"  Cumpiano v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBanco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                              \r\n\n        In January 1993, the House, under fresh leadership that\r\n\nhad pledged procedural reform, adopted several new rules.   Among\r\n\nthem was Rule  45 (the full  text of which  is reproduced in  the\r\n\nappendix).  On its face, Rule 45 banishes  all lobbyists from the\r\n\nfloor of the  House (and the House lounge) while  the House is in\r\n\nsession.   Nonetheless, the rule permits members of the public to\r\n\nbe on  the House floor  while the House  is in  session, provided\r\n\nthat  \"they remain seated along the sides of the chamber, refrain\r\n\nfrom conversation, and  maintain the decorum  of the House,\"  and\r\n\nprovided further that they do  not \"directly or indirectly engage\r\n\nin the practice of lobbying.\"  Rule 45(b).\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   2The  district court  nonetheless  rebuffed the  legislator-\r\nplaintiffs,  who  claimed  that  Rule  45  violated  their  First\r\nAmendment  right to  receive  political information.   The  court\r\nruled that, even if the legislators had been denied some level of\r\naccess to lobbyists, the denial did not \"rise[] to the level of a\r\nconstitutional  deprivation.\"   Social Workers,  874 F.  Supp. at\r                                                        \r\n542.     The   legislator-plaintiffs  have   not  appealed   and,\r\naccordingly, we confine  our discussion to the claims  brought by\r\nthe other plaintiffs.\r\n\n                              3\r\r\n\n        Although Rule  45 does not define  the term \"lobbyist,\"\r\n\nit incorporates the statutory  definition of \"lobbying\" contained\r\n\nin  the Rhode Island  Lobbying Act, R.I. Gen.  Laws    22-10-1 to\r\n\n22-10-12 (the  Act).    The Act  defines  \"lobbying\"  as  \"acting\r\n\ndirectly  or  soliciting  others  to  act  for   the  purpose  of\r\n\npromoting, opposing,  amending, or influencing in  any manner the\r\n\npassage  by the general assembly of any legislation or the action\r\n\non that  legislation by the governor.\"   Id.   22-10-2.   The Act\r                                                      \r\n\nrequires  lobbyists for  private organizations  and interests  to\r\n\nregister with the Secretary of State, see id.    22-10-5 &amp; 22-10-\r                                                       \r\n\n6, and to wear identifying badges, see id.   22-10-8.  Government\r                                                    \r\n\nofficials  who lobby are given considerably more leeway.  The Act\r\n\ngrants safe passage to  many elected officials, see id.    22-10-\r                                                                 \r\n\n3(1), and other public employees, while required to register, are\r\n\notherwise exempt from the Act's provisions.  See id.   22-10-4.1.\r                                                              \r\n\nNeither elected officials nor other public employees are required\r\n\nto wear identification badges.\r\n\n        The district court found that, prior to the adoption of\r\n\nRule 45, the House provided two galleries overlooking the chamber\r\n\nwhich were  accessible to  all members  of the  public, lobbyists\r\n\nincluded.   In  addition,  \"representatives of  both private  and\r\n\ngovernmental  organizations were  allowed  to be  present on  the\r\n\nfloor of the House.\"  Social Workers, 874 F. Supp. at 535.  These\r                                              \r\n\nlobbyists typically occupied seats  on the periphery, in an  area\r\n\nranged alongside the  two outermost  aisles of  the House  floor.\r\n\nThey  communicated with legislators in a variety of ways, such as\r\n\n                              4\r\r\n\nby whispered  conversations on the perimeter of  the House floor,\r\n\nwritten  notes, physical  gestures, and  other assorted  signals.\r\n\nSee id.  This buzznacking took place even  while the members were\r                 \r\n\ndebating floor amendments.\r\n\n        After the adoption of Rule  45, access to the  overhead\r\n\ngalleries remained unchanged.   But from that point forward,  the\r\n\nHouse  excluded  private  lobbyists (easily  recognized  by their\r\n\nobligatory identification badges) from  the House floor while the\r\n\nHouse  was in  session.    The  district  court  found  that,  in\r\n\ncontrast,  \"agents  or employees  of  governmental  bodies [were]\r\n\nallowed to be present on the floor of the House while it [was] in\r\n\nsession,  as  [were]  members  of  the  general  public.\"     Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nMoreover,   the  \"defendants  permitted  agents  of  governmental\r\n\norganizations to be present, to  speak, to respond to  questions,\r\n\nto  provide information,  and to  confer with legislators  on the\r\n\nHouse  floor  during  House   sessions  on  frequent  occasions,\"\r\n\nnotwithstanding  the  apparently unconditional  text of  Rule 45.\r\n\nId. at 537.\r             \r\n\n        The  plaintiffs struck back on April 27, 1993.  On that\r\n\ndate, they filed  a civil action  under 42 U.S.C.    1983  (1988)\r\n\nagainst  Messrs.   Harwood  and  Petteruti  (as  the  individuals\r\n\npurportedly responsible for enforcing the House's rules) charging\r\n\nthat   Rule  45,  on  its  face  and  as  applied,  violated  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  rights  under the  First and  Fourteenth Amendments.\r\n\nThe  defendants denied  the  allegations.   Following a  four-day\r\n\nbench  trial, the judge found  for the plaintiffs.   See National\r                                                                           \r\n\n                              5\r\r\n\nAss'n  of Social  Workers v.  Harwood, 860  F. Supp.  943 (D.R.I.\r                                               \r\n\n1994).   The defendants then moved to  alter the judgment.  While\r\n\nthat motion was under advisement, we decided AIDS Action Comm. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMassachusetts  Bay Transp. Auth., 42 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994).  The\r                                          \r\n\njudge then issued the opinion that is now before us, 874 F. Supp.\r\n\n530, modifying the original rescript in certain particulars.\r\n\n        In substance, the court found that  the presence of the\r\n\ngeneral public on  the perimeter of the House floor    a presence\r\n\nexpressly permitted  by Rule 45    constituted \"communicative and\r\n\nexpressive activity,\" id. at 540; that, due to the  communicative\r                                   \r\n\npossibilities inherent in physical presence, the  public's access\r\n\nto the perimeter  of the House floor rendered  the floor itself a\r\n\nlimited-purpose public forum, see  id.; and that, therefore, both\r                                                \r\n\nRule  45's exclusion  of lobbyists  and its  proscription against\r\n\nlobbying  on  the  House floor  constituted  impermissible  time,\r\n\nplace, and manner restrictions on expressive activity, see id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n540-41.3   On this basis,  the court  held that Rule  45, on  its\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   3In the court's  view, the  rule did not  \"leave open  ample\r\nalternative  means of  communication  for the  lobbyists,\" Social\r                                                                           \r\nWorkers, 874 F. Supp. at 541, because \"representatives elected to\r                 \r\nthe  Rhode   Island  House  of  Representatives   are  part  time\r\nlegislators . . .  [who] lack legislative office quarters  in the\r\nState House or elsewhere, [and who] lack legislative  staffs, and\r\n[who]  generally  have  full  time  jobs  in  addition  to  their\r\nlegislative duties.\"  Id.   This meant, the court  reasoned, that\r                                   \r\nexclusion  of  the  lobbyists  denied  them  the  opportunity  to\r\ncommunicate  with  hard-to-find  legislators  by  way  of  silent\r\npresence.  See id.\r                            \r\n    In condemning the ban on lobbying on the House floor during\r\nHouse sessions,  the court took a  similar tack.  It  found that,\r\n\"with regard to  floor amendments, which  are often proposed  and\r\nvoted on in the same House proceeding, the only timely and useful\r\ncommunication that can  take place  is that which  occurs on  the\r\nfloor of the House, during the debate on the amendment.\"  Id. \r                                                                       \r\n\n                              6\r\r\n\nface, violated  the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.   See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 541.\r\n\n        The  court  also  found  that   the  House  haphazardly\r\n\nenforced Rule 45, allowing lobbying by government officials while\r\n\nprohibiting others from lobbying.  See id. at 535-37.  Predicated\r                                                    \r\n\non  this finding,  the court  concluded that \"the  application of\r\n\nRule 45 amounts to a  content based restriction on speech.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat   541.    Because  the  court  could  discern  no  \"compelling\r\n\ngovernment  interest\" that  justified  the  exclusion of  private\r\n\nlobbying  while  sparing  governmental  lobbying,   it  held  the\r\n\ninterpretation and enforcement of Rule 45 invalid under the First\r\n\nAmendment.  Id. at 541-42.\r                         \r\n\n        In constructing a remedy, the judge, presaging an issue\r\n\nnot  yet raised by  the parties,  voiced concerns  about judicial\r\n\ninterference  in  legislative  affairs.   See  id.  at  542.   He\r                                                            \r\n\ntherefore  declined  the   plaintiffs'  invitation  to   \"require\r\n\ndefendants  to return to  the pre-1993 practice  of admitting all\r\n\nlobbyists, public and private, onto  the floor of the House  on a\r\n\nfirst-come,  first-served  basis.\"   Id.   Instead,  he  opted to\r                                                  \r\n\ndeclare \"the  current interpretation  and enforcement of  Rule 45\r\n\nunconstitutional,\"  and  to  order  the  House  to  refrain  from\r\n\n\"continuing  its current  practices with  regard to  this issue.\"\r\n\nId. at  543.4  The House leadership responded on two levels:  the\r             \r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   4For  reasons  that are  not  readily  apparent to  us,  the\r\nplaintiffs never sued  the House  as a body  and, therefore,  the\r\ndistrict court  plainly lacked jurisdiction to  enjoin the House.\r\nThe plaintiffs  now  concede that,  insofar  as the  lower  court\r\npurported  to do  so,  its  order  cannot  stand.    Withal,  the\r\n\n                              7\r\r\n\nHouse  itself  passed  a  new  rule  barring  all  persons except\r\n\nlegislators and legislative  aides from the House  floor, and the\r\n\nnamed defendants launched this appeal.\r\n\nII.  PROCEDURAL DEFAULT\r          II.

The State  of  Rhode  Island,\r\n\nthrough  its  Attorney  General,  as  amicus  curiae,  lends  its\r\n\nsupport.\r\n\n        It  is very late in the day  to bring a new argument to\r\n\nthe  fore.   Ordinarily,  an appellant  who  has not  proffered a\r\n\nparticular claim or defense in the district court \"may not unveil\r\n\nit in  the court of appeals.\"   United States v.

For reasons  which more clearly  appear infra,  we\r                                                                      \r\nneed not unsnarl this tangle.\r\n\n                              8\r\r\n\nwith a  near-religious fervor, see, e.g.,  McCoy v.

Nor can this variant\r                              \r\n\nof the  raise-or-waive principle  be dismissed as  a pettifogging\r\n\ntechnicality or a trap for the indolent; the rule is founded upon\r\n\nimportant  considerations  of  fairness,  judicial  economy,  and\r\n\npractical wisdom.   See, e.g., Sandstrom  v. Chemlawn Corp.,  904\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 83,  87 (1st Cir. 1990);  United States v.

Thus, parties must speak  clearly in\r\n\nthe trial court, on pain that,  if they forget their lines,  they\r\n\nwill likely be bound forever to hold their peace.  This is as  it\r\n\nshould  be:  the rule fosters worthwhile systemic ends and courts\r\n\nwill be the losers if they permit it to be too easily evaded.\r\n\n        But foolish consistency is  reputedly the hobgoblin  of\r\n\nlittle  minds,  see  Ralph  Waldo Emerson,  \"Self  Reliance,\"  in\r                                                                           \r\n\nEssays:   First  Series (1841),  and in  the last  analysis, this\r                                 \r\n\narticulation  of the raise-or-waive  principle, though important,\r\n\nis a matter of discretion.   See United States v.

Mercedes-Amparo,  980 F.2d 17,  18-19 (1st Cir.  1992);\r                                   \r\n\nUnited  States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289, 291-92 (1st Cir. 1982).\r                                    \r\n\nThus,  this rule  (like  most  rules)  admits  of  an  occasional\r\n\nexception.   \"Occasional\" is the key word.  Since exceptions must\r\n\nbe  few and far  between, an appellate  court's discretion should\r\n\n                              9\r\r\n\nnot  be  affirmatively  exercised  unless  the  equities  heavily\r\n\npreponderate in favor of such a step.\r\n\n        In  the La Guardia and Krynicki  opinions, we set forth\r                                                   \r\n\nguidelines  that suggest when it may be appropriate to invoke the\r\n\nexception,  and we  need not  rehearse the  litany.   Instead, we\r\n\nexplain  why  those  criteria are  satisfied  here,  and,  in the\r\n\nprocess, explicate the criteria themselves.\r\n\n        First,  this is not a  case in which,  by neglecting to\r\n\nraise an issue  in a timely  manner, a litigant has  deprived the\r\n\ncourt of appeals of useful factfinding.   The court below made  a\r\n\nnumber of findings as to  the appellants' conduct in interpreting\r\n\nand enforcing Rule 45, and addressing the omitted  issue requires\r\n\nonly that we determine whether the described conduct, giving full\r\n\ndeference to these factual findings, falls within the established\r\n\nboundaries  of legislative immunity.  Thus, it can fairly be said\r\n\nthat  the  omitted issue  is purely  legal  in nature,  and lends\r\n\nitself to satisfactory resolution  on the existing record without\r\n\nfurther  development of the facts.  These attributes ease the way\r\n\nfor invoking  the exception.  See  La Guardia, 902 F.2d  at 1013;\r                                                       \r\n\nKrynicki, 689 F.2d at 291-92.\r                  \r\n\n        Second, appellants' belated proffer \"raises an issue of\r\n\nconstitutional   magnitude,\"  a   factor   that   favors   review\r\n\nnotwithstanding the procedural default.  La Guardia,  902 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1013.   Third,  the  omitted  argument  is  \"highly  persuasive,\"\r\n\nKrynicki,  689 F.2d at 292, a circumstance that \"often inclines a\r                  \r\n\ncourt  to  entertain a  pivotal argument  for  the first  time on\r\n\n                              10\r\r\n\nappeal,\"  La  Guardia,  902   F.2d  at  1013,  particularly  when\r                               \r\n\ndeclining to reach the  omitted argument threatens \"a miscarriage\r\n\nof justice,\"  Krynicki,  689 F.2d  at 292.5   Fourth,  we see  no\r                                \r\n\nspecial prejudice  or inequity  to the  plaintiffs.  The  omitted\r\n\ndefense is law-based, not fact-based.   In addition, the  parties\r\n\nhave  joined issue; the claim of legislative immunity was made in\r\n\nfull  in  the  appellants'  opening  brief  in  this  court,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs responded to  it in extenso, and both  sides addressed\r                                                \r\n\nthe point during oral argument.  The absence of unfairness  has a\r\n\ndefinite  bearing  on  a  decision  to  overlook  this  type   of\r\n\nprocedural default.   See United  States v. Doe,  878 F.2d  1546,\r                                                         \r\n\n1554  (1st Cir. 1989); cf. Singleton, 428 U.S. at 120 (discussing\r                                              \r\n\nimportance,  in determining  whether to  reach the  merits  of an\r\n\nomitted  issue, of ensuring  that the  opposing party  \"ha[s] the\r\n\nopportunity to present whatever  legal arguments he may have\"  to\r\n\nthe  court  of  appeals).   Fifth,  the  omission seems  entirely\r\n\ninadvertent  rather  than  deliberate;  although  withholding the\r\n\nargument had  the regrettable effect of  blindsiding the district\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   5In this  context, \"miscarriage of justice\"  means more than\r\nthe  individualized  harm   that  occurs  whenever  the   failure\r\nseasonably to raise  a claim or defense  alters the outcome  of a\r\ncase.   Rather, courts  ordinarily will relax  the raise-or-waive\r\nprinciple on this basis only if a failure to do  so threatens the\r\nfrustration of some broadly important  right.  See Schlesinger v.\r                                                                        \r\nCouncilman,  420  U.S.  738,   743  (1975)  (holding  that,  when\r                    \r\n\"jurisdictional  and  equity  issues  . .  .  [are]  sufficiently\r\nimportant,\" courts  may consider issues  on appeal that  were not\r\nraised below);  Krynicki, 689  F.2d at  292 (explaining  that the\r                                  \r\ninterest at stake  must be  \"legitimate and  significant\").   For\r\nthis reason, courts often  are more prone to make  the infrequent\r\nexception in  cases that  involve a discernible  public interest,\r\nand less prone to do so in disputes between private parties.\r\n\n                              11\r\r\n\njudge  and needlessly  prolonging the  litigation, it  yielded no\r\n\ntactical advantage to the defendants.\r\n\n        Sixth    and perhaps most  salient   the  omitted issue\r\n\nimplicates  matters  of great  public  moment,  and touches  upon\r\n\npolicies as  basic  as federalism,  comity, and  respect for  the\r\n\nindependence  of  democratic   institutions.    Courts   must  be\r\n\nsensitive to such concerns.  See Stone v. City and  County of San\r                                                                           \r\n\nFrancisco,  968 F.2d  850, 855  (9th  Cir. 1992)  (explaining the\r                   \r\n\ncourt's  election to  address  a matter  first  raised on  appeal\r\n\nbecause  \"[i]ssues  touching  on  federalism and  comity  may  be\r\n\nconsidered sua  sponte\"), cert. denied,  113 S.

Wagner,  47 F.3d 845\r                                                             \r\n\n(7th  Cir. 1995)  (suggesting that  \"when  matters of  comity are\r\n\ninvolved, the ordinary doctrines of  waiver give way\"); Jusino v.\r                                                                        \r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   6Our belief  that the defendants should not be strictly held\r\nto a waiver of  their absolute legislative immunity in  this case\r\nis fortified by  our recognition  that a primary  purpose of  the\r\nimmunity is to prevent courts from intruding into  precincts that\r\nare   constitutionally  reserved   to  the   legislative  branch.\r\nOverlooking  a waiver  in order  to further  this policy  of non-\r\ninterference  is  analogous to  our  settled  rule that,  because\r\nfederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, the absence of\r\nfederal subject matter jurisdiction can be raised on appeal  even\r\nif  the  issue  was  not  raised  below.    See,  e.g.,  American\r                                                                           \r\nPolicyholders Ins.  Co. v.

Failure to address the issue\r\n\nmay  well result in an  unwarranted intrusion by  a federal court\r\n\ninto the internal operations of a state legislature.  Under these\r\n\nexceptional circumstances, we follow the course of perceived duty\r\n\nand  proceed, in  the exercise  of our  discretion, to  weigh the\r\n\nlegislative  immunity argument.7   See  La Guardia,  902 F.2d  at\r                                                            \r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   7The dissent's principal response to this reason seems to be\r\nthat  overlooking  the  waiver  \"eliminates  any  incentive\"  for\r\nlegislators to raise  the immunity  defense in  a timely  manner.\r\nPost at 39-40.   This reasoning strikes us as  triply flawed.  In\r              \r\nthe first place, that argument can be used with equal force as to\r\nvirtually all omitted defenses; its logical extension is that all\r\nwaivers should rigorously  be enforced.   That view  has much  to\r\ncommend it as a  matter of case  management, but, as La  Guardia,\r                                                                          \r\nKrynicki,  Mercedes-Amparo, Hoover,  and Stone illustrate,  it is\r                                                        \r\nsimply not the law.\r\n    In  the  second  place,  the  argument  underestimates  the\r\ncapabilities  of appellate  courts.    There  is  no  hint  of  a\r\ndeliberate  bypass in  this  case    the  belated tender  of  the\r\ndefense is the product  of a change in counsel  (coupled with the\r\nappearance  of  Rhode Island's  Attorney  General  as an  amicus)\r\n\n                              13\r\r\n\n1013 (\"Rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the\r\n\nends  of  justice,  not  to defeat  them.\")  (quoting  Hormel  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHelvering, 312 U.S. 552, 557 (1941)).\r                   \r\n\nIII.  THE MERITS OF THE OMITTED DEFENSE\r          III.  THE MERITS OF THE OMITTED DEFENSE\r\n\n        We bifurcate  our analysis of  the legislative immunity\r\n\ndefense,  first discussing  the general  nature and scope  of the\r\n\ndoctrine  and  then  addressing  the  specific  contours  of  the\r\n\nappellants' claim.\r\n\n            A.

I,\r\n\n 6, cl. 1.  The Clause is,  by its terms, limited to members of\r\n\nCongress.   See Lake  County Estates  v. Tahoe  Regional Planning\r                                                                           \r\n\nAgency,  440   U.S.  391,   404  (1979).     Nevertheless,  state\r                \r\n\nlegislators and  their surrogates enjoy a  parallel immunity from\r\n\nliability for their legislative acts.\r\n\n        While this immunity is derived from federal common law,\r\n\nit is  similar in  scope and  object to  the immunity  enjoyed by\r\n\nfederal  legislators under the Speech or Debate Clause.  When the\r\n\nJustices  initially recognized  state legislative  immunity  as a\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\nrather  than a change in  tactics or a  reassessment of political\r\ncosts   and,  if sandbagging  were to occur,  we have  confidence\r\nthat  this court  would see it  for what  is was,  and decline to\r\nexercise discretion in favor of the sandbagger.\r\n    Finally,  if we assume that the dissent is correct and that\r\nour  ruling today may  encourage legislator-litigants to withhold\r\nimmunity defenses for political reasons, that is still the lesser\r\nevil,  far preferable in our view to the unwarranted insertion of\r\nthe federal court's nose into the state legislature's tent.\r\n\n                              14\r\r\n\ncomponent of federal  common law,  they turned to  the Speech  or\r\n\nDebate Clause  for guidance anent  the contours of  the doctrine.\r\n\nSee Tenney v.

Later, the\r                                 \r\n\nCourt  acknowledged that  the immunities  enjoyed by  federal and\r\n\nstate legislators are essentially coterminous.  See Supreme Court\r                                                                           \r\n\nof Va. v.

Hence, our  exploration of the  appellants' legislative\r\n\nimmunity claim begins with a distillation of principles extracted\r\n\nfrom federal constitutional jurisprudence.\r\n\n        The  Speech or Debate Clause has its roots in a similar\r\n\nprovision found in  the English  Bill of  Rights of  1689.8   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v.

The Clause  is modeled  to  ensure that  the\r\n\nLegislative  Branch  will  be   able  to  perform  without  undue\r\n\ninterference the whole of the legislative function ceded to it by\r\n\nthe Framers.   See Eastland v.  United States Serviceman's  Fund,\r                                                                          \r\n\n421 U.S.  491, 502 (1975).   To that end, the  Clause operates to\r\n\nshelter   individual  legislators   from  the   distractions  and\r\n\nhindrance  of civil  litigation, see id.  at 503,  and \"immunizes\r                                                  \r\n\n[them]  from suits  for  either prospective  relief or  damages,\"\r\n\nConsumers Union, 446 U.S. at 731.\r                         \r\n\n        While  the  core  protection conferred  by  the  Clause\r\n\nconcerns speech or debate by a member of Congress on the floor of\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   8The British version provides:  \"That the Freedom of Speech,\r\nand  Debates  or  Proceedings  in  Parliament,  ought  not to  be\r\nimpeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament.\"\r\n1 Wm. &amp; Mary, Sess. 2, ch.

This breadth of  application, which draws  its essence\r\n\nfrom the Supreme Court's  espousal of a \"practical rather  than a\r\n\nstrictly literal reading\" of  the Clause, Hutchinson v. Proxmire,\r                                                                          \r\n\n443 U.S.  111, 124 (1979), is made manifest in two ways.  For one\r\n\nthing,  the Clause's  prophylaxis extends  to any  act \"generally\r\n\ndone in a session of the House by one  of its members in relation\r\n\nto the business before it.\"  Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103  U.S. 168,\r                                                           \r\n\n204 (1880).   So  read, the Clause  protects not only  speech and\r\n\ndebate  per  se,  but  also   voting,  see  id.,  circulation  of\r                                                         \r\n\ninformation  to other legislators, see Doe  v. McMillan, 412 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n306,  312  (1973),  participation  in  the  work  of  legislative\r\n\ncommittees, see Gravel, 408 U.S. at 624; Tenney, 341 U.S. at 378-\r                                                         \r\n\n79, and a host of kindred activities.\r\n\n        For  another thing,  because the  applicability of  the\r\n\nSpeech or Debate Clause necessarily focuses on particular acts or\r\n\nfunctions,  not  on  particular  actors  or   functionaries,  the\r\n\nprophylaxis  of  the  Clause  also extends  to  legislative  acts\r\n\nperformed  by non-legislators.   See  Eastland, 421  U.S. at  507\r                                                        \r\n\n(refusing  to  draw  a  distinction  between  the  members  of  a\r\n\ncongressional  subcommittee and  the subcommittee's  counsel when\r\n\nthe  latter's  actions  were  within  the  sphere  of  legitimate\r\n\nlegislative activity); Gravel, 408 U.S. at 618 (holding that \"the\r                                       \r\n\nSpeech or Debate Clause applies not only to a Member  but also to\r\n\nhis aides  insofar  as  the conduct  of  the latter  would  be  a\r\n\n                              16\r\r\n\nprotected legislative  act if performed by  the Member himself\").\r\n\nThis extension evinces a recognition that, as a practical matter,\r\n\nlegislators cannot be expected to  perform their constitutionally\r\n\nallocated tasks without staff support.\r\n\n        This is not to say that the protections afforded by the\r\n\nSpeech  or Debate  Clause  are limitless.    They are  not.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGravel, 408 U.S. at 625.  Although the Court has  read the Clause\r                \r\n\ngenerously,  its  protections  must  match  its  purposes.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nEastland, 421  U.S. at 501-02.   When all  is said and  done, the\r                  \r\n\nabsolute immunity conferred by the Clause is not afforded \"simply\r\n\nfor the personal or  private benefit of Members of  Congress, but\r\n\nto  protect the integrity of the  legislative process by insuring\r\n\nthe independence  of individual  legislators.\"  United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBrewster, 408 U.S. 501, 507 (1972).\r                  \r\n\n        The key limitation    which applies both to members  of\r\n\nCongress  and  to congressional  staffers    is  that  the Clause\r\n\nprotects \"only purely legislative activities.\"  Id. at 512.  If a\r                                                             \r\n\nlegislator (or  his surrogate)  undertakes actions that  are only\r\n\n\"casually or incidentally related to legislative affairs,\" id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n528, or  which fall outside the  \"legitimate legislative sphere,\"\r\n\nEastland,  421  U.S.  at  503  (citation  omitted),  no  immunity\r                  \r\n\ninheres.  By the same token, the mere fact that a legislator or a\r\n\nlegislative  aide performs an  act in his  official capacity does\r\n\nnot automatically  confer protection  under the Speech  or Debate\r\n\nClause.  See Gravel, 408 U.S. at 625.  For example, when a member\r                             \r\n\nof Congress disseminates press releases to the public, the Clause\r\n\n                              17\r\r\n\ndoes not attach  because such documents  are \"primarily means  of\r\n\ninforming those outside the  legislative forum.\"  Hutchinson, 443\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  at 133.   So, too, activities that  are more political than\r\n\nlegislative in nature  do not come within the legislative sphere,\r\n\nand, hence,  do not implicate the  Speech or Debate Clause.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBrewster,  408 U.S.  at  512.

The  plaintiffs\r\n\nbrought  suit, as  we have  said,  under 42  U.S.C.    1983.   In\r\n\nactions invoking  federal civil  rights statutes,  federal courts\r\n\ncustomarily  \"equate[]  the legislative  immunity to  which state\r\n\nlegislators are entitled . . . to that accorded Congressmen under\r\n\nthe Constitution.\"   Consumers Union,  446 U.S. at  733.   Viewed\r                                              \r\n\nagainst  this backdrop,  it is  unsurprising that  the courts  of\r\n\nappeals  historically  have relied  on  Speech  or Debate  Clause\r\n\nprecedents   to  define   the  doctrinal   boundaries  of   state\r\n\nlegislative  immunity under the  federal common law.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nSchlitz  v.

Thus, our mode of analysis\r\n\ndovetails with the Speech or Debate Clause cases.\r\n\n        At the  heart  of  our inquiry  lies  the  question  of\r\n\nwhether  appellants' acts  in respect  to Rule  45 are  \"part and\r\n\nparcel of the legislative process.\"  Gravel, 408 U.S. at 626.  If\r                                                     \r\n\nso, appellants  are protected.  See id.  To answer this question,\r                                                 \r\n\nwe must understand the nature of the acts.9   We can look at them\r\n\nin one of two ways.\r\n\n        In a general  sense, the defendants    the Speaker  and\r\n\nthe head doorkeeper   did nothing more  or less than to interpret\r\n\nand enforce Rule 45.  Where, as here, a legislative body adopts a\r\n\nrule,  not invidiously discriminatory on  its face, see infra pp.\r                                                                       \r\n\n26-28,  that  bears  upon  its  conduct  of  frankly  legislative\r\n\nbusiness, we think that the doctrine of legislative immunity must\r\n\nprotect legislators and  legislative aides  who do  no more  than\r\n\ncarry out the will of the body by enforcing the rule as a part of\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   9In   certain  types  of  cases,  the  legislative  immunity\r\nanalysis centers on function,  attempting to ascertain whether an\r\naction  by   one  or   more  legislators  is   administrative  or\r\nlegislative   in  nature.     See,  e.g.,   Negron-Gaztambide  v.\r                                                                       \r\nHernandez-Torres, 35 F.3d 25, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that\r                          \r\nlegislators' decision  to discharge librarian  was administrative\r\nin nature, and did not give rise to legislative immunity).  Here,\r\nhowever, we are dealing with a procedural rule adopted by a house\r\nof  the legislature  as a  whole for  the management  of  its own\r\nbusiness.   Hence, we are not concerned with whether the adoption\r\nof the rule comprises  a legislative act   that  is transparently\r\nclear   but, rather, with whether that act is more than \"casually\r\nor  incidentally   related\"   to  core   legislative   functions.\r\nBrewster, 408 U.S. at 528.\r                  \r\n\n                              19\r\r\n\ntheir  official duties.10   See  Consumers Union  of the  U.S. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPeriodical Correspondents'  Ass'n, 515  F.2d 1341,  1348-50 (D.C.\r                                           \r\n\nCir. 1975) (holding congressional employees' actions in enforcing\r\n\nCongress's  internal seating regulations  immune under  Speech or\r\n\nDebate Clause),  cert.  denied, 423  U.S. 1051  (1976); see  also\r                                                                           \r\n\nDavids  v.

Assuming  for argument's  sake  that  this\r\n\nnarrower  perspective is  relevant, the  question of  whether the\r\n\nappellants are entitled to  legislative immunity would be reduced\r\n\nto a question of whether the acts which the district court  found\r\n\nproblematic  fell within  or without \"the  legitimate legislative\r\n\nsphere.\"  Eastland, 421 U.S. at 503.\r                            \r\n\n        The  first   area  of   inquiry  can   celeritously  be\r\n\ndispatched.  We think it is beyond serious dispute that enforcing\r\n\na duly enacted  legislative rule which prohibits lobbying  on the\r\n\nHouse floor during House sessions  is well within the legislative\r\n\nsphere.   Such  a restriction necessarily  affects the  manner in\r\n\nwhich  the  House conducts  its  most characteristic  legislative\r\n\nfunctions, e.g., debating  and voting.   A rule  that colors  the\r                         \r\n\nvery conditions  under which legislators engage  in formal debate\r\n\nis  indubitably part and  parcel of the  legislative process, and\r\n\nthe acts of House  officials (whether or not elected  members) in\r\n\nenforcing  it  are  therefore  fully  protected against  judicial\r\n\ninterference by the  doctrine of legislative immunity.   See id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\n                              21\r\r\n\nsee also Doe, 412 U.S. at 312-13; Tenney, 341 U.S. at 378-79.\r                                                  \r\n\n        At  first blush, the next area of inquiry   whether the\r\n\nexclusion of all  lobbyists from  the perimeter of  the House  is\r\n\nwithin  the legislative  sphere    appears more  murky.   Seating\r\n\narrangements for  non-legislators arguably are  less integral  to\r\n\nthe legislative  process than  the regulation of  lobbying during\r\n\nHouse  sessions.   As  the trial  testimony  in this  case  amply\r\n\ndemonstrates, however,  when lobbyists  are present on  the House\r\n\nfloor (even on the perimeter), they often become embroiled in the\r\n\nlegislative  process either through self-initiated or legislator-\r\n\ninitiated  contacts.  And, even if lobbyists are able to maintain\r\n\nstoic  silence on the perimeter, their  mere presence affects the\r\n\nlegislative   environment.11     We  conclude,   therefore,  that\r\n\nregulation of admission to the House floor comprises \"an integral\r\n\npart  of the  deliberative and  communicative processes  by which\r\n\nMembers  participate in . .  . House proceedings  with respect to\r\n\nthe   consideration   and  passage   or  rejection   of  proposed\r\n\nlegislation.\"    Gravel, 408  U.S.  at  625.   Consequently,  the\r                                 \r\n\ndoctrine of legislative immunity pertains.\r\n\n        We are not alone  in our view of a  legislature's House\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   11The plaintiffs  themselves have argued, in  the context of\r\ntheir First Amendment claim,  that they should at least  be given\r\nthe opportunity to  sit silently  on the perimeter  of the  House\r\nfloor  so  that  they  may  communicate  through  their  physical\r\npresence.  The district court accepted this argument, and made it\r\na  cornerstone of  the  ensuing First  Amendment  analysis.   See\r                                                                           \r\nSocial Workers, 874 F. Supp. at 539-41.   The importance that the\r                        \r\nplaintiffs attach to admittance  to the perimeter indicates their\r\nown  recognition  that,  by  mere  physical  presence,  they  can\r\ninfluence ongoing legislative business.\r\n\n                              22\r\r\n\nas its castle.  In Periodical Correspondents', the court  reached\r                                                       \r\n\na  similar conclusion.    There,  the Periodical  Correspondents'\r\n\nAssociation, which  issues credentials to the  press galleries of\r\n\nCongress,   denied  accreditation  to  a  particular  periodical,\r\n\nConsumer Reports, on  the ground that it had ties  to an advocacy\r\n\norganization.  Consumers Union  sued the sergeants-at-arms of the\r\n\nHouse  and  Senate, among  other  defendants,  alleging that  the\r\n\nexclusion  violated the First Amendment.  The court held that the\r\n\nsergeants-at-arms were  immune under the Speech  or Debate Clause\r\n\nbecause  arrangements  for seating  the  press in  the  House and\r\n\nSenate galleries were \"integral\" to \"the  legislative machinery.\"\r\n\n515 F.2d  at 1350.   In  a later case,  the court  elaborated its\r\n\nrationale,  explaining  that the  seating  \"immediately concerned\r\n\nHouse   consideration  of   proposed  legislation\"   because  the\r\n\narrangements \"were  intended to  shield members of  Congress from\r\n\npress members' use of  their House access to  lobby legislators.\"\r\n\nWalker  v.  Jones, 733  F.2d  923,  930  (D.C. Cir.)  (discussing\r                           \r\n\nPeriodical Correspondents'), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1036 (1984).\r                                                   \r\n\n        Like the  seating arrangements at  issue in  Periodical\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorrespondents', the  seating arrangements  dictated  by Rule  45\r                         \r\n\ninvolve the \"regulation of the very atmosphere in which lawmaking\r\n\ndeliberations occur.\"   Walker, 733  F.2d at 930.   Moreover,  if\r                                        \r\n\nthere is a distinction between Periodical Correspondents' and the\r                                                                   \r\n\ninstant case, it does  not advantage the present plaintiffs;  the\r\n\nRhode  Island  House is  seeking to  regulate  access to  its own\r\n\nfloor, rather than to galleries located above the floor.\r\n\n                              23\r\r\n\n        We come now to the third area of inquiry, involving the\r\n\nsignificance,  if   any,  of  the  plaintiffs'   claim  that  the\r\n\nappellants  interpreted and  enforced  Rule 45  in a  manner that\r\n\nallowed  lobbying on  the House  floor by  governmental,  but not\r\n\nprivate,  lobbyists.    This  as-applied  exclusion  of   private\r\n\nlobbyists, at  its most primitive level,  involves regulating the\r\n\nlegislative environment  by controlling access to  the seating on\r\n\nthe perimeter of  the House  floor.  Because  such regulation  is\r\n\n\"done in a session of the House by one of its members in relation\r\n\nto  the business  before it,\"  Kilbourn, 103  U.S. at 204,  it is\r                                                 \r\n\nwithin the legislative sphere.\r\n\n        To  be  sure, both  our  dissenting  colleague and  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  protest  that  the  House  treats  private  lobbyists\r\n\ndifferently (and less hospitably) than public lobbyists, and that\r\n\nthis differential  treatment offends the First  Amendment.  These\r\n\ncharges  lack  sufficient  force  to  strip away  the  shield  of\r\n\nabsolute legislative immunity.\r\n\n        We  believe that  the  body of  our opinion  adequately\r\n\nrebuts the  dissent's views, and we decline  to repastinate well-\r\n\nploughed ground.  We do add, however, our belief that the dissent\r\n\nseriously  misconstrues  the  Court's  Speech  or  Debate  Clause\r\n\njurisprudence beyond all  recognition.  To the extent that Powell\r                                                                           \r\n\ncan be read to hold that legislative immunity does not extend  to\r\n\nlegislative  employees, the  Court in  later cases  has routinely\r\n\nconfined it to its unique facts.  See, e.g., Gravel,  408 U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n621 (specifically identifying Kilbourn, Powell, and Dombrowski v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                              24\r\r\n\nEastland, 387 U.S.  82 (1967),  and stating that  none \"of  these\r                  \r\n\ncases   adopted  the   simple  proposition   that  immunity   was\r\n\nunavailable to congressional or committee  employees because they\r\n\nwere not  Representatives or  Senators\").   Rather, the case  law\r\n\n\"reflect[s]  a decidedly  jaundiced  view towards  extending  the\r\n\nClause  so as  to privilege  illegal or  unconstitutional conduct\r\n\nbeyond  that   essential  to   foreclose  executive  control   of\r\n\nlegislative  speech  or debate  and  associated  matters such  as\r\n\nvoting and committee  reports and proceedings.\"   Id.  We  see no\r                                                               \r\n\nreason why judicial  control of legislative  speech or debate  is\r\n\nany  less  pernicious  than  executive control.    Moreover,  the\r\n\ndecision  not to  extend  legislative immunity  to  congressional\r\n\nemployees in cases such as Powell turned on whether \"relief could\r                                           \r\n\nbe afforded without proof of a legislative act  or the motives or\r\n\npurposes underlying such an  act,\" thereby avoiding impermissible\r\n\nencroachment on \"legislative independence.\"   Id. at 620.   Under\r                                                           \r\n\nthat standard, judicial review of House Rule 45   as the tortured\r\n\ncourse  of  the  proceedings  below  graphically   illustrates   \r\n\nunquestionably required a substantial judicial intrusion into the\r\n\nlegislative domain.  Finally, we recognize, as the dissent points\r\n\nout,  that the  Court  has remarked  an exception  to legislative\r\n\nimmunity for the exercise  by legislators of punitive enforcement\r                                                               \r\n\nauthority outside  the ambit  of purely  legislative proceedings.\r\n\nSee Consumers  Union, 446 U.S. at  736.  But the  Court has never\r                              \r\n\nsuggested, much less held, that the enforcement of a rule adopted\r\n\nby an entire legislative  body designed to govern the  conduct of\r\n\n                              25\r\r\n\nlegislative  proceedings falls  within that  exception.   If that\r\n\nwere the rule, legislative  immunity would be little more  than a\r\n\nrumor, and the Speech or Debate Clause would be easily skirted.\r\n\n        Similarly, the plaintiffs'  \"as-applied\" arguments  are\r\n\nunavailing.   In  Eastland  v. United  States Servicemen's  Fund,\r                                                                          \r\n\nsupra, the plaintiffs asseverated  that \"once it is alleged  that\r               \r\n\nFirst Amendment  rights may be infringed  by congressional action\r\n\nthe Judiciary may intervene to protect [First Amendment] rights.\"\r\n\n421  U.S. at 509.   The Court flatly  rejected this asseveration,\r\n\nwarning that the effort  to carve out such an  exception \"ignores\r\n\nthe  absolute nature of the speech or debate protection and [the]\r\n\ncases which have broadly construed that protection.\"  Id. at 509-\r                                                                   \r\n\n10.  The Court added:  \"Where we are presented with an attempt to\r\n\ninterfere with an ongoing activity by Congress, and that activity\r\n\nis found to be  within the legitimate legislative sphere,  [First\r\n\nAmendment] balancing plays no part.\"  Id. at 510 n.16.  The Ninth\r                                                   \r\n\nCircuit put matters  even more bluntly, writing that  \"nothing in\r\n\nthe First  or Fourteenth Amendments or in 42  U.S.C.   1983 . . .\r\n\ncan justify [an] attempt to inject the Federal Judiciary into the\r\n\ninternal  procedures of a House of a state legislature.\"  Davids,\r                                                                          \r\n\n549 F.2d at 123.\r\n\n        The  plaintiffs'  also  assert  that  the  differential\r\n\ntreatment  of public  and  private lobbyists  violates the  Equal\r\n\nProtection  Clause.  This assertion does not derail the engine of\r\n\nlegislative immunity.   Activities that comprise  part and parcel\r\n\nof the legislative process are protected by legislative immunity;\r\n\n                              26\r\r\n\nthat immunity is not forfeited simply because the activities,  if\r\n\nunprotected,  might violate a  plaintiff's constitutional rights.\r\n\nSee Doe, 412 U.S. at 312-13;  see also Colon Berrios, 716 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n91.  Thus,  in Doe, the  Supreme Court ruled  that the Speech  or\r                            \r\n\nDebate   Clause   shields   legislators'   actions   \"within  the\r\n\nlegislative sphere,  even though  [the] conduct, if  performed in\r\n\nother   than   legislative   contexts,   would   in   itself   be\r\n\nunconstitutional.\"   412  U.S. at  312-13 (internal  citation and\r\n\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\n        For obvious reasons, the  plaintiffs chafe at the broad\r\n\nsweep of the doctrine of legislative immunity, and, in struggling\r\n\nto make their point, they marshal a parade of horribles.  To cite\r\n\na  typical  example, they  raise  the specter  of  a hypothetical\r\n\nlegislature that votes to allow access to its chambers to members\r\n\nof only one race or to adherents of only one religion.\r\n\n        The  plaintiffs  have the  right  to  march, but  their\r\n\nparade  is  on  the  wrong  route.    The  Court  has  explicitly\r\n\nrecognized  that  there may  be  some  conduct, even  within  the\r\n\nlegislative   sphere,  that   is   so  flagrantly   violative  of\r\n\nfundamental constitutional protections  that traditional  notions\r\n\nof legislative  immunity would  not deter judicial  intervention.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Kilbourn, 103  U.S. at 204 (leaving open  the question\r                             \r\n\nof whether \"there may not be things done, in the one House or the\r\n\nother, of an extraordinary  character, for which the members  who\r\n\ntake part in the act may be held  legally responsible\"); see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nTenney, 341 U.S. at 379 (Black, J., concurring) (recognizing that\r                \r\n\n                              27\r\r\n\nthe  Court's jurisprudence  \"indicates that there  is a  point at\r\n\nwhich  a  legislator's  conduct  so far  exceeds  the  bounds  of\r\n\nlegislative power that he may be held personally liable in a suit\r\n\nbrought  under the Civil Rights Act\").  Whatever may be the outer\r\n\nlimits  of the doctrine  of legislative immunity,  however, it is\r\n\nclear that  the instant case  is not so  extreme as to  cross (or\r\n\neven closely approach) the border.\r\n\n        Taking the  district court's  factual findings  at face\r\n\nvalue, Rule 45, as applied, may  arguably be wrong as a matter of\r\n\npolicy  and as  a matter of  constitutional law    but  it is not\r\n\ninvidiously discriminatory.  To the contrary, the differentiation\r\n\nbetween private and public  lobbyists appears to be based  on two\r\n\nfactors  that  bear  some  rational  relationship  to  legitimate\r                                   \r\n\nlegislative  purposes.    First, the  House  leadership explained\r\n\nthat,  in its view, the  exclusion of private  lobbyists from the\r\n\nfloor  was  a  useful  tool  to   bolster  public  confidence  in\r\n\nlegislative   independence   and   integrity.12      Second,  the\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   12In  a  debate over  a motion  to  reconsider Rule  45, the\r\nMajority Leader, Representative George Caruolo, stated:\r\n\n        This  isn't trying  to retard  lobbyists from\r\n        pursuing their vocation  . . .   It's a  rule\r\n        that says, quite simply, this is the people's\r\n        chamber, the  public  is invited.    But  the\r\n        business of the people should be conducted by\r\n        the people's representatives.   It should not\r\n        be  in any  way  affected by  people who  are\r\n        registered to  advocate particular positions,\r\n        whether they are paid or unpaid . . . .\r\n\n        Later,  Representative Caruolo explained why he thought\r\nthat  governmental lobbyists  on the  floor of  the House  do not\r\ntrigger the same public perceptions as private lobbyists:\r\n\n                              28\r\r\n\ndefendants consistently  have taken the position  that government\r\n\nlobbyists  act in  effect  as support  staff  for legislators  by\r\n\ngiving them neutral statistical and  factual information relevant\r\n\nto pending  legislation.  These justifications  for the continued\r\n\npresence of government lobbyists, found by the  district court to\r\n\nbe authentic (if asthenic),  see Social Workers, 874 F.  Supp. at\r                                                         \r\n\n541-42, afford a sufficiently rational basis  to persuade us that\r\n\nthis case  does not  give rise  to the  question reserved  by the\r\n\nKilbourn Court.13\r                  \r\n\n        Thus,  we  conclude  that,  insofar as  the  appellants\r\n\nenforced  Rule 45's prohibitions  against private  lobbyists, but\r\n\nspared governmental  lobbyists from exclusion,  they acted within\r\n\nthe  legislative   sphere  and   are   protected  from   judicial\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n        [A]ny  general  officer  or   any  government\r\n        employee  who   is  here,  working   in  this\r\n        building  [the  State  House]  on  government\r\n        policy   they're paid  by the government.  We\r\n        are the government.  That's the distinction .\r\n        . .   Let's not have private groups  out here\r\n        trying to  manipulate this floor while we are\r\n        taking votes.\r\n\nIn  the  same  vein,  Edward  Clement,  the  House's  legislative\r\ncoordinator,  testified  that  he  did  not  consider  government\r\nlobbyists to be lobbyists per se, but, rather, \"people called [to\r\nthe floor] by members  of the House for  informational purposes.\"\r\nSpeaker Harwood echoed the  same themes, describing the principal\r\nspokesman  for the  state Budget  Office as  \"a dollars-and-cents\r\nguy.  . . .  a resource  factual guy,\" in contradistinction to \"a\r\nlobbying, influence guy.\"\r\n\n   13This  conclusion is  not undermined  by the  lower court's\r\ndetermination that these reasons  were insufficient to warrant an\r\ninfringement on the First  Amendment rights of private lobbyists.\r\nSee  Social Workers,  874  F. Supp.  at  541-42.   Such  rigorous\r                             \r\ntesting, appropriate  in the First  Amendment context, is  out of\r\nplace  in the context of legislative immunity.

CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n        We  need go  no further.14   In our  republican system,\r\n\ndifferent  institutions of  government occupy  different spheres.\r\n\nWithin  its  own  domain,  the  legislative  branch  of  a  state\r\n\ngovernment is entitled to a reasonable measure of independence in\r\n\nconducting its  internal affairs.    As a  rule, a  legislature's\r\n\nregulation  of  the atmosphere  in  which  it conducts  its  core\r\n\nlegislative activities    debating, voting,  passing legislation,\r\n\nand  the like    is part and  parcel of  the legislative process,\r\n\nand,  hence, not subject to  a judicial veto.   See Eastland, 421\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at  509.  Because  Rule 45,  and the defendants'  actions in\r\n\ninterpreting  and  enforcing it,  fit  within the  sweep  of this\r\n\ngenerality,   the  doctrine  of   absolute  legislative  immunity\r\n\nrequires that the federal courts refuse to entertain the suit.\r\n\nReversed.

All persons  who are\r\n        unable  to  access  the  House  galleries  by\r\n        reason of physical handicap shall be entitled\r\n        to admission to the House floor.\r\n\n        (b)   Lobbyists    including   former   state\r\n        legislators  who are  lobbyists shall  not be\r\n        entitled to  admission  to the  floor of  the\r\n        House during the session  thereof.

When   the\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit  Judge,   dissenting.\r                                                          \r\n\ngovernment chooses to  listen only  to its own  voice in  the\r\n\npolitical  process   by  excluding  the   voices  of  private\r\n\ncitizens, core  First Amendment values are violated.   At the\r\n\nheart of  this case  is not the  ability of the  Rhode Island\r\n\nHouse  to  promulgate  rules  for  the  conduct  of  its  own\r\n\nbusiness,  but  the  defendants'  actual  practice,  directly\r\n\ncontrary to  the  Rule adopted  by  the House,  of  excluding\r\n\nspeakers  unless  they  represent  the  government  and  thus\r\n\nexpress the government's own  viewpoint.  While, in  my view,\r\n\nthe House  could have  legitimately closed the  floor of  its\r\n\nChamber to all  who sought to influence  its work, defendants\r\n\nmay  not permit  government lobbyists to  lobby on  the House\r\n\nfloor   while  prohibiting   private  citizens   and  private\r\n\nlobbyists  from doing the same.  The First Amendment does not\r\n\npermit the government to put its  thumb on the scale in  this\r\n\nway and favor itself in the arena  of political speech.  With\r\n\nrespect, I dissent.\r\n\n          Unlike  the   majority,  I   would  not  take   the\r\n\nextraordinary   step   of   affording   defendants   absolute\r\n\nlegislative immunity, thus preventing the court from reaching\r\n\nthe First Amendment issue.  The  majority does so in the name\r\n\nof federalism and comity,  important values to be sure.   But\r\n\nnaming  those values  may obscure  the issues  involved here.\r\n\nThis  case   does  not   implicate   traditional  issues   of\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\n\"federalism\"  at  all,  such  as  the  limits  on  enumerated\r\n\ncongressional  powers, see United States v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct.\r                                                             \r\n\n1624 (1995), or the  relative allocation of legislative power\r\n\nbetween state and federal  governments, see U.S. Term Limits,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v. Thornton,  115 S. Ct. 1842 (1995).  Rather, this case\r                            \r\n\nraises  thorny issues  of  the  constitutional allocation  of\r\n\npowers  between the  people  and those  elected to  represent\r\n\nthem,  and  of  the  appropriate role  of  federal  courts in\r\n\nresolving such issues. \r\n\n                            Facts\r                                             \r\n\n          Rule  45 on its face does not permit any lobbyists,\r\n\ngovernment or private, to be on the House floor and prohibits\r\n\nlobbying  on  the  floor  by  anyone,  private  citizen15  or\r\n\nprofessional  lobbyist, while the House is in session.  It is\r\n\nthat Rule which reflects the decision of the House as  to the\r\n\nrunning of  its affairs.  Permitting  government lobbyists to\r\n\nlobby on the floor of the House violates the House Rule.  \r\n\n          The defendants  claimed that  such  were not  their\r\n\npractices.  But the district court, after trial, found to the\r\n\ncontrary  and  the defendants  have  not  appealed from  that\r\n\nfactual determination.   The  record amply  demonstrates that\r\n\ngovernment lobbyists were regularly plying their trade on the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Under the terms of Rule 45, certain government officials\r\nincluding  the  Governor, the  Secretary  of  State, and  the\r\nAttorney  General  have  access  to  the  floor.    The  Rule\r\nnonetheless prohibits anyone from lobbying.\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nfloor after adoption of the House  Rule which ostensibly kept\r\n\nthem out.    And, as  the  district court  found,  defendants\r\n\n\"flagrantly permitted\" such activities.\r\n\n          The Rhode Island  House presents a  factual setting\r\n\nperhaps unique in this country.  Unlike    many   legislative\r\n\nbodies,  including the  United  States  Congress, most  Rhode\r\n\nIsland legislators are part-time and have neither offices nor\r\n\nstaff.  The House meets for six months or less in a year, and\r\n\nthen only for three  or four afternoons and evenings  a week.\r\n\nOnce  the  session  starts,  it  rarely breaks  until  it  is\r\n\nconcluded.  Legislators typically arrive just in time for the\r\n\nsession and leave immediately on its conclusion.  Legislators\r\n\nhave no  desks other  than their  desks on the  floor of  the\r\n\nChamber.   Often there is no  other place  but  the floor for\r\n\ndirect  communication   with  the  legislators,   apart  from\r\n\ndisturbing  legislators  in   their  capacities  as   private\r\n\ncitizens where they live or work.\r\n\n          Amendments  to bills  are often introduced  for the\r\n\nfirst  time on the floor.  They  are often unavailable to the\r\n\npublic  before being introduced and are available only in the\r\n\nHouse Chamber after being introduced.  Frequently, especially\r\n\ntoward the close  of the session, the House votes  on such an\r\n\namendment on the  same day, and sometimes  within minutes, of\r\n\nthe amendment being introduced.  \r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n          Around  the perimeter  of  the floor  of the  House\r\n\nChamber  are approximately  eighteen chairs.   Some  of those\r\n\nchairs  have  been filled  on  a  daily basis  by  government\r\n\nlobbyists  since  Rule 45  was  enacted.   The  remainder are\r\n\nfilled  by members  of  the public.    Private lobbyists  are\r\n\nrelegated to balcony seating.\r\n\n          Government officials sitting in the perimeter seats\r\n\nhave  and  use  a  decided advantage  in  communicating  with\r\n\nlegislators and in  collecting and disseminating information.\r\n\nIndividual legislators frequently walk over to the  perimeter\r\n\nto speak with the government lobbyists.  These lobbyists send\r\n\nnotes to legislators indicating that they would like to speak\r\n\nand  they  get the  attention  of  individual legislators  by\r\n\nsignalling them.   People seated  along the perimeter  of the\r\n\nfloor receive more  information than others concerning  floor\r\n\namendments, which  are  distributed to  the legislators  only\r\n\nwhen they are introduced.  Thus, government lobbyists who are\r\n\nsitting on the floor  can see copies of floor  amendments and\r\n\nhave the  opportunity to  communicate their views,  including\r\n\npertinent information,  to the legislators.   It is virtually\r\n\nimpossible  for those who are not permitted onto the floor to\r\n\nlearn the exact language of an offered amendment because  the\r\n\ntext of  floor amendments is  not distributed outside  of the\r\n\nChamber.\r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\n          Government  lobbyists  have  actively  lobbied  for\r\n\ntheir  positions both from  the perimeter seats  and from the\r\n\nfloor  itself.  They have  done so on  bills which government\r\n\nofficials  have  supported  and  which  private  groups  have\r\n\nopposed.  Those bills often concerned matters of great public\r\n\ndebate.  For example, the topic of public funding of abortion\r\n\nwas  taken up by the  legislature.  Agents  of the Governor's\r\n\noffice,  which supported such  funding, sat on  the floor and\r\n\ntalked  to  legislators while  the  lobbyist  from the  Rhode\r\n\nIsland  State Right  to Life  Committee, Inc.,  which opposed\r\n\nsuch funding, was  relegated to the balcony.   Similarly, the\r\n\nAttorney  General  of  Rhode  Island  introduced  a  bill  to\r\n\nreinstate the  death penalty and he and his staff were on the\r\n\nfloor during debates on  the bill, speaking with legislators.\r\n\nPrivate group lobbyists opposed  to the bill, including those\r\n\nfrom  the  Rhode  Island  Affiliate  of  the  American  Civil\r\n\nLiberties Union, could only watch  from the balcony and  were\r\n\nprecluded from the floor and from lobbying.\r\n\n          The same duality  characterized the influencing  of\r\n\nbills  on  welfare reform.    Government  lobbyists from  the\r\n\nDepartment of  Human Services were present  for floor debates\r\n\non  an  amendment  which   would  restore  a  General  Public\r\n\nAssistance  program  cut from  the  Governor's  budget.   The\r\n\nDepartment  favored elimination  of  the program.   Lobbyists\r\n\nfrom the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), which\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nopposed eliminating the program, were excluded.  There was no\r\n\nbreak in  the  session between  the  time the  amendment  was\r\n\nintroduced and it was voted upon.  Similarly, in  debate over\r\n\nan amendment to an AFDC program, lobbyists for the Department\r\n\nin the perimeter seats attempted to influence the vote, while\r\n\na NASW lobbyist in the balcony ineffectively tried  to convey\r\n\nthe NASW's  position by  waving hands.   Prison-related bills\r\n\nreceived  the  same  treatment.   Department  of  Corrections\r\n\nofficials were  on the  floor with legislators  during debate\r\n\nwhile ACLU  lobbyists who opposed  the Department's  position\r\n\nwatched ineffectively from the  balcony.  There were numerous\r\n\nother  instances  where  the  Governor's  Office,  the  State\r\n\nPolice, the  Department of Economic Development,  the Banking\r\n\nand  Insurance  Department,  the Fire  Marshal,  the  General\r\n\nTreasurer's Office and the Department  of Business Regulation\r\n\nlobbyists  spoke  directly  with  legislators  on  the  floor\r\n\nregarding pending legislation.16\r\n\n          Nor  were   the  advantages  given   to  government\r\n\nlobbyists   limited  to   lobbyists  from   state  government\r\n\nagencies.   The lobbyist for  the Mayor of  Providence was on\r\n\nthe floor of the House  every day, frequently conversing with\r\n\nlegislators.  She spoke with legislators on issues as  varied\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  The ability  of government employees  to sit in  the few\r\nperimeter seats may have been used  to advance their personal\r\ninterests as well.  For example, during debates  on incentive\r\npay  for  court clerks,  two court  clerks  sat in  the aisle\r\nseats.\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nas a proposed  gun court,  the Providence  water supply,  and\r\n\nfunding for the city.\r\n\n          Lobbying  by  government  lobbyists at  times  took\r\n\nplace  among  the seats  of  the legislators,  even  with the\r\n\nknowledge of the Speaker.  For example, when the House was in\r\n\nsession, the Providence lobbyist  was on a cellular telephone\r\n\nand walked  in between  the rows  of the legislators'  seats,\r\n\npassing  the telephone to  certain members of  the House, who\r\n\nlistened  and spoke  into the  telephone.  The  telephone was\r\n\neventually passed  to the  Speaker, who also  listened, spoke\r\n\nand chuckled.   Only  when a  member of  the House  raised an\r\n\nobjection  did  the Providence  lobbyist  move  to the  outer\r\n\naisles.  But she was not asked to leave the floor and was not\r\n\nasked to refrain from speaking to the legislators.\r\n\n                           Immunity\r                                               \r\n\n          I  respectfully disagree  with the  decision of  my\r\n\nvery able colleagues to  afford absolute legislative immunity\r\n\nto both  of the defendants.  Not only was the defense waived,\r\n\nbut  even if  it had  been properly  raised, the  doctrine of\r\n\nlegislative  immunity  does  not,  in my  view,  foreclose  a\r\n\njudicial  determination  of  the  constitutionality   of  the\r\n\ndefendants'  practices.   The  challenged  practices  do  not\r\n\nconstitute the  kind of \"purely legislative  activities\" that\r\n\nhave  traditionally   triggered   the  protections   of   the\r\n\nlegislative immunity bar.   Raising that bar in this  case is\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\nnot  necessary  to vindicate  the  vital  interests that  the\r\n\ndoctrine was  intended  to safeguard,  and  indeed  undercuts\r\n\nthose interests.\r\n\n          This case does not  present the kind of exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances  that would  even permit  consideration  of the\r\n\ndefendants'  legislative  immunity  arguments, because  those\r\n\narguments  were  not raised  in  the  district  court.

Here,  the immunity doctrine  -- hardly  an obscure\r\n\nlegal  concept -- was never raised as a defense to liability,\r\n\neven when the distinguished  trial court was solicitous about\r\n\nminimizing   the  intrusion  of   the  litigation   into  the\r\n\nfunctioning of  the state legislature.   Defendant Harwood is\r\n\nhimself an attorney and both defendants were ably represented\r\n\nin  the district  court.   I see  no reason  not to  hold the\r\n\ndefendants to  their waivers.

Wulff,  428\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 106, 121 (1976)  (reversing court of appeals in  a civil\r\n\ncase for deciding issues not argued in the district court).\r\n\n          In  reaching the immunity  issue, the majority sets\r\n\nup   a  virtually   no-lose   proposition  for   legislators.\r\n\nLegislators  are certainly cognizant of the public perception\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nthat  raising an immunity defense is tantamount to a claim of\r\n\nbeing above  the Constitution.   Thus, raising  a defense  of\r\n\nlegislative  immunity  at the  outset  of  litigation is  not\r\n\nwithout its political costs.   The majority's approach, which\r\n\npermits  the  defense to  be  raised  after trial,  virtually\r                                                       \r\n\neliminates  any incentive to raise  it sooner.   If the trial\r\n\nwere  to  produce  an unfavorable  outcome,  the  legislator-\r\n\ndefendant could simply  assert immunity  on appeal,  claiming\r\n\nthat  the  failure  to raise  the  defense  earlier  had been\r\n\ninadvertent.  Because there rarely will be direct evidence to\r\n\ncounter such a claim of inadvertence, and because the defense\r\n\nof absolute  legislative immunity will always  present a law-\r\n\nbased,  potentially  dispositive  question of  constitutional\r\n\nmagnitude,  a  court  of   appeals  applying  the  majority's\r\n\napproach would almost  inevitably consider the defense,  even\r\n\nthough raised for the first time on appeal.\r\n\n          Moreover, to the extent  that one of the rationales\r\n\nunderlying  legislative  immunity  is  to  prevent  vexatious\r\n\nlitigation  against legislators, that rationale is undermined\r\n\nwhere  (as here)  the legislator-defendant  goes through  the\r\n\nentire trial and  raises the  defense only on  appeal.   \"The\r\n\npurpose  of the  protection  afforded legislators  is not  to\r\n\nforestall judicial review of legislative action but to insure\r\n\nthat  legislators are not distracted from  or hindered in the\r\n\nperformance of  their legislative tasks by  being called into\r\n\n                             -41-\r                                         -41-\r\r\n\ncourt to defend  their actions.\"   Powell, 395  U.S. at  505.\r                                                     \r\n\nDenials  of legislative  immunity are  immediately appealable\r\n\nbecause the immunity is not simply a defense to liability but\r\n\nis also an immunity from suit.  Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n500, 508  (1979).  Appellate  courts are unable  to vindicate\r\n\nthat  interest where  defendants  wait until  after trial  to\r\n\nraise the immunity  defense.  See  id.  There  thus may be  a\r                                                  \r\n\ngreater systemic  interest in  ensuring that the  interest is\r\n\nraised early.\r\n\n          Much  of  what  the  immunity  protects  cannot  be\r\n\nremedied  here.   Because  the  defendants  never asserted  a\r\n\ndefense of  immunity, the action  was fully tried  before the\r\n\nquestion  was ever  put to the  district court.   Legislators\r\n\nhave  already   testified.    Deciding  the   merits  of  the\r\n\nconstitutional  question  entails  no  additional  burden  or\r\n\ninconvenience upon the  defendants.  The  need to ignore  the\r\n\ndefendants' waiver in order to  reach the immunity issue  is,\r\n\nas a result, greatly reduced.17\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  Even if one could  overlook defendants' waiver, we could\r\nnot  reach the immunity issue absent a showing of plain error\r\nby the  district court.  Cf.  United States v.

The  Supreme Court's case law  demonstrates that even\r\n\nif a suit asserting individual rights could not be brought to\r\n\nchallenge  a  legislative act  per se,  it  is not  barred by\r                                                 \r\n\nlegislative immunity  if it  merely seeks  prospective relief\r\n\nagainst  a legislative employee for  his role in carrying out\r\n\nor  enforcing the  directives of  that same  legislative act.\r\n\nThat is precisely what the plaintiffs seek here.\r\n\n          There  is no  immunity  for practices  that  simply\r\n\nrelate to legislative  activities.

In my view,\r                                                          \r\n\nlegislative immunity does not  reach enforcement of the House\r\n\nRule because such enforcement is not \"an integral part of the\r\n\n                             -44-\r                                         -44-\r\r\n\ndeliberative   and  communicative  processes\"  of  the  state\r\n\nlegislature.\r\n\n          Of course,  the regulation of the  admission of the\r\n\npublic  to the House's floor  has an important  impact on the\r                                                                  \r\n\nlegislative process  -- that is  what this lawsuit  is about.\r\n\nBut  it belies  common  usage, I  believe,  to say  that  the\r\n\ndefendants' practices relating to  the admission or exclusion\r\n\nof  classes of persons  from the  House floor  constitute \"an\r\n\nintegral   part  of   the   deliberative  and   communicative\r\n\nprocesses\" of the legislature.

However, the Court  permitted the\r                                                                     \r\n\nsuit  to go forward against the House's Sergeant at Arms, who\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                         -47-\r\r\n\nhad merely executed the unconstitutional arrest warrant.

As the  Supreme  Court later  summarized  the\r               \r\n\nholding  of Kilbourn:  \"That  the House  could with  impunity\r                                \r\n\norder an unconstitutional  arrest afforded no  protection for\r\n\nthose who  made the arrest.\"   Gravel, 408 U.S. at  618.

Applying the  teaching of\r                                     \r\n\nKilbourn,  the Court  went on  to hold  that the  doctrine of\r                    \r\n\nlegislative immunity did not  bar a judicial determination of\r                                        \r\n\nthe  merits  of  plaintiffs' constitutional  claims,  to  the\r\n\nextent   that  those   claims  were   asserted  against   the\r\n\nlegislative  employees  who had  merely been  responsible for\r\n\nenforcing the  House's  resolution, namely,  the Sergeant  at\r                     \r\n\nArms, the Clerk, and the Doorkeeper.

In that case, which arose out\r                                         \r\n\nof an allegedly illegal raid, the Court sustained the defense\r\n\nof  legislative immunity  with respect to  the Chairman  of a\r\n\nsubcommittee  of  the  U.S. Senate  Judiciary  Committee  for\r\n\nissuing  subpoenas  to gather  information,  but  declined to\r\n\nextend  immunity  to  the  subcommittee's  counsel,  who  had\r\n\nallegedly participated  in the execution of  the illegal raid\r\n\nto obtain the  same information.  See id.  at 84.

The\r\n\nplaintiffs sought declaratory  and injunctive relief,  naming\r\n\nthe  Virginia Court and  its Chief Justice  (among others) as\r\n\ndefendants.   The Supreme  Court concluded that  the Virginia\r\n\nCourt, in propounding the disciplinary rules, had acted in  a\r\n\nlegislative (not judicial) capacity.   The Virginia Court was\r\n\nheld  entitled  to  absolute  legislative immunity  for  acts\r\n\npertaining to the enactment  of the disciplinary rules, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nrefusing to amend the rules to comport with the Constitution.\r\n\nSee  id. at  733-34.   The  Supreme  Court further  observed,\r                    \r\n\nhowever,  that  the  Virginia  Court  performed  not  only  a\r\n\nlegislative role with respect  to the disciplinary rules, but\r\n\nalso had enforcement authority.

The Court\r                                                     \r\n\nconcluded  that to  the extent  that the  plaintiffs' section\r\n\n1983  action sought prospective  relief against  the Virginia\r\n\nCourt   in  its   enforcement   capacity,  the   doctrine  of\r                                         \r\n\nlegislative immunity did not bar the suit.

In\r            judicial  determination of a plaintiff's constitutional claim\r\nForrester, a  state court judge enjoyed  no judicial immunity\r                     \r\nfor  the administrative  acts  of demoting  and dismissing  a\r            to the extent that the claim is one for injunctive relief and\r\nprobation officer.

The court there in fact\r\nreached  the merits  and  scrutinized the  plaintiffs'  First\r\nAmendment claims, but found them wanting.\r\n\n                             -53-\r                                         -53-\r\r\n\nimmunities  to benefit  communications between  the executive\r\n\nbranch (government lobbyists) and the legislative  branch, to\r\n\nthe  exclusion  of  communication  from  groups  of   private\r\n\ncitizens.   Judicial illumination  of the immunity,  as James\r\n\nMadison said, must be guided by \"the reason and the necessity\r\n\nof  the privilege.\"    Letter from  James  Madison to  Philip\r\n\nDoddridge  (June 6, 1832), in 4 Letters and Other Writings of\r                                                                         \r\n\nJames Madison 221 (1884).  That reason  and necessity dictate\r                         \r\n\nthat  this court not credit the immunity defense on the facts\r\n\nof this case.\r\n\n                       First Amendment\r                                                  \r\n\n          Is the First Amendment violated by  the defendants'\r\n\npractice  of admitting  government  lobbyists onto  the House\r\n\nfloor  to  lobby while  excluding those  not employed  by the\r\n\ngovernment?   The answer,  I believe, is  that the defendants\r\n\nhave violated the First Amendment.  \r\n\n          Several   interrelated    and   fundamental   First\r\n\nAmendment  interests   are   offended  by   the   defendants'\r\n\npractices.   The  defendants have  excluded  the  plaintiffs'\r\n\npolitical speech and have done so in a discriminatory manner.\r\n\nThe defendants'  practices have  resulted  in viewpoint-  and\r\n\ncontent-based  discrimination,  favoring government  speakers\r\n\nand  government  viewpoints   and  excluding   non-government\r\n\nspeakers and non-government viewpoints.   The restrictions on\r\n\nspeech posed  by the practices  are severe in  their effects.\r\n\n                             -54-\r                                         -54-\r\r\n\nDefendants'   discriminatory   practices   also  permit   the\r\n\ngovernment  unchecked  power to  act  in  its self  interest,\r\n\nrather than in the  interest of the citizens.   These effects\r\n\nstrike  at  the heart  of  the First  Amendment,  and subject\r\n\ndefendants'  practices to  the highest  level of  scrutiny, a\r\n\nscrutiny  defendants  cannot  withstand.24   Those  practices\r\n\nare  not  narrowly  tailored   to  meet  a  compelling  state\r\n\ninterest, and therefore fail to pass constitutional muster.\r\n\n          The  parties have framed  the First Amendment issue\r\n\nin  terms of  whether the  House Chamber  floor is  a \"public\r\n\nforum.\"     But   the   \"public   forum\"   doctrine,   itself\r\n\nproblematic,25 is  particularly ill-suited to this  case.

The  Rhode Island\r\n\nHouse is  singular  in the  lack of  opportunity for  private\r\n\ncitizens  to  have   direct,  effective  communications  with\r\n\nlegislators.    The  ability  to communicate  directly  is  a\r\n\nconsiderable advantage.  The situation created by the private\r\n\nlobbyist ban is that akin to a monopoly over a single channel\r\n\nof communication,  where the government has  discriminated in\r\n\nproviding  access to  that  channel and  also determined  the\r\n\ncontent of what flows through the channel.  \r\n\n          Against   this   panoply  of   dangers31   must  be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n31.  Defendants' argument  poses yet  other dangers too.   If\r\nthe   legislature  gets  information  from  nowhere  but  the\r\nexecutive   branch,   the   legislature's  ability   to   act\r\nindependently,  and thus  to be  a check  and balance  to the\r\nexecutive  is  undercut.     This  corollary  danger  of  the\r\nundercutting  of the separation of powers  at the state level\r\nis  keenly  illustrated by  the  amicus  brief  filed by  the\r\nexecutive   branch,   urging   strongly   its   interest   in\r\n\n                             -62-\r                                         -62-\r\r\n\nmeasured  the interests  attributed to  the defendants.   The\r\n\nmajority  finds, in the immunity analysis, that there are two\r\n\nsuch interests32 and that the interests would pass a rational\r\n\nbasis  test, at least for determining whether to carve out an\r\n\nexception to the immunity it  would grant.  Without accepting\r\n\nthe  premise  that  the   only  exceptions  to  immunity  are\r\n\nirrational legislative  acts, neither  of those  interests is\r\n\nsufficient  to  withstand  strict  scrutiny.33   Indeed,  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncommunicating  with   the  legislature  and   supporting  the\r\nexclusion of private voices.\r\n\n32.  To  the extent  that  the House  Rule  on its  face  was\r\njustified  as an effort to maintain decorum and control noise\r\nto a level which did not interfere with the members work, the\r\nrecord shows  instances in which government  lobbyists on the\r                                                       \r\nfloor were objected to  by members as causing problems.   The\r\ndefendants  accordingly   do   not  try   to  justify   their\r\ndiscriminatory distinction on such grounds.\r\n\n33.  Defendants'  practice  does  not   even  meet  the  less\r\nrigorous  test   of  intermediate  scrutiny.     Intermediate\r\nscrutiny of restrictions  has traditionally  been applied  to\r\ncommercial  speech that  concerns  unlawful  activity  or  is\r\nmisleading, see  Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 115 S.

The test has three related\r                        \r\nprongs: first,  the  government  must  assert  a  substantial\r\ninterest in support of the regulation; second, the government\r\nmust demonstrate that the restriction directly and materially\r\nadvances  that interest;  and third,  the regulation  must be\r\n\"narrowly drawn.\"   Florida Bar,  115 S.

The\r                                           \r\ngovernment's asserted interest in having government lobbyists\r\non  the floor  of  the House,  to  the exclusion  of  private\r\nlobbyists, is  to have  them  provide information.   But  the\r\ngovernment has  not shown  why the  interest  in having  only\r\ngovernment provide  information, and  not private groups,  is\r\n\"substantial.\"   Relatedly, the  restriction is not \"narrowly\r\ntailored\" to  meet the information provision  goal because it\r\nis overbroad and serves  to exclude valuable information that\r\nprivate lobbyists might provide.  \r\n\n                             -63-\r                                         -63-\r\r\n\ndefendants' bedrock argument is different again, and it, too,\r\n\nis insufficient.\r\n\n          The   majority   credits   reasons  of   bolstering\r\n\nlegislative independence and  of having government  lobbyists\r\n\nact to provide information.  But legislative independence was\r\n\nproffered as a reason for Rule 45 on its face, which excludes\r\n\nall lobbyists, and not  to the distinction between government\r\n\nand non-government lobbyists.34\r\n\n          Defendants  argue  that allowing  only governmental\r\n\nlobbyists access to the  floor of the legislature  serves the\r\n\ngoal of allowing legislators to receive valuable information.\r\n\nDefendants,   however,   have  established   no  demonstrable\r\n\ninterest in receiving information  from the government to the\r\n\nexclusion of private sources.

A goal  of legislative independence is quite legitimate.\r\nBut the interest distinctively served by the private lobbyist\r\nrestriction  is to  display to  the public  the legislature's\r\nspecial hostility  towards the private  interest groups  that\r\nattempt to influence their  votes. \"The politicians of [Rhode\r\nIsland] are  entitled to  express that  hostility --  but not\r\nthrough  the  means  of  imposing   unique  limitations  upon\r\nspeakers who (however benightedly) disagree.\"  R.A.V., 112 S.\r                                                                 \r\nCt.  at 2550.   \"The  point of  the First  Amendment is  that\r\nmajority preferences must be  expressed in some fashion other\r\nthan  silencing speech on the basis  of its content.\"  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n2548.  \"[T]he First Amendment as we understand it today rests\r\non  the  premise that  it  is government  power,  rather than\r\nprivate power,  that is the  main threat to  free expression;\r\nand  as a  consequence,  the  Amendment  imposes  substantial\r\nlimitations on the Government even when it is trying to serve\r\nconcededly praiseworthy  goals.\" Turner Broadcasting,  114 S.\r                                                                \r\nCt.  at 2480 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting\r\nin part).\r\n\n                             -64-\r                                         -64-\r\r\n\nsources  controlled   by  its  own  interests   is  hardly  a\r\n\ncompelling  one.35   \"A State's  claim  that it  is enhancing\r\n\nthe  ability  of its  citizenry  to  make wise  decisions  by\r\n\nrestricting the flow  of information to  them must be  viewed\r\n\nwith some skepticism. . . .

Defendants  attempt  to  liken  their  private  lobbying\r\nrestriction to  the restrictions on lobbying  imposed by Rule\r\nXXXII  of  the   United  States  House  of   Representatives.\r\nDefendants'   analogy,  however,   works  against   them  and\r\ndemonstrates  that  there is  no  \"compelling\"  need to  give\r\ngovernment  lobbyists  access to  the  floor  to lobby  while\r\nexcluding others.  Unlike the defendants' practices, the U.S.\r\nHouse  of  Representatives  Rule does  not  allow  government\r\nlobbyists to  lobby while excluding private  lobbyists.  Rule\r\nXXXII  is  neutral and  excludes all  lobbyists.   Even those\r\nnormally  afforded the courtesy of admission  to the floor --\r\nformer Members of the House, former  Parliamentarians, former\r\nelected officers,  and former  elected minority  employees of\r\nthe  House  --   are  denied  admission  if   they  or  their\r\norganizations have any interest  in matters before the House.\r\nSimilarly, staff  of a Member are not allowed to lobby on the\r\noccasions  they are admitted to  the House.   That the United\r\nStates House of Representatives has chosen neutrality and not\r\nto   grant  preference  to   the  government   lobbyists  and\r\ninformation providers (if there is any distinction) undercuts\r\nany argument by  defendants that they have a  compelling need\r\nto give preference to the government.\r\n\n                             -65-\r                                         -65-\r\r\n\n501,  511 n.** (1991).  In this case the restriction excludes\r\n\nvaluable information  from the  legislative purview.   As the\r\n\nmajority points  out, lobbying groups  have vastly  different\r\n\ninterests  and  perspectives.     Access to  such  varied and\r\n\nindependent  sources of  information, far  from  impeding the\r\n\nlegislature's access to  useful information, surely functions\r\n\nto  increase both the quality  and the quantity  of the total\r\n\nset of information available.   \r\n\n          The provision of  information from executive branch\r\n\nagencies to members of  the legislature is a  very legitimate\r\n\ninterest of  government.   The majority suggests  there is  a\r\n\ndistinction between mere  information providing and lobbying,\r\n\nbut that  distinction is  contradicted  by the  record.   The\r\n\nfactual findings  of the district  court leave no  doubt that\r\n\nthe court considered the contention that government lobbyists\r\n\nwere engaging in mere \"information-providing\" and rejected it\r\n\nas a factual matter.  \r\n\n          Even if  the distinction were tenable  on the facts\r\n\nhere, as it is not, it does not provide refuge from the First\r\n\nAmendment.     There  is  plainly  value  to  the  speech  by\r\n\ngovernment lobbyists, whether it  be heavy-handed lobbying or\r\n\nmore lightly  dexterous provision of information.   See Block\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Meese,  793 F.2d 1303,  1312-14 (D.C. Cir.)  (Scalia, J.),\r                    \r\n\ncert.  denied,  478  U.S. 1021  (1986).    But  the value  of\r                         \r\n\ngovernment speech is  not the  point.  Rather,  the point  is\r\n\n                             -66-\r                                         -66-\r\r\n\nthat  the  government has  permitted  itself  to speak  while\r\n\nprohibiting non-government speech.  \r\n\n          Speech  from   non-government  speakers,  including\r\n\nlobbyists, is  also valuable.  Indeed, while  lobbying may be\r\n\nsubject to  registration and  disclosure,36 no case  has ever\r\n\nsuggested that lobbying, including  its information-gathering\r\n\nand providing component,  could be banned entirely.  But that\r\n\nissue need not be reached here, for what is clear is that the\r\n\ngovernment must keep the playing field level.37\r\n\n          Moreover,  even if  there  were greater  reason  to\r\n\ncredit  the distinction  between \"information  providing\" and\r\n\n\"lobbying,\" First Amendment \"due  process\" type issues  would\r\n\nstill  preclude reliance  on the  distinction to  justify the\r\n\nrestriction  of  First  Amendment   rights.

Political scientists  have found\r\nthat  lobbyists' primary strategy  in influencing legislators\r\nis to  provide information to counteract  the similar efforts\r\nof other  groups, not  to achieve influence  through pressure\r\ntactics.

Even if there were\r\n\na  discernible distinction,  the \"difference  between factual\r\n\nstatement and advocacy  may turn upon the debatability of the\r\n\nfacts described as true, or the pertinency of facts omitted.\"\r\n\nBlock, 793 F.2d at  1313.  The distinction between  providing\r                 \r\n\ninformation and acting for the purpose of \"influencing in any\r\n\nmanner the  passage  of  legislation\"  is  exceedingly  fine.\r\n\nHere, legislators  testified that \"information\"  provided did\r\n\nin  fact influence  them  on  how to  vote.   The  House  has\r\n\nrecognized that information may influence  votes.  Rule 45 on\r\n\nits face provides that \"no person . . . shall either directly\r                                                                         \r\n\nor indirectly\" engage in the practice of lobbying.  The House\r                         \r\n\nhas  thus  drawn  the  line to  preclude  any  activity, even\r\n\nindirect, to influence votes.   The First Amendment puts  the\r\n\nburden on the  government to finely  tailor its practices  to\r\n\npermissible goals,  and no  such fine tailoring  was done  by\r\n\ndefendants' practices here.  See  Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n115 S. Ct. 1585, 1593 (1995).\r\n\n          The   real  argument   that  the   defendants  have\r\n\narticulated  to justify  their  actions is  their claim  that\r\n\ngovernment   lobbyists  represent   the  people   while  non-\r\n\n                             -68-\r                                         -68-\r\r\n\ngovernment lobbyists do not.  Accordingly, they say, there is\r\n\nno  cause to worry.   That is an  inversion of constitutional\r\n\nvalues.  While there may be value to the government voice, it\r\n\ncannot be the only  voice.  To permit that to be  so would be\r\n\nto stifle discussion.  See Buckley  v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,  14\r                                                        \r\n\n(1976) (\"Discussion  of public issues  . . .[is]  integral to\r\n\nthe operation of  the system of government established by our\r\n\nConstitution.    The  First  Amendment affords  the  broadest\r\n\nprotection to  such political expression in  order 'to assure\r\n\n[the] unfettered interchange of  ideas for the bringing about\r\n\nof  political and  social  changes desired  by the  people.'\"\r\n\n(citing Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957))).\r                                         \r\n\n          There  is  another danger,  and  that  is that  the\r\n\ngovernment's voice will not  truly represent the interests of\r\n\nthe  public.38    Government should  theoretically  represent\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n38.  Defendants  express a legitimate concern that government\r\nmay  be captured by \"special interests.\"  Apart from the fact\r\nthat  the government  itself  is frequently  its own  special\r\ninterest group,  the solution to the problem  of a government\r\ncaptured by \"special interests\"  would hardly be to have  the\r\ngovernment speak only to itself.\r\n          Moreover, many of  the plaintiff groups may  hardly\r\nbe  characterized  as  the   centers  of  wealth,  power  and\r\nprivilege.  Citizens,  who themselves may not be  affluent or\r\npowerful, band  together in  groups to lobby  the government,\r\nwhether  the groups be, to  give but two  examples, the Rhode\r\nIsland State  Right  To Life  Committee, Inc.,  or the  local\r\nchapter of the ACLU.  These groups may be thought to be a way\r\nto avoid the capturing  of government by \"special interests.\"\r\nDefendants' practices may thus  thrust them headlong into the\r\ndangers  they profess to wish to avoid.  Central to effecting\r\na system  of democratic  self-governance is  enabling private\r\ninterests to be able  to act in concert.   Without collective\r\naction it  may be  impossible to alter  the status quo.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -69-\r                                         -69-\r\r\n\nthe  people  and not  represent itself.   Theory  and reality\r\n\noften depart.  The government  is not always a mirror  of the\r\n\npeople.    Government  employees  today  are  recognized   as\r\n\nconstituting their own interest group.

Madison feared that government might choose to serve\r\n\nitself instead of the citizens, saying:\r\n\n          In framing  a government  which is  to be\r\n          administered by  men over men,  the great\r\n          difficulty lies in this:   you must first\r\n          enable  the  government  to  control  the\r\n          governed; and in the next place oblige it\r\n          to control  itself.  A dependence  on the\r\n          people  is, no doubt, the primary control\r\n          on government; but experience  has taught\r\n          mankind   the   necessity  of   auxiliary\r\n          precautions.\r\n\nId. at  160; see  also Amar, The  Bill of  Rights, supra,  at\r                                                                    \r\n\n1132-33.   Central  among  those \"auxiliary  precautions\"  in\r\n\nobliging  the government to control itself from self-interest\r\n\nand self-dealing are the  protections afforded to citizens by\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          survive the legislative  snuffing out  of\r\n          freedom . . . to speak.\r\n\nTenney v.

Among\r\n\nthem was Rule  45 (the full  text of which  is reproduced in  the\r\n\nappendix).  On its face, Rule 45 banishes  all lobbyists from the\r\n\nfloor of the  House (and the House lounge) while  the House is in\r\n\nsession.   Nonetheless, the rule permits members of the public to\r\n\nbe on  the House floor  while the House  is in  session, provided\r\n\nthat  \"they remain seated along the sides of the chamber, refrain\r\n\nfrom conversation, and  maintain the decorum  of the House,\"  and\r\n\nprovided further that they do  not \"directly or indirectly engage\r\n\nin the practice of lobbying.\"  Rule 45(b).\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   2The  district court  nonetheless  rebuffed the  legislator-\r\nplaintiffs,  who  claimed  that  Rule  45  violated  their  First\r\nAmendment  right to  receive  political information.   The  court\r\nruled that, even if the legislators had been denied some level of\r\naccess to lobbyists, the denial did not \"rise[] to the level of a\r\nconstitutional  deprivation.\"   Social Workers,  874 F.

Nevertheless,  state\r                \r\n\nlegislators and  their surrogates enjoy a  parallel immunity from\r\n\nliability for their legislative acts.\r\n\n        While this immunity is derived from federal common law,\r\n\nit is  similar in  scope and  object to  the immunity  enjoyed by\r\n\nfederal  legislators under the Speech or Debate Clause.

We think it is beyond serious dispute that enforcing\r\n\na duly enacted  legislative rule which prohibits lobbying  on the\r\n\nHouse floor during House sessions  is well within the legislative\r\n\nsphere.   Such  a restriction necessarily  affects the  manner in\r\n\nwhich  the  House conducts  its  most characteristic  legislative\r\n\nfunctions, e.g., debating  and voting.   A rule  that colors  the\r                         \r\n\nvery conditions  under which legislators engage  in formal debate\r\n\nis  indubitably part and  parcel of the  legislative process, and\r\n\nthe acts of House  officials (whether or not elected  members) in\r\n\nenforcing  it  are  therefore  fully  protected against  judicial\r\n\ninterference by the  doctrine of legislative immunity.

Seating\r\n\narrangements for  non-legislators arguably are  less integral  to\r\n\nthe legislative  process than  the regulation of  lobbying during\r\n\nHouse  sessions.   As  the trial  testimony  in this  case  amply\r\n\ndemonstrates, however,  when lobbyists  are present on  the House\r\n\nfloor (even on the perimeter), they often become embroiled in the\r\n\nlegislative  process either through self-initiated or legislator-\r\n\ninitiated  contacts.  And, even if lobbyists are able to maintain\r\n\nstoic  silence on the perimeter, their  mere presence affects the\r\n\nlegislative   environment.11     We  conclude,   therefore,  that\r\n\nregulation of admission to the House floor comprises \"an integral\r\n\npart  of the  deliberative and  communicative processes  by which\r\n\nMembers  participate in . .  . House proceedings  with respect to\r\n\nthe   consideration   and  passage   or  rejection   of  proposed\r\n\nlegislation.\"    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108610\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gravel,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/108610/gravel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  at  <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   Consequently,  the\r                                 \r\n\ndoctrine of legislative immunity pertains.\r\n\n        We are not alone  in our view of a  legislature's House\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   11The plaintiffs  themselves have argued, in  the context of\r\ntheir First Amendment claim,  that they should at least  be given\r\nthe opportunity to  sit silently  on the perimeter  of the  House\r\nfloor  so  that  they  may  communicate  through  their  physical\r\npresence.  The district court accepted this argument, and made it\r\na  cornerstone of  the  ensuing First  Amendment  analysis.   See\r                                                                           \r\nSocial </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Workers,</span> <span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Whatever may be the outer\r\n\nlimits  of the doctrine  of legislative immunity,  however, it is\r\n\nclear that  the instant case  is not so  extreme as to  cross (or\r\n\neven closely approach) the border.\r\n\n        Taking the  district court's  factual findings  at face\r\n\nvalue, Rule 45, as applied, may  arguably be wrong as a matter of\r\n\npolicy  and as  a matter of  constitutional law    but  it is not\r\n\ninvidiously discriminatory.  To the contrary, the differentiation\r\n\nbetween private and public  lobbyists appears to be based  on two\r\n\nfactors  that  bear  some  rational  relationship  to  legitimate\r                                   \r\n\nlegislative  purposes.    First, the  House  leadership explained\r\n\nthat,  in its view, the  exclusion of private  lobbyists from the\r\n\nfloor  was  a  useful  tool  to   bolster  public  confidence  in\r\n\nlegislative   independence   and   integrity.12      Second,  the\r\n                  \r                              \r\n\n   12In  a  debate over  a motion  to  reconsider Rule  45, the\r\nMajority Leader, Representative George Caruolo, stated:\r\n\n        This  isn't trying  to retard  lobbyists from\r\n        pursuing their vocation  . . .   It's a  rule\r\n        that says, quite simply, this is the people's\r\n        chamber, the  public  is invited.    But  the\r\n        business of the people should be conducted by\r\n        the people's representatives.   It should not\r\n        be  in any  way  affected by  people who  are\r\n        registered to  advocate particular positions,\r\n        whether they are paid or unpaid . . . .\r\n\n        Later,  Representative Caruolo explained why he thought\r\nthat  governmental lobbyists  on the  floor of  the House  do not\r\ntrigger the same public perceptions as private lobbyists:\r\n\n                              28\r\r\n\ndefendants consistently  have taken the position  that government\r\n\nlobbyists  act in  effect  as support  staff  for legislators  by\r\n\ngiving them neutral statistical and  factual information relevant\r\n\nto pending  legislation.  These justifications  for the continued\r\n\npresence of government lobbyists, found by the  district court to\r\n\nbe authentic (if asthenic),  see Social Workers, 874 F.

At the\r\n\nheart of  this case  is not the  ability of the  Rhode Island\r\n\nHouse  to  promulgate  rules  for  the  conduct  of  its  own\r\n\nbusiness,  but  the  defendants'  actual  practice,  directly\r\n\ncontrary to  the  Rule adopted  by  the House,  of  excluding\r\n\nspeakers  unless  they  represent  the  government  and  thus\r\n\nexpress the government's own  viewpoint.  While, in  my view,\r\n\nthe House  could have  legitimately closed the  floor of  its\r\n\nChamber to all  who sought to influence  its work, defendants\r\n\nmay  not permit  government lobbyists to  lobby on  the House\r\n\nfloor   while  prohibiting   private  citizens   and  private\r\n\nlobbyists  from doing the same.  The First Amendment does not\r\n\npermit the government to put its  thumb on the scale in  this\r\n\nway and favor itself in the arena  of political speech.  With\r\n\nrespect, I dissent.\r\n\n          Unlike  the   majority,  I   would  not  take   the\r\n\nextraordinary   step   of   affording   defendants   absolute\r\n\nlegislative immunity, thus preventing the court from reaching\r\n\nthe First Amendment issue.  The  majority does so in the name\r\n\nof federalism and comity,  important values to be sure.   But\r\n\nnaming  those values  may obscure  the issues  involved here.\r\n\nThis  case   does  not   implicate   traditional  issues   of\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\n\"federalism\"  at  all,  such  as  the  limits  on  enumerated\r\n\ncongressional  powers, see United States v.

Rather, this case\r                            \r\n\nraises  thorny issues  of  the  constitutional allocation  of\r\n\npowers  between the  people  and those  elected to  represent\r\n\nthem,  and  of  the  appropriate role  of  federal  courts in\r\n\nresolving such issues. \r\n\n                            Facts\r                                             \r\n\n          Rule  45 on its face does not permit any lobbyists,\r\n\ngovernment or private, to be on the House floor and prohibits\r\n\nlobbying  on  the  floor  by  anyone,  private  citizen15  or\r\n\nprofessional  lobbyist, while the House is in session.  It is\r\n\nthat Rule which reflects the decision of the House as  to the\r\n\nrunning of  its affairs.  Permitting  government lobbyists to\r\n\nlobby on the floor of the House violates the House Rule.  \r\n\n          The defendants  claimed that  such  were not  their\r\n\npractices.  But the district court, after trial, found to the\r\n\ncontrary  and  the defendants  have  not  appealed from  that\r\n\nfactual determination.   The  record amply  demonstrates that\r\n\ngovernment lobbyists were regularly plying their trade on the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Under the terms of Rule 45, certain government officials\r\nincluding  the  Governor, the  Secretary  of  State, and  the\r\nAttorney  General  have  access  to  the  floor.    The  Rule\r\nnonetheless prohibits anyone from lobbying.\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nfloor after adoption of the House  Rule which ostensibly kept\r\n\nthem out.    And, as  the  district court  found,  defendants\r\n\n\"flagrantly permitted\" such activities.\r\n\n          The Rhode Island  House presents a  factual setting\r\n\nperhaps unique in this country.  Unlike    many   legislative\r\n\nbodies,  including the  United  States  Congress, most  Rhode\r\n\nIsland legislators are part-time and have neither offices nor\r\n\nstaff.  The House meets for six months or less in a year, and\r\n\nthen only for three  or four afternoons and evenings  a week.\r\n\nOnce  the  session  starts,  it  rarely breaks  until  it  is\r\n\nconcluded.  Legislators typically arrive just in time for the\r\n\nsession and leave immediately on its conclusion.  Legislators\r\n\nhave no  desks other  than their  desks on the  floor of  the\r\n\nChamber.   Often there is no  other place  but  the floor for\r\n\ndirect  communication   with  the  legislators,   apart  from\r\n\ndisturbing  legislators  in   their  capacities  as   private\r\n\ncitizens where they live or work.\r\n\n          Amendments  to bills  are often introduced  for the\r\n\nfirst  time on the floor.  They  are often unavailable to the\r\n\npublic  before being introduced and are available only in the\r\n\nHouse Chamber after being introduced.  Frequently, especially\r\n\ntoward the close  of the session, the House votes  on such an\r\n\namendment on the  same day, and sometimes  within minutes, of\r\n\nthe amendment being introduced.  \r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n          Around  the perimeter  of  the floor  of the  House\r\n\nChamber  are approximately  eighteen chairs.   Some  of those\r\n\nchairs  have  been filled  on  a  daily basis  by  government\r\n\nlobbyists  since  Rule 45  was  enacted.   The  remainder are\r\n\nfilled  by members  of  the public.    Private lobbyists  are\r\n\nrelegated to balcony seating.\r\n\n          Government officials sitting in the perimeter seats\r\n\nhave  and  use  a  decided advantage  in  communicating  with\r\n\nlegislators and in  collecting and disseminating information.\r\n\nIndividual legislators frequently walk over to the  perimeter\r\n\nto speak with the government lobbyists.  These lobbyists send\r\n\nnotes to legislators indicating that they would like to speak\r\n\nand  they  get the  attention  of  individual legislators  by\r\n\nsignalling them.   People seated  along the perimeter  of the\r\n\nfloor receive more  information than others concerning  floor\r\n\namendments, which  are  distributed to  the legislators  only\r\n\nwhen they are introduced.  Thus, government lobbyists who are\r\n\nsitting on the floor  can see copies of floor  amendments and\r\n\nhave the  opportunity to  communicate their views,  including\r\n\npertinent information,  to the legislators.   It is virtually\r\n\nimpossible  for those who are not permitted onto the floor to\r\n\nlearn the exact language of an offered amendment because  the\r\n\ntext of  floor amendments is  not distributed outside  of the\r\n\nChamber.\r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\n          Government  lobbyists  have  actively  lobbied  for\r\n\ntheir  positions both from  the perimeter seats  and from the\r\n\nfloor  itself.  They have  done so on  bills which government\r\n\nofficials  have  supported  and  which  private  groups  have\r\n\nopposed.  Those bills often concerned matters of great public\r\n\ndebate.  For example, the topic of public funding of abortion\r\n\nwas  taken up by the  legislature.  Agents  of the Governor's\r\n\noffice,  which supported such  funding, sat on  the floor and\r\n\ntalked  to  legislators while  the  lobbyist  from the  Rhode\r\n\nIsland  State Right  to Life  Committee, Inc.,  which opposed\r\n\nsuch funding, was  relegated to the balcony.   Similarly, the\r\n\nAttorney  General  of  Rhode  Island  introduced  a  bill  to\r\n\nreinstate the  death penalty and he and his staff were on the\r\n\nfloor during debates on  the bill, speaking with legislators.\r\n\nPrivate group lobbyists opposed  to the bill, including those\r\n\nfrom  the  Rhode  Island  Affiliate  of  the  American  Civil\r\n\nLiberties Union, could only watch  from the balcony and  were\r\n\nprecluded from the floor and from lobbying.\r\n\n          The same duality  characterized the influencing  of\r\n\nbills  on  welfare reform.    Government  lobbyists from  the\r\n\nDepartment of  Human Services were present  for floor debates\r\n\non  an  amendment  which   would  restore  a  General  Public\r\n\nAssistance  program  cut from  the  Governor's  budget.   The\r\n\nDepartment  favored elimination  of  the program.   Lobbyists\r\n\nfrom the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), which\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nopposed eliminating the program, were excluded.  There was no\r\n\nbreak in  the  session between  the  time the  amendment  was\r\n\nintroduced and it was voted upon.  Similarly, in  debate over\r\n\nan amendment to an AFDC program, lobbyists for the Department\r\n\nin the perimeter seats attempted to influence the vote, while\r\n\na NASW lobbyist in the balcony ineffectively tried  to convey\r\n\nthe NASW's  position by  waving hands.   Prison-related bills\r\n\nreceived  the  same  treatment.   Department  of  Corrections\r\n\nofficials were  on the  floor with legislators  during debate\r\n\nwhile ACLU  lobbyists who opposed  the Department's  position\r\n\nwatched ineffectively from the  balcony.  There were numerous\r\n\nother  instances  where  the  Governor's  Office,  the  State\r\n\nPolice, the  Department of Economic Development,  the Banking\r\n\nand  Insurance  Department,  the Fire  Marshal,  the  General\r\n\nTreasurer's Office and the Department  of Business Regulation\r\n\nlobbyists  spoke  directly  with  legislators  on  the  floor\r\n\nregarding pending legislation.16\r\n\n          Nor  were   the  advantages  given   to  government\r\n\nlobbyists   limited  to   lobbyists  from   state  government\r\n\nagencies.   The lobbyist for  the Mayor of  Providence was on\r\n\nthe floor of the House  every day, frequently conversing with\r\n\nlegislators.  She spoke with legislators on issues as  varied\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  The ability  of government employees  to sit in  the few\r\nperimeter seats may have been used  to advance their personal\r\ninterests as well.  For example, during debates  on incentive\r\npay  for  court clerks,  two court  clerks  sat in  the aisle\r\nseats.\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nas a proposed  gun court,  the Providence  water supply,  and\r\n\nfunding for the city.\r\n\n          Lobbying  by  government  lobbyists at  times  took\r\n\nplace  among  the seats  of  the legislators,  even  with the\r\n\nknowledge of the Speaker.  For example, when the House was in\r\n\nsession, the Providence lobbyist  was on a cellular telephone\r\n\nand walked  in between  the rows  of the legislators'  seats,\r\n\npassing  the telephone to  certain members of  the House, who\r\n\nlistened  and spoke  into the  telephone.  The  telephone was\r\n\neventually passed  to the  Speaker, who also  listened, spoke\r\n\nand chuckled.   Only  when a  member of  the House  raised an\r\n\nobjection  did  the Providence  lobbyist  move  to the  outer\r\n\naisles.  But she was not asked to leave the floor and was not\r\n\nasked to refrain from speaking to the legislators.\r\n\n                           Immunity\r                                               \r\n\n          I  respectfully disagree  with the  decision of  my\r\n\nvery able colleagues to  afford absolute legislative immunity\r\n\nto both  of the defendants.  Not only was the defense waived,\r\n\nbut  even if  it had  been properly  raised, the  doctrine of\r\n\nlegislative  immunity  does  not,  in my  view,  foreclose  a\r\n\njudicial  determination  of  the  constitutionality   of  the\r\n\ndefendants'  practices.   The  challenged  practices  do  not\r\n\nconstitute the  kind of \"purely legislative  activities\" that\r\n\nhave  traditionally   triggered   the  protections   of   the\r\n\nlegislative immunity bar.   Raising that bar in this  case is\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\nnot  necessary  to vindicate  the  vital  interests that  the\r\n\ndoctrine was  intended  to safeguard,  and  indeed  undercuts\r\n\nthose interests.\r\n\n          This case does not  present the kind of exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances  that would  even permit  consideration  of the\r\n\ndefendants'  legislative  immunity  arguments, because  those\r\n\narguments  were  not raised  in  the  district  court.

Because there rarely will be direct evidence to\r\n\ncounter such a claim of inadvertence, and because the defense\r\n\nof absolute  legislative immunity will always  present a law-\r\n\nbased,  potentially  dispositive  question of  constitutional\r\n\nmagnitude,  a  court  of   appeals  applying  the  majority's\r\n\napproach would almost  inevitably consider the defense,  even\r\n\nthough raised for the first time on appeal.\r\n\n          Moreover, to the extent  that one of the rationales\r\n\nunderlying  legislative  immunity  is  to  prevent  vexatious\r\n\nlitigation  against legislators, that rationale is undermined\r\n\nwhere  (as here)  the legislator-defendant  goes through  the\r\n\nentire trial and  raises the  defense only on  appeal.   \"The\r\n\npurpose  of the  protection  afforded legislators  is not  to\r\n\nforestall judicial review of legislative action but to insure\r\n\nthat  legislators are not distracted from  or hindered in the\r\n\nperformance of  their legislative tasks by  being called into\r\n\n                             -41-\r                                         -41-\r\r\n\ncourt to defend  their actions.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107969\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Powell,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/107969/powell-v-mccormack/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at  <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r                                                     \r\n\nDenials  of legislative  immunity are  immediately appealable\r\n\nbecause the immunity is not simply a defense to liability but\r\n\nis also an immunity from suit.

Because  the  defendants  never asserted  a\r\n\ndefense of  immunity, the action  was fully tried  before the\r\n\nquestion  was ever  put to the  district court.   Legislators\r\n\nhave  already   testified.    Deciding  the   merits  of  the\r\n\nconstitutional  question  entails  no  additional  burden  or\r\n\ninconvenience upon the  defendants.  The  need to ignore  the\r\n\ndefendants' waiver in order to  reach the immunity issue  is,\r\n\nas a result, greatly reduced.17\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.

Judicial illumination  of the immunity,  as James\r\n\nMadison said, must be guided by \"the reason and the necessity\r\n\nof  the privilege.\"    Letter from  James  Madison to  Philip\r\n\nDoddridge  (June 6, 1832), in 4 Letters and Other Writings of\r                                                                         \r\n\nJames Madison 221 (1884).  That reason  and necessity dictate\r                         \r\n\nthat  this court not credit the immunity defense on the facts\r\n\nof this case.\r\n\n                       First Amendment\r                                                  \r\n\n          Is the First Amendment violated by  the defendants'\r\n\npractice  of admitting  government  lobbyists onto  the House\r\n\nfloor  to  lobby while  excluding those  not employed  by the\r\n\ngovernment?   The answer,  I believe, is  that the defendants\r\n\nhave violated the First Amendment.  \r\n\n          Several   interrelated    and   fundamental   First\r\n\nAmendment  interests   are   offended  by   the   defendants'\r\n\npractices.   The  defendants have  excluded  the  plaintiffs'\r\n\npolitical speech and have done so in a discriminatory manner.\r\n\nThe defendants'  practices have  resulted  in viewpoint-  and\r\n\ncontent-based  discrimination,  favoring government  speakers\r\n\nand  government  viewpoints   and  excluding   non-government\r\n\nspeakers and non-government viewpoints.   The restrictions on\r\n\nspeech posed  by the practices  are severe in  their effects.\r\n\n                             -54-\r                                         -54-\r\r\n\nDefendants'   discriminatory   practices   also  permit   the\r\n\ngovernment  unchecked  power to  act  in  its self  interest,\r\n\nrather than in the  interest of the citizens.   These effects\r\n\nstrike  at  the heart  of  the First  Amendment,  and subject\r\n\ndefendants'  practices to  the highest  level of  scrutiny, a\r\n\nscrutiny  defendants  cannot  withstand.24   Those  practices\r\n\nare  not  narrowly  tailored   to  meet  a  compelling  state\r\n\ninterest, and therefore fail to pass constitutional muster.\r\n\n          The  parties have framed  the First Amendment issue\r\n\nin  terms of  whether the  House Chamber  floor is  a \"public\r\n\nforum.\"     But   the   \"public   forum\"   doctrine,   itself\r\n\nproblematic,25 is  particularly ill-suited to this  case.

The  Rhode Island\r\n\nHouse is  singular  in the  lack of  opportunity for  private\r\n\ncitizens  to  have   direct,  effective  communications  with\r\n\nlegislators.    The  ability  to communicate  directly  is  a\r\n\nconsiderable advantage.  The situation created by the private\r\n\nlobbyist ban is that akin to a monopoly over a single channel\r\n\nof communication,  where the government has  discriminated in\r\n\nproviding  access to  that  channel and  also determined  the\r\n\ncontent of what flows through the channel.  \r\n\n          Against   this   panoply  of   dangers31   must  be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n31.  Defendants' argument  poses yet  other dangers too.   If\r\nthe   legislature  gets  information  from  nowhere  but  the\r\nexecutive   branch,   the   legislature's  ability   to   act\r\nindependently,  and thus  to be  a check  and balance  to the\r\nexecutive  is  undercut.     This  corollary  danger  of  the\r\nundercutting  of the separation of powers  at the state level\r\nis  keenly  illustrated by  the  amicus  brief  filed by  the\r\nexecutive   branch,   urging   strongly   its   interest   in\r\n\n                             -62-\r                                         -62-\r\r\n\nmeasured  the interests  attributed to  the defendants.   The\r\n\nmajority  finds, in the immunity analysis, that there are two\r\n\nsuch interests32 and that the interests would pass a rational\r\n\nbasis  test, at least for determining whether to carve out an\r\n\nexception to the immunity it  would grant.  Without accepting\r\n\nthe  premise  that  the   only  exceptions  to  immunity  are\r\n\nirrational legislative  acts, neither  of those  interests is\r\n\nsufficient  to  withstand  strict  scrutiny.33   Indeed,  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncommunicating  with   the  legislature  and   supporting  the\r\nexclusion of private voices.\r\n\n32.  To  the extent  that  the House  Rule  on its  face  was\r\njustified  as an effort to maintain decorum and control noise\r\nto a level which did not interfere with the members work, the\r\nrecord shows  instances in which government  lobbyists on the\r                                                       \r\nfloor were objected to  by members as causing problems.   The\r\ndefendants  accordingly   do   not  try   to  justify   their\r\ndiscriminatory distinction on such grounds.\r\n\n33.  Defendants'  practice  does  not   even  meet  the  less\r\nrigorous  test   of  intermediate  scrutiny.

The\r                                           \r\ngovernment's asserted interest in having government lobbyists\r\non  the floor  of  the House,  to  the exclusion  of  private\r\nlobbyists, is  to have  them  provide information.   But  the\r\ngovernment has  not shown  why the  interest  in having  only\r\ngovernment provide  information, and  not private groups,  is\r\n\"substantial.\"   Relatedly, the  restriction is not \"narrowly\r\ntailored\" to  meet the information provision  goal because it\r\nis overbroad and serves  to exclude valuable information that\r\nprivate lobbyists might provide.  \r\n\n                             -63-\r                                         -63-\r\r\n\ndefendants' bedrock argument is different again, and it, too,\r\n\nis insufficient.\r\n\n          The   majority   credits   reasons  of   bolstering\r\n\nlegislative independence and  of having government  lobbyists\r\n\nact to provide information.  But legislative independence was\r\n\nproffered as a reason for Rule 45 on its face, which excludes\r\n\nall lobbyists, and not  to the distinction between government\r\n\nand non-government lobbyists.34\r\n\n          Defendants  argue  that allowing  only governmental\r\n\nlobbyists access to the  floor of the legislature  serves the\r\n\ngoal of allowing legislators to receive valuable information.\r\n\nDefendants,   however,   have  established   no  demonstrable\r\n\ninterest in receiving information  from the government to the\r\n\nexclusion of private sources.

Defendants  attempt  to  liken  their  private  lobbying\r\nrestriction to  the restrictions on lobbying  imposed by Rule\r\nXXXII  of  the   United  States  House  of   Representatives.\r\nDefendants'   analogy,  however,   works  against   them  and\r\ndemonstrates  that  there is  no  \"compelling\"  need to  give\r\ngovernment  lobbyists  access to  the  floor  to lobby  while\r\nexcluding others.  Unlike the defendants' practices, the U.S.\r\nHouse  of  Representatives  Rule does  not  allow  government\r\nlobbyists to  lobby while excluding private  lobbyists.  Rule\r\nXXXII  is  neutral and  excludes all  lobbyists.   Even those\r\nnormally  afforded the courtesy of admission  to the floor --\r\nformer Members of the House, former  Parliamentarians, former\r\nelected officers,  and former  elected minority  employees of\r\nthe  House  --   are  denied  admission  if   they  or  their\r\norganizations have any interest  in matters before the House.\r\nSimilarly, staff  of a Member are not allowed to lobby on the\r\noccasions  they are admitted to  the House.   That the United\r\nStates House of Representatives has chosen neutrality and not\r\nto   grant  preference  to   the  government   lobbyists  and\r\ninformation providers (if there is any distinction) undercuts\r\nany argument by  defendants that they have a  compelling need\r\nto give preference to the government.\r\n\n                             -65-\r                                         -65-\r\r\n\n501,  511 n.** (1991).  In this case the restriction excludes\r\n\nvaluable information  from the  legislative purview.   As the\r\n\nmajority points  out, lobbying groups  have vastly  different\r\n\ninterests  and  perspectives.     Access to  such  varied and\r\n\nindependent  sources of  information, far  from  impeding the\r\n\nlegislature's access to  useful information, surely functions\r\n\nto  increase both the quality  and the quantity  of the total\r\n\nset of information available.   \r\n\n          The provision of  information from executive branch\r\n\nagencies to members of  the legislature is a  very legitimate\r\n\ninterest of  government.   The majority suggests  there is  a\r\n\ndistinction between mere  information providing and lobbying,\r\n\nbut that  distinction is  contradicted  by the  record.   The\r\n\nfactual findings  of the district  court leave no  doubt that\r\n\nthe court considered the contention that government lobbyists\r\n\nwere engaging in mere \"information-providing\" and rejected it\r\n\nas a factual matter.  \r\n\n          Even if  the distinction were tenable  on the facts\r\n\nhere, as it is not, it does not provide refuge from the First\r\n\nAmendment.     There  is  plainly  value  to  the  speech  by\r\n\ngovernment lobbyists, whether it  be heavy-handed lobbying or\r\n\nmore lightly  dexterous provision of information.

The distinction between  providing\r                 \r\n\ninformation and acting for the purpose of \"influencing in any\r\n\nmanner the  passage  of  legislation\"  is  exceedingly  fine.\r\n\nHere, legislators  testified that \"information\"  provided did\r\n\nin  fact influence  them  on  how to  vote.   The  House  has\r\n\nrecognized that information may influence  votes.  Rule 45 on\r\n\nits face provides that \"no person . . . shall either directly\r                                                                         \r\n\nor indirectly\" engage in the practice of lobbying.

Accordingly, they say, there is\r\n\nno  cause to worry.   That is an  inversion of constitutional\r\n\nvalues.  While there may be value to the government voice, it\r\n\ncannot be the only  voice.  To permit that to be  so would be\r\n\nto stifle discussion.  See Buckley  v.

Defendants  express a legitimate concern that government\r\nmay  be captured by \"special interests.\"  Apart from the fact\r\nthat  the government  itself  is frequently  its own  special\r\ninterest group,  the solution to the problem  of a government\r\ncaptured by \"special interests\"  would hardly be to have  the\r\ngovernment speak only to itself.\r\n          Moreover, many of  the plaintiff groups may  hardly\r\nbe  characterized  as  the   centers  of  wealth,  power  and\r\nprivilege.  Citizens,  who themselves may not be  affluent or\r\npowerful, band  together in  groups to lobby  the government,\r\nwhether  the groups be, to  give but two  examples, the Rhode\r\nIsland State  Right  To Life  Committee, Inc.,  or the  local\r\nchapter of the ACLU.  These groups may be thought to be a way\r\nto avoid the capturing  of government by \"special interests.\"\r\nDefendants' practices may thus  thrust them headlong into the\r\ndangers  they profess to wish to avoid.  Central to effecting\r\na system  of democratic  self-governance is  enabling private\r\ninterests to be able  to act in concert.   Without collective\r\naction it  may be  impossible to alter  the status quo.
