This   appeal  presents  the\n                            \n\nquestion  whether federal maritime  law preempts Rhode Island\n\nlegislation  affording expanded  state-law  remedies for  oil\n\npollution  damage.   In an able  opinion, the  district court\n\nheld that the remedies were preempted.  Discerning the law in\n\nthis area is far from easy;  one might tack a sailboat into a\n\nfog bank  with more  confidence.  Yet  guided in  part by  an\n\nimportant Supreme Court decision rendered  after the district\n\ncourt's decision, we are  constrained to reverse in part  and\n\nto remand for further proceedings.\n\n     The basic facts of the case are not in dispute.  On June\n\n23,  1989,  the M/V  World Prodigy,  an  oil tanker  owned by\n\nBallard Shipping Co., ran  aground in Narragansett Bay, Rhode\n\nIsland, spilling over 300,000 gallons of heating oil into the\n\nbay.    The wreck  occurred when  the  ship strayed  from the\n\ndesignated  shipping channel  and collided  with a  rock near\n\nBrenton Reef, about a  mile south of Newport at the  mouth of\n\nthe bay.  The oil slick prompted the State of Rhode Island to\n\nclose Narragansett  Bay to all shellfishing  activities for a\n\nperiod of two weeks during and after cleanup operations.\n\n     State authorities  charged the captain of  the ship with\n\nentering  the bay without a local pilot on board in violation\n\nof  state law.   Both  the captain  and Ballard  also pleaded\n\nguilty to criminal violations  of the Federal Water Pollution\n\nControl Act, see 33 U.S.C.    1319(c).  The captain and owner\n                \n\n                             -2-\n\nwere fined a total of $30,500 and $500,000, respectively.  In\n\naddition, Ballard agreed to  pay $3.9 million in compensation\n\nfor  federal cleanup  costs, $4.7  million for  state cleanup\n\ncosts and damage to natural resources, $500,000 of which  was\n\nto be  available to  compensate individuals, and  $550,000 to\n\nsettle claims for lost wages by local shellfishermen.\n\n     A  number of  claimants  filed suit  against Ballard  in\n\nRhode  Island.  Ballard  responded on  December 22,  1989, by\n\nbringing  a   petition   in  admiralty   for  limitation   or\n\nexoneration from liability.   46 U.S.C.   185.   \"[T]he court\n\nof  admiralty  in  [a  limitation  of  liability]  proceeding\n\nacquires the right to marshal all claims, whether of strictly\n\nadmiralty origin  or not, and to  give effect to  them by the\n\napportionment of the res and  by judgment in personam against\n                                                     \n\nthe owner, so far as the court may decree.\" Just v. Chambers,\n                                                            \n\n312  U.S.  383, 386  (1941).   In  the present  case, several\n\nclaimants reasserted their claims in the admiralty action.\n\n     The  claimants in  the  present appeal  are  a group  of\n\nshellfish dealers who allege  severe economic losses  arising\n\nfrom the  two-week hiatus  in shellfishing  activities, which\n\nsuspended  their operations  during the  busiest time  of the\n\nshellfishing  season.    They  alleged negligence  under  the\n\ngeneral maritime law and  the common law of Rhode  Island, as\n\nwell as a  claim for  economic losses pursuant  to the  Rhode\n\nIsland  Environmental Injury Compensation Act, R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n                             -3-\n\nch. 46-12.3 et seq. (\"the Compensation Act\").\n                   \n\n     On June 17, 1992, Ballard moved to dismiss the shellfish\n\ndealers' claims on the basis  of the Supreme Court's decision\n\nin  Robins  Dry Dock  &amp;  Repair Co.  v.  Flint, 275  U.S. 303\n                                              \n\n(1927),  which  held  that compensation  for  economic losses\n\nstanding  alone  is  unavailable  in admiralty  cases.    The\n\ndistrict  court  granted  the  motion,  holding  that  Robins\n                                                             \n\npreempted the contrary provisions of the state's Compensation\n\nAct, which expressly provides for recovery of purely economic\n\nlosses arising from an oil spill.  In re Complaint of Ballard\n                                                             \n\nShipping  Co., 810 F. Supp.  359 (D.R.I. 1993).   The dealers\n             \n\nnow appeal from that dismissal.\n\n     We first  address the  federal claims brought  under the\n\ngeneral maritime  law.   The Constitution grants  the federal\n\ncourts authority to hear \"all Cases of admiralty and maritime\n\nJurisdiction.\"  U.S. Const. Art. III,   2.  The parties agree\n\nthat  the  dealers' federal  claims  fall  within this  group\n\nbecause the  spill occurred on navigable waters and arose out\n\nof  traditional  maritime  activity.     See  Executive   Jet\n                                                             \n\nAviation, Inc.  v. City  of Cleveland, 409  U.S. 249  (1972).\n                                     \n\nAdmiralty  jurisdiction  brings with  it  a  body of  federal\n\njurisprudence, largely uncodified,   known  as maritime  law.\n\nSee East River  S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica  Delaval, 476 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n858, 864 (1985).\n\n     The  dealers assert  that their businesses  were injured\n\n                             -4-\n\nwhen the  World Prodigy spill prevented  local fishermen from\n\nharvesting   shellfish  in   Narragansett  Bay   and  thereby\n\nprecluded  the  dealers  from  purchasing  the  shellfish and\n\nreselling them to restaurants and other buyers.  The dealers'\n\nmaritime-law  claims  are  thus purely  for  economic losses,\n\nunaccompanied  by any  physical injury  to their  property or\n\nperson.  Those  federal claims, as  the district court  held,\n\nare  squarely foreclosed by Robins  Dry Dock &amp;  Repair Co. v.\n                                                          \n\nFlint, 275 U.S. 303 (1927).\n     \n\n     In  Robins,  the charterer  of  a vessel  sued  a repair\n               \n\ncompany that negligently  damaged the vessel while it  was in\n\ndry  dock,  alleging  that  the resulting  delay  caused  the\n\ncharterer  to  lose  profits  that it  would  have  otherwise\n\nderived from the  use of the ship.  Justice  Holmes wrote for\n\nthe Court in holding that the suit could not be maintained:\n\n     [N]o authority  need be  cited to  show that, as  a\n     general rule,  at least,  a tort  to the  person or\n     property of  one man  does not make  the tortfeasor\n     liable to another merely because the injured person\n     was under  a contract  with that other,  unknown to\n     the doer  of the wrong.  . .  .  The  law does  not\n     spread its protection so far.\n\n275 U.S. at 309.\n\n     Justice  Holmes's  pronouncement  could have  been  read\n\nmerely  as negating  a claim  of negligent  interference with\n\ncontract.  See Getty Refining and Marketing Co. v. MT FADI B,\n                                                            \n\n766 F.2d 829,  831-32 (3d  Cir. 1985).   Instead, Robins  has\n                                                        \n\ngenerally  been  taken to  establish  the  broader rule  that\n\n                             -5-\n\npurely economic losses arising from a tort, but unaccompanied\n\nby physical injury to  anything in which the plaintiff  has a\n\nproprietary  interest,  are  not  compensable  under  federal\n\nmaritime law.  See, e.g., State of Louisiana ex rel. Guste v.\n                                                          \n\nM/V  Testbank, 752 F.2d 1019, 1022 (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc),\n             \n\ncert.  denied, 477 U.S. 903 (1986).  Our circuit adopted this\n             \n\nbroader  reading in Barber Lines  A/S v. M/V  Donau Maru, 764\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  50, 51-52  (1st  Cir. 1985),  and,  in any  event,  the\n\nsecondary nature  of the economic injury  here--which is akin\n\nto interference  with contract--would likely  bring this case\n\nwithin even a narrow reading of Robins.\n                                      \n\n     Several courts have recognized exceptions to Robins, but\n                                                        \n\nnone  of  the familiar  examples apply  in  this case.1   The\n\ndistrict court so held, and the dealers do not challenge that\n\nconclusion on appeal.  Accordingly, we agree that plaintiffs'\n\nfederal claims  for purely economic losses  under the general\n\nmaritime  law are  barred.   The appeal  thus turns  upon the\n\nextent to  which Robins  bars the  states  from permitting  a\n                       \n\ndifferent result under state law pursuant  to the exercise of\n                            \n\nthe state's police powers.\n\n     Although  the Judiciary  Act of  1789 vested  \"exclusive\n\n                    \n\n     1The  classic  exceptions   include  claims  brought  by\nfishermen as \"favorites  of admiralty,\" see Union  Oil Co. v.\n                                                          \nOppen,  501 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1974), and claims for economic\n     \nlosses that are intentionally  caused, see Dick Meyers Towing\n                                                             \nService, Inc. v. United States, 577 F.2d 1023, 1025 (5th Cir.\n                              \n1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 908 (1979).\n                   \n\n                             -6-\n\noriginal  cognizance of  all  civil causes  of admiralty  and\n\nmaritime jurisdiction\" in the federal courts, the act added a\n\nprovision  \"saving to suitors, in  all cases, the  right of a\n\ncommon  law remedy, where the common law is competent to give\n\nit.\" 1 Stat.  76-77.  The modern version of the statute saves\n\n\"all  other   remedies  to  which  [suitors]   are  otherwise\n\nentitled.\" 28 U.S.C.    1333.  The upshot  is that an injured\n\nparty  may have claims  arising from  a single  accident both\n\nunder  federal  maritime law  and  under  state law,  whether\n\nlegislation or common law.   See G. Gilmore &amp;  C. Black, Jr.,\n                                \n\nThe Law  of Admiralty    1-13, at  37 (2d ed.  1975).   State\n                     \n\nremedies under the  savings to suitors clause  may be pursued\n\nin  state  court  or, where  there  is  a  basis for  federal\n\njurisdiction, in federal court.\n\n     Whether a state claim is litigated in a federal court or\n\na state forum, \"the extent to which state law may  be used to\n\nremedy  maritime  injuries  is  constrained  by  a  so-called\n\n`reverse-Erie' doctrine  which requires that  the substantive\n             \n\nremedies afforded by the  States conform to governing federal\n\nmaritime standards.\" Offshore Logistics, Inc.  v. Tallentire,\n                                                            \n\n477 U.S. 207, 223  (1986) (citations omitted).  How  far this\n\nconformity requirement extends,  and whether it preempts  the\n\ndealers'  state-law claims,  are the  central issues  in this\n\ncase.\n\n     On appeal, the dealers  mainly stress their claims under\n\n                             -7-\n\nRhode  Island's  Compensation  Act.    The  Compensation  Act\n\nprovides  generally  that  owners  or  operators of  seagoing\n\nvessels may be held liable  for harms arising from negligence\n\nof the owner,  operator or  agents or from  the violation  of\n\nRhode Island pilotage and water pollution laws.

The statute also  contains the\n\nfollowing specific provisions regarding economic loss:\n\n     (a)  A  person  shall be  entitled  to  recover for\n          economic  loss  .  .   .  if  the  person  can\n          demonstrate the  loss of income  or diminution\n          of profit to a person  or business as a result\n          of  damage to  the  natural resources  of  the\n          state of Rhode Island  caused by the violation\n          of any  provision [of  the  piloting or  water\n          pollution laws] by the owner or operator . . .\n          of the  seagoing vessel  and/or caused by  the\n          negligence of the owner or  operator . . .  of\n          the seagoing vessel.\n\n     (b)  In any  suit brought to recover  economic loss\n          it shall  not be  necessary to prove  that the\n          loss  was  sustained as  a result  of physical\n          injury to the  person or damage to his  or her\n          property,  nor shall  it be  a defense  to any\n          claim that the defendant  owed no special duty\n          to  the plaintiff  or  that the  loss was  the\n          result   of   governmental  action   taken  in\n          response to the violation and/or negligence of\n          the defendant.\n\n     (c)  Without   limiting   the  generality   of  the\n          foregoing,   persons  engaged   in  commercial\n          fishing or shellfishing and/or  the processors\n          of fish or shellfish, who can demonstrate that\n          they have sustained a loss of income or profit\n          as  a  result  of  damage to  the  environment\n          resulting   from   [violations   of   law   or\n          negligence] . . . shall have a cause of action\n          for economic  loss.

Gen. Laws   46-12.3-4.\n\n     For the  purposes of this appeal  only, Ballard concedes\n\nthat the dealers  would have  a valid cause  of action  under\n\nthis  statute, and  that the  Compensation Act,  which became\n\neffective on September 30, 1990, may be applied retroactively\n\nto cover  the 1989 M/V World  Prodigy spill.2   We think that\n\nthe  statutory claims  effectively subsume  state  common law\n\nclaims  since the Compensation Act  appears to go  as far and\n\nfurther than common law  in departing from Robins.   Thus, we\n                                                 \n\nfocus upon the statute.\n\n     The shipowner and captain insist, and the district court\n\nagreed,  that  the  state  claims  are  preempted  under  the\n\ndoctrine  of  Southern Pacific  Co. v.  Jensen, 244  U.S. 205\n                                              \n\n(1917).  Jensen,  in a  now famous passage,  held that  state\n               \n\nlegislation  affecting maritime  commerce is  invalid \"if  it\n\ncontravenes  the essential  purpose  expressed by  an act  of\n\nCongress, or works  material prejudice to the  characteristic\n\nfeatures of the general maritime law, or interferes  with the\n\nproper harmony  and uniformity  of that  law in its  interna-\n\ntional and interstate relations.\"  Id. at 216.\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     2See  1990 R.I. Pub. Laws  ch. 198,    2 (providing that\n         \nthe  Compensation Act  shall apply  to all  causes of  action\npending on or  after September 30,  1990, regardless of  when\nthe  violation and/or act of negligence  occurred, as long as\nsuit  was   commenced  within  the   applicable  statute   of\nlimitations).\n\n                             -9-\n\n     Jensen,  however, was  by its  own terms  something less\n           \n\nthan  a rule  of automatic  and  mechanical preemption.   \"It\n\nwould be difficult,  if not impossible,\" said  the Court, \"to\n\ndefine with  exactness just how far the  general maritime law\n\nmay be  changed, modified, or affected  by state legislation.\n\nThat this may be done to  some extent cannot be denied.\"  244\n                                                       \n\nU.S. at 216 (emphasis added).   What is even  more telling is\n\nthat the Supreme Court after Jensen, without ever repudiating\n                                   \n\nits language, upheld the application of state law in a number\n\nof maritime-related  cases despite the existence  of a direct\n\nconflict between maritime rules and state law.\n\n     This  saga is  recounted in  Professor  Currie's classic\n\narticle,  aptly titled  \"Federalism and  the Admiralty:  `The\n\nDevil's  Own  Mess,'\" 1960  Sup. Ct.  Rev.  158.   A familiar\n\nexample is Just v.  Chambers, 312 U.S. 383 (1941),  where the\n                            \n\nCourt  permitted  a  state  law  claim  for  personal  injury\n\noccurring  on board a ship against the estate of the vessel's\n\nowner, despite  a contrary  maritime rule that  a shipowner's\n\nliability does not survive his death.  This year, in American\n                                                             \n\nDredging  Co. v.  Miller, 114  S. Ct.  981 (1994),  the Court\n                        \n\nupheld a  Louisiana open-forum statute, making  the forum non\n                                                             \n\nconveniens doctrine unavailable in savings clause cases, even\n          \n\nthough forum  non conveniens  is a  part of  federal maritime\n                            \n\nlaw.\n\n     American Dredging assertedly  reaffirms Jensen's  three-\n                                                   \n\n                             -10-\n\nprong  test for  preemption quoted  above.   Since no  act of\n\nCongress   directly  governs  our   case,  the   first  prong\n\n(contravention) is irrelevant  to our case.   The third prong\n\n(\"proper    harmony   and   uniformity\")   we   reserve   for\n\nconsideration below.   What  is of  immediate concern  is the\n\nsecond  (\"material  prejudice\")  prong;  and  here,  American\n                                                             \n\nDredging  gave the  famous language  a twist  that  could not\n        \n\neasily have been anticipated by the litigants in this case or\n\nby the district court.\n\n     Judged by the bare  language of Jensen, the Compensation\n                                           \n\nAct might  easily  seem  to  do  \"material  prejudice\"  to  a\n\n\"characteristic feature\" of maritime law, since Robins is the\n                                                      \n\ngoverning  maritime rule  and  the  Compensation Act  rejects\n\nRobins in everything but name.  But the word \"characteristic\"\n      \n\nhas different  shadings, and American Dredging,  in its first\n                                              \n\nand  most  important   holding,  gives  the   \"characteristic\n\nfeature\" language a definitive meaning:  it  reads the phrase\n\nto  apply--and apparently  only to  apply--to a  federal rule\n\nthat  either \"originated  in  admiralty\"  or  \"has  exclusive\n\napplication there.\"  114 S. Ct. at 987.  \n\n     Indeed, Justice Scalia goes on  to say that the doctrine\n\nat issue  in American  Dredging,  the doctrine  of forum  non\n                                                             \n\nconveniens,  \"is   and  has   been  a  doctrine   of  general\n          \n\napplication\" and that \"therefore\" its disregard by  Louisiana\n\ndoes  not prejudice \"[a} characteristic featur[e]\" of general\n\n                             -11-\n\nmaritime law.\"  114 S. Ct. at 987.  Further, only so narrow a\n\nreading of the characteristic  feature test comports with the\n\nresult in American Dredging.   Since the forum non conveniens\n                                                             \n\ndoctrine had  long and  widespread  application in  admiralty\n\ncases,  id. at  986, a  broad reading  of the  characteristic\n           \n\nfeature test would have resulted in preemption.\n\n     Although  it  is easier  to  identify the  origins  of a\n\ndoctrine recognizing  liability than one denying  it, we have\n\nfound no  evidence that Robins' denial of recovery for purely\n                              \n\neconomic losses  originated in admiralty.   Justice  Holmes's\n\nopinion in Robins presents  the rule as a virtual  truism for\n                 \n\nwhich  \"no authority  need be  cited,\" 275  U.S. at  309, and\n\nrefers  the reader to three other opinions in which \"[a] good\n\nstatement [of  the rule] will  be found.\" Id.

An  issue created by  such a conflict  of\n     interests can  be  resolved only  by  reference  to\n     those interests  and by an attempt  to maximize the\n     effectuation of  the proper concerns  of both state\n     and nation.\n\n1960 Sup.

No one can doubt that the state's interest\n\nin  avoiding pollution  in its  navigable  waters and  on its\n\nshores, and  in redressing injury  to its citizens  from such\n\npollution, is a weighty  one.

See also id. at 332-43.\n                     \n\n     Claimants in this case  argue flatly that Askew, without\n                                                    \n\nmore, sustains the Rhode Island statute; and perhaps it does.\n\nThe difficulty is that  Justice Douglas rejected the maritime\n\nlaw preemption claim on the ground that Jensen had nothing to\n                                              \n\ndo with \"shoreside injury by ships on navigable waters.\"  411\n\n                             -16-\n\nU.S. at 344.   \"Historically,\" said Justice Douglas, \"damages\n\nto  the shore or to  shore facilities were  not cognizable in\n\nadmiralty.\"   Id. at 240.   Although Congress  had by statute\n                 \n\nextended  admiralty jurisdiction shoreword in 1948, the Court\n\nsaid that this extension did not  carry Jensen with it.   Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 341.\n\n     If  Justice  Douglas  meant   to  avoid  preemption  for\n\nphysical damage  to  the shore  or shore  facilities, as  his\n\nwords seem to suggest,  this might easily not embrace  damage\n\nto bay  waters or the  beds beneath them.   If instead  Askew\n                                                             \n\nmeant  to allow a state  remedy for any  intangible impact or\n\nloss  ultimately felt on shore, it  is hard to see what would\n\nbe  left  of  preemptive  federal authority  since  the  most\n\ntraditional   of  admiralty   events--for  example,   a  ship\n\ncollision or  a seaman's death-- has  such intangible effects\n\nashore.  However the riddle of  Askew is solved, we think  it\n                                     \n\nsafest to take it here merely to  show, as it assuredly does,\n\nthe importance of the  state's interest in providing remedies\n\nfor vessel-caused oil pollution damage.\n\n     The federal interest in limiting remedies is more subtle\n\nbut also not  without importance.  The  Compensation Act does\n\nnot regulate the out-of-court  behavior of ships or sailors--\n\nwhat is sometimes called \"primary conduct\"; rather the act is\n\nconcerned  with the  liability  imposed for  conduct that  is\n\nalready unlawful.  State regulation of primary conduct in the\n\n                             -17-\n\nmaritime realm  is not automatically forbidden,  e.g., Ray v.\n                                                          \n\nAtlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151, 179-80 (1978), but such\n                      \n\nregulation presents the most  direct risk of conflict between\n\nfederal and  state  commands,  or  of  inconsistency  between\n\nvarious  state  regimes  to  which the  same  vessel  may  be\n\nsubject.4\n\n     Instead,  the  question  here  is the  familiar  one  of\n\nburden.  At some point, a regime of liability, or a diversity\n\nof regimes,  could impose or  threaten such heavy  costs that\n\nmaritime  commerce may  itself be  impaired.   Initially such\n\ncosts  are borne  by shipowners  but in  the end  they affect\n\nevery business that  uses ships or receives  raw materials by\n\nship  and every citizen who, as a worker or consumer, depends\n\nupon such  commerce.  A  regime may  also be so  difficult to\n\nadminister  as  to  prevent  the  efficient  and  predictable\n\nresolution of maritime  disputes.  These  are not trivial  or\n\nirrelevant concerns,  for  \"the fundamental  interest  giving\n\nrise to  maritime jurisdiction is the  protection of maritime\n\ncommerce.\"5 \n\n                    \n\n     4O'Melveny &amp; Myers v. Federal Deposit Ins.

Central Gulf  Lines, Inc.,  111 S.  Ct.\n                                               \n2071, 2074 (1991) (internal quotations omitted).  The Supreme\nCourt  has regularly  considered  such  burdens in  admiralty\n\n                             -18-\n\n     Indeed,   these  very   concerns--with  the   burden  of\n\nliability and  of  administration--underpin the  Robins  rule\n                                                       \n\nitself  and are discussed at length in Barber Lines, 754 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 54-55.  But  it is one thing to say that  a federal court,\n\nlargely responsible for shaping  the common law of admiralty,\n\nshould  follow  a longstanding  liability  rule  to govern  a\n\nfederal  cause of action.  It is  quite another to say that a\n\nstate remedy, presumptively  preserved under  the savings  to\n\nsuitors  clause,  is  potentially  so  disruptive  as  to  be\n\nunconstitutional.  Where as here the state remedy is aimed at\n\na  matter of great and legitimate state concern, a court must\n\nact with caution.\n\n     The question,  then, is  whether absent the  Robins rule\n                                                        \n\nthere remain limitations  on the scope of  recovery under the\n\nCompensation  Act adequate to limit the  burden it imposes on\n\nmaritime commerce.    The  Compensation Act  has  yet  to  be\n\nconstrued by the Rhode Island courts.  We nevertheless assume\n\nthat  its extension of liability to cover all \"loss of income\n\nor diminution of profit  . . . as  a result of damage  to the\n                                              \n\n                    \n\npreemption cases,  see, e.g., Ray v.  Atlantic Richfield Co.,\n                                                            \n435 U.S. 151, 179-80 (1978);  Huron Portland Cement, 362 U.S.\n                                                   \nat 443-44, and has drawn explicit parallels between admiralty\npreemption  and  Commerce  Clause  analysis.   See  Davis  v.\n                                                         \nDepartment of  Labor and  Industries of Washington,  317 U.S.\n                                                  \n249, 257 (1942); Wilburn Boat Co. v.

This does not, however, mean that the admiralty\nclause  simply duplicates  a commerce  clause analysis.

Laws    46-12.3-4 (emphasis  supplied), incorporates the\n\nfamiliar  tort  limitations of  foreseeability  and proximate\n\ncause.   These principles do in some measure limit the burden\n\nimposed on maritime shipping.\n\n     Foreseeability  may extend  some  distance,  cf.  Barber\n                                                             \n\nLines, 764 F.2d at 52, and \"remoteness\" is scarcely a sharply\n     \n\ndefined concept.   Compare Petitions of  Kinsman Transit Co.,\n                                                            \n\n388 F.2d 821 (2d  Cir. 1968) (rejecting Robins  but excluding\n                                              \n\neconomic losses suffered  by the owner of a  vessel prevented\n\nfrom unloading its cargo  above a bridge that collapsed  as a\n\nresult  of defendant's  negligence  as too  remote to  permit\n\nrecovery).   We cannot be  sure how Rhode  Island courts will\n\ndevelop these concepts in the context of oil pollution cases.\n\nDepending on Rhode Island's solutions, the burdens imposed by\n\nthe Compensation  Act, financial and  administrative, may  be\n\nsubstantial  but they may also  be tolerable.   One might say\n\nthat the case for  preemption at this stage is subject to the\n\nScotch verdict--not proven.  \n\n     Having said  all this, we think  one final consideration\n\ntips the scales in favor of the Compensation Act's  validity.\n\nCongress  has  recently enacted  the  Oil  Pollution Act,  33\n\nU.S.C.    2701 et seq.,  which almost certainly  provides for\n                      \n\n                             -20-\n\nrecovery  of purely  economic  damages in  oil spill  cases.6\n\nSection 2702(b)(2)(E)  of  the act  provides that  \"[d]amages\n\nequal  to  the  loss  of profits  or  impairment  of  earning\n\ncapacity due  to the  injury,  destruction, or  loss of  real\n\nproperty,  personal property,  or  natural resources,  . .  .\n\nshall be recoverable by any claimant.\"  The  House Conference\n\nReport makes clear that,  under section 2702(b)(2)(E), \"[t]he\n\nclaimant need not  be the  owner of the  damaged property  or\n\nresources to recover for lost profits or income\".  H.R. Conf.\n\nRep.  No. 101-653, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 103 (1990).  The act\n\nalso  expressly  provides  that  it does  not  preempt  state\n\nimposition of additional liability requirements.  33 U.S.C.  \n\n2718(a).\n\n     The  statute  contains  another  substantial   piece  of\n\nevidence that  Congress means  to allow recovery  of economic\n\nlosses  from  injury to  natural  resources  even though  the\n\nclaimant's  own  property  was   not  damaged.    In  another\n\nsubsection  of the  damage  provision, there  is an  explicit\n\nprovision  for recovery  of \"economic  losses  resulting from\n\ndestruction  of real or personal property\" by a claimant \"who\n\n                    \n\n     6We  say \"almost\" only because one court has held to the\ncontrary. See In re Petition of Cleveland  Tankers, Inc., 791\n                                                        \nF. Supp.  669, 678-79 (E.D. Mich. 1992).   Most commentators,\nby contrast, have read  the new statute--as its language  and\nlegislative history  suggest--to override the Robins Dry Dock\n                                                             \nrule,  see  McCurdy,  \"An  Overview  of   OPA  1990  and  Its\n          \nRelationship  to Other Laws,\" 5 U.S.F.

United States  v. Ven-\n                                                             \n\nFuel, Inc.,  758 F.2d 741,  751-52 (1st Cir.  1985) (readings\n          \n\nthat create redundancies are not favored). \n\n     The new federal statute  does not apply retroactively to\n\ngovern  the present case.   See Pub.  L. No.  101-380,   1020\n                               \n\n(providing  that  the statute  \"shall  apply  to an  incident\n\noccurring  after the date  the enactment of  this Act [August\n\n18,  1990].\").  But we  think that the  statute is compelling\n\nevidence  that Congress  does  not view  either expansion  of\n\nliability  to cover  purely economic  losses or  enactment of\n\ncomparable state oil pollution regimes as an excessive burden\n\non maritime  commerce.  Given the  Congress' superior ability\n\nto weigh the very practical considerations relating to such a\n\njudgment,  we give  Congress' conclusion  substantial weight.\n\nFor  this purpose,  the non-retroactivity  of the  statute is\n\nirrelevant.\n\n     We hold, then, that  the Rhode Island's Compensation Act\n\nas reasonably  construed and applied is not  preempted by the\n\nadmiralty clause of the Constitution.  We express no judgment\n\non  whether claimants'  particular  injuries were  reasonably\n\nforeseeable or proximately caused by the grounding of the M/V\n\n                             -22-\n\nWorld  Prodigy,  or whether  claimants' claims  are otherwise\n\nviable under the Rhode Island statute.  That determination is\n\nfor the district court in the first instance or for the state\n\ncourts.  Robins Dry Dock remains the rule in this circuit for\n                        \n\nfederal claims;   we simply hold that Rhode Island is free to\n\nchart a different course.\n\n     Because  of the Oil Pollution  Act, it may  well be that\n\nthe immediate problem with which  we have wrestled at  length\n\nin  this case is  a transient one;  the legal  regime for oil\n\npollution accidents after August 18, 1990,  will largely be a\n\ncreature of  the new statute.   But the case before  us, like\n\nall cases, is  important to the litigants,  and the governing\n\nlegal  standards have  application  elsewhere.   Applying  an\n\nimprecise federal  preemption standard to a  little construed\n\nstate statute is  no easy  task.  For  the present,  assuming\n\nthat the  Rhode Island  statute is providently  construed and\n\napplied, we think that it is not unconstitutional.\n\n     The   decision   of   the  district   court   dismissing\n\nplaintiffs'  federal claims  is affirmed;   the  dismissal of\n                                        \n\nplaintiffs' state claims is reversed and the case is remanded\n                                                             \n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                             -23-\n",

This   appeal  presents  the\n                            \n\nquestion  whether federal maritime  law preempts Rhode Island\n\nlegislation  affording expanded  state-law  remedies for  oil\n\npollution  damage.   In an able  opinion, the  district court\n\nheld that the remedies were preempted.  Discerning the law in\n\nthis area is far from easy;  one might tack a sailboat into a\n\nfog bank  with more  confidence.  Yet  guided in  part by  an\n\nimportant Supreme Court decision rendered  after the district\n\ncourt's decision, we are  constrained to reverse in part  and\n\nto remand for further proceedings.\n\n     The basic facts of the case are not in dispute.  On June\n\n23,  1989,  the M/V  World Prodigy,  an  oil tanker  owned by\n\nBallard Shipping Co., ran  aground in Narragansett Bay, Rhode\n\nIsland, spilling over 300,000 gallons of heating oil into the\n\nbay.    The wreck  occurred when  the  ship strayed  from the\n\ndesignated  shipping channel  and collided  with a  rock near\n\nBrenton Reef, about a  mile south of Newport at the  mouth of\n\nthe bay.  The oil slick prompted the State of Rhode Island to\n\nclose Narragansett  Bay to all shellfishing  activities for a\n\nperiod of two weeks during and after cleanup operations.\n\n     State authorities  charged the captain of  the ship with\n\nentering  the bay without a local pilot on board in violation\n\nof  state law.   Both  the captain  and Ballard  also pleaded\n\nguilty to criminal violations  of the Federal Water Pollution\n\nControl Act, see 33 U.S.C.    1319(c).  The captain and owner\n                \n\n                             -2-\n\nwere fined a total of $30,500 and $500,000, respectively.  In\n\naddition, Ballard agreed to  pay $3.9 million in compensation\n\nfor  federal cleanup  costs, $4.7  million for  state cleanup\n\ncosts and damage to natural resources, $500,000 of which  was\n\nto be  available to  compensate individuals, and  $550,000 to\n\nsettle claims for lost wages by local shellfishermen.\n\n     A  number of  claimants  filed suit  against Ballard  in\n\nRhode  Island.  Ballard  responded on  December 22,  1989, by\n\nbringing  a   petition   in  admiralty   for  limitation   or\n\nexoneration from liability.   46 U.S.C.   185.   \"[T]he court\n\nof  admiralty  in  [a  limitation  of  liability]  proceeding\n\nacquires the right to marshal all claims, whether of strictly\n\nadmiralty origin  or not, and to  give effect to  them by the\n\napportionment of the res and  by judgment in personam against\n                                                     \n\nthe owner, so far as the court may decree.\" Just v.

In  the present  case, several\n\nclaimants reasserted their claims in the admiralty action.\n\n     The  claimants in  the  present appeal  are  a group  of\n\nshellfish dealers who allege  severe economic losses  arising\n\nfrom the  two-week hiatus  in shellfishing  activities, which\n\nsuspended  their operations  during the  busiest time  of the\n\nshellfishing  season.    They  alleged negligence  under  the\n\ngeneral maritime law and  the common law of Rhode  Island, as\n\nwell as a  claim for  economic losses pursuant  to the  Rhode\n\nIsland  Environmental Injury Compensation Act, R.I.

But  it is one thing to say that  a federal court,\n\nlargely responsible for shaping  the common law of admiralty,\n\nshould  follow  a longstanding  liability  rule  to govern  a\n\nfederal  cause of action.  It is  quite another to say that a\n\nstate remedy, presumptively  preserved under  the savings  to\n\nsuitors  clause,  is  potentially  so  disruptive  as  to  be\n\nunconstitutional.

United States  v. Ven-\n                                                             \n\nFuel, Inc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450368\"><a href=\"/opinion/450368/united-states-v-ven-fuel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  751-52 (1st Cir.  1985) (readings\n          \n\nthat create redundancies are not favored). \n\n     The new federal statute  does not apply retroactively to\n\ngovern  the present case.   See Pub.  L. No.  101-380,   1020\n                               \n\n(providing  that  the statute  \"shall  apply  to an  incident\n\noccurring  after the date  the enactment of  this Act [August\n\n18,  1990].\").  But we  think that the  statute is compelling\n\nevidence  that Congress  does  not view  either expansion  of\n\nliability  to cover  purely economic  losses or  enactment of\n\ncomparable state oil pollution regimes as an excessive burden\n\non maritime  commerce.  Given the  Congress' superior ability\n\nto weigh the very practical considerations relating to such a\n\njudgment,  we give  Congress' conclusion  substantial weight.\n\nFor  this purpose,  the non-retroactivity  of the  statute is\n\nirrelevant.\n\n     We hold, then, that  the Rhode Island's Compensation Act\n\nas reasonably  construed and applied is not  preempted by the\n\nadmiralty clause of the Constitution.  We express no judgment\n\non  whether claimants'  particular  injuries were  reasonably\n\nforeseeable or proximately caused by the grounding of the M/V\n\n                             -22-\n\nWorld  Prodigy,  or whether  claimants' claims  are otherwise\n\nviable under the Rhode Island statute.  That determination is\n\nfor the district court in the first instance or for the state\n\ncourts.  Robins Dry Dock remains the rule in this circuit for\n                        \n\nfederal claims;   we simply hold that Rhode Island is free to\n\nchart a different course.\n\n     Because  of the Oil Pollution  Act, it may  well be that\n\nthe immediate problem with which  we have wrestled at  length\n\nin  this case is  a transient one;  the legal  regime for oil\n\npollution accidents after August 18, 1990,  will largely be a\n\ncreature of  the new statute.   But the case before  us, like\n\nall cases, is  important to the litigants,  and the governing\n\nlegal  standards have  application  elsewhere.   Applying  an\n\nimprecise federal  preemption standard to a  little construed\n\nstate statute is  no easy  task.  For  the present,  assuming\n\nthat the  Rhode Island  statute is providently  construed and\n\napplied, we think that it is not unconstitutional.\n\n     The   decision   of   the  district   court   dismissing\n\nplaintiffs'  federal claims  is affirmed;   the  dismissal of\n                                        \n\nplaintiffs' state claims is reversed and the case is remanded\n                                                             \n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                             -23-\n</pre>",
