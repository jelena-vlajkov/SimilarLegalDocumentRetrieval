William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                    \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                     Breyer, Chief Judge,\n                                        \n               Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n                                              \n\n                                         \n\nNazzaro Scarpa on brief pro se.\n              \nA.  John  Pappalardo,  United  States  Attorney,  and  Suzanne  E.\n                                                                  \nDurrell, Assistant United States Attorney, on Memorandum in Support of\n   \nAppellee's Motion for Summary Disposition, for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.   Upon review of the parties' briefs and the\n               \n\nrecord on appeal,  we find no error  in the district  court's\n\ndismissal of  plaintiff's complaint based on  the reasons set\n\nforth in the  defendant's memorandum.  We  add only that,  in\n\nany   event,  plaintiff's   allegation  that   the  defendant\n\ncommitted  perjury, even accepted as true for purposes of the\n\nmotion to dismiss,  does not support a civil rights claim for\n\ndamages.  See  Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325 (1983) (holding\n                               \n\nthat  a  police  officer  witness  is  entitled  to  absolute\n\nimmunity  against a   1983 claim;  alleged perjury at trial);\n\nKyricopoulos v.
