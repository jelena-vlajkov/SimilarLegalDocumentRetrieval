Linda  Joler, a  supervisor at\r                                       \r\n\nScott  Paper  Company's paper  mill  in  Winslow, Maine,  was\r\n\ndischarged  In March  1992  as part  of  a \"downsizing\"  that\r\n\neliminated 35  percent of  the salaried employees.   Charging\r\n\ngender  discrimination, Joler  sued  Scott  in  the  district\r\n\ncourt, primarily under Title  VII of the Civil Rights  Act of\r\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C.    2000e et. seq.   Joler also claimed  under\r                                             \r\n\nthe Maine Human  Right Act,  5 M.R.S.A.     4571-72, but  the\r\n\nparties have not sought  to distinguish the state claim  from\r\n\nthe federal claim.\r\n\n     After discovery, Scott moved  for summary judgment. In a\r\n\nwritten decision  the magistrate  judge recommended that  the\r\n\nmotion be granted.   On October 31, 1994, the  district judge\r\n\nadopted  the findings  and recommendation  of the  magistrate\r\n\njudge without elaboration.  Joler now appeals.   Joler's most\r\n\nsubstantial  claim on  appeal  is factual,  namely, that  she\r\n\noffered enough evidence of discrimination to justify a trial.\r\n\n     The framework for evaluating the evidence in a Title VII\r\n\ncase  depends  on whether  the charge  is one  of intentional\r\n\ndiscrimination or  of disparate impact, Griggs  v. Duke Power\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.,  401 U.S. 424 (1971);  in this case,  only the former is\r               \r\n\nalleged.    Indeed,   the  layoff   actually  increased   the\r\n\npercentage  of  female  first  line   supervisors  remaining.\r\n\nJoler's claim,  therefore, depends  on a showing  that gender\r\n\nbias was the  motive, or at least a motive,  in selecting her\r                                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nfor discharge.

In  evaluating the evidence  tendered, we\r\n\ndraw all reasonable inferences in favor of Joler as the party\r\n\nopposing summary judgment, and we review de novo the district\r                                                            \r\n\ncourt's  decision to grant summary  judgment.  Id.   The bare\r                                                              \r\n\nfacts are these:\r\n\n     Joler  began  working  at  the mill  in  1975,  advanced\r\n\nseveral steps up  the ladder,  and in 1987  became the  first\r\n\nfemale  supervisor in  the mill's  Recycling Department.   In\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nfall 1991, Scott  ordered the  mill's management  to cut  the\r\n\nsalaried  work  force  by  about  35  percent.    The  mill's\r\n\nmanagement,  who made  the  selection using  guidelines  from\r\n\nScott's headquarters, comprised  the mill manager,  its human\r\n\nresources director, and the heads  of each department.  Every\r\n\nmember of this team was a male.\r\n\n     The team divided all  salaried employees into job groups\r\n\nmade up of those who, regardless of  their department, needed\r\n\nsimilar  skills  for  their  jobs; Joler,  for  example,  was\r\n\ngrouped among 27 operating floor leaders throughout the mill.\r\n\nEach  employee  was  then  graded numerically  based  on  job\r\n\nskills, versatility and length of  service.  The employees in\r\n\neach job  group were then ranked in order of the their scores\r\n\nand those with the lowest scores were selected for discharge.\r\n\n     Joler's  score  placed her  as  number 23  among  the 27\r\n\noperating  floor leaders.    Scott discharged  the 10  lowest\r\n\nscoring operating floor leaders,  comprising nine men and one\r\n\nwoman  (Joler).    After  the  downsizing,  17  such  leaders\r\n\nremained,  of whom four were women, one having been promoted.\r\n\nThus, the proportion  of female leaders in  the mill actually\r\n\nrose; but in the Recycling Department, the number of  leaders\r\n\nchanged from three men and one woman (Joler) to five men, two\r\n\nof the men being shifted from other departments.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     Joler's case,  as summarized  on the appeal,  amounts to\r\n\nthis: Joler's  record at the mill was a good one; the two new\r\n\nleaders added to the  Recycling Department had poorer records\r\n\nthan Joler's;  Joler's ranking  was adversely affected  by an\r\n\nincident in which she complained  about a subordinate who had\r\n\nmade sexist comments about her; the mill had a history of too\r\n\nfew women  and of  tolerating sexism;  the rating scheme  was\r\n\nbiased against  Joler  and women  in  general; and  the  mill\r\n\nculpably  destroyed  documents  and concealed  its  decision-\r\n\nmaking process.\r\n\n     If  all of these claims  were taken at  face value, they\r\n\ncould add up to a formidable  case.  But except for the first\r\n\none--Joler was  a good  employee--the claims  are overstated,\r\n\nincomplete or in two important instances largely unsupported.\r\n\nWhether  what is  left  is enough  remains to  be considered.\r\n\nStill, it  is of no use  trying to weigh the  wheat until the\r\n\nchaff has been separated out.  \r\n\n     The two transferred leaders  had flaws in their records,\r\n\nas did Joler; but  each was ranked higher overall,  and Joler\r\n\npresents no  evidence that  their rankings  were deliberately\r\n\noverstated.   It is quite  true that there  was some evidence\r\n\nthat  the  transferees  did  not  perform  in  the  Recycling\r\n\nDepartment as well as  had Joler.  But Joler  was experienced\r\n\nthere,  and they  were  not.   The reorganization  aimed, and\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\npermissibly so, to retain generalists who had the flexibility\r\n\nto be used in different jobs.\r\n\n     Joler's next claim is that she was fired in part because\r\n\nof her own recent complaint about sexual harassment by a male\r\n\nsubordinate.   This  man (Marcel  Moreau) made  at least  one\r\n\nsexist  comment to Joler, Scott disciplined  him, and then it\r\n\nsoftened the  discipline greatly  when his  union complained.\r\n\nOne or two members of the management group apparently thought\r\n\nthat Joler's  handling of the incident reflected badly on her\r\n\nskills in dealing with subordinates, but she herself admitted\r\n\nto problems in this sphere.\r\n\n     There is more substance to Joler's claim that women were\r\n\nunderrepresented among  the mill's  employees and  there were\r\n\nepisodes of sexist comments by various of its male employees.\r\n\nBut  there is no evidence that  these background facts, which\r\n\nare  sadly quite common, had any effect on Joler's ratings or\r\n\non  the rating process.   On the contrary,  there is evidence\r\n\nthat  partly on  account  of this  history,  Scott made  some\r\n\nefforts to assure  that the downsizing  did not decrease  its\r\n\nfemale-to-male ratio.\r\n\n     We come,  then, to the  heart of the  matter--the charge\r\n\nthat  Joler's own  score and the  rating process  were biased\r\n\nagainst women.   Joler's score was  principally determined by\r\n\nher department  head, Fletcher,  and her brief  says outright\r\n\nthat he was motivated by gender bias stemming from the Moreau\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nincident.  On deposition, Joler herself  said that apart from\r\n\nher discharge  she  never saw  Fletcher discriminate  against\r\n\nwomen,  nor   is  there   any  objective  evidence   that  he\r\n\ndiscriminated.\r\n\n     About the most that Joler's  brief offers is his alleged\r\n\nstatement to her, when he informed her of the discharge, that\r\n\n\"you  can  cry now.\"   If  Fletcher  made this  statement (he\r\n\ndenies it but we  will assume arguendo that  he made it),  it\r                                                  \r\n\nlikely  reflects a  stereotype.   But Fletcher  had supported\r                                                                         \r\n\nJoler's promotion to leader over two competing males, and his\r\n\nultimate appraisal of Joler was generally consistent with his\r\n\nappraisals before the Moreau incident.  The charge of bias is\r\n\nsimply without basis.\r\n\n     Having  reviewed the  evidence, we  also reject  Joler's\r\n\nclaim  that the  \"versatility\"  component of  the job  skills\r\n\ncriteria revealed a bias against women.  The resulting scores\r\n\nfor men and women in this category can be viewed in different\r\n\nways, some favorable  to women and some to  men.  But despite\r\n\nclaims to the contrary in Joler's brief, there is no evidence\r\n\nthat the criterion or the scores were deliberately tilted and\r\n\nalmost  none that  the criterion  had a  significant negative\r\n\neffect upon women as a group.\r\n\n     We turn  finally to  the charge of  document destruction\r\n\nand  concealment.  Of course, a party's efforts to destroy or\r\n\nconceal   evidence  may   give  rise   to  an   inference  of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nconsciousness  of  guilt,  and  this  self-appraisal  can  be\r\n\nweighed  with other  evidence in  the  case.   But businesses\r\n\ndiscard materials all  the time.  An  inference of spoilation\r\n\ndepends on  underlying facts that would  permit a fact-finder\r\n\nto  conclude that those who destroyed the materials did so in\r\n\n\"bad faith or . . . consciousness of a weak case.\"  Allen Pen\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo. v. Springfield Photo Mount Co., 653 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1981).  No such evidence is present here.\r\n\n     After   the  downsizing,  the   rating  group  kept  the\r\n\nassessment sheets for every employee, handwritten comments on\r\n\nthe sheets,  and scores  assigned to each  employee by  every\r\n\nrater.    Perhaps  unwisely,  the  group  discarded  separate\r\n\nhandwritten  notes made  by  individual  managers during  the\r\n\ndiscussion  and  a set  of loose  flip  charts, one  of which\r\n\ncontained a more detailed breakdown of the scoring regime for\r\n\nversatility than  was  contained in  the  written  assessment\r\n\nplan.\r\n\n     But  what  was  retained  by  Scott  makes  it  easy  to\r\n\nreconstruct  almost all of the  rating process.   There is no\r\n\nindication that  anything was  destroyed in order  to prevent\r\n\nits  use  in  litigation  or  that  anything  lost  contained\r\n\ninformation helpful to  Joler.  On  these facts, no  rational\r\n\nbasis exists for inferring  that Scott engaged in spoilation.\r\n\nThe magistrate judge did not err in rejecting the inference. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n       It is  time to sum  up.   There is  simply not  enough\r\n\nevidence to  underpin a  charge that Joler  was fired  either\r\n\nsolely or in part because of gender discrimination.  Not only\r\n\nwould the trial  judge be  compelled to direct  a verdict  if\r\n\nsuch a case were presented  to a jury, but we have  no reason\r\n\nto  think that  the gaps  and weaknesses  could be  filled by\r\n\nanything likely to  arise at  trial.

Charging gender discrimination, Joler sued Scott in the district court, primarily under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e et. seq.   Joler also claimed under the Maine Human Right Act, 5 M.R.S.A. Secs. 4571-72, but the parties have not sought to distinguish the state claim from the federal claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, Scott moved for summary judgment.  In a written decision the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be granted.  On October 31, 1994, the district judge adopted the findings and recommendation of the magistrate judge without elaboration.  Joler now appeals.  Joler's most substantial claim on appeal is factual, namely, that she offered enough evidence of discrimination to justify a trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The framework for evaluating the evidence in a Title VII case depends on whether the charge is one of intentional discrimination or of disparate impact, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971);  in this case, only the former is alleged.  Indeed, the layoff actually increased the percentage of female first line supervisors remaining.  Joler's claim, therefore, depends on a showing that gender bias was the motive, or at least a motive, in selecting her for discharge.  See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989);  Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc, 30 F.3d 255, 260 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Title VII cases, once the employee makes out a \"prima facie \" case, the employer must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge.

Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).  But neither burden is a heavy one and, for purposes of this appeal, Scott seemingly concedes that a prima facie case was made out and Joler concedes that Scott did articulate the required explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the burden to prove Scott's improper motive remained with Joler, she could avoid summary judgment simply by showing that substantial evidence supported her position.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir.1993).  In evaluating the evidence tendered, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Joler as the party opposing summary judgment, and we review de novo the district court's decision to grant summary judgment.  Id. The bare facts are these:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler began working at the mill in 1975, advanced several steps up the ladder, and in 1987 became the first female supervisor in the mill's Recycling Department.  In fall 1991, Scott ordered the mill's management to cut the salaried work force by about 35 percent.  The mill's management, who made the selection using guidelines from Scott's headquarters, comprised the mill manager, its human resources director, and the heads of each department.  Every member of this team was a male.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The team divided all salaried employees into job groups made up of those who, regardless of their department, needed similar skills for their jobs;  Joler, for example, was grouped among 27 operating floor leaders throughout the mill.  Each employee was then graded numerically based on job skills, versatility and length of service.  The employees in each job group were then ranked in order of the their scores and those with the lowest scores were selected for discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's score placed her as number 23 among the 27 operating floor leaders.  Scott discharged the 10 lowest scoring operating floor leaders, comprising nine men and one woman (Joler).  After the downsizing, 17 such leaders remained, of whom four were women, one having been promoted.  Thus, the proportion of female leaders in the mill actually rose;  but in the Recycling Department, the number of leaders changed from three men and one woman (Joler) to five men, two of the men being shifted from other departments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's case, as summarized on the appeal, amounts to this:  Joler's record at the mill was a good one;  the two new leaders added to the Recycling Department had poorer records than Joler's;  Joler's ranking was adversely affected by an incident in which she complained about a subordinate who had made sexist comments about her;  the mill had a history of too few women and of tolerating sexism;  the rating scheme was biased against Joler and women in general;  and the mill culpably destroyed documents and concealed its decision-making process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If all of these claims were taken at face value, they could add up to a formidable case.  But except for the first one--Joler was a good employee--the claims are overstated, incomplete or in two important instances largely unsupported.  Whether what is left is enough remains to be considered.  Still, it is of no use trying to weigh the wheat until the chaff has been separated out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two transferred leaders had flaws in their records, as did Joler;  but each was ranked higher overall, and Joler presents no evidence that their rankings were deliberately overstated.  It is quite true that there was some evidence that the transferees did not perform in the Recycling Department as well as had Joler.  But Joler was experienced there, and they were not.  The reorganization aimed, and permissibly so, to retain generalists who had the flexibility to be used in different jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's next claim is that she was fired in part because of her own recent complaint about sexual harassment by a male subordinate.  This man (Marcel Moreau) made at least one sexist comment to Joler, Scott disciplined him, and then it softened the discipline greatly when his union complained.  One or two members of the management group apparently thought that Joler's handling of the incident reflected badly on her skills in dealing with subordinates, but she herself admitted to problems in this sphere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is more substance to Joler's claim that women were underrepresented among the mill's employees and there were episodes of sexist comments by various of its male employees.  But there is no evidence that these background facts, which are sadly quite common, had any effect on Joler's ratings or on the rating process.  On the contrary, there is evidence that partly on account of this history, Scott made some efforts to assure that the downsizing did not decrease its female-to-male ratio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come, then, to the heart of the matter--the charge that Joler's own score and the rating process were biased against women.  Joler's score was principally determined by her department head, Fletcher, and her brief says outright that he was motivated by gender bias stemming from the Moreau incident.  On deposition, Joler herself said that apart from her discharge she never saw Fletcher discriminate against women, nor is there any objective evidence that he discriminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the most that Joler's brief offers is his alleged statement to her, when he informed her of the discharge, that \"you can cry now.\"   If Fletcher made this statement (he denies it but we will assume arguendo that he made it), it likely reflects a stereotype.  But Fletcher had supported Joler's promotion to leader over two competing males, and his ultimate appraisal of Joler was generally consistent with his appraisals before the Moreau incident.  The charge of bias is simply without basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the evidence, we also reject Joler's claim that the \"versatility\" component of the job skills criteria revealed a bias against women.  The resulting scores for men and women in this category can be viewed in different ways, some favorable to women and some to men.  But despite claims to the contrary in Joler's brief, there is no evidence that the criterion or the scores were deliberately tilted and almost none that the criterion had a significant negative effect upon women as a group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to the charge of document destruction and concealment.  Of course, a party's efforts to destroy or conceal evidence may give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt, and this self-appraisal can be weighed with other evidence in the case.  But businesses discard materials all the time.  An inference of spoilation depends on underlying facts that would permit a fact-finder to conclude that those who destroyed the materials did so in \"bad faith or ... consciousness of a weak case.\"  Allen Pen Co. v. Springfield Photo Mount Co., 653 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir.1981).  No such evidence is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the downsizing, the rating group kept the assessment sheets for every employee, handwritten comments on the sheets, and scores assigned to each employee by every rater.  Perhaps unwisely, the group discarded separate handwritten notes made by individual managers during the discussion and a set of loose flip charts, one of which contained a more detailed breakdown of the scoring regime for versatility than was contained in the written assessment plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But what was retained by Scott makes it easy to reconstruct almost all of the rating process.  There is no indication that anything was destroyed in order to prevent its use in litigation or that anything lost contained information helpful to Joler.  On these facts, no rational basis exists for inferring that Scott engaged in spoilation.  The magistrate judge did not err in rejecting the inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is time to sum up.  There is simply not enough evidence to underpin a charge that Joler was fired either solely or in part because of gender discrimination.  Not only would the trial judge be compelled to direct a verdict if such a case were presented to a jury, but we have no reason to think that the gaps and weaknesses could be filled by anything likely to arise at trial.  Coll v. PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc., 50 F.3d 1115, 1121 (1st Cir.1995);  see also 10 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2713.1 (2d ed.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler criticizes the magistrate judge's analysis of the facts and the weight he assigned to certain pieces of evidence.  There is no need to consider these criticisms separately.  Because this court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo, we have to make our own appraisal of the record.  Even if we were to disagree with the magistrate judge on a particular point, our result would be the same and that is sufficient.  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's remaining claims of \"legal\" error have no force.  The \"mixed motive\" provision of the 1991 amendments to the statute, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), did in certain respects overrule the Supreme Court's decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), but in this case no improper mixed motive was shown by the evidence.  Similarly, we agree with Joler that under Hicks, a plaintiff's prima facie case, coupled with evidence of pretext, can sometimes suffice to defeat summary judgment, see Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 260 (1st Cir.1994);  but there is no evidence here sufficient to show Scott's asserted reason for the discharge was pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a distressing case because of a hardship having nothing to do with discrimination.  By all accounts, Joler was an able employee who served Scott with dedication for 16 years and did not, in any ordinary sense, deserve to lose her job.  But it is in the nature of large scale reductions in force that qualified workers find themselves out of a job for economic reasons unrelated to personal fault.  Title VII was not intended to remedy that problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The employees in each job group were then ranked in order of the their scores and those with the lowest scores were selected for discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's score placed her as number 23 among the 27 operating floor leaders.  Scott discharged the 10 lowest scoring operating floor leaders, comprising nine men and one woman (Joler).  After the downsizing, 17 such leaders remained, of whom four were women, one having been promoted.  Thus, the proportion of female leaders in the mill actually rose;  but in the Recycling Department, the number of leaders changed from three men and one woman (Joler) to five men, two of the men being shifted from other departments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's case, as summarized on the appeal, amounts to this:  Joler's record at the mill was a good one;  the two new leaders added to the Recycling Department had poorer records than Joler's;  Joler's ranking was adversely affected by an incident in which she complained about a subordinate who had made sexist comments about her;  the mill had a history of too few women and of tolerating sexism;  the rating scheme was biased against Joler and women in general;  and the mill culpably destroyed documents and concealed its decision-making process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If all of these claims were taken at face value, they could add up to a formidable case.  But except for the first one--Joler was a good employee--the claims are overstated, incomplete or in two important instances largely unsupported.  Whether what is left is enough remains to be considered.  Still, it is of no use trying to weigh the wheat until the chaff has been separated out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two transferred leaders had flaws in their records, as did Joler;  but each was ranked higher overall, and Joler presents no evidence that their rankings were deliberately overstated.  It is quite true that there was some evidence that the transferees did not perform in the Recycling Department as well as had Joler.  But Joler was experienced there, and they were not.  The reorganization aimed, and permissibly so, to retain generalists who had the flexibility to be used in different jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's next claim is that she was fired in part because of her own recent complaint about sexual harassment by a male subordinate.  This man (Marcel Moreau) made at least one sexist comment to Joler, Scott disciplined him, and then it softened the discipline greatly when his union complained.  One or two members of the management group apparently thought that Joler's handling of the incident reflected badly on her skills in dealing with subordinates, but she herself admitted to problems in this sphere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is more substance to Joler's claim that women were underrepresented among the mill's employees and there were episodes of sexist comments by various of its male employees.  But there is no evidence that these background facts, which are sadly quite common, had any effect on Joler's ratings or on the rating process.  On the contrary, there is evidence that partly on account of this history, Scott made some efforts to assure that the downsizing did not decrease its female-to-male ratio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come, then, to the heart of the matter--the charge that Joler's own score and the rating process were biased against women.  Joler's score was principally determined by her department head, Fletcher, and her brief says outright that he was motivated by gender bias stemming from the Moreau incident.  On deposition, Joler herself said that apart from her discharge she never saw Fletcher discriminate against women, nor is there any objective evidence that he discriminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the most that Joler's brief offers is his alleged statement to her, when he informed her of the discharge, that \"you can cry now.\"   If Fletcher made this statement (he denies it but we will assume arguendo that he made it), it likely reflects a stereotype.  But Fletcher had supported Joler's promotion to leader over two competing males, and his ultimate appraisal of Joler was generally consistent with his appraisals before the Moreau incident.  The charge of bias is simply without basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the evidence, we also reject Joler's claim that the \"versatility\" component of the job skills criteria revealed a bias against women.  The resulting scores for men and women in this category can be viewed in different ways, some favorable to women and some to men.  But despite claims to the contrary in Joler's brief, there is no evidence that the criterion or the scores were deliberately tilted and almost none that the criterion had a significant negative effect upon women as a group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to the charge of document destruction and concealment.  Of course, a party's efforts to destroy or conceal evidence may give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt, and this self-appraisal can be weighed with other evidence in the case.  But businesses discard materials all the time.  An inference of spoilation depends on underlying facts that would permit a fact-finder to conclude that those who destroyed the materials did so in \"bad faith or ... consciousness of a weak case.\"  Allen Pen Co. v. Springfield Photo Mount Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392052\"><a href=\"/opinion/392052/allen-pen-company-inc-v-springfield-photo-mount-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1981).  No such evidence is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the downsizing, the rating group kept the assessment sheets for every employee, handwritten comments on the sheets, and scores assigned to each employee by every rater.  Perhaps unwisely, the group discarded separate handwritten notes made by individual managers during the discussion and a set of loose flip charts, one of which contained a more detailed breakdown of the scoring regime for versatility than was contained in the written assessment plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But what was retained by Scott makes it easy to reconstruct almost all of the rating process.  There is no indication that anything was destroyed in order to prevent its use in litigation or that anything lost contained information helpful to Joler.  On these facts, no rational basis exists for inferring that Scott engaged in spoilation.  The magistrate judge did not err in rejecting the inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is time to sum up.  There is simply not enough evidence to underpin a charge that Joler was fired either solely or in part because of gender discrimination.  Not only would the trial judge be compelled to direct a verdict if such a case were presented to a jury, but we have no reason to think that the gaps and weaknesses could be filled by anything likely to arise at trial.  Coll v. PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195995\"><a href=\"/opinion/195995/coll-v-pb-diagnostics/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1121 (1st Cir.1995);  see also 10 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2713.1 (2d ed.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler criticizes the magistrate judge's analysis of the facts and the weight he assigned to certain pieces of evidence.  There is no need to consider these criticisms separately.  Because this court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo, we have to make our own appraisal of the record.  Even if we were to disagree with the magistrate judge on a particular point, our result would be the same and that is sufficient.  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 822 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joler's remaining claims of \"legal\" error have no force.  The \"mixed motive\" provision of the 1991 amendments to the statute, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), did in certain respects overrule the Supreme Court's decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span> </a></span>(1989), but in this case no improper mixed motive was shown by the evidence.  Similarly, we agree with Joler that under Hicks, a plaintiff's prima facie case, coupled with evidence of pretext, can sometimes suffice to defeat summary judgment, see Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675091\"><a href=\"/opinion/675091/jimmie-e-woods-v-friction-materials-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 260 (1st Cir.1994);  but there is no evidence here sufficient to show Scott's asserted reason for the discharge was pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a distressing case because of a hardship having nothing to do with discrimination.  By all accounts, Joler was an able employee who served Scott with dedication for 16 years and did not, in any ordinary sense, deserve to lose her job.  But it is in the nature of large scale reductions in force that qualified workers find themselves out of a job for economic reasons unrelated to personal fault.  Title VII was not intended to remedy that problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
