In the district  court, Sharon\r                                       \r\n\nParker  was awarded substantial damages by a jury which found\r\n\nthat a police officer  had violated her rights in  the course\r\n\nof  an arrest.    On  this  appeal,  almost  the  only  issue\r\n\npresented, and  certainly the only one warranting discussion,\r\n\nis  a claim that the  district court erred  in describing for\r\n\nthe jury  the state  disorderly conduct  statute used by  the\r\n\npolice officer to justify Parker's arrest.  Because the issue\r\n\nis narrowly framed, our description of the factual background\r\n\nis brief.\r\n\n     Late  in  the  evening  of  February  10,  1990,  Parker\r\n\nreturned by car to her parents' house in downtown Nashua, New\r\n\nHampshire, from  a dance at the local Moose Club.  There were\r\n\nsix  passengers in the car:  Parker and her husband, Parker's\r\n\nparents,  her  sister,  and  her  sister's  companion.    The\r\n\ncompanion owned and drove the vehicle.  Parker has a disorder\r\n\naffecting the left side of her body;  and for this reason she\r\n\ndoes not drink alcohol.\r\n\n     When the car reached  the house, Parker and  her husband\r\n\nentered  their own car,  which had been left  in front of the\r\n\nhouse prior  to the dance.   At that  point a police  cruiser\r\n\ndriven by officer  James Lima pulled  up behind the  Parkers'\r\n\ncar and flashed its  light.  The officer previously  had been\r\n\nparked by the side of the road when Parker and her companions\r\n\ndrove  by, en route from the dance  to the home of the Parker\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nparents.  The  officer later testified  that he thought  that\r\n\nthe car's  driver had  committed traffic violations.   It  is\r\n\nunclear whether the  officer confused the two  cars, but when\r\n\nParker got out of her own vehicle in response to the flashing\r\n\nlights, the officer asked for her license and registration.\r\n\n     At  this  point, the  police  version  of what  occurred\r\n\nbegins  to  diverge sharply  from  that  of  Parker  and  her\r\n\ncompanions.  According to Lima, he was  assaulted by Parker's\r\n\nhusband, Parker's  sister, and the sister's  companion.  Lima\r\n\npressed a button  calling for  emergency backup.   Two  other\r\n\nofficers  arrived.    The  struggle  continued  and  Parker's\r\n\nhusband was  buffeted.  Ultimately, the  husband, sister, and\r\n\nsister's  companion were  arrested.   By this  time, Parker's\r\n\nparents and others had come out to the scene.\r\n\n     Additional  police  arrived,  including   Officer  Frank\r\n\nSheehan, who  eventually  arrested Parker  herself.   Officer\r\n\nSheehan's later testimony was that he saw  Parker standing in\r\n\nthe road  yelling at  the other officers,  using obscenities.\r\n\nHe  told her to quiet down and  leave the road.  According to\r\n\nSheehan,  eventually   Parker  moved  to  the   sidewalk  but\r\n\ncontinued  to yell.  At  that point Sheehan  said he arrested\r\n\nParker for disorderly conduct.\r\n\n     Parker's description  of events is quite  different.  In\r\n\nher own later  testimony, she  denied being in  the road  and\r\n\nclaimed  to have said to Officer Sheehan only that she wanted\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nto go  to the police  station with her husband  who was being\r\n\narrested.   Sheehan, she  says, responded with  an obscenity,\r\n\ndeclaring  that  the  police car  was  not  a  taxi.   Parker\r\n\ntestified that  she simply turned away and  walked toward the\r\n\nhouse,  saying  to  her  mother   that  this  was  \"the  most\r\n\nunbelievable thing I've ever seen.\"\r\n\n     In  all  events,  Parker  was  handcuffed,  offering  no\r\n\nresistance.   She  later offered  medical testimony  that her\r\n\nshoulder and upper arm, already susceptible to injury because\r\n\nof   her  medical   condition,   were  wrenched   during  the\r\n\nhandcuffing.   Then, en route to the police cruiser, she says\r\n\nthat she  was pulled or  tugged by the handcuffs  so that she\r\n\nfell on the ground and was then dragged by the  police over a\r\n\nsnow bank.  The police version is that this was an accidental\r\n\nfall.\r\n\n     Parker was  arrested  for and  charged  with  disorderly\r\n\nconduct.    The  charges   were  eventually  dropped  by  the\r\n\nauthorities.  In due  course, she brought the present  action\r\n\nin  district  court against  the City  of Nashua,  the Nashua\r\n\nPolice Department  and  various officers  including  Sheehan.\r\n\nHer federal  claim under 42  U.S.C.   1983  was based on  her\r\n\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be  free\r\n\nfrom  unreasonable  seizure.   She  also  asserted state  law\r\n\nclaims  based on her allegedly unlawful arrest.  The case was\r\n\ntried before a jury in January and February 1994.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     At  the  trial,  Parker  and the  police  offered  their\r\n\nrespective  versions  of  what   had  happened.    There  was\r\n\ntestimony  from  Parker,  Sheehan   and  a  number  of  other\r\n\nwitnesses  on both sides who  had been present  at the scene.\r\n\nParker, who was a government social worker, proffered medical\r\n\nand economic evidence to support a very substantial  award of\r\n\ndamages.   The  jury  returned a  large  verdict  for  Parker\r\n\nagainst  Sheehan (although  smaller than  requested), finding\r\n\nspecially that  Parker's rights under both  federal and state\r\n\nlaw had been infringed.\r\n\n     On this  appeal, defendants'  central claim is  that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred  in failing to charge  the jury properly\r\n\nas to the offense for which Parker was arrested.  The premise\r\n\nof  Parker's claim was that she had been arrested even though\r\n\nthe  police lacked  probable  cause to  believe that  she had\r\n\ncommitted  or was  committing an  offense.   See  Michigan v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nDeFillippo,  443 U.S. 31, 36  (1979).  To  decide whether the\r                      \r\n\npolice  had probable cause, the  jury had to  match what they\r\n\nfound  to  be  the  facts--more  accurately,  the  reasonable\r\n\nperception of police as  to those facts--against the elements\r\n\nof the offense.\r\n\n     The New Hampshire disorderly conduct  statute, N.H. Rev.\r\n\nStat.  Ann.     644:2,  comprises  the   misdemeanor  offense\r\n\nlabelled disorderly conduct; but the statute, reprinted in an\r\n\nappendix to  this opinion,  describes nine different  ways of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\ncommitting  the  offense and  covers over  a page  of single-\r\n\nspaced  text.   Several  of  the  offenses  described in  the\r\n\nstatute  were arguably  pertinent  to the  police version  of\r\n\nevents;  others--e.g.,  interference   with  a   firefighting\r                                 \r\n\noperation or obstructing the  entrance to a public building--\r\n\nhad nothing whatever to do with the arrest.\r\n\n     A reading of Sheehan's trial testimony strongly suggests\r\n\nthat the disorderly conduct offense that he  deemed Parker to\r\n\nhave committed  fell under  section III(a) of  the disorderly\r\n\nconduct statute.   That provision is  directed at anyone  who\r\n\npurposely causes a  breach of the peace, annoyance  or alarm,\r\n\nor reckless  risk of  these consequences,  by making  loud or\r\n\nunreasonable  noises   in  a  public  location.     Sheehan's\r\n\ntestimony at  trial emphasized the  loud noises that  he said\r\n\nParker was making and the risk that the gathering crowd would\r\n\nbe incited.\r\n\n     It  is difficult to be sure just how the parties treated\r\n\nthe matter when presenting  their case, because parts of  the\r\n\ntranscript  (e.g., the  closing  statements)  have  not  been\r                             \r\n\nprovided by defendants.  But it is clear that when it came to\r\n\ncharging  the jury,  the defense  in its  requests to  charge\r\n\nasked  the judge to read almost all of the disorderly conduct\r\n\nstatute to the jury.  The trial judge confined  his charge to\r\n\nthe  loud noise  offense  described in  section III(a).   The\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ncourt's refusal to  charge more  broadly is  now assigned  as\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n     We will assume for purposes  of this appeal that Sheehan\r\n\nwas entitled at trial  to justify his arrest of  Parker under\r\n\nany  provision of  the  disorderly conduct  statute that  the\r\n\nevidence  at trial might show to have applied to her conduct.\r\n\nThere was some  evidence from the police witnesses to suggest\r\n\nthat  Parker used obscenities  and refused  to comply  with a\r\n\nlawful police  order; it is  more doubtful that  the evidence\r\n\nshowed any obstruction of  traffic.  Thus a request  that the\r\n\njury  be instructed  as  to  at  least  two  of  these  other\r\n\ndisorderly conduct offenses was arguably proper.1\r\n\n     An  initial  difficulty  is  that  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. 51\r\n\nprovides  that \"[n]o  party may  assign as  error .  . .  the\r\n\nfailure  to give  an  instruction unless  that party  objects\r\n\nthereto  before the  jury  retires to  consider its  verdict,\r\n\nstating distinctly the matter objected to and  the grounds of\r\n\nthe  objection.\"  Further, to satisfy Rule 51 \"the judge must\r\n\nbe told precisely  what the problem  is, and as  importantly,\r                             \r\n\nwhat  the attorney would consider a satisfactory cure.\"  Linn\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Scarfo  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCabletron Systems, Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 944 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                   \r\n\n     In  this instance,  after the district  court instructed\r\n\nthe jury, defense counsel promptly objected to the failure to\r\n\nread  the \"entire  disorderly conduct  statute\" to  the jury.\r\n\nWhen  the court said that  Parker had been  charged only with\r\n\nviolating  section  III(a)  and  \"[n]obody   claims  she  was\r\n\nviolating the rest of it,\" defense counsel responded:\r\n\n          We adduced testimony in evidence that she\r\n          violated  that  section  where   she  was\r\n          declining  to  comply  with a  reasonable\r\n          order of a police officer,  which I think\r\n          is  toward  the  end of  the  substantive\r\n          sections of it.\r\n\nThe  trial judge  said  that  he  did  not  think  that  \"it\"\r\n\n(presumably referring  to the evidence) would  support such a\r\n\ncharge, noted defense counsel's objection, and moved on.\r\n\n     The defense gave the district court no justification for\r\n\nreading  the  entire statute  to the  jury  and so  failed to\r\n\ntender a legally correct instruction.  This requirement is no\r\n\nformality:  the trial court, especially in hearing objections\r\n\nafter the instructions have been given, is making on-the-spot\r\n\nchoices;  and when the  instruction offered by  the lawyer is\r\n\nmanifestly overbroad, the district  judge may reject  without\r\n\nassuming the burden  of editing  it down to  save some  small\r\n\nportion  that may  be viable.

Consolidated Foods\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., 744 F.2d 566, 570 (7th Cir. 1984).\r                 \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     Certainly  in this  case  the defense  request that  the\r\n\ncourt read to the  jury almost all of the  disorderly conduct\r\n\nstatute was properly denied.  A number of the offenses listed\r\n\nhad no possible relevance to the case.  On appeal, defendants\r\n\nmake  no attempt  to show  otherwise.   To allow the  jury to\r\n\nwander aimlessly among the various paragraphs would have been\r\n\nan invitation to confusion  and would be no more  proper than\r\n\nreading  to  the jury  in a  criminal  case a  description of\r\n\noffenses with which the defendant was not charged.\r\n\n     The  story of  the  requested instruction  is not  over.\r\n\nDuring jury  deliberations, the  jury  submitted a  question,\r\n\n\"Can we got a copy of the disorderly conduct  law; i.e., what\r\n\nconstitutes this violation.\"   At this point, defense counsel\r\n\nagain  stated  that  the   entire  statute  should  be  read,\r\n\nasserting  that  the  question  for  the  jury  was  \"whether\r\n\nprobable cause  existed  for  the officer  on  the  scene  to\r\n\nbelieve  that   the  plaintiff  committed   the  offense   of\r\n\ndisorderly  conduct.\"   The court  refused to read  the whole\r\n\nstatute, and  instead reread its original  instruction to the\r\n\njury.  Defense counsel then objected:\r\n\n          Your Honor, we simply object to the Court\r\n          not describing all  the circumstances  in\r\n          the  statute  where a  person  can commit\r\n          disorderly  conduct  or  when an  officer\r\n          could reasonably  believe that disorderly\r\n          conduct  was  committed,  especially  the\r\n          sections of  the statute which  relate to\r\n          engaging   in   tumultuous  behavior   or\r\n          knowingly  refusing  to  comply with  the\r\n          lawful order of  a peace officer to  move\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n          from any public place, which by itself is\r\n          enough, or directing obscene  language or\r\n          obstructing   vehicular   or   pedestrian\r\n          traffic on the street, all of which there\r\n          is testimony on.\r\n\n     This court  has not  decided whether an  initial request\r\n\nfor   an  instruction,   not  properly   presented,   can  be\r\n\nresurrected  by  a  proper  request  made  when  the jury  is\r\n\nreinstructed.   Surely when a new instruction is given to the\r                                             \r\n\njury during  its deliberations,  a new opportunity  exists to\r\n\nobject or propose changes; but few cases address what happens\r\n\nwhen the jury is simply given  the original instruction again\r\n\nand  the  lawyer   now  makes  an  objection,  or   seeks  an\r\n\nalternative, that was not  properly presented before.  Wright\r\n\n&amp; Miller treat the reread instruction as reopening the matter\r\n\nentirely, but the case law is sparse, and we are less certain\r\n\nthat any  blanket rule governs.  See  generally 9 A. Wright &amp;\r                                                           \r\n\nC.  Miller, Federal  Practice and  Procedure    2553,  at 516\r                                                        \r\n\n(1995).\r\n\n     In all events, the new request made here at the time  of\r\n\nrereading repeated  the original unjustified request that the\r                              \r\n\nentire  disorderly conduct statute be read to the jury.  This\r\n\ntime defense counsel enlarged the number of specific offenses\r\n\nfor  which  he  claimed  to  find  support  in  the evidence,\r\n\nreferring to  tumultuous behavior, refusing to  obey a lawful\r\n\norder, making  obscene remarks and  obstructing traffic--\"all\r\n\nof which [he  said] there is testimony on.\"   But once again,\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nthe  request that the entire  statute be read  is far broader\r\n\nthan anything to which counsel was entitled.\r\n\n     It  is  possible,  with  great  generosity,  to construe\r\n\ndefense counsel's  oral objections--both  at the time  of the\r\n\noriginal instruction  and at its rereading--as an alternative\r\n\nrequest to charge the jury only as to the specific disorderly\r\n\nconduct provisions  for which  the defense claimed  there was\r\n\nevidence  (e.g., refusal to  obey a lawful  order).  Standing\r                           \r\n\nalone,  this would  not  be enough  because  it is  counsel's\r\n\nobligation to  communicate clearly with the  judge in seeking\r\n\ninstructions, Scarfo,  54 F.3d at 947,  and counsel's request\r                                \r\n\nwas  far from  clear.   On  the  other hand,  there was  some\r\n\nindication that  the trial  judge did consider  whether other\r\n\nportions of the disorderly conduct statute should be read and\r\n\nthus was not entirely misled by the garbled objection.\r\n\n     Even if  we  treated  the request  for  a  more  limited\r\n\ninstruction as  properly preserved  (and this is  a stretch),\r\n\nthe failure to give the more limited instruction was patently\r\n\nharmless  in  this  case.     Vera-Lozano  v.   International\r                                                                         \r\n\nBroadcasters, 50 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir. 1995).   Our reason is\r                        \r\n\nnot lack of evidence.   Although we can understand  the trial\r\n\njudge's doubts on  this point, Sheehan  can make a  colorable\r\n\nclaim that  even his  own testimony supported  the conclusion\r\n\nthat Parker yelled obscenities,  refused to move promptly out\r\n\nof the street, or both.  When one adds fragments of consonant\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\ntestimony  from  other  officers,  there  are  at  least  two\r\n\nprovisions of  the  disorderly conduct  statute  under  which\r\n\nParker could have been charged, apart from excessive noise.\r\n\n     What persuades us that the error (if any) is harmless is\r\n\nthis:   Parker on  the one hand  and the police  on the other\r\n\ngave coherent but directly conflicting versions of the events\r\n\nrelating to Parker.   Those  versions were each  of a  piece:\r\n\nSheehan,  with some  support from  other officers,  said that\r\n\nParker  had been  standing in  the street yelling  at police,\r\n\nused  swear words, and did not promptly obey an order to move\r\n\nonto the sidewalk  and shut up.  Parker's  version, supported\r\n\nby  other witnesses, is that she had been standing behind one\r\n\nof  the parked cars, had  caused no disturbance  and had done\r\n\nnothing  more than  make a  properly phrased  request to  the\r\n\nofficer to accompany her husband.\r\n\n     The jury  heard all  this testimony from  the witnesses,\r\n\nand  obviously accepted Parker's version of events.  It is to\r\n\nus  inconceivable  that  the  jury would  have  decided  this\r\n\nconflict of fact in favor of the defense if only  it had been\r                            \r\n\ntold that several other  provisions of the disorderly conduct\r\n\nmight also  have been violated  if the police  testimony were\r\n\naccepted.    The  main  thrust  of  Sheehan's  testimony  was\r\n\nParker's standing in the  street yelling, despite his efforts\r\n\nto  get  her  to stop;  the  other  violations  were at  best\r\n\nancillary.   There is no plausible way that this jury, having\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nrejected the essence of the police  testimony, would or could\r\n\nnevertheless  have  found  in  Sheehan's  favor  based  on  a\r\n\nslightly fuller account of what the statute provided.\r\n\n     Our conclusion is not  based on any judgment of  our own\r\n\nas  to what the evidence  proved to have  happened.  Although\r\n\nParker's brief portrays the police engaged in something close\r\n\nto a police  riot, there  is some indication  that others  in\r\n\nParker's party may have been at least partly at fault for the\r\n\ndisturbance.   But  the  evidence was  certainly adequate  to\r\n\nsupport  the jury verdict in favor of Parker on her own claim\r\n\nof wrongful arrest, and  the verdict was not affected  by the\r\n\nomission  of   a  more  complete  instruction  on  disorderly\r\n\nconduct.\r\n\n     The defense brief also  contends that the district court\r\n\nerred in failing to  give an instruction, in relation  to the\r\n\nstate-law  claims  made  by  Parker,  that  the  police  were\r\n\nprivileged to use reasonable  force to prevent perceived harm\r\n\nto  officers   or  the   public.    Although   the  privilege\r\n\ninstruction was requested by the defense, no proper objection\r\n\nto  its omission was made  after the district  court gave its\r\n\ncharge  and  omitted  the   requested  paragraph.    In  this\r\n\ninstance, the  failure to object properly  is beyond dispute.\r\n\nThe  omitted instruction  did not  lead to  a miscarriage  of\r\n\njustice, so  there is  no basis  for a claim  of plain  error\r\n\nunder United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993).\r                                        \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\n     Defendants have urged, contingently, that  the new trial\r\n\nthey  request should  be limited  to  liability.   Parker has\r\n\nfiled a contingent cross appeal urging that in any new trial,\r\n\nshe should be allowed to introduce additional evidence in her\r\n\nfavor--e.g., that the police sought  to obtain a release from\r                       \r\n\nher--which  the district court did not permit her to offer in\r\n\nthe  original trial.  Because we affirm the judgment in favor\r\n\nof Parker, these contingent requests need not be reached.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\n                           APPENDIX\r\n\n     RSA 644:2 Disorderly Conduct.

On this appeal, almost the only issue presented, and certainly the only one warranting discussion, is a claim that the district court erred in describing for the jury the state disorderly conduct statute used by the police officer to justify Parker's arrest.   Because the issue is narrowly framed, our description of the factual background is brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Late in the evening of February 10, 1990, Parker returned by car to her parents' house in downtown Nashua, New Hampshire, from a dance at the local Moose Club.   There were six passengers in the car:  Parker and her husband, Parker's parents, her sister, and her sister's companion.   The companion owned and drove the vehicle.   Parker has a disorder affecting the left side of her body;  and for this reason she does not drink alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the car reached the house, Parker and her husband entered their own car, which had been left in front of the house prior to the dance.   At that point a police cruiser driven by officer James Lima pulled up behind the Parkers' car and flashed its light.   The officer previously had been parked by the side of the road when Parker and her companions drove by, en route from the dance to the home of the Parker parents.   The officer later testified that he thought that the car's driver had committed traffic violations.   It is unclear whether the officer confused the two cars, but when Parker got out of her own vehicle in response to the flashing lights, the officer asked for her license and registration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the police version of what occurred begins to diverge sharply from that of Parker and her companions.   According to Lima, he was assaulted by Parker's husband, Parker's sister, and the sister's companion.   Lima pressed a button calling for emergency backup.   Two other officers arrived.   The struggle continued and Parker's husband was buffeted.   Ultimately, the husband, sister, and sister's companion were arrested.   By this time, Parker's parents and others had come out to the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additional police arrived, including Officer Frank Sheehan, who eventually arrested Parker herself.   Officer Sheehan's later testimony was that he saw Parker standing in the road yelling at the other officers, using obscenities.   He told her to quiet down and leave the road.   According to Sheehan, eventually Parker moved to the sidewalk but continued to yell.   At that point Sheehan said he arrested Parker for disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker's description of events is quite different.   In her own later testimony, she denied being in the road and claimed to have said to Officer Sheehan only that she wanted to go to the police station with her husband who was being arrested.   Sheehan, she says, responded with an obscenity, declaring that the police car was not a taxi.   Parker testified that she simply turned away and walked toward the house, saying to her mother that this was \"the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, Parker was handcuffed, offering no resistance.   She later offered medical testimony that her shoulder and upper arm, already susceptible to injury because of her medical condition, were wrenched during the handcuffing.   Then, en route to the police cruiser, she says that she was pulled or tugged by the handcuffs so that she fell on the ground and was then dragged by the police over a snow bank.   The police version is that this was an accidental fall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker was arrested for and charged with disorderly conduct.   The charges were eventually dropped by the authorities.   In due course, she brought the present action in district court against the City of Nashua, the Nashua Police Department and various officers including Sheehan.   Her federal claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 was based on her rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free from unreasonable seizure.   She also asserted state law claims based on her allegedly unlawful arrest.   The case was tried before a jury in January and February 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial, Parker and the police offered their respective versions of what had happened.   There was testimony from Parker, Sheehan and a number of other witnesses on both sides who had been present at the scene.   Parker, who was a government social worker, proffered medical and economic evidence to support a very substantial award of damages.   The jury returned a large verdict for Parker against Sheehan (although smaller than requested), finding specially that Parker's rights under both federal and state law had been infringed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, defendants' central claim is that the district court erred in failing to charge the jury properly as to the offense for which Parker was arrested.   The premise of Parker's claim was that she had been arrested even though the police lacked probable cause to believe that she had committed or was committing an offense.   See Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 36, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 2631, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979).   To decide whether the police had probable cause, the jury had to match what they found to be the facts--more accurately, the reasonable perception of police as to those facts--against the elements of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire disorderly conduct statute, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 644:2, comprises the misdemeanor offense labelled disorderly conduct;  but the statute, reprinted in an appendix to this opinion, describes nine different ways of committing the offense and covers over a page of single-spaced text.   Several of the offenses described in the statute were arguably pertinent to the police version of events;  others--e.g., interference with a firefighting operation or obstructing the entrance to a public building--had nothing whatever to do with the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reading of Sheehan's trial testimony strongly suggests that the disorderly conduct offense that he deemed Parker to have committed fell under section III(a) of the disorderly conduct statute.   That provision is directed at anyone who purposely causes a breach of the peace, annoyance or alarm, or reckless risk of these consequences, by making loud or unreasonable noises in a public location.   Sheehan's testimony at trial emphasized the loud noises that he said Parker was making and the risk that the gathering crowd would be incited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to be sure just how the parties treated the matter when presenting their case, because parts of the transcript (e.g., the closing statements) have not been provided by defendants.   But it is clear that when it came to charging the jury, the defense in its requests to charge asked the judge to read almost all of the disorderly conduct statute to the jury.   The trial judge confined his charge to the loud noise offense described in section III(a).   The court's refusal to charge more broadly is now assigned as error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume for purposes of this appeal that Sheehan was entitled at trial to justify his arrest of Parker under any provision of the disorderly conduct statute that the evidence at trial might show to have applied to her conduct.   There was some evidence from the police witnesses to suggest that Parker used obscenities and refused to comply with a lawful police order;  it is more doubtful that the evidence showed any obstruction of traffic.   Thus a request that the jury be instructed as to at least two of these other disorderly conduct offenses was arguably proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An initial difficulty is that Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 provides that \"[n]o party may assign as error ... the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"   Further, to satisfy Rule 51 \"the judge must be told precisely what the problem is, and as importantly, what the attorney would consider a satisfactory cure.\"  Linn v. Andover Newton Theological School, Inc., 874 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1989).   And the lawyer must propose a lawful instruction or correction, and not one that substantially overstates the law in that party's favor.  Scarfo v. Cabletron Systems, Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 944 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, after the district court instructed the jury, defense counsel promptly objected to the failure to read the \"entire disorderly conduct statute\" to the jury.   When the court said that Parker had been charged only with violating section III(a) and \"[n]obody claims she was violating the rest of it,\" defense counsel responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>We adduced testimony in evidence that she violated that section where she was declining to comply with a reasonable order of a police officer, which I think is toward the end of the substantive sections of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge said that he did not think that \"it\" (presumably referring to the evidence) would support such a charge, noted defense counsel's objection, and moved on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense gave the district court no justification for reading the entire statute to the jury and so failed to tender a legally correct instruction.   This requirement is no formality:  the trial court, especially in hearing objections after the instructions have been given, is making on-the-spot choices;  and when the instruction offered by the lawyer is manifestly overbroad, the district judge may reject without assuming the burden of editing it down to save some small portion that may be viable.  Chase v. Consolidated Foods Corp., 744 F.2d 566, 570 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly in this case the defense request that the court read to the jury almost all of the disorderly conduct statute was properly denied.   A number of the offenses listed had no possible relevance to the case.   On appeal, defendants make no attempt to show otherwise.   To allow the jury to wander aimlessly among the various paragraphs would have been an invitation to confusion and would be no more proper than reading to the jury in a criminal case a description of offenses with which the defendant was not charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story of the requested instruction is not over.   During jury deliberations, the jury submitted a question, \"Can we got a copy of the disorderly conduct law;  i.e., what constitutes this violation.\"   At this point, defense counsel again stated that the entire statute should be read, asserting that the question for the jury was \"whether probable cause existed for the officer on the scene to believe that the plaintiff committed the offense of disorderly conduct.\"   The court refused to read the whole statute, and instead reread its original instruction to the jury.   Defense counsel then objected:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Your Honor, we simply object to the Court not describing all the circumstances in the statute where a person can commit disorderly conduct or when an officer could reasonably believe that disorderly conduct was committed, especially the sections of the statute which relate to engaging in tumultuous behavior or knowingly refusing to comply with the lawful order of a peace officer to move from any public place, which by itself is enough, or directing obscene language or obstructing vehicular or pedestrian traffic on the street, all of which there is testimony on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not decided whether an initial request for an instruction, not properly presented, can be resurrected by a proper request made when the jury is reinstructed.   Surely when a new instruction is given to the jury during its deliberations, a new opportunity exists to object or propose changes;  but few cases address what happens when the jury is simply given the original instruction again and the lawyer now makes an objection, or seeks an alternative, that was not properly presented before.   Wright &amp; Miller treat the reread instruction as reopening the matter entirely, but the case law is sparse, and we are less certain that any blanket rule governs.   See generally 9A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2553, at 416 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the new request made here at the time of rereading repeated the original unjustified request that the entire disorderly conduct statute be read to the jury.   This time defense counsel enlarged the number of specific offenses for which he claimed to find support in the evidence, referring to tumultuous behavior, refusing to obey a lawful order, making obscene remarks and obstructing traffic--\"all of which [he said] there is testimony on.\"   But once again, the request that the entire statute be read is far broader than anything to which counsel was entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible, with great generosity, to construe defense counsel's oral objections--both at the time of the original instruction and at its rereading--as an alternative request to charge the jury only as to the specific disorderly conduct provisions for which the defense claimed there was evidence (e.g., refusal to obey a lawful order).   Standing alone, this would not be enough because it is counsel's obligation to communicate clearly with the judge in seeking instructions, Scarfo, 54 F.3d at 947, and counsel's request was far from clear.   On the other hand, there was some indication that the trial judge did consider whether other portions of the disorderly conduct statute should be read and thus was not entirely misled by the garbled objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we treated the request for a more limited instruction as properly preserved (and this is a stretch), the failure to give the more limited instruction was patently harmless in this case.  Vera-Lozano v. International Broadcasting, 50 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir.1995).   Our reason is not lack of evidence.   Although we can understand the trial judge's doubts on this point, Sheehan can make a colorable claim that even his own testimony supported the conclusion that Parker yelled obscenities, refused to move promptly out of the street, or both.   When one adds fragments of consonant testimony from other officers, there are at least two provisions of the disorderly conduct statute under which Parker could have been charged, apart from excessive noise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What persuades us that the error (if any) is harmless is this:  Parker on the one hand and the police on the other gave coherent but directly conflicting versions of the events relating to Parker.   Those versions were each of a piece:  Sheehan, with some support from other officers, said that Parker had been standing in the street yelling at police, used swear words, and did not promptly obey an order to move onto the sidewalk and shut up.   Parker's version, supported by other witnesses, is that she had been standing behind one of the parked cars, had caused no disturbance and had done nothing more than make a properly phrased request to the officer to accompany her husband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury heard all this testimony from the witnesses, and obviously accepted Parker's version of events.   It is to us inconceivable that the jury would have decided this conflict of fact in favor of the defense if only it had been told that several other provisions of the disorderly conduct might also have been violated if the police testimony were accepted.   The main thrust of Sheehan's testimony was Parker's standing in the street yelling, despite his efforts to get her to stop;  the other violations were at best ancillary.   There is no plausible way that this jury, having rejected the essence of the police testimony, would or could nevertheless have found in Sheehan's favor based on a slightly fuller account of what the statute provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is not based on any judgment of our own as to what the evidence proved to have happened.   Although Parker's brief portrays the police engaged in something close to a police riot, there is some indication that others in Parker's party may have been at least partly at fault for the disturbance.   But the evidence was certainly adequate to support the jury verdict in favor of Parker on her own claim of wrongful arrest, and the verdict was not affected by the omission of a more complete instruction on disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense brief also contends that the district court erred in failing to give an instruction, in relation to the state-law claims made by Parker, that the police were privileged to use reasonable force to prevent perceived harm to officers or the public.   Although the privilege instruction was requested by the defense, no proper objection to its omission was made after the district court gave its charge and omitted the requested paragraph.   In this instance, the failure to object properly is beyond dispute.   The omitted instruction did not lead to a miscarriage of justice, so there is no basis for a claim of plain error under United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants have urged, contingently, that the new trial they request should be limited to liability.   Parker has filed a contingent cross appeal urging that in any new trial, she should be allowed to introduce additional evidence in her favor--e.g., that the police sought to obtain a release from her--which the district court did not permit her to offer in the original trial.   Because we affirm the judgment in favor of Parker, these contingent requests need not be reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSA 644:2 Disorderly Conduct.

On this appeal, almost the only issue presented, and certainly the only one warranting discussion, is a claim that the district court erred in describing for the jury the state disorderly conduct statute used by the police officer to justify Parker's arrest.   Because the issue is narrowly framed, our description of the factual background is brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Late in the evening of February 10, 1990, Parker returned by car to her parents' house in downtown Nashua, New Hampshire, from a dance at the local Moose Club.   There were six passengers in the car:  Parker and her husband, Parker's parents, her sister, and her sister's companion.   The companion owned and drove the vehicle.   Parker has a disorder affecting the left side of her body;  and for this reason she does not drink alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the car reached the house, Parker and her husband entered their own car, which had been left in front of the house prior to the dance.   At that point a police cruiser driven by officer James Lima pulled up behind the Parkers' car and flashed its light.   The officer previously had been parked by the side of the road when Parker and her companions drove by, en route from the dance to the home of the Parker parents.   The officer later testified that he thought that the car's driver had committed traffic violations.   It is unclear whether the officer confused the two cars, but when Parker got out of her own vehicle in response to the flashing lights, the officer asked for her license and registration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the police version of what occurred begins to diverge sharply from that of Parker and her companions.   According to Lima, he was assaulted by Parker's husband, Parker's sister, and the sister's companion.   Lima pressed a button calling for emergency backup.   Two other officers arrived.   The struggle continued and Parker's husband was buffeted.   Ultimately, the husband, sister, and sister's companion were arrested.   By this time, Parker's parents and others had come out to the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additional police arrived, including Officer Frank Sheehan, who eventually arrested Parker herself.   Officer Sheehan's later testimony was that he saw Parker standing in the road yelling at the other officers, using obscenities.   He told her to quiet down and leave the road.   According to Sheehan, eventually Parker moved to the sidewalk but continued to yell.   At that point Sheehan said he arrested Parker for disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker's description of events is quite different.   In her own later testimony, she denied being in the road and claimed to have said to Officer Sheehan only that she wanted to go to the police station with her husband who was being arrested.   Sheehan, she says, responded with an obscenity, declaring that the police car was not a taxi.   Parker testified that she simply turned away and walked toward the house, saying to her mother that this was \"the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, Parker was handcuffed, offering no resistance.   She later offered medical testimony that her shoulder and upper arm, already susceptible to injury because of her medical condition, were wrenched during the handcuffing.   Then, en route to the police cruiser, she says that she was pulled or tugged by the handcuffs so that she fell on the ground and was then dragged by the police over a snow bank.   The police version is that this was an accidental fall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker was arrested for and charged with disorderly conduct.   The charges were eventually dropped by the authorities.   In due course, she brought the present action in district court against the City of Nashua, the Nashua Police Department and various officers including Sheehan.   Her federal claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 was based on her rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free from unreasonable seizure.   She also asserted state law claims based on her allegedly unlawful arrest.   The case was tried before a jury in January and February 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial, Parker and the police offered their respective versions of what had happened.   There was testimony from Parker, Sheehan and a number of other witnesses on both sides who had been present at the scene.   Parker, who was a government social worker, proffered medical and economic evidence to support a very substantial award of damages.   The jury returned a large verdict for Parker against Sheehan (although smaller than requested), finding specially that Parker's rights under both federal and state law had been infringed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, defendants' central claim is that the district court erred in failing to charge the jury properly as to the offense for which Parker was arrested.   The premise of Parker's claim was that she had been arrested even though the police lacked probable cause to believe that she had committed or was committing an offense.   See Michigan v. DeFillippo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110127\"><a href=\"/opinion/110127/michigan-v-defillippo/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110127\"><a href=\"/opinion/110127/michigan-v-defillippo/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span> </a></span>(1979).   To decide whether the police had probable cause, the jury had to match what they found to be the facts--more accurately, the reasonable perception of police as to those facts--against the elements of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire disorderly conduct statute, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 644:2, comprises the misdemeanor offense labelled disorderly conduct;  but the statute, reprinted in an appendix to this opinion, describes nine different ways of committing the offense and covers over a page of single-spaced text.   Several of the offenses described in the statute were arguably pertinent to the police version of events;  others--e.g., interference with a firefighting operation or obstructing the entrance to a public building--had nothing whatever to do with the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reading of Sheehan's trial testimony strongly suggests that the disorderly conduct offense that he deemed Parker to have committed fell under section III(a) of the disorderly conduct statute.   That provision is directed at anyone who purposely causes a breach of the peace, annoyance or alarm, or reckless risk of these consequences, by making loud or unreasonable noises in a public location.   Sheehan's testimony at trial emphasized the loud noises that he said Parker was making and the risk that the gathering crowd would be incited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to be sure just how the parties treated the matter when presenting their case, because parts of the transcript (e.g., the closing statements) have not been provided by defendants.   But it is clear that when it came to charging the jury, the defense in its requests to charge asked the judge to read almost all of the disorderly conduct statute to the jury.   The trial judge confined his charge to the loud noise offense described in section III(a).   The court's refusal to charge more broadly is now assigned as error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume for purposes of this appeal that Sheehan was entitled at trial to justify his arrest of Parker under any provision of the disorderly conduct statute that the evidence at trial might show to have applied to her conduct.   There was some evidence from the police witnesses to suggest that Parker used obscenities and refused to comply with a lawful police order;  it is more doubtful that the evidence showed any obstruction of traffic.   Thus a request that the jury be instructed as to at least two of these other disorderly conduct offenses was arguably proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An initial difficulty is that Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 provides that \"[n]o party may assign as error ... the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"   Further, to satisfy Rule 51 \"the judge must be told precisely what the problem is, and as importantly, what the attorney would consider a satisfactory cure.\"  Linn v. Andover Newton Theological School, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522861\"><a href=\"/opinion/522861/edmund-h-linn-v-andover-newton-theological-school-inc-edmund-h-linn/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1989).   And the lawyer must propose a lawful instruction or correction, and not one that substantially overstates the law in that party's favor.  Scarfo v. Cabletron Systems, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196064\"><a href=\"/opinion/196064/scarfo-v-cabletron-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 944 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, after the district court instructed the jury, defense counsel promptly objected to the failure to read the \"entire disorderly conduct statute\" to the jury.   When the court said that Parker had been charged only with violating section III(a) and \"[n]obody claims she was violating the rest of it,\" defense counsel responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>We adduced testimony in evidence that she violated that section where she was declining to comply with a reasonable order of a police officer, which I think is toward the end of the substantive sections of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge said that he did not think that \"it\" (presumably referring to the evidence) would support such a charge, noted defense counsel's objection, and moved on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense gave the district court no justification for reading the entire statute to the jury and so failed to tender a legally correct instruction.   This requirement is no formality:  the trial court, especially in hearing objections after the instructions have been given, is making on-the-spot choices;  and when the instruction offered by the lawyer is manifestly overbroad, the district judge may reject without assuming the burden of editing it down to save some small portion that may be viable.  Chase v. Consolidated Foods Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442013\"><a href=\"/opinion/442013/david-t-chase-v-consolidated-foods-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 570 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly in this case the defense request that the court read to the jury almost all of the disorderly conduct statute was properly denied.   A number of the offenses listed had no possible relevance to the case.   On appeal, defendants make no attempt to show otherwise.   To allow the jury to wander aimlessly among the various paragraphs would have been an invitation to confusion and would be no more proper than reading to the jury in a criminal case a description of offenses with which the defendant was not charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story of the requested instruction is not over.   During jury deliberations, the jury submitted a question, \"Can we got a copy of the disorderly conduct law;  i.e., what constitutes this violation.\"   At this point, defense counsel again stated that the entire statute should be read, asserting that the question for the jury was \"whether probable cause existed for the officer on the scene to believe that the plaintiff committed the offense of disorderly conduct.\"   The court refused to read the whole statute, and instead reread its original instruction to the jury.   Defense counsel then objected:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Your Honor, we simply object to the Court not describing all the circumstances in the statute where a person can commit disorderly conduct or when an officer could reasonably believe that disorderly conduct was committed, especially the sections of the statute which relate to engaging in tumultuous behavior or knowingly refusing to comply with the lawful order of a peace officer to move from any public place, which by itself is enough, or directing obscene language or obstructing vehicular or pedestrian traffic on the street, all of which there is testimony on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not decided whether an initial request for an instruction, not properly presented, can be resurrected by a proper request made when the jury is reinstructed.   Surely when a new instruction is given to the jury during its deliberations, a new opportunity exists to object or propose changes;  but few cases address what happens when the jury is simply given the original instruction again and the lawyer now makes an objection, or seeks an alternative, that was not properly presented before.   Wright &amp; Miller treat the reread instruction as reopening the matter entirely, but the case law is sparse, and we are less certain that any blanket rule governs.   See generally 9A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2553, at 416 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the new request made here at the time of rereading repeated the original unjustified request that the entire disorderly conduct statute be read to the jury.   This time defense counsel enlarged the number of specific offenses for which he claimed to find support in the evidence, referring to tumultuous behavior, refusing to obey a lawful order, making obscene remarks and obstructing traffic--\"all of which [he said] there is testimony on.\"   But once again, the request that the entire statute be read is far broader than anything to which counsel was entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible, with great generosity, to construe defense counsel's oral objections--both at the time of the original instruction and at its rereading--as an alternative request to charge the jury only as to the specific disorderly conduct provisions for which the defense claimed there was evidence (e.g., refusal to obey a lawful order).   Standing alone, this would not be enough because it is counsel's obligation to communicate clearly with the judge in seeking instructions, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196064\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Scarfo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196064/scarfo-v-cabletron-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span>, and counsel's request was far from clear.   On the other hand, there was some indication that the trial judge did consider whether other portions of the disorderly conduct statute should be read and thus was not entirely misled by the garbled objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we treated the request for a more limited instruction as properly preserved (and this is a stretch), the failure to give the more limited instruction was patently harmless in this case.  Vera-Lozano v. International Broadcasting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691949\"><a href=\"/opinion/691949/67-fair-emplpraccas-bna-667-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43488-agnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.1995).   Our reason is not lack of evidence.   Although we can understand the trial judge's doubts on this point, Sheehan can make a colorable claim that even his own testimony supported the conclusion that Parker yelled obscenities, refused to move promptly out of the street, or both.   When one adds fragments of consonant testimony from other officers, there are at least two provisions of the disorderly conduct statute under which Parker could have been charged, apart from excessive noise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What persuades us that the error (if any) is harmless is this:  Parker on the one hand and the police on the other gave coherent but directly conflicting versions of the events relating to Parker.   Those versions were each of a piece:  Sheehan, with some support from other officers, said that Parker had been standing in the street yelling at police, used swear words, and did not promptly obey an order to move onto the sidewalk and shut up.   Parker's version, supported by other witnesses, is that she had been standing behind one of the parked cars, had caused no disturbance and had done nothing more than make a properly phrased request to the officer to accompany her husband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury heard all this testimony from the witnesses, and obviously accepted Parker's version of events.   It is to us inconceivable that the jury would have decided this conflict of fact in favor of the defense if only it had been told that several other provisions of the disorderly conduct might also have been violated if the police testimony were accepted.   The main thrust of Sheehan's testimony was Parker's standing in the street yelling, despite his efforts to get her to stop;  the other violations were at best ancillary.   There is no plausible way that this jury, having rejected the essence of the police testimony, would or could nevertheless have found in Sheehan's favor based on a slightly fuller account of what the statute provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is not based on any judgment of our own as to what the evidence proved to have happened.   Although Parker's brief portrays the police engaged in something close to a police riot, there is some indication that others in Parker's party may have been at least partly at fault for the disturbance.   But the evidence was certainly adequate to support the jury verdict in favor of Parker on her own claim of wrongful arrest, and the verdict was not affected by the omission of a more complete instruction on disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense brief also contends that the district court erred in failing to give an instruction, in relation to the state-law claims made by Parker, that the police were privileged to use reasonable force to prevent perceived harm to officers or the public.   Although the privilege instruction was requested by the defense, no proper objection to its omission was made after the district court gave its charge and omitted the requested paragraph.   In this instance, the failure to object properly is beyond dispute.   The omitted instruction did not lead to a miscarriage of justice, so there is no basis for a claim of plain error under United States v.

Parker has filed a contingent cross appeal urging that in any new trial, she should be allowed to introduce additional evidence in her favor--e.g., that the police sought to obtain a release from her--which the district court did not permit her to offer in the original trial.   Because we affirm the judgment in favor of Parker, these contingent requests need not be reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSA 644:2 Disorderly Conduct.
