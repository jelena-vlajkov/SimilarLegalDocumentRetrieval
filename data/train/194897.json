Pursuant  to   a  plea\n                                     \n\nagreement,  defendant-appellant Pedro  Reyes pled  guilty to  one\n\ncount of conspiracy to  distribute and to possess with  intent to\n\ndistribute  cocaine and one count of distribution of cocaine.  In\n\nthis appeal, Reyes challenges the district court's calculation of\n\nhis guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\"), contesting the inclusion,\n\nas relevant conduct, of  transactions involving his  codefendant,\n\nwhich  were the subject of  charges dropped pursuant  to the plea\n\nagreement.  Finding no clear error, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n                                 \n\n          Because Reyes  pled  guilty, we  distill  the  relevant\n\nfacts from the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") and the  transcript of\n\nthe sentencing hearing.   United States  v. Castellone, 985  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n21,  22 (1st  Cir. 1993).   Reyes  and codefendant  Jos  Tav rez-\n\nTolentio  (\"Tav rez\")  were  the  subjects  of  a  combined  Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and local law enforcement drug\n\ninvestigation.\n\n          On  the  evening  of  Monday, January  27,  1992,  West\n\nWarwick detective Sergeant Peter Appollonia met Tav rez outside a\n\nbuilding at 61 Whipple  Street in Providence, Rhode Island.   The\n\ntwo  men proceeded  to a  second floor  apartment where  they met\n\nReyes.   Electric Company records  indicate that Reyes leased the\n\napartment.  Once inside, Tav rez  produced a bag containing  27.4\n\ngrams  of  cocaine  from   the  bathroom;  Reyes  and  Appollonia\n\nnegotiated the price of this transaction  and a quantity discount\n\nfor  a future  sale of  two ounces of  cocaine.   Appollonia then\n\n                               -2-\n\ninquired if he  could purchase  the two ounces  on Wednesday  and\n\nReyes told Appollonia  to come  by at anytime.   The  transaction\n\nconcluded  when Appollonia paid Reyes $900 for the 27.4 grams and\n\nReyes counted the money.\n\n          The  next  day, January  28,  1992,  DEA Special  Agent\n\nBotelho  met  Tav rez  at 1455  Mineral  Spring  Avenue  in North\n\nProvidence.   Tav rez brought Botelho to  apartment sixteen where\n\nthey met a man known  as \"Tony.\"  Tav rez gave Botelho  124 grams\n\nof  cocaine and Botelho paid  him $3,100.   Shortly after Botelho\n\nentered the building on Mineral Street, DEA agents observed Reyes\n\ndrive  his BMW,  accompanied by  a grey  Oldsmobile, from  his 61\n\nWhipple Street address to  the building on Mineral Street.   When\n\nthe two vehicles arrived, the Oldsmobile proceeded to the rear of\n\nthe  building.  Reyes  parked nearby, exited  his vehicle, walked\n\naround the parking lot  adjacent to the Mineral Street  building,\n\nand returned  to his  car where  he waited.   Shortly  before the\n\ntransaction between Botelho and  Tav rez was completed, Reyes and\n\nthe  Oldsmobile departed  the  area and  returned  to 61  Whipple\n\nStreet.     The  DEA  interpreted  Reyes'   actions  as  counter-\n\nsurveillance for the deal occurring above in apartment sixteen.\n\n          On  Saturday,   February  1,  1992,   at  approximately\n\n5:30 p.m., detective Appollonia returned  to 61 Whipple Street to\n\npurchase more  cocaine.   He  encountered Reyes  entering a  Ford\n\nEscort  and inquired whether Reyes  had cocaine for  sale.  Reyes\n\ndirected Appollonia to  return later,  at which  time he,  Reyes,\n\nwould have the cocaine.   Reyes then departed.   At approximately\n\n                               -3-\n\n6:00  p.m., Reyes  returned  to 61  Whipple  Street in  his  BMW,\n\nfollowed  by  the  grey  Oldsmobile, and  entered  the  building.\n\nAppollonia returned  at 6:07 p.m. and  met Tav rez in  the second\n\nfloor  apartment.   Reyes  was not  present.   Tav rez  left  the\n\napartment  and returned with  54.9 grams of  cocaine.  Appollonia\n\ninquired whether  Reyes had informed  Tav rez that the  price was\n\nset  at  $1,700,  representing the  quantity  discount previously\n\nnegotiated.     Tav rez  indicated   that  Reyes  had   done  so.\n\nAppollonia paid for the cocaine and left the premises.\n\n          On  Monday,  February 10,  1992, at  approximately 1:15\n\np.m., agent Botelho returned  to 1455 Mineral Street to  buy more\n\ncocaine.   He met Tav rez, who  agreed to sell him  four and one-\n\nhalf ounces of cocaine.  Tav rez left Mineral Street and drove in\n\na red Toyota wagon registered to Reyes to 61 Whipple Street.\n\n          Approximately 35 minutes later, Tav rez returned to the\n\nMineral  Street  address.   Botelho  observed  Tav rez and  Reyes\n\ninspecting Botelho's car,  which was parked in the  adjacent lot.\n\nTav rez again  met with Botelho and claimed that he would have to\n\ngo to South Providence to obtain the cocaine.  Tav rez departed a\n\nsecond time, and  the Toyota and  Reyes' BMW went  to 61  Whipple\n\nStreet.   DEA agents observed Tav rez,  Reyes and an unidentified\n\nman  entering the  building.   Tav rez then  returned  to Mineral\n\nStreet with 124.1 grams of cocaine.  Botelho alerted other agents\n\nand  Tav rez was  arrested.   Later,  Reyes  was arrested  at  61\n\nWhipple Street, where the police found .18 grams of cocaine.\n\n          Count  one  charged  that  from a  time  unknown  until\n\n                               -4-\n\nFebruary 10, 1992, Reyes and Tav rez conspired to distribute, and\n\nto possess with intent to distribute, cocaine, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C.    841(a)(1) and 846.  Counts two, three, and four charged\n\nReyes  and Tav rez with distribution of cocaine on January 27 and\n\n28, and February 1, 1992, in violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1),\n\n841(b)(1)(B), and  18 U.S.C.    2.  Count five  charged Reyes and\n\nTav rez  possessed  cocaine  with  intent  to  distribute  it  on\n\nFebruary 10,  1992,  in  violation  of 21  U.S.C.      841(a)(1),\n\n841(b)(1)(C), and 18 U.S.C.   2.  Reyes pled guilty to counts one\n\nand two and the  government dropped the charges in  counts three,\n\nfour, and five.\n\n          At sentencing,  the district court  determined the  GSR\n\nbased  on the quantity of drugs involved in all the transactions,\n\nincluding amounts related to the  dropped charges.  The  quantity\n\ntherefore was  330.58 grams,  which resulted  in  a base  offense\n\nlevel of 22.  United States  Sentencing Guidelines   2D1.1(c)(11)\n\n(Drug Quantity Table).  The judge adjusted the base offense level\n\ndownward   by  two  levels   for  acceptance  of  responsibility.\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1(a).  With an offense level of 20  and a criminal\n\nhistory category of  I, the GSR was 33  to 41 months.   The judge\n\nsentenced Reyes to 33 months.\n\n          On appeal,  Reyes contests the calculation  of the GSR,\n\narguing that he should  be sentenced based  on the 27.4 grams  of\n\ncocaine involved in the  January 27 transaction to which  he pled\n\nguilty.   Based on a 27.4 grams,  the base offense level would be\n\n14,   yielding  an  offense  level  of  12  after  reduction  for\n\n                               -5-\n\nacceptance of responsibility.   Reyes contends therefore that the\n\nGSR ought to have been 10 to 16 months.\n\n                                II\n                                  \n\n          For  the purposes of sentencing,  the key factor is the\n\nquantity of  drugs involved.   That quantity  is \"the sum  of the\n\ncharged  conduct to  which defendant  pleads plus  his 'relevant'\n\nuncharged  conduct.\"  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.  1990).  \"The drug  quantity is to be  derived from all\n\nacts  'that were  part of the  same course  of conduct  or common\n\nscheme or plan  as the offense of conviction.'\"  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nGarc a,  954  F.2d 12,  15 (1st  Cir.  1992) (quoting  U.S.S.G.  \n      \n\n1B1.3(a)(2)).  \"This court has repeatedly upheld the inclusion as\n\nrelevant conduct  of  acts  either not  charged  or  charged  but\n\ndropped.\"  Id. (citing cases).  In the case of jointly undertaken\n              \n\ncriminal  activity  (whether or  not  charged  as a  conspiracy),\n\nrelevant conduct includes all  acts reasonably foreseeable by the\n\ndefendant and committed in  furtherance of the jointly undertaken\n\nactivity.  U.S.S.G.   1B1.3, comment. (n.1); Castellone, 985 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 24; Garc a, 954 F.2d at  15.  To include disputed transactions\n             \n\nas relevant conduct, the government must prove by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence a sufficient nexus between the conduct underlying\n\nthe  dropped charges and the  offense of conviction.  Castellone,\n                                                                \n\n985 F.2d  at 24; United States  v. Sklar, 920 F.2d  107, 110 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1990).   We accord  considerable deference to  the district\n\ncourt's  determination that drug  transactions in dropped charges\n\nform part of the  same course of conduct as  counts of conviction\n\n                               -6-\n\nand, absent mistake of law, will set aside those findings only if\n\nclearly  erroneous.  Castellone, 985 F.2d at 24; Garc a, 954 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 15.\n\n          Reyes  contends that the government  did not prove by a\n\npreponderance  of the  evidence  a sufficient  nexus between  the\n\ncharges  of  convictions  and the  January  28,  February  1, and\n\nFebruary 10, 1992 transactions.  Reyes emphasizes that he was not\n\nphysically  present  during  these   transactions  and  that  the\n\ndistrict court found that Tav rez operated his own heroin concern\n\nwithout  Reyes'  participation.   Reyes  asserts  that, like  the\n\nheroin business, Tav rez was distributing cocaine  without Reyes'\n\nknowledge  and   in  furtherance  of   only  Tav rez'  individual\n\ninterests.\n\n          With respect to the February  1, and February 10,  1992\n\ndrug  deals, Reyes'  assertions are  ridiculous.  To  begin with,\n\nReyes indicated at the January 27, drug sale, to which Reyes pled\n\nguilty,  that  detective  Appollonia  could come  by  anytime  to\n\npurchase cocaine.  The natural inference is that Reyes operated a\n\ncocaine  distribution   business.    On   February  1,  detective\n\nAppollonia encountered  Reyes outside  Reyes'  61 Whipple  Street\n\naddress,  and asked to purchase cocaine.   Reyes asked Appollonia\n\nto  return  later  when the  cocaine  arrived.    Reyes left  the\n\nbuilding and returned.   Moments later, Appollonia entered Reyes'\n\nsecond floor apartment and purchased cocaine from Tav rez.  Reyes\n\nwas  not observed leaving the building.  The district judge could\n\nfairly infer that Reyes  had brought the cocaine back  to Whipple\n\n                               -7-\n\nStreet, allowing Tav rez to conduct the actual sale.\n\n          The  February 10  transaction  is  similarly linked  to\n\nReyes.     Although  the  drug  buy   involved  a  different  law\n\nenforcement agent, Botelho, and  occurred at a different address,\n\n1455 Mineral Street, Tav rez drove a vehicle  registered to Reyes\n\nto Reyes' apartment; returned with Reyes to Mineral Street, where\n\nthe  two observed  Botelho's  vehicle and  the surrounding  area;\n\nagain returned  to Whipple  Street with Reyes;  and finally  went\n\nback to Mineral Street to sell Botelho the cocaine.   This series\n\nof  actions supports an inference  that Tav rez had  to clear the\n\nsale  with Reyes,  that  the two  conducted  an investigation  of\n\nMineral  Street before  proceeding, and  that Reyes  provided the\n\ncocaine from the Whipple Street address.\n\n          The  evidence   connecting  Reyes  to  the  January  28\n\ntransaction admittedly is less  convincing.  When considered with\n\nthe  three other drug deals, however, we cannot conclude that the\n\ndistrict court's  inclusion of this evidence  as relevant conduct\n\nwas clearly erroneous.  The  other three transactions support the\n\ninference  that  Tav rez and  Reyes  worked  closely together  on\n\ncocaine  sales  and  that Reyes  was  the  supplier.   Given  the\n\nreconnaissance mission  during the  February 10 transaction,  the\n\nvisit  paid to the parking lot at  Mineral Street by Reyes in his\n\nBMW and the grey Oldsmobile during the January 28 deal would also\n\nappear to be surveillance.   The district court could  reasonably\n\ninfer  from  all the  evidence  that the  conduct  underlying the\n\ndropped charges formed part of the same course of conduct.  As we\n\n                               -8-\n\nmade clear in United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499,  508 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990),  \"where there  is  more than  one  plausible view  of  the\n\ncircumstances,  the sentencing  court's choice  among supportable\n\nalternatives cannot  be clearly  erroneous.\"  The  district court\n\ntherefore was entitled to include the quantities  of cocaine from\n\nall the transactions when determining the GSR.\n\n          Finding no clear error, we affirm.\n                                           \n\n                               -9-\n",

Appollonia returned at 6:07 p.m. and met Tavarez in the second floor apartment.  Reyes was not present.  Tavarez left the apartment and returned with 54.9 grams of cocaine.  Appollonia inquired whether Reyes had informed Tavarez that the price was set at $1,700, representing the quantity discount previously negotiated.  Tavarez indicated that Reyes had done so.

Tavarez again met with Botelho and claimed that he would have to go to South Providence to obtain the cocaine.  Tavarez departed a second time, and the Toyota and Reyes' BMW went to 61 Whipple Street.  DEA agents observed Tavarez, Reyes and an unidentified man entering the building.  Tavarez then returned to Mineral Street with 124.1 grams of cocaine.  Botelho alerted other agents and Tavarez was arrested.

Secs. 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.  Count five charged Reyes and Tavarez possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it on February 10, 1992, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.

The quantity therefore was 330.58 grams, which resulted in a base offense level of 22.  United States Sentencing Guidelines Sec. 2D1.1(c)(11) (Drug Quantity Table).  The judge adjusted the base offense level downward by two levels for acceptance of responsibility.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a).  With an offense level of 20 and a criminal history category of I, the GSR was 33 to 41 months.

Based on a 27.4 grams, the base offense level would be 14, yielding an offense level of 12 after reduction for acceptance of responsibility.

In the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity (whether or not charged as a conspiracy), relevant conduct includes all acts reasonably foreseeable by the defendant and committed in furtherance of the jointly undertaken activity.

To include disputed transactions as relevant conduct, the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence a sufficient nexus between the conduct underlying the dropped charges and the offense of conviction.  Castellone, 985 F.2d at 24;  United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.1990).  We accord considerable deference to the district court's determination that drug transactions in dropped charges form part of the same course of conduct as counts of conviction and, absent mistake of law, will set aside those findings only if clearly erroneous.  Castellone, 985 F.2d at 24;  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes contends that the government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence a sufficient nexus between the charges of convictions and the January 28, February 1, and February 10, 1992 transactions.  Reyes emphasizes that he was not physically present during these transactions and that the district court found that Tavarez operated his own heroin concern without Reyes' participation.  Reyes asserts that, like the heroin business, Tavarez was distributing cocaine without Reyes' knowledge and in furtherance of only Tavarez' individual interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the February 1, and February 10, 1992 drug deals, Reyes' assertions are ridiculous.  To begin with, Reyes indicated at the January 27, drug sale, to which Reyes pled guilty, that detective Appollonia could come by anytime to purchase cocaine.  The natural inference is that Reyes operated a cocaine distribution business.  On February 1, detective Appollonia encountered Reyes outside Reyes' 61 Whipple Street address, and asked to purchase cocaine.  Reyes asked Appollonia to return later when the cocaine arrived.  Reyes left the building and returned.  Moments later, Appollonia entered Reyes' second floor apartment and purchased cocaine from Tavarez.  Reyes was not observed leaving the building.  The district judge could fairly infer that Reyes had brought the cocaine back to Whipple Street, allowing Tavarez to conduct the actual sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The February 10 transaction is similarly linked to Reyes.  Although the drug buy involved a different law enforcement agent, Botelho, and occurred at a different address, 1455 Mineral Street, Tavarez drove a vehicle registered to Reyes to Reyes' apartment;  returned with Reyes to Mineral Street, where the two observed Botelho's vehicle and the surrounding area;  again returned to Whipple Street with Reyes;  and finally went back to Mineral Street to sell Botelho the cocaine.  This series of actions supports an inference that Tavarez had to clear the sale with Reyes, that the two conducted an investigation of Mineral Street before proceeding, and that Reyes provided the cocaine from the Whipple Street address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence connecting Reyes to the January 28 transaction admittedly is less convincing.  When considered with the three other drug deals, however, we cannot conclude that the district court's inclusion of this evidence as relevant conduct was clearly erroneous.  The other three transactions support the inference that Tavarez and Reyes worked closely together on cocaine sales and that Reyes was the supplier.  Given the reconnaissance mission during the February 10 transaction, the visit paid to the parking lot at Mineral Street by Reyes in his BMW and the grey Oldsmobile during the January 28 deal would also appear to be surveillance.  The district court could reasonably infer from all the evidence that the conduct underlying the dropped charges formed part of the same course of conduct.  As we made clear in United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990), \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\"   The district court therefore was entitled to include the quantities of cocaine from all the transactions when determining the GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no clear error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The two men proceeded to a second floor apartment where they met Reyes.  Electric Company records indicate that Reyes leased the apartment.  Once inside, Tavarez produced a bag containing 27.4 grams of cocaine from the bathroom;  Reyes and Appollonia negotiated the price of this transaction and a quantity discount for a future sale of two ounces of cocaine.  Appollonia then inquired if he could purchase the two ounces on Wednesday and Reyes told Appollonia to come by at anytime.  The transaction concluded when Appollonia paid Reyes $900 for the 27.4 grams and Reyes counted the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, January 28, 1992, DEA Special Agent Botelho met Tavarez at 1455 Mineral Spring Avenue in North Providence.  Tavarez brought Botelho to apartment sixteen where they met a man known as \"Tony.\"   Tavarez gave Botelho 124 grams of cocaine and Botelho paid him $3,100.  Shortly after Botelho entered the building on Mineral Street, DEA agents observed Reyes drive his BMW, accompanied by a grey Oldsmobile, from his 61 Whipple Street address to the building on Mineral Street.  When the two vehicles arrived, the Oldsmobile proceeded to the rear of the building.  Reyes parked nearby, exited his vehicle, walked around the parking lot adjacent to the Mineral Street building, and returned to his car where he waited.  Shortly before the transaction between Botelho and Tavarez was completed, Reyes and the Oldsmobile departed the area and returned to 61 Whipple Street.
