Scarpaci  contends that  the district\n\ncourt improperly  enhanced his  sentence for obstruction  of jus-\n\ntice.  Gawlowicz claims that  the court mistakenly believed  that\n\nit  lacked authority  to  depart below  the Guideline  Sentencing\n\nRange  (GSR).  Finding no  merit in their  contentions, we affirm\n\nthe district court judgments.\n\n          Scarpaci  and  Gawlowicz  were associated  with  United\n\nStates Funding  (USF), a  mortgage  broker which  was engaged  in\n\nfinding  and  providing  mortgage  financing  for   USF  clients.\n\nScarpaci  founded USF and served as its president and sole stock-\n\nholder throughout its  existence.  Gawlowicz was employed by USF.\n\nUSF  engaged in various  types of fraud:   falsifying information\n\npertaining to  the financial condition of borrowers and the value\n\nof their collateral; paying  kickbacks to an officer of  a finan-\n\ncial institution which purchased  loans from USF; preparing false\n\nfinancial statements  relating to USF itself;  and kiting checks.\n\nScarpaci was involved in all aspects of USF's fraudulent  activi-\n\nties.  Gawlowicz helped prepare numerous false appraisals for use\n\nby USF.  \n\n          On  appeal,  Scarpaci challenges  the  two-point upward\n\nadjustment  imposed for  obstructing justice.   See  U.S.S.G.   -\r                                                             \n\n3C1.1.1    Although  Scarpaci  concedes  that  USF  records  were\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Scarpaci  has withdrawn  a  claim that  the district  court\nerred in combining upward adjustments under U.S.S.G.    2F1.1(b)-\n(2) (more than minimal planning) and U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(a) (manage-\n\n                                3\r\n\ndestroyed, he argues that  there was no proper basis  for finding\n\nthat he  caused their  destruction with  intent to  obstruct jus-\n\ntice.2  We  review the  sentencing court's findings  of fact  for\n\nclear error.   United States v.  Figaro, 935 F.2d 4,  8 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \n\n1991).  \n\n          The  presentence  report  (PSR)  states  that  Scarpaci\n\ninstructed Stephen Wilson  to destroy USF  documents in order  to\n\nimpede the  criminal investigation.  Scarpaci  did not contradict\n\nthis proposed PSR finding,  but merely responded that he  had \"no\n\npresent recollection\" of such an instruction.  Thus, the district\n\ncourt finding that Scarpaci obstructed justice was supportable on\n\nuncontroverted information related in the PSR.  See United States\r                                                                           \n\nv.  Blanco, 888  F.2d 907,  908-09 (1st  Cir.  1989) (defendant's\r                    \n\nfailure to dispute truth of  statement provided proper basis  for\n\nfinding).\n\n          Gawlowicz  attempts to  challenge the  district court's\n\ndecision not to depart below the GSR.  Unless  the district court\n\nmisapprehended its  authority to make such  a departure, however,\n\n                    \r                              \n\nrial  role in offense).  See United  States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d 15,\r                                                              \n17-18  (1st Cir.  1994) (holding  these adjustments  not mutually\nexclusive).\n\n     2Scarpaci  further  argues that  there  could  have been  no\nobstruction of  justice because the information  in the destroyed\nUSF records was readily obtainable by the government, and that he\ndid  not give  instructions  to destroy  the  documents with  the\nintent of obstructing any investigation.  Aside from the problem-\natic assumptions  upon which these claims  are premised, Scarpaci\nneglected to surface either contention before the district court.\nAs neither  argument was  raised below, both  are deemed  waived.\nUnited States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                \n\n                                4\r\n\nwe have no jurisdiction to review its departure decision.  United\r                                                                           \n\nStates v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                          \n\n          Gawlowicz cited three alleged grounds for the departure\n\nrequest:  his minimal role in the offense, the need to \"equalize\"\n\nsentences among codefendants, and  economic duress.  Although the\n\ncourt approved  a  four-point  downward  adjustment  pursuant  to\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.2, due to Gawlowicz' minimal  role in the offense,\n\nit declined to depart below the  GSR.  Gawlowicz insists that the\n\ncourt's comments  at sentencing evince a  misunderstanding of its\n\nauthority,  under United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942 (1st Cir.\r                                                   \n\n1993), to depart downward:\n\n          THE COURT:  Let  me say this:  I  don't think\r                             \n          as  a matter of law that I can [depart] here.\n          If I  am wrong  and you  want to appeal  that\n          point, maybe I  will get  some guidance  from\n          you on appeal.  I think as a  matter of law I\n          may not do what you suggest.\n\nThe sentencing  hearing transcript  as a whole  reveals, however,\n\nthat  the court  fully  appreciated the  bounds of  its departure\n\nauthority  but concluded that departure  was not warranted in the\n\ncircumstances of  this  case.3   The  court was  conversant  with\n                    \r                              \n\n     3In rejecting the departure request, the court stated:\n\n          I  don't  think this  is  that  kind of  cir-\r                                                                 \n          cumstance.  There are cases that go the other\r                             \n          way  that are quite specific  . . .   But, on\n          the  other hand,  there  is always  a ray  of\n          light.  I don't see that in this case . . . I\r                                                         \n          have Riviera [sic] . . .  I thought it was an\r                                \n          excellent  opinion, and  it provides  us with\n          more  guidance than  we have  had up  to this\n          point, and  if more  is coming, that  is very\n          well.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n                                5\r\n\nRivera  and related case law, as well  as the Guidelines.

Scarpaci contends that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence for obstruction of justice.  Gawlowicz claims that the court mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to depart below the Guideline Sentencing Range (GSR).  Finding no merit in their contentions, we affirm the district court judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scarpaci and Gawlowicz were associated with United States Funding (USF), a mortgage broker which was engaged in finding and providing mortgage financing for USF clients.  Scarpaci founded USF and served as its president and sole stockholder throughout its existence.  Gawlowicz was employed by USF.  USF engaged in various types of fraud:  falsifying information pertaining to the financial condition of borrowers and the value of their collateral;  paying kickbacks to an officer of a financial institution which purchased loans from USF;  preparing false financial statements relating to USF itself;  and kiting checks.  Scarpaci was involved in all aspects of USF's fraudulent activities.  Gawlowicz helped prepare numerous false appraisals for use by USF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Scarpaci challenges the two-point upward adjustment imposed for obstructing justice.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Although Scarpaci concedes that USF records were destroyed, he argues that there was no proper basis for finding that he caused their destruction with intent to obstruct justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We review the sentencing court's findings of fact for clear error.   United States v. Figaro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562319\"><a href=\"/opinion/562319/united-states-v-porfirio-johnson-figaro/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (PSR) states that Scarpaci instructed Stephen Wilson to destroy USF documents in order to impede the criminal investigation.  Scarpaci did not contradict this proposed PSR finding, but merely responded that he had \"no present recollection\" of such an instruction.  Thus, the district court finding that Scarpaci obstructed justice was supportable on uncontroverted information related in the PSR.  See United States v. Blanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531324\"><a href=\"/opinion/531324/united-states-v-alfonso-blanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 908-09 (1st Cir. 1989) (defendant's failure to dispute truth of statement provided proper basis for finding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gawlowicz attempts to challenge the district court's decision not to depart below the GSR. Unless the district court misapprehended its authority to make such a departure, however, we have no jurisdiction to review its departure decision.   United States v. Romolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563790\"><a href=\"/opinion/563790/united-states-v-christopher-j-romolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gawlowicz cited three alleged grounds for the departure request:  his minimal role in the offense, the need to \"equalize\" sentences among codefendants, and economic duress.  Although the court approved a four-point downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2, due to Gawlowicz' minimal role in the offense, it declined to depart below the GSR. Gawlowicz insists that the court's comments at sentencing evince a misunderstanding of its authority, under  United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1993), to depart downward:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Let me say this:  I don't think as a matter of law that I can [depart] here.  If I am wrong and you want to appeal that point, maybe I will get some guidance from you on appeal.  I think as a matter of law I may not do what you suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing hearing transcript as a whole reveals, however, that the court fully appreciated the bounds of its departure authority but concluded that departure was not warranted in the circumstances of this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The court was conversant with Rivera and related case law, as well as the Guidelines.  Two of the grounds upon which Gawlowicz based his departure request-equalization of sentences and economic duress-are forbidden grounds for departure.   See United States v. Wogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1448 (1st Cir.)
