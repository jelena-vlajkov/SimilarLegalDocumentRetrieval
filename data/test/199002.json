This is primarily a declaratory\n\njudgment action in which a firearms distributor sought a determination\n\nthat it was entitled to defense and/or indemnity from its insurance\n\ncarrier under its general liability policies for civil actions brought\n\nby or on behalf of gunshot victims on a general theory that several\n\nfirearm distributors had negligently, willfully, knowingly, and\n\nrecklessly flooded the firearms market. The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the insurance carrier holding that the\n\n\"products-completed operations hazard\" exclusion provision applied to\n\nthe civil actions, thereby precluding coverage. See Brazas Sporting\n\nArms, Inc. v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 59 F. Supp. 2d\n\n223, 225-26 (D. Mass. 1999).      Because we agree with the district\n\ncourt's interpretation of the exclusion provision, and for the\n\nadditional reasons discussed below, we affirm the grant of summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n            Between 1992 and 1997, appellee American Empire Surplus Lines\n\nInsurance Company, a Delaware corporation, issued three identical\n\n\"commercial general liability\" policies to appellant Brazas Sporting\n\nArms, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation. Brazas's policies contained\n\nthe following endorsement that altered the standard policy agreement:\n\n\"This insurance does not apply to 'bodily injury' or 'property damage'\n\nincluded within the 'products-completed operations hazard.'\" Products-\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fcompleted operations hazard includes \"all 'bodily injury' and 'property\n\ndamage' occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of\n\n'your product' or 'your work' except: (1) Products that are still in\n\nyour physical possession; or (2) Work that had not yet been completed\n\nor abandoned.\"    \"Your product\" is defined as,\n\n          a. Any goods or products, other than real\n          property,   manufactured,  sold, handled,\n          distributed or disposed of by:\n\n          (1) You;\n\n          (2) Others trading under your name; or\n\n          (3) A person or organization whose business or\n          assets you have acquired . . . .\n\n          . . .\n\n          'Your Product' includes:\n\n          a. Warranties or representations made at any time\n          with respect to the fitness, quality, durability,\n          performance or use of 'your product'; and\n\n          b. The providing of or failure to provide\n          warnings or instructions.\"\n\n\"Your work\" means:\n\n          a. Work or operations performed by you or on\n          your behalf . . . .\n\n          . . .\n\n          'Your work' includes:\n\n          a. Warranties or representations made at any time\n          with respect to the fairness, quality,\n          durability, performance or use of 'your work';\n          and\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          b. The providing of or failure to provide\n          warnings or instructions.\n\n          In 1995, Brazas discovered that it had been named as a\n\ndefendant in litigation pending in the Eastern District of New York.\n\nIt subsequently learned that it was named as a defendant in an\n\nadditional law suit. Both lawsuits charged Brazas and various other\n\nmanufacturers and dealers of handguns, as well as industry trade\n\ngroups, with liability for contributing to market overflow.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuits alleged that:\n\n          Defendants have knowingly produced and\n          distributed handguns in excess of the reasonable\n          demand by responsible consumers in the lawful\n          national handgun market, and they have knowingly\n          failed or refused to take any meaningful steps to\n          regulate and control the distribution and sale of\n          their guns by retail dealers. Their willfully\n          negligent conduct - individually and as an\n          industry - has created and supplied an unlawful\n          national market in firearms, the source of the\n          handguns that killed and wounded plaintiffs and\n          their loved ones.\n\nNotably, the lawsuits did not identify any particular guns sold by\n\nBrazas as the cause of injury to any particular plaintiffs. By the\n\ntime the district court entered judgment, one of the cases had gone to\n\ntrial, and Brazas had eventually been dismissed. See Hamilton v. Accu-\n\nTek, No. C.V. 95-0049 (E.D.N.Y. 1995). Brazas has incurred in excess\n\nof $75,000 in defense costs in connection with the litigation.\n\n          At least some of the claims alleged in the lawsuits occurred\n\nduring the effective period of the American Empire policies. However,\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fupon notice, American Empire denied coverage and refused to defend\n\nBrazas. As a result, Brazas brought this declaratory judgment action\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\nunder that court's diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332.\n\nBrazas also brought a claim under the Massachusetts consumer protection\n\nstatute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, ยง 11.      The parties filed cross\n\nmotions for summary judgment. Brazas appeals from the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment for American Empire and the denial of\n\nBrazas's motion for partial summary judgment on its duty to defend\n\nclaim.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.   The Policy Coverage Claim\n\n          We review de novo the district court's interpretation of the\n\ninsurance contracts. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Merchants Ins. Co. of New\n\nHampshire, Inc. v. United States Fidelity & Guar. Co., 143 F.3d 5, 6-8\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); GRE Ins. Group v. Metropolitan Boston Hous.\n\nPartnership, Inc., 61 F.3d 79, 81 (1st Cir. 1995). Under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, we construe an insurance policy under the general rules of\n\ncontract interpretation. See Merchants, 143 F.3d at 8 (citing Hakim v.\n\nMassachusetts Insurers' Insolvency Fund, 675 N.E.2d 1161, 1164 (Mass.\n\n1997)). We begin with the actual language of the policies, given its\n\nplain and ordinary meaning. See GRE Ins. Group, 61 F.3d at 81 (citing\n\ncases). In so doing, we \"consider 'what an objectively reasonable\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\finsured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be\n\ncovered.'\" Id. (quoting Trustees of Tufts Univ. v. Commercial Union\n\nIns. Co., 616 N.E.2d 68, 72 (Mass. 1993)).\n\n          As a liability insurer in Massachusetts, American Empire has\n\na duty to defend Brazas if the allegations in the New York litigation\n\nare \"reasonably susceptible\" to an interpretation that they state a\n\nclaim covered by Brazas's policy. Merchants, 143 F.3d at 8 (quoting\n\nNew England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 667 N.E.2d\n\n295, 297 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996) (internal quotations omitted)); see also\n\nMt. Airy Ins. Co. v. Greenbaum, 127 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 458 N.E.2d 338 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1983)).   Under Massachusetts law, the duty to defend is\n\nbroader than, and independent of, the duty to indemnify.           See\n\nMerchants, 143 F.3d at 8 (citing Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. v.\n\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 545 N.E.2d 1156, 1158 (Mass. 1989));\n\nMillipore Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 115 F.3d 21, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (citing same). That is, the obligation to defend turns on the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint rather than the facts proven at trial.\n\nSee Millipore, 115 F.3d at 35; see also GRE Ins. Group, 61 F.3d at 81.\n\n          A liability insurer has no duty to defend a claim that is\n\nspecifically excluded from coverage, but the insurer bears the burden\n\nof establishing the applicability of any exclusion. See Mt. Airy, 127\n\nF.3d at 19 (citing Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co. v. Hercules Bldg. &\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fWrecking Co., 619 N.E.2d 353 (Mass. App. Ct. 1993)); GRE Ins. Group, 61\n\nF.3d at 81 (citing Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 568\n\nN.E.2d 631, 633 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991)).         Consistent with the\n\nMassachusetts general rule favoring insureds in policy interpretation,\n\nany ambiguities in the exclusion provision are strictly construed\n\nagainst the insurer. See Mt. Airy, 127 F.3d at 19 (citing Sterilite,\n\n458 N.E.2d 338); GRE Ins. Group, 61 F.3d at 81; see also Hakim, 675\n\nN.E.2d at 1165 (holding that \"[t]his rule of construction applies with\n\nparticular force to exclusionary provisions\"). Ambiguity exists when\n\nthe policy language is susceptible to more than one rational\n\ninterpretation. See Merchants, 143 F.3d at 8 (citing Boston Symphony\n\nOrchestra, 545 N.E.2d at 1169); Mt. Airy, 127 F.3d at 19 (citing\n\nJefferson Ins. Co. of New York v. Holyoke, 503 N.E.2d 474 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1987)).   But it does not follow that ambiguity exists solely\n\nbecause the parties disagree as to the provision's meaning.        See\n\nContinental Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 370, 374\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Before the district court, and on appeal, American Empire's\n\nposition is that the products-completed operations hazard exclusion\n\nexcludes coverage for all injuries arising from Brazas's products, off\n\npremises, regardless of the circumstances. Brazas contends that such\n\na reading of the exclusion provision would render the general liability\n\npolicy meaningless. Brazas challenged summary judgment on two grounds:\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f(1) the products-completed operations hazard exclusion was intended to\n\napply to defective products only, and (2) the New York civil actions do\n\nnot actually allege injuries from Brazas's products, but rather\n\ninjuries caused by the company's business management and strategy,\n\nthereby rendering the exclusion provision inapplicable.\n\n            The district court rejected the appellant's arguments. The\n\ncourt held that the language of the exclusion provision did not support\n\na reading that would limit the exclusion to injuries from defective\n\nproducts.    Additionally, the court concluded that \"[o]nly by a\n\ndistortion of language and logic can plaintiff suggest that the\n\ninjuries sued upon do not 'arise from' the distribution of Brazas\n\nproducts, off Brazas premises.\" Brazas, 59 F. Supp. 2d at 226. We\n\ntake up each of the appellant's arguments in turn.\n\n            A.   Defective Products\n\n            The appellant posits that the \"pivotal issue\" of the case is\n\n\"whether the exclusion is meant to bar more than product liability\n\nclaims.\"1 Appellant's Brief at 15. It suggests that in the scheme of\n\n\n\n1 The parties and the case law use the terms \"products liability\" and\n\"defective products\" interchangeably in the context of the products-\ncompleted operations hazard exclusion. However, these terms are not\ncoterminous, and it is at least arguable that the New York law suits\nare a variety of a products liability action. Because such an\nunderstanding of products liability is antithetical to the appellant's\nargument, for purposes of this discussion, we will assume that the New\nYork cases are not products liability actions. And to avoid further\nconfusion, we will only use the term defective products for the\nremainder of this opinion.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthe commercial general liability policy as a whole the general risks of\n\ndoing business should be protected, and, therefore, the exclusion\n\nprovision should be limited to defective products claims. Moreover,\n\nthe appellant argues, a reasonable insured would interpret the\n\nprovision as applying to defective products only.\n\n          Unfortunately, we have no guidance from Massachusetts courts\n\non this issue.    Indeed numerous other courts have read similar\n\nexclusion provisions to be defective products exclusions,2 but there is\n\ncontrary authority from courts finding such a reading to be beyond the\n\ntext of the exclusion.3\n\n\n2 See, e.g., Scarborough v. Northern Assurance Co. of America, 718 F.2d\n130, 136 (5th Cir. 1983) (negligent failure to warn); Farm Bureau Mut.\nIns. Co. of Arkansas, Inc. v. Lyon, 528 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Ark. 1975)\n(negligent sale of gun powder to minors); McGinnis v. Fidelity & Cas.\nCo. of New York, 276 Cal. App. 2d 15, 17-18 (Cal. Ct. App. 1969)\n(negligent sale of gun powder to minors); ADA Resources v. Don Chamblin\n& Assocs., 361 So.2d 1339, 1343 (La. Ct. App. 1978) (sale of defective\njoint fits within exclusion provision); Lessak v. Metropolitan Cas.\nIns. Co. of New York, 151 N.E.2d 730, 734-35 (Ohio 1958) (negligent\nsale of BB gun to minor); Hartford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Moorhead, 578 A.2d\n492, 495-96 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1990) (negligent failure to warn); General\nIns. Co. of America v. Crawford, 635 S.W.2d 98, 102 (Tenn. 1982)\n(negligent sale of products); Colony Ins. Co. v. H.R.K., Inc., 728\nS.W.2d 848, 851 (Tex. App. 1987) (wrongful death action arising out of\nsuicide with gun sold by insured).\n3 See, e.g., Cobbins v. General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp.,\n290 N.E.2d 873, 877 (Ill. 1972) (negligent sale of fireworks to minor);\nPennsylvania Gen. Ins. Co. v. Kielon, 492 N.Y.S.2d 502, 503-04 (N.Y.\nApp. Div. 1985) (negligent sale of gunpowder to minor).\n\n  We agree with the appellant that two of the cases upon which the\ndistrict court and the appellee rely, Rhinebeck Bicycle Shop, Inc. v.\nSterling Insurance Co., 546 N.Y.S.2d 499 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989), and New\nYork Casualty Insurance Co. v. Halley Electric Co., 539 N.Y.S.2d 204,\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          We agree with the district court that the latter line of case\n\nlaw is more persuasive. First, we observe that many of the courts that\n\nhave held that a products-completed operations hazard exclusion\n\nprovision was, in effect, a defective products exclusion were\n\nconsidering provisions that contained materially different language\n\nfrom the provision in American Empire's policies. Second, and more\n\nsignificant, in order to limit the American Empire exclusion provision\n\nto defective products, we would need to read into the text a\n\nrequirement that is simply not there.        The products-completed\n\noperations hazard includes in plain and unambiguous language \"all\n\n'bodily injury' and 'property damage' occurring away from premises you\n\nown or rent and arising out of 'your product.'\" Where, as here, the\n\nlanguage of the exclusion provision is unambiguous, the text should be\n\ngiven its plain meaning.    In this case, the plain meaning of the\n\nexclusion is that it applies to all product-related injuries. See\n\nCobbins, 290 N.E.2d at 877. Although we take into account the likely\n\nunderstanding of a reasonable insured, we may not read into the\n\nprovision a condition or language that is not present. See Hakim, 675\n\nN.E.2d at 1164-65. Nor are we sure that in the context of Brazas's\n\n\n\n205 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989), are inapposite. In those cases, the\nplaintiffs alleged injuries that resulted from negligent assembly or\nmanufacture -- i.e. defective products -- and therefore, the fact that\nthose courts applied the product hazard exclusion under those\ncircumstances sheds no light on the applicability of the provision to\na negligent sale type of case.\n\n                                -10-\n\factual business as a distributor, rather than a manufacturer, a\n\nreasonable insured would read the exclusion to refer to defective\n\nproducts. Consequently, we are convinced that the exclusion clause\n\ndoes not limit itself to injuries that arise out of defective products.\n\n          B.   \"Arising out of\"\n\n          The second issue -- whether the New York civil actions state\n\nclaims for injuries that \"arise out of\" Brazas products -- is a much\n\ncloser case. We have before us Brazas, an insured who purchased a\n\ncommercial general liability policy, arguably with the intent of\n\ncovering the general risks of doing business. See Western Alliance\n\nIns. Co. v. Gill, 686 N.E.2d 997, 1000-01 (Mass. 1997). However, an\n\nexclusion provision in the policy explicitly denies coverage for all\n\ninjuries \"arising out of\" the insured's products, products which are\n\ninherently dangerous. Subsequently, a civil action is brought for\n\nwrongful injuries allegedly resulting from Brazas's saturation of the\n\nmarket with its products. However, the plaintiffs, who were directly\n\ninjured by products from that market (or an underground market),\n\nthrough intervening intentional wrongdoing, do not claim that any of\n\nBrazas's products were involved in their specific injuries. We must\n\ntherefore determine whether it is legally significant that the\n\nunderlying civil action alleges that the injury was caused by the\n\nappellant's conduct and not the appellant's products.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          On the one hand, Massachusetts case law instructs that the\n\nterm \"arising out of\" should be broadly construed and additionally\n\ndirects our attention to the source of the underlying injury rather\n\nthan the theory of liability alleged in the complaint. See, e.g.,\n\nBagley v. Monticello Ins. Co., 720 N.E.2d 813, 816-17 (Mass. 1999). On\n\nthe other hand, at least some Massachusetts courts recognize a separate\n\ninjury arising out of the insured's negligence independent of the\n\nproximate cause of harm, see, e.g., Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marnell,\n\n496 N.E.2d 158, 161 (Mass. 1986), which taken together with\n\nMassachusetts general policy favoring insureds in interpreting\n\ninsurance contracts, see GRE Ins. Group, 61 F.3d at 81, suggests a\n\nnarrow reading of the exclusion provision. Traditional considerations,\n\nsuch as parties' expectations, see Western Alliance, 686 N.E.2d at\n\n1000-01, shed no further light on the issue because neither party would\n\nhave foreseen this type of lawsuit when they entered into the policy\n\nagreement.\n\n          Faced with these conflicting principles of construction, and\n\nin the absence of a definitive answer from Massachusetts courts, we\n\nfocus our inquiry on the text of the exclusion provision.          The\n\nproducts-completed operations hazard exclusion applies to \"all 'bodily\n\ninjury' . . . arising out of '[Brazas's] product.'\"              Under\n\nMassachusetts law, \"arising out of\" \"indicates a wider range of\n\ncausation than the concept of proximate causation in tort law.\"\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fRischitelli v. Safety Ins. Co., 671 N.E.2d 1243, 1245 (Mass. 1996),\n\nquoted in Merchants, 143 F.3d at 9; see also Mt. Airy, 127 F.3d at 20;\n\nBagley, 720 N.E.2d at 816. In other words, it falls somewhere between\n\nproximate and \"but for\" causation -- an intermediate causation\n\nstandard. See Merchants, 143 F.3d at 9-10; Rischitelli, 671 N.E.2d at\n\n1245; see also Bagley, 720 N.E.2d at 816 (observing that many cases\n\ninterpret the term as much more analogous to \"but for\" causation). It\n\nis generally understood to mean \"originating from,\" \"growing out of,\"\n\n\"flowing from,\" \"incident to,\" or \"having connection with.\"        See\n\nMerchants, 143 F.3d at 9; Mt. Airy, 127 F.3d at 20; New England Mut.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 667 N.E.2d at 298 (citing Webster's Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 117 (1981)); see also Continental Cas. Co. v.\n\nCity of Richmond, 763 F.2d 1076, 1080 (9th Cir. 1985) (listing similar\n\nvariations of \"arising out of\" to illustrate that phrase is broader\n\nthan \"caused by\").\n\n          In interpreting the phrase \"arising out of\" in the context\n\nof the case at hand, we are compelled by Massachusetts law to consider\n\nthe \"source from which the plaintiff's personal injury originates\n\nrather than the specific theories of liability alleged in the complaint\n\n[of the underlying civil action].\" Bagley, 720 N.E.2d at 817 (quoting\n\nNew England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 667 N.E.2d at 299). Thus, in this\n\ncase, firearms were the immediate source of the plaintiffs' injuries,\n\nand the fact that the plaintiffs, to reach the deep pockets of the\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\ffirearms industry, contrived a theory of liability that targeted Brazas\n\nfor its alleged participation in flooding the firearms market cannot\n\naffect the application of the exclusion provision. See id. at 816-17;\n\nUnited Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Parish, 717 N.E.2d 1016, 1018-19 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1999).\n\n          The appellant correctly asserts that under Massachusetts law\n\nan act of negligence can create a separate legal injury that does not\n\narise out of the product. However, the primary cases upon which the\n\nappellant relies for this proposition, Rischitelli v. Safety Insurance\n\nCo., 671 N.E.2d 1243 (Mass. 1996), and Worcester Mutual Insurance Co.\n\nv. Marnell, 496 N.E.2d 158 (Mass. 1986), are readily distinguishable.\n\n          In Rischitelli, the plaintiff was the victim of road rage --\n\nafter a car accident, he was physically attacked by the driver of the\n\nother car. As an insured under a standard automobile insurance policy,\n\nthe plaintiff sought to recover benefits. The policy afforded coverage\n\nfor \"'bodily injury . . . arising out of the ownership, maintenance or\n\nuse of an auto.'\" Rischitelli, 671 N.E.2d at 1245. Although the issue\n\nbefore the court related to policy coverage rather than to an exclusion\n\nprovision, the court's construction of the expression \"arising out of\"\n\nis duly applicable to this case. The court recognized that the phrase\n\ndid not \"refer to all circumstances in which the injury would not have\n\noccurred 'but for' the involvement of a motor vehicle.\" Id. Instead,\n\nit observed, cases fall along a continuum depending on the causal\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fconnection between the injury and the automobile. See id. at 1245.\n\nFor instance, under a standard auto policy there was no coverage when\n\na plaintiff tripped on a rope that fell off a truck or when a plaintiff\n\nwas shot by the insured while seated in his automobile, but the sexual\n\nassault of a school bus passenger by the bus driver involved an injury\n\narising from the use of a motor vehicle. See id. (citing Perry v.\n\nChipouras, 66 N.E.2d 361 (Mass. 1946), Sabatinelli v. Travelers Ins.\n\nCo., 341 N.E.2d 880 (Mass. 1976), and Roe v. Lawn, 634 N.E.2d 117\n\n(Mass. 1994)). In these cases, the intervening act of violence broke\n\nthe chain of causation between the operation of the vehicles and the\n\ninjuries only where the violence was merely incidental to the use of\n\nthe vehicle. Consequently, the Rischitelli court concluded that the\n\nbattery was sufficiently independent of the motor vehicle accident that\n\nthe losses the plaintiff sustained arose from the intentional\n\nwrongdoing of the other driver and not from the use of an automobile.\n\nSee id. at 1246.\n\n          A variation of this independent causation analysis aided the\n\ncourt in Worcester Mutual Insurance Co. In that case, the underlying\n\ncomplaint alleged that the insureds' negligent supervision of a party\n\nheld at their residence was the proximate cause of an automobile\n\naccident that killed the plaintiff's intestate. See 496 N.E.2d at 159.\n\nThe insureds sought coverage for the wrongful death action under their\n\nhomeowners' insurance policy, but the policy had an exclusion for\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fbodily injury arising out of the ownership or use of a motor vehicle.\n\nSee id. The court concluded, however, that negligent supervision \"is\n\nseparate and distinct from the use or operation of an automobile.\" Id.\n\nat 161. The court reasoned that the allegations in the complaint,\n\nnamely, that the insureds had failed to prevent their son from\n\ndrinking, related solely to activities that took place in the home and\n\nthat, therefore, the insureds could reasonably expect to be protected\n\nby their homeowner's policy.      See id.\n\n          The court's reasoning in Worcester would at first glance seem\n\nto control the outcome in this case -- the New York civil actions\n\naccuse Brazas of making bad business decisions, conduct which takes\n\nplace on Brazas's premises, and, therefore, Brazas could reasonably\n\nexpect protection under its comprehensive general liability policy.\n\nHowever, unlike the circumstances in Worcester and Rischitelli, here\n\nthe two sources of injury are interdependent.       Brazas's alleged\n\nmisconduct is the over-distribution of firearms and the proximate cause\n\nof the plaintiffs' injuries are firearms, whereas in Worcester, the\n\nparents' negligent supervision of their son derived from their illegal\n\nand unsupervised provision of alcohol, not the automobile that was\n\nultimately the cause of the wrongful death. As the Worcester Court\n\nexplained, alternatively, a claim for negligent entrustment (of the\n\nautomobile), conduct which still occurred in the home, would\n\nnecessarily have been within the exclusion provision. See id. at 245-\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f46. Similarly, in Rischitelli the battery and the car accident were\n\nseparate and distinct events; the car accident merely preceded, and set\n\nthe context for, the battery. In contrast, Brazas's conduct, along\n\nwith the New York plaintiffs' claims, indisputably derived from\n\nfirearms. In other words, the company, in distributing its firearms,\n\nis allegedly negligent precisely because it created the risk of the\n\nexact kind of injuries suffered by the New York plaintiffs. See United\n\nNat'l Ins. Co., 717 N.E.2d at 1018-19; New England Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\n\n447 N.E.2d at 298-99; see also Continental Cas. Co., 763 F.2d at 1080-\n\n81.\n\n          Because the New York law suits concern off-premises conduct\n\narising out of (not merely incidentally related to) firearms products,\n\nBrazas is not entitled to defense or indemnity coverage as a result of\n\nthe products-completed operations hazard exclusion.\n\nII.   Unfair Trade Practice Claim\n\n          This Court can quickly dispose of Brazas's additional claim\n\nthat American Empire violated the Massachusetts consumer protection\n\nstatute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, ยง 11, because it is nothing more than\n\na reconfiguration of its coverage claim. Moreover, Brazas fails to\n\ndirect the Court to any evidence that would create a genuine issue of\n\nfact to support this claim.\n\n          The Massachusetts consumer protection statute provides a\n\nright of action to anyone who suffered a loss of money or property as\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fa result of an unfair or deceptive business practice. See Brown Daltas\n\n& Assocs. v. General Accident Ins. Co. of America, 844 F. Supp. 58, 67\n\n(D. Mass. 1994), rev'd on other grounds, 48 F.3d 30 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nIt generally protects consumers from unfair business practices that are\n\n\"immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; or within the bounds\n\nof some statutory, common-law or other established concept of\n\nunfairness.\" Ellis v. Safety Ins. Co., 672 N.E.2d 979, 986 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1996).\n\n          In this vein, Brazas contends that American Empire violated\n\nthe Massachusetts law that established the rules of fairness as to an\n\ninsurer's claims handling procedures, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, ยง\n\n3(9)(a), (n), and thereby violated chapter 93A. Specifically, the\n\nappellant charges American Empire with (1) misrepresenting pertinent\n\npolicy provisions and (2) failing to provide a reasonable explanation\n\nof the basis for denial of coverage. As an initial matter, a violation\n\nof chapter 176D is not automatically actionable under chapter 93A, ยง\n\n11, which provides a cause of action for business plaintiffs injured by\n\nunfair trade practices. See Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,\n\n610 N.E.2d 912, 197 (Mass. 1993); cf. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, ยง 9(1)\n\n(establishing right of action for consumer plaintiffs for violations of\n\nch. 176D, ยง 3(9)).   That said, conduct that violates ch. 176D may\n\nindependently be an unfair trade practice actionable under ch. 93A, ยง\n\n11. See Kiewit Constr. Co. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 878 F. Supp.\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f298, 301-02 (D. Mass. 1995). But we need not get distracted by the\n\ninterrelationship of the two statutes because the appellant utterly\n\nfails to develop this claim.\n\n          At its core, the appellant's misrepresentation argument is\n\nthat American Empire issued a policy called a \"general liability\"\n\npolicy, which, based on the broad scope of the products-completed\n\noperations hazard exclusion, is in fact only a premises liability\n\npolicy. Brazas does not allege, or point to any evidence, indicating\n\nthat American Empire made any misrepresentations when it issued the\n\npolicy, but argues only that the policy itself, in its own terms,\n\nmisrepresents its coverage -- that is, a comprehensive liability policy\n\nwould cover the New York civil actions because they arise from the\n\ngeneral risks of doing business. Despite the appellant's claim to the\n\ncontrary, this convoluted argument does not in itself create an issue\n\nof fact. We held above that the exclusion provision was not ambiguous\n\nand that, consequently, a reasonable insured would have understood that\n\nproduct-related injuries like those at issue in the New York civil\n\nactions would be excluded from coverage. Thus, as a matter of law the\n\npolicies are not misleading.\n\n          The appellant's claim that American Empire violated chapter\n\n176D because it did not provide a reasonable explanation for the denial\n\nof coverage is likewise unavailing. Again, Brazas does not point to\n\nany deficiency on the part of American Empire in its correspondence\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fwith Brazas.   Instead, Brazas argues that the       explanation was\n\ninadequate because American Empire \"chose to read the allegations in\n\nthe underlying New York actions in the manner most favorable to its\n\nposition.\" Appellant's Brief at 27. Not only has the appellant failed\n\nto articulate a tenable theory under chapter 176D, ยง 3(9), without\n\noffering any legal support, but, more important, we have concluded that\n\nAmerican Empire properly denied coverage and did not owe Brazas a duty\n\nto defend. Where as here, the insurer properly denied coverage, there\n\ncan be no violation of chapter 176D. See Spurlin v. Merchants Ins. Co.\n\nof New Hampshire, 866 F. Supp. 57, 62 (D. Mass. 1994).\n\n          As the appellant has failed to persuade the Court that\n\nAmerican Empire engaged in any conduct that rose to the level of\n\nunfairness as a matter of law, summary judgment was appropriate. See\n\nBrown Daltas & Assocs., 844 F. Supp. at 67-68.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          Because we conclude that the allegations raised in the New\n\nYork action arise out of Brazas's products and fall directly within the\n\nproducts-completed operations hazard exclusion in the general liability\n\npolicy, we hold that American Empire could reasonably have concluded\n\nthat the New York action was outside the scope of coverage and, thus,\n\nthat it owed Brazas no duty to defend. For similar reasons, this Court\n\nholds that the appellant's consumer protection claim is baseless.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fThus, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor\n\nof American Empire.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

It subsequently learned that it was named as a defendant in  an additional law suit.  Both lawsuits charged Brazas and various  other manufacturers and dealers of handguns, as well as industry  trade groups, with liability for contributing to market overflow. Specifically, the lawsuits alleged that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants have knowingly produced and  distributed handguns in excess of the  reasonable demand by responsible consumers in  the lawful national handgun market, and they  have knowingly failed or refused to take any  meaningful steps to regulate and control the  distribution and sale of their guns by retail  dealers.  Their willfully negligent conduct -  individually and as an industry - has created  and supplied an unlawful national market in  firearms, the source of the handguns that  killed and wounded plaintiffs and their loved  ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, the lawsuits did not identify any particular guns sold by  Brazas as the cause of injury to any particular plaintiffs.  By the  time the district court entered judgment, one of the cases had gone  to trial, and Brazas had eventually been dismissed. See Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, No. C.V. 95-0049 (E.D.N.Y. 1995).

However, upon notice, American Empire denied coverage  and refused to defend Brazas.  As a result, Brazas brought this  declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for  the District of Massachusetts under that court's diversity  jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332.  Brazas also brought a  claim under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 11.  The parties filed cross motions for  summary judgment.  Brazas appeals from the district court's grant  of summary judgment for American Empire and the denial of Brazas's  motion for partial summary judgment on its duty to defend claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  The Policy Coverage Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's interpretation of  the insurance contracts.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Merchants Ins.  Co. of New Hampshire, Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co.,  143 F.3d 5, 6-8 (1st Cir. 1998); GRE Ins. Group v. Metropolitan  Boston Hous. Partnership, Inc., 61 F.3d 79, 81 (1st Cir. 1995). Under Massachusetts law, we construe an insurance policy under the  general rules of contract interpretation.  See Merchants, 143 F.3d  at 8 (citing Hakim v. Massachusetts Insurers' Insolvency Fund, 675  N.E.2d 1161, 1164 (Mass. 1997)).  We begin with the actual language  of the policies, given its plain and ordinary meaning.  See GRE  Ins. Group, 61 F.3d at 81 (citing cases).  In so doing, we  \"consider 'what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the  relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.'\"  Id. (quoting Trustees of Tufts Univ. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 616  N.E.2d 68, 72 (Mass. 1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a liability insurer in Massachusetts, American Empire  has a duty to defend Brazas if the allegations in the New York  litigation are \"reasonably susceptible\" to an interpretation that  they state a claim covered by Brazas's policy.  Merchants, 143 F.3d  at 8 (quoting New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins.  Co., 667 N.E.2d 295, 297 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996) (internal quotations  omitted)); see also Mt. Airy Ins. Co. v.

Under Massachusetts law,  the duty to defend is broader than, and independent of, the duty to  indemnify.  See Merchants, 143 F.3d at 8 (citing Boston Symphony  Orchestra, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 545 N.E.2d 1156, 1158  (Mass. 1989)); Millipore Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 115 F.3d  21, 35 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing same).  That is, the obligation to  defend turns on the facts alleged in the complaint rather than the  facts proven at trial.  See Millipore, 115 F.3d at 35; see also GRE  Ins. Group, 61 F.3d at 81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A liability insurer has no duty to defend a claim that is  specifically excluded from coverage, but the insurer bears the  burden of establishing the applicability of any exclusion.  See Mt.  Airy, 127 F.3d at 19 (citing Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co. v. Hercules Bldg. &amp; Wrecking Co., 619 N.E.2d 353 (Mass. App. Ct.  1993)); GRE Ins.

Consistent with the Massachusetts general rule favoring insureds in  policy interpretation, any ambiguities in the exclusion provision  are strictly construed against the insurer.  See Mt. Airy, 127 F.3d  at 19 (citing Sterilite, 458 N.E.2d 338); GRE Ins. Group, 61 F.3d  at 81; see also Hakim, 675 N.E.2d at 1165 (holding that \"[t]his  rule of construction applies with particular force to exclusionary  provisions\").  Ambiguity exists when the policy language is  susceptible to more than one rational interpretation.  SeeMerchants, 143 F.3d at 8 (citing Boston Symphony Orchestra, 545  N.E.2d at 1169); Mt. Airy, 127 F.3d at 19 (citing Jefferson Ins.  Co. of New York v. Holyoke, 503 N.E.2d 474 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987)). But it does not follow that ambiguity exists solely because the  parties disagree as to the provision's meaning.  See Continental  Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins.

Brazas  contends that such a reading of the exclusion provision would  render the general liability policy meaningless.  Brazas challenged  summary judgment on two grounds:  (1) the products-completed  operations hazard exclusion was intended to apply to defective  products only, and (2) the New York civil actions do not actually  allege injuries from Brazas's products, but rather injuries caused  by the company's business management and strategy, thereby  rendering the exclusion provision inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the appellant's arguments. The court held that the language of the exclusion provision did not  support a reading that would limit the exclusion to injuries from  defective products.  Additionally, the court concluded that \"[o]nly  by a distortion of language and logic can plaintiff suggest that  the injuries sued upon do not 'arise from' the distribution of  Brazas products, off Brazas premises.\"  Brazas, 59 F. Supp. 2d at  226.  We take up each of the appellant's arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Defective Products</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant posits that the \"pivotal issue\" of the case  is \"whether the exclusion is meant to bar more than product  liability claims.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Appellant's Brief at 15.  It suggests that in  the scheme of the commercial general liability policy as a whole  the general risks of doing business should be protected, and,  therefore, the exclusion provision should be limited to defective  products claims.  Moreover, the appellant argues, a reasonable  insured would interpret the provision as applying to defective  products only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, we have no guidance from Massachusetts  courts on this issue.  Indeed numerous other courts have read  similar exclusion provisions to be defective products exclusions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but there is contrary authority from courts finding such a reading  to be beyond the text of the exclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the latter line of  case law is more persuasive.  First, we observe that many of the  courts that have held that a products-completed operations hazard  exclusion provision was, in effect, a defective products exclusion  were considering provisions that contained materially different  language from the provision in American Empire's policies.  Second,  and more significant, in order to limit the American Empire  exclusion provision to defective products, we would need to read  into the text a requirement that is simply not there.  The  products-completed operations hazard includes in plain and  unambiguous language \"all 'bodily injury' and 'property damage'  occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of  'your product.'\"  Where, as here, the language of the exclusion  provision is unambiguous, the text should be given its plain  meaning.  In this case, the plain meaning of the exclusion is that  it applies to all product-related injuries.  See Cobbins, 290  N.E.2d at 877.  Although we take into account the likely  understanding of a reasonable insured, we may not read into the  provision a condition or language that is not present.  See Hakim,  675 N.E.2d at 1164-65.  Nor are we sure that in the context of  Brazas's actual business as a distributor, rather than a  manufacturer, a reasonable insured would read the exclusion to  refer to defective products.  Consequently, we are convinced that  the exclusion clause does not limit itself to injuries that arise  out of defective products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.  \"Arising out of\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue -- whether the New York civil actions  state claims for injuries that \"arise out of\" Brazas products -- is  a much closer case.  We have before us Brazas, an insured who  purchased a commercial general liability policy, arguably with the  intent of covering the general risks of doing business.  See  Western Alliance Ins. Co. v. Gill, 686 N.E.2d 997, 1000-01 (Mass.  1997).  However, an exclusion provision in the policy explicitly  denies coverage for all injuries \"arising out of\" the insured's  products, products which are inherently dangerous.  Subsequently,  a civil action is brought for wrongful injuries allegedly resulting  from Brazas's saturation of the market with its products.  However,  the plaintiffs, who were directly injured by products from that  market (or an underground market), through intervening intentional  wrongdoing, do not claim that any of Brazas's products were  involved in their specific injuries.  We must therefore determine  whether it is legally significant that the underlying civil action  alleges that the injury was caused by the appellant's conduct and  not the appellant's products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, Massachusetts case law instructs that  the term \"arising out of\" should be broadly construed and  additionally directs our attention to the source of the underlying  injury rather than the theory of liability alleged in the  complaint.  See, e.g., Bagley v. Monticello Ins. Co., 720 N.E.2d  813, 816-17 (Mass. 1999).  On the other hand, at least some  Massachusetts courts recognize a separate injury arising out of the  insured's negligence independent of the proximate cause of harm, see, e.g., Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marnell, 496 N.E.2d 158, 161  (Mass. 1986), which taken together with Massachusetts general  policy favoring insureds in interpreting insurance contracts, see GRE Ins. Group, 61 F.3d at 81, suggests a narrow reading of the  exclusion provision.  Traditional considerations, such as parties'  expectations, see Western Alliance, 686 N.E.2d at 1000-01, shed no  further light on the issue because neither party would have  foreseen this type of lawsuit when they entered into the policy  agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with these conflicting principles of construction,  and in the absence of a definitive answer from Massachusetts  courts, we focus our inquiry on the text of the exclusion  provision.  The products-completed operations hazard exclusion  applies to \"all 'bodily injury' . . . arising out of '[Brazas's]  product.'\"  Under Massachusetts law, \"arising out of\" \"indicates a  wider range of causation than the concept of proximate causation in  tort law.\"  Rischitelli v. Safety Ins. Co., 671 N.E.2d 1243, 1245 (Mass. 1996), quoted in Merchants, 143 F.3d at 9; see also Mt.  Airy, 127 F.3d at 20; Bagley, 720 N.E.2d at 816.  In other words,  it falls somewhere between proximate and \"but for\" causation -- an  intermediate causation standard.  See Merchants, 143 F.3d at 9-10; Rischitelli, 671 N.E.2d at 1245; see also Bagley, 720 N.E.2d at 816  (observing that many cases interpret the term as much more  analogous to \"but for\" causation).  It is generally understood to  mean \"originating from,\" \"growing out of,\" \"flowing from,\"  \"incident to,\" or \"having connection with.\"  See Merchants, 143  F.3d at 9;aMt. Airy, 127 F.3d at 20; New England Mut. Life Ins.  Co., 667 N.E.2d at 298 (citing Webster's Third New International  Dictionary 117 (1981)); see also Continental Cas. Co. v. City of  Richmond, 763 F.2d 1076, 1080 (9th Cir. 1985) (listing similar  variations of \"arising out of\" to illustrate that phrase is broader  than \"caused by\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting the phrase \"arising out of\" in the  context of the case at hand, we are compelled by Massachusetts law  to consider the \"source from which the plaintiff's personal injury  originates rather than the specific theories of liability alleged  in the complaint [of the underlying civil action].\"  Bagley, 720  N.E.2d at 817 (quoting New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 667 N.E.2d  at 299).  Thus, in this case, firearms were the immediate source of  the plaintiffs' injuries, and the fact that the plaintiffs, to  reach the deep pockets of the firearms industry, contrived a theory  of liability that targeted Brazas for its alleged participation in  flooding the firearms market cannot affect the application of the  exclusion provision.  See id. at 816-17; United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Parish, 717 N.E.2d 1016, 1018-19 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant correctly asserts that under Massachusetts  law an act of negligence can create a separate legal injury that  does not arise out of the product.  However, the primary cases upon  which the appellant relies for this proposition, Rischitelli v. Safety Insurance Co., 671 N.E.2d 1243 (Mass. 1996), and Worcester  Mutual Insurance Co. v. Marnell, 496 N.E.2d 158 (Mass. 1986), are  readily distinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rischitelli, the plaintiff was the victim of road rage  -- after a car accident, he was physically attacked by the driver  of the other car.  As an insured under a standard automobile  insurance policy, the plaintiff sought to recover benefits.  The  policy afforded coverage for \"'bodily injury . . . arising out of  the ownership, maintenance or use of an auto.'\"  Rischitelli, 671  N.E.2d at 1245.  Although the issue before the court related to  policy coverage rather than to an exclusion provision, the court's  construction of the expression \"arising out of\" is duly applicable  to this case.  The court recognized that the phrase did not \"refer  to all circumstances in which the injury would not have occurred  'but for' the involvement of a motor vehicle.\"  Id.  Instead, it  observed, cases fall along a continuum depending on the causal  connection between the injury and the automobile.  See id. at 1245. For instance, under a standard auto policy there was no coverage  when a plaintiff tripped on a rope that fell off a truck or when a  plaintiff was shot by the insured while seated in his automobile,  but the sexual assault of a school bus passenger by the bus driver  involved an injury arising from the use of a motor vehicle.  Seeid. (citing Perry v. Chipouras, 66 N.E.2d 361 (Mass. 1946), Sabatinelli v. Travelers Ins. Co., 341 N.E.2d 880 (Mass. 1976), and Roe v. Lawn, 634 N.E.2d 117 (Mass. 1994)).  In these cases, the  intervening act of violence broke the chain of causation between  the operation of the vehicles and the injuries only where the  violence was merely incidental to the use of the vehicle. Consequently, the Rischitelli court concluded that the battery was  sufficiently independent of the motor vehicle accident that the  losses the plaintiff sustained arose from the intentional  wrongdoing of the other driver and not from the use of an  automobile.  See id. at 1246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variation of this independent causation analysis aided  the court in Worcester Mutual Insurance Co.  In that case, the  underlying complaint alleged that the insureds' negligent  supervision of a party held at their residence was the proximate  cause of an automobile accident that killed the plaintiff's  intestate.  See 496 N.E.2d at 159.  The insureds sought coverage  for the wrongful death action under their homeowners' insurance  policy, but the policy had an exclusion for bodily injury arising  out of the ownership or use of a motor vehicle.  See id.  The court  concluded, however, that negligent supervision \"is separate and  distinct from the use or operation of an automobile.\"  Id. at 161. The court reasoned that the allegations in the complaint, namely,  that the insureds had failed to prevent their son from drinking,  related solely to activities that took place in the home and that,  therefore, the insureds could reasonably expect to be protected by  their homeowner's policy.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reasoning in Worcester would at first glance  seem to control the outcome in this case -- the New York civil  actions accuse Brazas of making bad business decisions, conduct  which takes place on Brazas's premises, and, therefore, Brazas  could reasonably expect protection under its comprehensive general  liability policy.  However, unlike the circumstances in Worcester and Rischitelli, here the two sources of injury are interdependent. Brazas's alleged misconduct is the over-distribution of firearms  and the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries are firearms,  whereas in Worcester, the parents' negligent supervision of their  son derived from their illegal and unsupervised provision of  alcohol, not the automobile that was ultimately the cause of the  wrongful death.  As the Worcester Court explained, alternatively,  a claim for negligent entrustment (of the automobile), conduct  which still occurred in the home, would necessarily have been  within the exclusion provision.  See id. at 245-46.  Similarly, in Rischitelli the battery and the car accident were separate and  distinct events; the car accident merely preceded, and set the  context for, the battery.  In contrast, Brazas's conduct, along  with the New York plaintiffs' claims, indisputably derived from  firearms.  In other words, the company, in distributing its  firearms, is allegedly negligent precisely because it created the  risk of the exact kind of injuries suffered by the New York  plaintiffs.  See United Nat'l Ins. Co., 717 N.E.2d at 1018-19; New  England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 447 N.E.2d at 298-99; see alsoContinental Cas. Co., 763 F.2d at 1080-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the New York law suits concern off-premises  conduct arising out of (not merely incidentally related to) firearms products, Brazas is not entitled to defense or indemnity  coverage as a result of the products-completed operations hazard  exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  Unfair Trade Practice Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court can quickly dispose of Brazas's additional  claim that American Empire violated the Massachusetts consumer  protection statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 11, because it is  nothing more than a reconfiguration of its coverage claim. Moreover, Brazas fails to direct the Court to any evidence that  would create a genuine issue of fact to support this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts consumer protection statute provides a  right of action to anyone who suffered a loss of money or property  as a result of an unfair or deceptive business practice.  See Brown  Daltas &amp; Assocs. v. General Accident Ins. Co. of America, 844 F.  Supp. 58, 67 (D. Mass. 1994), rev'd on other grounds, 48 F.3d 30  (1st Cir. 1995).  It generally protects consumers from unfair  business practices that are \"immoral, unethical, oppressive, or  unscrupulous; or within the bounds of some statutory, common-law or  other established concept of unfairness.\"  Ellis v. Safety Ins.  Co., 672 N.E.2d 979, 986 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this vein, Brazas contends that American Empire  violated the Massachusetts law that established the rules of  fairness as to an insurer's claims handling procedures, Mass. Gen.  Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9)(a), (n), and thereby violated chapter 93A. Specifically, the appellant charges American Empire with (1)  misrepresenting pertinent policy provisions and (2) failing to  provide a reasonable explanation of the basis for denial of  coverage.  As an initial matter, a violation of chapter 176D is not  automatically actionable under chapter 93A, &#167; 11, which provides a  cause of action for business plaintiffs injured by unfair trade  practices.  See Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 610 N.E.2d  912, 197 (Mass. 1993); cf. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(1)  (establishing right of action for consumer plaintiffs for  violations of ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9)).  That said, conduct that violates  ch. 176D may independently be an unfair trade practice actionable  under ch. 93A, &#167; 11.  See Kiewit Constr. Co. v. Westchester Fire  Ins. Co., 878 F. Supp. 298, 301-02 (D. Mass. 1995).  But we need  not get distracted by the interrelationship of the two statutes  because the appellant utterly fails to develop this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its core, the appellant's misrepresentation argument  is that American Empire issued a policy called a \"general  liability\" policy, which, based on the broad scope of the products-completed operations hazard exclusion, is in fact only a premises  liability policy.  Brazas does not allege, or point to any  evidence, indicating that American Empire made any  misrepresentations when it issued the policy, but argues only that  the policy itself, in its own terms, misrepresents its coverage --  that is, a comprehensive liability policy would cover the New York  civil actions because they arise from the general risks of doing  business.  Despite the appellant's claim to the contrary, this  convoluted argument does not in itself create an issue of fact.  We  held above that the exclusion provision was not ambiguous and that,  consequently, a reasonable insured would have understood that  product-related injuries like those at issue in the New York civil  actions would be excluded from coverage.  Thus, as a matter of law  the policies are not misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's claim that American Empire violated  chapter 176D because it did not provide a reasonable explanation  for the denial of coverage is likewise unavailing.  Again, Brazas  does not point to any deficiency on the part of American Empire in  its correspondence with Brazas.  Instead, Brazas argues that the explanation was inadequate because American Empire \"chose to read  the allegations in the underlying New York actions in the manner  most favorable to its position.\"  Appellant's Brief at 27.  Not  only has the appellant failed to articulate a tenable theory under  chapter 176D, &#167; 3(9), without offering any legal support, but, more  important, we have concluded that American Empire properly denied  coverage and did not owe Brazas a duty to defend.  Where as here,  the insurer properly denied coverage, there can be no violation of  chapter 176D.  See Spurlin v. Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire,  866 F. Supp. 57, 62 (D. Mass. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the appellant has failed to persuade the Court that  American Empire engaged in any conduct that rose to the level of  unfairness as a matter of law, summary judgment was appropriate. See Brown Daltas &amp; Assocs., 844 F. Supp. at 67-68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we conclude that the allegations raised in the  New York action arise out of Brazas's products and fall directly  within the products-completed operations hazard exclusion in the  general liability policy, we hold that American Empire could  reasonably have concluded that the New York action was outside the  scope of coverage and, thus, that it owed Brazas no duty to defend. For similar reasons, this Court holds that the appellant's consumer  protection claim is baseless.  Thus, we affirm the district court's  grant of summary judgment in favor of American Empire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   The parties and the case law use the terms \"products liability\"  and \"defective products\" interchangeably in the context of the  products-completed operations hazard exclusion.  However, these  terms are not coterminous, and it is at least arguable that the New  York law suits are a variety of a products liability action. Because such an understanding of products liability is antithetical  to the appellant's argument, for purposes of this discussion, we  will assume that the New York cases are not products liability  actions.  And to avoid further confusion, we will only use the term  defective products for the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>   See, e.g., Scarborough v.

Brazas's  policies contained the following endorsement that altered the  standard policy agreement:  \"This insurance does not apply to  'bodily injury' or 'property damage' included within the 'products-completed operations hazard.'\"  Products-completed operations  hazard includes \"all 'bodily injury' and 'property damage'  occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of  'your product' or 'your work' except:  (1) Products that are still  in your physical possession; or (2) Work that had not yet been  completed or abandoned.\"  \"Your product\" is defined as,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

It subsequently learned that it was named as a defendant in  an additional law suit.  Both lawsuits charged Brazas and various  other manufacturers and dealers of handguns, as well as industry  trade groups, with liability for contributing to market overflow. Specifically, the lawsuits alleged that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants have knowingly produced and  distributed handguns in excess of the  reasonable demand by responsible consumers in  the lawful national handgun market, and they  have knowingly failed or refused to take any  meaningful steps to regulate and control the  distribution and sale of their guns by retail  dealers.  Their willfully negligent conduct -  individually and as an industry - has created  and supplied an unlawful national market in  firearms, the source of the handguns that  killed and wounded plaintiffs and their loved  ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, the lawsuits did not identify any particular guns sold by  Brazas as the cause of injury to any particular plaintiffs.  By the  time the district court entered judgment, one of the cases had gone  to trial, and Brazas had eventually been dismissed. See Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, No. C.V. 95-0049 (E.D.N.Y. 1995).  Brazas has incurred  in excess of $75,000 in defense costs in connection with the  litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least some of the claims alleged in the lawsuits  occurred during the effective period of the American Empire  policies.  However, upon notice, American Empire denied coverage  and refused to defend Brazas.  As a result, Brazas brought this  declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for  the District of Massachusetts under that court's diversity  jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332.  Brazas also brought a  claim under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 11.  The parties filed cross motions for  summary judgment.  Brazas appeals from the district court's grant  of summary judgment for American Empire and the denial of Brazas's  motion for partial summary judgment on its duty to defend claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

Brazas  contends that such a reading of the exclusion provision would  render the general liability policy meaningless.  Brazas challenged  summary judgment on two grounds:  (1) the products-completed  operations hazard exclusion was intended to apply to defective  products only, and (2) the New York civil actions do not actually  allege injuries from Brazas's products, but rather injuries caused  by the company's business management and strategy, thereby  rendering the exclusion provision inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the appellant's arguments. The court held that the language of the exclusion provision did not  support a reading that would limit the exclusion to injuries from  defective products.  Additionally, the court concluded that \"[o]nly  by a distortion of language and logic can plaintiff suggest that  the injuries sued upon do not 'arise from' the distribution of  Brazas products, off Brazas premises.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2408738\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brazas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2408738/brazas-sporting-arms-v-american-empire-surplus/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Defective Products</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant posits that the \"pivotal issue\" of the case  is \"whether the exclusion is meant to bar more than product  liability claims.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Appellant's Brief at 15.  It suggests that in  the scheme of the commercial general liability policy as a whole  the general risks of doing business should be protected, and,  therefore, the exclusion provision should be limited to defective  products claims.  Moreover, the appellant argues, a reasonable  insured would interpret the provision as applying to defective  products only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, we have no guidance from Massachusetts  courts on this issue.  Indeed numerous other courts have read  similar exclusion provisions to be defective products exclusions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but there is contrary authority from courts finding such a reading  to be beyond the text of the exclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the latter line of  case law is more persuasive.  First, we observe that many of the  courts that have held that a products-completed operations hazard  exclusion provision was, in effect, a defective products exclusion  were considering provisions that contained materially different  language from the provision in American Empire's policies.  Second,  and more significant, in order to limit the American Empire  exclusion provision to defective products, we would need to read  into the text a requirement that is simply not there.  The  products-completed operations hazard includes in plain and  unambiguous language \"all 'bodily injury' and 'property damage'  occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of  'your product.'\"  Where, as here, the language of the exclusion  provision is unambiguous, the text should be given its plain  meaning.  In this case, the plain meaning of the exclusion is that  it applies to all product-related injuries.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cobbins,</span> <span class=\"volume\">290</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">877</span></span>.  Although we take into account the likely  understanding of a reasonable insured, we may not read into the  provision a condition or language that is not present.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hakim,</span>  <span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1164-65</span></span>.  Nor are we sure that in the context of  Brazas's actual business as a distributor, rather than a  manufacturer, a reasonable insured would read the exclusion to  refer to defective products.  Consequently, we are convinced that  the exclusion clause does not limit itself to injuries that arise  out of defective products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.  \"Arising out of\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue -- whether the New York civil actions  state claims for injuries that \"arise out of\" Brazas products -- is  a much closer case.  We have before us Brazas, an insured who  purchased a commercial general liability policy, arguably with the  intent of covering the general risks of doing business.  See  Western Alliance Ins. Co. v. Gill, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></span>, 1000-01 (Mass.  1997).  However, an exclusion provision in the policy explicitly  denies coverage for all injuries \"arising out of\" the insured's  products, products which are inherently dangerous.  Subsequently,  a civil action is brought for wrongful injuries allegedly resulting  from Brazas's saturation of the market with its products.  However,  the plaintiffs, who were directly injured by products from that  market (or an underground market), through intervening intentional  wrongdoing, do not claim that any of Brazas's products were  involved in their specific injuries.  We must therefore determine  whether it is legally significant that the underlying civil action  alleges that the injury was caused by the appellant's conduct and  not the appellant's products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, Massachusetts case law instructs that  the term \"arising out of\" should be broadly construed and  additionally directs our attention to the source of the underlying  injury rather than the theory of liability alleged in the  complaint.  See, e.g., Bagley v. Monticello Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">813</span></span>, 816-17 (Mass. 1999).  On the other hand, at least some  Massachusetts courts recognize a separate injury arising out of the  insured's negligence independent of the proximate cause of harm, see, e.g., Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marnell, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></span>, 161  (Mass. 1986), which taken together with Massachusetts general  policy favoring insureds in interpreting insurance contracts, see GRE Ins. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196201\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Group,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196201/gre-v-metropolitan-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, suggests a narrow reading of the  exclusion provision.  Traditional considerations, such as parties'  expectations, see Western <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Alliance,</span> <span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1000-01</span></span>, shed no  further light on the issue because neither party would have  foreseen this type of lawsuit when they entered into the policy  agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with these conflicting principles of construction,  and in the absence of a definitive answer from Massachusetts  courts, we focus our inquiry on the text of the exclusion  provision.

Thus, in this case, firearms were the immediate source of  the plaintiffs' injuries, and the fact that the plaintiffs, to  reach the deep pockets of the firearms industry, contrived a theory  of liability that targeted Brazas for its alleged participation in  flooding the firearms market cannot affect the application of the  exclusion provision.

However, the primary cases upon  which the appellant relies for this proposition, Rischitelli v. Safety Insurance Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span> </span>(Mass. 1996), and Worcester  Mutual Insurance Co. v.

As an insured under a standard automobile  insurance policy, the plaintiff sought to recover benefits.  The  policy afforded coverage for \"'bodily injury . . . arising out of  the ownership, maintenance or use of an auto.'\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rischitelli,</span> <span class=\"volume\">671</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1245</span></span>.  Although the issue before the court related to  policy coverage rather than to an exclusion provision, the court's  construction of the expression \"arising out of\" is duly applicable  to this case.  The court recognized that the phrase did not \"refer  to all circumstances in which the injury would not have occurred  'but for' the involvement of a motor vehicle.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Instead, it </span> observed, cases fall along a continuum depending on the causal  connection between the injury and the automobile.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1245. </span>For instance, under a standard auto policy there was no coverage  when a plaintiff tripped on a rope that fell off a truck or when a  plaintiff was shot by the insured while seated in his automobile,  but the sexual assault of a school bus passenger by the bus driver  involved an injury arising from the use of a motor vehicle.  Seeid. (citing Perry v. Chipouras, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span> </span>(Mass. 1946), Sabatinelli v. Travelers Ins.

In these cases, the  intervening act of violence broke the chain of causation between  the operation of the vehicles and the injuries only where the  violence was merely incidental to the use of the vehicle. Consequently, the Rischitelli court concluded that the battery was  sufficiently independent of the motor vehicle accident that the  losses the plaintiff sustained arose from the intentional  wrongdoing of the other driver and not from the use of an  automobile.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1246.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variation of this independent causation analysis aided  the court in Worcester Mutual Insurance Co.  In that case, the  underlying complaint alleged that the insureds' negligent  supervision of a party held at their residence was the proximate  cause of an automobile accident that killed the plaintiff's  intestate.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">159</span></span>.  The insureds sought coverage  for the wrongful death action under their homeowners' insurance  policy, but the policy had an exclusion for bodily injury arising  out of the ownership or use of a motor vehicle.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  The court </span> concluded, however, that negligent supervision \"is separate and  distinct from the use or operation of an automobile.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 161. </span>The court reasoned that the allegations in the complaint, namely,  that the insureds had failed to prevent their son from drinking,  related solely to activities that took place in the home and that,  therefore, the insureds could reasonably expect to be protected by  their homeowner's policy.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reasoning in Worcester would at first glance  seem to control the outcome in this case -- the New York civil  actions accuse Brazas of making bad business decisions, conduct  which takes place on Brazas's premises, and, therefore, Brazas  could reasonably expect protection under its comprehensive general  liability policy.  However, unlike the circumstances in Worcester and Rischitelli, here the two sources of injury are interdependent. Brazas's alleged misconduct is the over-distribution of firearms  and the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries are firearms,  whereas in Worcester, the parents' negligent supervision of their  son derived from their illegal and unsupervised provision of  alcohol, not the automobile that was ultimately the cause of the  wrongful death.  As the Worcester Court explained, alternatively,  a claim for negligent entrustment (of the automobile), conduct  which still occurred in the home, would necessarily have been  within the exclusion provision.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 245-46. </span> Similarly, in Rischitelli the battery and the car accident were separate and  distinct events; the car accident merely preceded, and set the  context for, the battery.  In contrast, Brazas's conduct, along  with the New York plaintiffs' claims, indisputably derived from  firearms.  In other words, the company, in distributing its  firearms, is allegedly negligent precisely because it created the  risk of the exact kind of injuries suffered by the New York  plaintiffs.

Gen.  Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9)(a), (n), and thereby violated chapter 93A. Specifically, the appellant charges American Empire with (1)  misrepresenting pertinent policy provisions and (2) failing to  provide a reasonable explanation of the basis for denial of  coverage.  As an initial matter, a violation of chapter 176D is not  automatically actionable under chapter 93A, &#167; 11, which provides a  cause of action for business plaintiffs injured by unfair trade  practices.  See Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem.

Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(1)  (establishing right of action for consumer plaintiffs for  violations of ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9)).  That said, conduct that violates  ch. 176D may independently be an unfair trade practice actionable  under ch. 93A, &#167; 11.  See Kiewit Constr. Co. v. Westchester Fire  Ins.

But we need  not get distracted by the interrelationship of the two statutes  because the appellant utterly fails to develop this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its core, the appellant's misrepresentation argument  is that American Empire issued a policy called a \"general  liability\" policy, which, based on the broad scope of the products-completed operations hazard exclusion, is in fact only a premises  liability policy.  Brazas does not allege, or point to any  evidence, indicating that American Empire made any  misrepresentations when it issued the policy, but argues only that  the policy itself, in its own terms, misrepresents its coverage --  that is, a comprehensive liability policy would cover the New York  civil actions because they arise from the general risks of doing  business.  Despite the appellant's claim to the contrary, this  convoluted argument does not in itself create an issue of fact.  We  held above that the exclusion provision was not ambiguous and that,  consequently, a reasonable insured would have understood that  product-related injuries like those at issue in the New York civil  actions would be excluded from coverage.  Thus, as a matter of law  the policies are not misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's claim that American Empire violated  chapter 176D because it did not provide a reasonable explanation  for the denial of coverage is likewise unavailing.  Again, Brazas  does not point to any deficiency on the part of American Empire in  its correspondence with Brazas.  Instead, Brazas argues that the explanation was inadequate because American Empire \"chose to read  the allegations in the underlying New York actions in the manner  most favorable to its position.\"  Appellant's Brief at 27.  Not  only has the appellant failed to articulate a tenable theory under  chapter 176D, &#167; 3(9), without offering any legal support, but, more  important, we have concluded that American Empire properly denied  coverage and did not owe Brazas a duty to defend.  Where as here,  the insurer properly denied coverage, there can be no violation of  chapter 176D.  See Spurlin v. Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1375806\"><a href=\"/opinion/1375806/spurlin-v-merchants-ins-co-of-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Brown Daltas &amp; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Assocs.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

For similar reasons, this Court holds that the appellant's consumer  protection claim is baseless.  Thus, we affirm the district court's  grant of summary judgment in favor of American Empire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   The parties and the case law use the terms \"products liability\"  and \"defective products\" interchangeably in the context of the  products-completed operations hazard exclusion.  However, these  terms are not coterminous, and it is at least arguable that the New  York law suits are a variety of a products liability action. Because such an understanding of products liability is antithetical  to the appellant's argument, for purposes of this discussion, we  will assume that the New York cases are not products liability  actions.  And to avoid further confusion, we will only use the term  defective products for the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>   See, e.g., Scarborough v.
