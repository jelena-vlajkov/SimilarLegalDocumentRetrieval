CALLAHAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF THE\n                SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n         [Hon. David L. Martin, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     David B. Green and Green & Greenberg on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Robin E. Feder,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Nancy B. Salafia,\nAssistant Regional Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         March 6, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam. Appellant appeals from the district\n\n court's   decision   affirming   the   final   decision   of   the\n\n Commissioner of Social Security denying disability insurance\n\n benefits under the Social Security Act.         After carefully\n\n reviewing the administrative record and the arguments of the\n\n parties, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the\n\n denial of benefits, essentially for the reasons given by the\n\n district court in its Memorandum and Order dated May 20,\n\n 1999 and by the Commissioner in his appellate brief.           We\n\n make only the following additional comments relative to\n\n claims of error not directly addressed by the district court\n\n or the Commissioner.1\n\n           1.   Appellant suggests that the administrative law\n\n judge (ALJ) had an obligation to consult a medical advisor\n\n to determine her onset date of disability, but we disagree.\n\n Since the ALJ concluded that claimant was not disabled at\n\n any time during the insured period, there was no ambiguity\n\n as to the date of onset which needed to be resolved.       We are\n\n\n\n    1 There is no need to address the question whether the new\nevidence given to the Appeals Council in support of the petition\nfor review comprises part of the administrative record. Whether\nor not that evidence is considered, substantial evidence of\nrecord supported the denial of benefits.\n\n                              -2-\n\falso unpersuaded by appellant's suggestion that the ALJ\n\nerred in not recontacting her treating physician, Dr. Ralph\n\nDiGiacomo, to clarify his opinion that claimant was totally\n\ndisabled.      On    this   case    record,     which   contains   scant\n\nobjective evidence of disability, we think that the district\n\ncourt   reasonably      suggested    that      the   doctor   based   his\n\notherwise    unexplained     opinion     on    appellant's    subjective\n\ncomplaints of pain.         For reasons adequately stated by the\n\ndistrict court and Commissioner, the ALJ properly determined\n\nthat her    allegations of pain were not fully creditable.\n\n            2. Appellant is right that the functional capacity\n\nreports by non-examining consulting physicians, which the\n\nALJ partly relied on in finding her not disabled, were made\n\nbefore Dr. DiGiacomo saw her for hand and low back/leg pain\n\nin December 1994 and March 1995.              Nonetheless, we conclude\n\nthat those reports, both of which were supported by citation\n\nto   medical   findings      of    record,     retained   considerable\n\nreliability.        This is especially true of the November 2,\n\n1994 report by Dr. Stankiewicz, which was completed just two\n\nmonths before the alleged onset date of disability.                   Dr.\n\nStankiewicz reviewed reports by Dr. John Przygoda, which, as\n\nappellant herself states, \"generally recorded abnormalities\n\nconsistent with those found by Dr. DiGiacomo\" (appellant's\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fbrief, at page 13).                 In particular, Dr. Przygoda noted\n\nclaimant's       arthritis,         low    back    strain,       leg       cramps       and\n\ndifficulty in bending, although he attributed her bending\n\ndifficulty to a different cause than did Dr. DiGiacomo.\n\nAppellant has not shown -- or made any attempt to show --\n\nthat the limitation in lumbar motion which Dr. DiGiacomo\n\nobserved in March 1995, just before expiration of insured\n\nstatus, constituted a significant impairment necessitating\n\na    new    functional       capacity      assessment.          In    addition,        Dr.\n\nDiGiacomo's findings relative to claimant's hand condition\n\nwere       compatible    with       March       1994     findings         by    treating\n\nphysician,       Dr.     Vaughn      Gooding,          which     both      consulting\n\nphysicians considered and noted in their reports.                               Although\n\nDr. DiGiacomo found some minor Bouchard's nodes developing\n\nin    December       1994,    his    subsequent          progress         notes    never\n\nmentioned      them     again      (or    any     hand    pain       or    other       hand\n\nproblem, for that matter).                 Hence, the ALJ would have been\n\njustified       in     giving       some        weight     to    the       consulting\n\nphysicians' reports, as he did.                   See Manso-Pizarro v. SHHS,\n\n76 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (stating that a\n\nfunctional      capacity        report      is    not     necessary            where   the\n\nmedical       evidence       suggests       a    \"relatively         mild       physical\n\nimpairment      posing,       to    the    laymen's       eye,       no   significant\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fexertional restriction\"); Gordils v.
