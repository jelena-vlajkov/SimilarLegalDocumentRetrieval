Appellants      are   three\n\nindividuals who were hired by the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nHealth to perform advocacy work for persons with AIDS.                      They\n\nclaim that the Department’s failure to renew their contracts at\n\nthe end of their original terms stemmed from discrimination in\n\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794, and provisions of Puerto Rico law.               Defendants are\n\nthe Department of Health, the Secretary of that Department, and\n\ntwo other supervisory officials.\n\n    The district court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint in its entirety, finding various deficiencies in the\n\ndifferent counts.      See Oliveras-Sifre v. Department of Health,\n\n38 F.Supp.2d 91 (D.P.R. 1999).         On appeal, appellants challenge\n\nthree   of    the    court’s     rulings:      (1)      the    dismissal      of\n\ndiscrimination      claims   under    Title    I   of    the    ADA   and    the\n\nRehabilitation Act, (2) the dismissal of retaliation claims\n\nunder Title V of the ADA, and (3) the rejection of individual\n\nliability for certain defendants.          We affirm.\n\n                               I. Discussion\n\n                                     -2-\n\f    We review the district court’s dismissal of the complaint\n\nde novo, accepting as true all well pleaded allegations and\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nSee Langadinos v. American Airlines, 199 F.3d 68, 69 (lst Cir.\n\n2000); Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16\n\n(lst Cir. 1989).\n\n    The Ombudsman’s Office for Persons with HIV/AIDS in the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Health was created in 1993 pursuant to\n\nan agreement with the United States Department of Health and\n\nHuman Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Region II.                All\n\nthree appellants were hired to work in that office: Elesma\n\nOliveras-Sifre as Ombudsman for HIV/AIDS, Carlos Aponte-Ortiz as\n\nStrategies and Liaison Coordinator, and Ruben Roman-Cruz as\n\nInvestigation Analyst.     They were contractual employees whose\n\ncontracts were not renewed upon expiration in 1997.1\n\n    Appellants allege that they were \"the object of persecution,\n\ndiscrimination,    retaliation   and    harassment,\"      culminating    in\n\ntheir   termination,   because   of    their   advocacy    on   behalf   of\n\nindividuals with AIDS. The specific conduct alleged to have\n\nelicited defendants’ unlawful response is described as follows:\n\n\n\n    1  The First Amended Complaint indicates that at least\nAponte, and perhaps Roman as well, were transferred to new\npositions in the Department of Health. See Complaint at ¶¶ 7,\n8, 43, 44.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           The active management performed by [plaintiffs] .\n      . . specifically, the report prepared on the\n      management of medical records of patients with\n      HIV/AIDS in the Fajardo Region; [their] opposition\n      related   to    the  dispositions   of  Regulation   86\n      regarding,    transfer,    disposal,   exhumation   and\n      cremation of corpses of persons infected with\n      HIV/AIDS;    [their]   opposition   to  Regulation   87\n      regarding transmissible diseases and the dispositions\n      of patients infected with HIV/AIDS; [their] position\n      regarding the harmful effects that the schedule[]\n      changes, resulting from the Health Reform, could have\n      on   PASET     personnel,    including   the   Regional\n      Immunological Clinics, on the clinical handling of\n      HIV/AIDS patients, caused a retaliation pattern from\n      defendants . . . .\n\nSee   First   Amended   Complaint,    at    ¶¶   20,   27,    33.     Oliveras\n\nadditionally    contends    that   she     experienced       retaliation    for\n\nproviding     information    to    the     OCR    regarding         the   OCR’s\n\ninvestigation on Regulation 87.          See id. at ¶ 21.\n\n      To state a claim for employment discrimination under Title\n\nI of the ADA, a plaintiff typically must show: (1) that he or\n\nshe suffers from a disability within the meaning of the Act; (2)\n\nthat he or she was able to perform the essential functions of\n\nthe job, either with or without reasonable accommodation; and\n\n(3) that the employer discharged him or her in whole or in part\n\nbecause of that disability.          See Feliciano v. State of Rhode\n\nIsland, 160 F.3d 780, 784 (lst Cir. 1998); see also 42 U.S.C. §\n\n12112(a).2\n\n\n      2\n      An employment discrimination claim under section 794 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act is analyzed under the same standards\n\n                                   -4-\n\f       The    district         court     initially     determined      that    neither\n\nOliveras      nor Aponte established a prima face case of disability\n\ndiscrimination because neither was disabled.                         Although Roman\n\ndid    have       a   qualifying    disability,        blindness,    the     complaint\n\nacknowledged           that    he   had    received     accommodation        for   that\n\ndisability, leaving the AIDS-related allegations as the sole\n\nfactual foundation for his disability discrimination claims as\n\nwell. 3       Arguably going above and beyond its duty to assist\n\nplaintiffs, the district court                sua sponte considered whether\n\nplaintiffs had stated a claim under the ADA’s \"association\n\nprovision,\" which protects qualified individuals from employment\n\ndiscrimination based on the \"known disability of an individual\n\nwith       whom       the    qualified    individual      is   known    to    have    a\n\nrelationship            or    association,\"       42    U.S.C.   §     12112(b)(4).\n\n\n\napplicable to Title I of the ADA. See Feliciano, 160 F.3d at\n784; 29 U.S.C. § 794(d).      We therefore do not separately\nconsider the Rehabilitation Act claim.\n       3\n       Paragraph 35 of the complaint alleges that Roman \"was\ngranted a reasonable accommodation (a reader and/or lecturer)\"\non account of his blindness and that, two months before his\ndismissal, he was informed that the lecturer’s contract would\nnot be renewed. Paragraph 41 alleges that, in addition to the\nallegations of discrimination applicable to the other two\nplaintiffs, he had been discriminated against \"because of his\ncondition as a blind individual.\"      No specific allegations\nconcerning the nature of that discrimination were alleged and,\nin any event, the claim is not re-asserted on appeal. Thus, for\npurposes of this appeal, Roman’s claims are the same as the\nother appellants.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fAppellants   made    no    reference        to   this     provision    in   their\n\ncomplaint.\n\n      The district court concluded that the association claim also\n\nfell short, however, and we agree.               The legislative history of\n\nsection 12112(b)(4) makes clear that the provision was intended\n\nto protect qualified individuals from adverse job actions based\n\non \"unfounded stereotypes and assumptions\" arising from the\n\nemployees’   relationships with particular disabled persons.                   See\n\nBarker v. International Paper Co., 993 F. Supp. 10, 15 (D. Me.\n\n1998)   (citation    omitted);    see       also   Den     Hartog     v.   Wasatch\n\nAcademy, 129 F.3d 1076, 1081-85 (10th Cir. 1997) (discussing\n\nprovision’s legislative history at length and stating that prima\n\nfacie case includes showing that plaintiff was known by his\n\nemployer to have \"a relative or associate with a disability\").\n\nThe EEOC also has concluded that this was the intended scope of\n\nthe   provision,    as    indicated   through       the    three    examples    of\n\nforbidden association discrimination set out in its Interpretive\n\nGuidance on this provision of the ADA:\n\n      (1) refusal to hire where the employer makes an\n      unfounded assumption that the employee will miss work\n      in order to care for a disabled relative; (2)\n      discharging an employee who does volunteer work with\n      AIDS victims, due to fear that the employee may\n      contract the disease; and (3) denying health benefits\n      to a disabled dependent of an employee but not to\n      other dependents, even where the provision of benefits\n      to the disabled dependent would result in increased\n      health insurance costs for the employer.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fDen Hartog, 129 F.3d at 1085 (citing 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630.8, App.\n\nat 360).\n\n       Appellants’ contentions do not fit within this framework.\n\nThey   do    not    allege   a   specific   association    with    a   disabled\n\nindividual, but contend, in essence, that they were punished for\n\ntheir advocacy on behalf of individuals with AIDS.                      As the\n\ndistrict      court    recognized,     such    a   claim     implicates     the\n\nprohibition against retaliation contained in Title V of the ADA,\n\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)-(c), not the association provision.\n\nSee Oliveras-Sifre, 38 F.Supp.2d at 101; see also Barker, 993 F.\n\nSupp. at 15.        We therefore turn to appellants’ second claim on\n\nappeal,      that   the   district    court   erred   in   rejecting      their\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n       The   ADA    prohibits    discrimination    against    an   individual\n\n\"because such individual has opposed any act or practice made\n\nunlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a\n\ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an\n\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.\"                   42\n\nU.S.C. § 12203(a).           To establish retaliation under the ADA, a\n\nplaintiff must show that: (1) he or she was engaged in protected\n\nconduct; (2) he or she was discharged, and (3) there was a\n\ncausal connection between the discharge and the conduct.                    See\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fSoileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16 (lst Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n    The district court fully analyzed appellants’ retaliation\n\nclaim in light of this standard, concluding that they failed to\n\nplead    facts    satisfying     its   first      element,    participation     in\n\nprotected conduct.          The court reviewed the settings covered by\n\nthe ADA – employment, public accommodations, and the provision\n\nof services and benefits by public entities – and concluded\n\nthat, \"as stated in the Complaint, the actions described by\n\nPlaintiffs       do   not   relate     to   any    forms     of    discrimination\n\nprohibited by Titles I, II or III of the ADA.\"                    See 38 F.Supp.2d\n\nat 101-02.\n\n    We agree that appellants’ vague allegations regarding policy\n\npositions they took as employees of the Ombudsman’s Office, see\n\nsupra at 3, are insufficient to demonstrate that they engaged in\n\nprotected conduct.          We reiterate the district court’s language:\n\n    It is not apparent to the Court how the management of\n    medical records of HIV/AIDS patients, treatment of\n    corpses of HIV/AIDS inflicted persons, disposition of\n    patients infected with HIV/AIDS, and the scheduling of\n    \"PASET personnel\" is related to the conduct prohibited\n    by the ADA regarding employment, public benefits, or\n    public   accommodations.     Without   more   specific\n    allegations as to how the positions Plaintiffs took as\n    part of their work at the Department of Health opposed\n    conduct made illegal by the ADA, the Court cannot\n    permit their claim to go forward.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f38 F.Supp.2d at 102-03 (footnote omitted).4             Appellants merely\n\nrepeat on appeal the same conclusory statements contained in\n\ntheir complaint, providing us no basis upon which to find that\n\nthe   district   court    erred    in    failing   to    translate     their\n\nallegations    into   specific    conduct    protected     by    the   ADA. 5\n\nAlthough we construe appellants’ claims liberally, see, e.g.,\n\nDoyle v. Hasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 190 (lst Cir. 1996), it is\n\nnot our role to conjecture whether an actionable claim lurks\n\nbeneath their sketchy allegations,           see Gooley v. Mobil Oil\n\nCorp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (lst Cir. 1988) (\"The threshold [for\n\nstating a claim] may be low, but it is real . . . .\"). We thus\n\naffirm the district court’s dismissal of appellants’ retaliation\n\nclaims.\n\n      Our   disposition   of     the    substantive     claims   makes    it\n\nunnecessary to consider whether the defendants could be held\n\nindividually liable under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\n\n                            II. Conclusion\n\n\n\n      4\"PASET\" is the Program of AIDs Affairs and Sexually\nTransmitted Diseases of the Department of Health, which also is\nknown as the Ombudsman’s Office for Persons with AIDS.\n      5Appellants argue that \"[t]he complaint makes specific\nallegations of retaliatory conduct in response to plaintiffs’\nconduct in their aid to patients with HIV/AIDS to exercise their\nrights or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by the ADA\nand the RA.\" They do not, however, specify the rights \"granted\nor protected by the ADA.\"\n\n                                   -9-\n\f    Having concluded that the appellants have failed to allege\n\nfacts that, even when viewed most favorably to them, establish\n\na prima facie case of disability discrimination, we hold that\n\nthe district court properly dismissed their complaint.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f",

Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the appellants have failed to allege facts that, even when viewed most favorably to them, establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, we hold that the district court properly dismissed their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The First Amended Complaint indicates that at least Aponte, and perhaps Roman as well, were transferred to new positions in the Department of Health.

Paragraph 41 alleges that, in addition to the allegations of discrimination applicable to the other two plaintiffs, he had been discriminated against \"because of his condition as a blind individual.\" No specific allegations concerning the nature of that discrimination were alleged and, in any event, the claim is not re-asserted on appeal. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, Roman's claims are the same as the other appellants.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> \"PASET\" is the Program of AIDs Affairs and Sexually Transmitted Diseases of the Department of Health, which also is known as the Ombudsman's Office for Persons with AIDS.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Appellants argue that \"[t]he complaint makes specific allegations of retaliatory conduct in response to plaintiffs' conduct in their aid to patients with HIV/AIDS to exercise their rights or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by the ADA and the RA.\" They do not, however, specify the rights \"granted or protected by the ADA.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
