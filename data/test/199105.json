FIUMARA,\n\n                     Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n         MARY C. MARSHALL (formerly Mary C. Fiumara);\n                  ROBERT TOWLER; ALAN ROACH,\n                     MICHAEL C. MCCARTHY,\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n        [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n       [Hon. James R. Muirhead, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Joseph J. Fiumara on brief pro se.\n     Joseph K. Bosen and Watson & Bosen, P.A. on Memorandum of\nLaw in Support of Motion for Summary Affirmance for appellee\nMary C. Marshall.\n     William G. Scott and Boynton, Waldron, Doleac, Woodman &\nScott, P.A. on brief for appellees Robert Towler and Alan Roach.\n     Peter G. Beeson, John P. Sherman and Devin, Millimet &\nBranch on brief for appellee Michael C. McCarthy.\n\fSEPTEMBER 28, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam.     Plaintiff appeals from a judgment\n\n dismissing his claims against one of the defendants for\n\n failure\n\n to state a claim, and, following discovery, entering summary\n\n judgment in favor of the other defendants.              Plaintiff's\n\n brief does not contain sufficiently developed argumentation\n\n in support of his claims of legal error, so we deem the\n\n issues waived.    Upon de novo review of the judgment in light\n\n of the arguments on appeal which we understand, and in light\n\n of the appendix materials, we see no error.              The court\n\n followed   the   correct   procedure   by   liberally    construing\n\n plaintiff's pro se pleadings and indulging all reasonable\n\n inferences in his favor.      We glimpse no genuine issue of\n\n material fact which required further proceedings.         We see no\n\n error in the denial of plaintiff's motions for additional\n\n discovery nor in the denial of his several motions seeking\n\n to re-join as a party the defendant dismissed from the case\n\n for a failure to state a claim.1\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    1We note, moreover, that even if Attorney McCarthy had been\nrejoined he, like the other defendants, would have been entitled\nto summary judgment.\n\f",
