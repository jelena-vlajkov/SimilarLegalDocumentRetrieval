The\n\ndistrict    court    allowed      American    Eagle’s    motion   for   summary\n\njudgment on the ground that Santiago failed to adduce sufficient\n\nevidence    that     she    was   disabled    within    the   meaning   of   the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (“the\n\nADA\").     We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            We describe the relevant facts appearing in the summary\n\njudgment record in the light most favorable to the appellant.\n\nSee New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. v. Northeast Dairy Compact\n\nComm'n, 198 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1999).                 Beginning December 1,\n\n1991, Santiago was employed by American Eagle.                    She became a\n\nflight attendant on November 30, 1994.             On August 30, 1995, on\n\na flight sequence to St. Croix, Santiago complained of ear pain\n\nand requested to be relieved from her schedule upon arrival in\n\nSan Juan.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f             The next day, Santiago awoke with bleeding and pain in\n\nher ear.      That day, her private physician diagnosed her with\n\notitis media (ear infection) and ordered her to rest.                        Santiago\n\nwent    on   sick     leave    from    American      Eagle.     When        her   pain\n\npersisted,      Santiago      sought    emergency       room    care        and   then\n\ntreatment from Dr. Germán González, an ear, nose and throat\n\nspecialist.      Dr. González diagnosed otitis media and sinusitis\n\n(sinus infection).            Upon his recommendation, on October 10,\n\n1995, Santiago reported her ear problem as a work-related injury\n\nto the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\").\n\n             American Eagle permitted Santiago to take sick leave\n\nfrom August 31, 1995, to early November, 1995.                       Following her\n\nsick    leave,      Santiago     returned       to   work     with     no     medical\n\nrestrictions.         She     continued    to    experience     pain,       however,\n\nparticularly during non-pressurized cabin flights.                     On November\n\n15, 1995, Santiago underwent an audiogram, a subjective hearing\n\ntest.    This test indicated that she had a moderate hearing loss\n\nin the right ear, but no hearing loss in the left ear.                              In\n\nsubjective       hearing      tests,    the     results       depend    upon       the\n\nindividual’s verbal responses as to her perceptions of her\n\nability or inability to hear certain sounds.                         In objective\n\nhearing      tests,    a    physician     determines      hearing      ability      by\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fobserving the brain’s response to sound; self-reporting is not\n\na factor.\n\n              On   December      5,    1995,    Santiago    sought     additional\n\ntreatment from the SIF physician, Dr. Pichardo, who diagnosed\n\nSantiago with acoustic trauma in her right ear and stated that\n\nSantiago should fly only in planes with pressurized cabins in\n\norder    to    \"minimize    the       effect    of   pressure\"    in   that   ear.\n\nSantiago gave Dr. Pichardo's recommendation to her supervisor,\n\nMichelle Fajardo.         Fajardo told her that the airline could not\n\nassign her to work solely in pressurized cabins because the\n\nrelevant      collective    bargaining         agreement    precluded     American\n\nEagle from altering Santiago’s flight sequences.                  Fajardo stated\n\nthat    Santiago    had    two   options:        she   could   continue     flying\n\nwithout    the     requested     accommodation,        or   she   could    resign.\n\nAmerican Eagle did not offer any other options at this time.\n\nOther flight attendants who had requested accommodations due to\n\near problems had been offered ground positions.\n\n              Following this conversation, Santiago continued to fly\n\non planes both with pressurized and unpressurized cabins.                       On\n\nMarch 1, 1996, Dr. González noted that Santiago had recovered\n\nfrom her otitis and sinusitis, but found that she had damage to\n\nher inner ear, resulting in auditory loss in the right ear and\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fother symptoms.      He recommended that she not fly until her\n\ncondition improved.\n\n           On Santiago’s own initiative, she ceased flying on\n\nMarch 19, 1996.     A few days later, American Eagle referred her\n\nto a company-appointed physician, Dr. Thomas Murphy.                Dr. Murphy\n\nstated that Santiago may have a fistula (an abnormal passageway)\n\nproducing chronic ear problems and that she “may not be able to\n\nfly again.”      He ordered that Santiago be temporarily removed\n\nfrom flying duties until her condition stabilized.                  Subjective\n\nhearing tests in or around April, 1996, reflected continued\n\nhearing loss in Santiago’s right ear.\n\n           Around this time, American Eagle began searching for\n\na ground position for Santiago.          Accordingly, in early April,\n\n1996,   Santiago   was   transferred     to   a    temporary    receptionist\n\nposition at the same salary level.            In May, 1996, she became a\n\npayroll clerk; in June, 1997, Santiago took a permanent position\n\nas operational manager, earning a higher salary than she did as\n\na flight attendant.        On or around June 19, 1996, a coworker\n\ncomplained about Santiago’s \"tone of voice,\" i.e. that she was\n\nspeaking   too   loudly.     Ana   Torres,        the   head   of   personnel,\n\nsuggested that Santiago be referred to a psychologist because\n\nshe ”had a problem of adaptation” to her hearing loss.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f              On May 21, 1996, Dr. González performed an exploratory\n\ntympanotomy and closed a fistula.                 In July, 1996, he recommended\n\nthat Santiago use a hearing aid and that she avoid \"constant\n\nairplane flights.\"           Additional subjective hearing tests around\n\nthat time reflected continued hearing loss in her right ear.\n\nSantiago did not start using the hearing aid until sometime\n\nafter August 29, 1996.\n\n              On    February      25,     1997,   Santiago     filed   a   complaint\n\nalleging that her employer’s conduct violated the ADA, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12101 et seq., and Act Number 44 of July 2, 1985, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn.    tit.       1,   §   501    (1982     &    Supp.    1992)    (\"Puerto     Rico\n\nDisabilities Law\").             In March, 1997, further subjective hearing\n\ntests indicated that Santiago had moderate to severe hearing\n\nloss in her right ear, while the left ear was normal.\n\n              In November, 1997, Santiago underwent objective hearing\n\ntests   for    the      first     time,    performed      by   otologist   Dr.   Fred\n\nTelischi. These tests suggested that her hearing was within the\n\nnormal range in both ears.                   On January 21, 1998, she had\n\nadditional objective hearing tests performed at the request of\n\nher expert witness, Dr. José Arsuaga, an ear, nose and throat\n\nspecialist.        After the tests, Dr. Arsuaga opined that Santiago's\n\nhearing capacity was within normal limits in both ears.                            He\n\nconcluded that while Santiago had suffered aerotitis (damage to\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fthe middle ear caused by ambient pressure changes) and possible\n\ndamage to the inner ear in 1995, she had recovered.                           Both\n\nTelischi and Arsuaga stated that Santiago may have exaggerated\n\nher responses in the earlier subjective audiology tests.\n\n           On   February    17,     1998,    Santiago    moved        for   partial\n\nsummary judgment on the issue of liability, contending that\n\nAmerican   Eagle   had     failed    to     timely   provide      a    reasonable\n\naccommodation and that this failure caused her hearing loss.\n\nAmerican Eagle opposed Santiago’s motion and cross-moved for\n\nsummary judgment.     In its motion, American Eagle did not dispute\n\nthe facts presented by Santiago but set forth additional facts,\n\nsome of which concerned the temporary nature of her hearing\n\nloss.      Santiago      opposed      American       Eagle’s      cross-motion,\n\ncontending that some of the additional facts were disputed.1\n\n           On June 9, 1998, in a published opinion, the district\n\ncourt allowed American Eagle’s motion for summary judgment.                     See\n\nSantiago   Clemente   v.    Executive       Airlines,    7   F.    Supp.2d     114\n\n(D.P.R. 1998).     The district court determined that Santiago did\n\nnot set forth sufficient evidence of a substantial limitation to\n\na major life activity.      Hence, it concluded, she failed to prove\n\n\n\n    1To the extent that Santiago’s opposition to American\nEagle’s   motion  for  summary  judgment indicated  factual\ncontroversies, none are material to our disposition of this\nappeal.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fan element of her prima facie case under the ADA: that her\n\nimpairment amounted to a disability.                      The court also dismissed\n\nSantiago’s supplemental state law claim, without prejudice, for\n\nlack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                             II.\n\n            This Court reviews orders for summary judgment de novo,\n\nconstruing    the    record       in    the       light   most    favorable    to    the\n\nnonmovant    and    resolving          all       reasonable   inferences      in    that\n\nparty's favor.           See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.                   Town of\n\nHoulton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).                       Santiago contends\n\nthat the district court did not properly construe the record in\n\nher favor, leading it erroneously to the conclusion that her\n\ncondition did not constitute a disability.\n\n            The    ADA    prohibits          an    employer   from   discriminating\n\nagainst a qualified individual on the basis of a disability.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).              Here, Santiago alleges that American\n\nEagle failed reasonably to accommodate her alleged ear-related\n\ndisability.        To survive American Eagle’s motion for summary\n\njudgment, she must furnish \"significantly probative evidence\"\n\nthat,   inter      alia,    she    is        a    qualified      individual   with     a\n\ndisability within the meaning of the ADA and that, despite\n\nknowing of the disability, her employer did not reasonably\n\naccommodate it.      See Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\f194   F.3d   252,      264    (1st   Cir.   1999);    see    also   42   U.S.C.   §\n\n12112(b)(5)(A) (under ADA, the term “discriminate” may include\n\nnot making reasonable accommodations to known physical or mental\n\nlimitations of otherwise qualified individual with disability).\n\n\n\n             Like the district court, we conclude that Santiago’s\n\nADA case founders for failure to show that she had a disability\n\nas that term has been construed for purposes of the statute.\n\nNot all physical impairments rise to the level of disability\n\nunder the ADA.         See Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 119 S. Ct.\n\n2162,   2168-69        (1999).       Rather,    the    ADA   defines     the   term\n\n\"disability\"      as    (A)    \"a    physical   or    mental   impairment      that\n\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of\n\n[an] individual,\" (B) \"a record of such an impairment,\" or (C)\n\n\"being regarded as having such an impairment.\"                       42 U.S.C. §\n\n12102(2)(A)-(C).\n\n             A.        Substantially limiting impairment\n\n             In contending that she qualifies for ADA protection\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A), Santiago argues that her ear\n\nproblems, principally the temporary right-ear hearing loss,\n\nsubstantially limited her major life activities of hearing,\n\nspeaking, and working.               Whether an impairment substantially\n\nlimits one or more of an individual’s major life activities is\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fdetermined in a three-step analysis.               See Bragdon v. Abbott, 524\n\nU.S. 624, 631 (1998).      First, we consider whether Santiago’s ear\n\nproblems constituted a physical impairment.              Second, we identify\n\nthe life activities upon which Santiago relies -- hearing,\n\nspeaking, and working -- and determine whether they constitute\n\nmajor life activities under the ADA.                   Third, tying the two\n\nstatutory    phrases     together,     we    ask    whether    the   impairment\n\nsubstantially limited one or more of the activities found to\n\namount to major life activities.             See id.\n\n            Read most favorably to Santiago, her evidence satisfies\n\nthe first two requirements of this analysis.                  Her ear problems\n\nwere an impairment under the relevant EEOC definitions, being a\n\n“physiological disorder or condition” affecting “special sense\n\norgans.\"      See   29   C.F.R.   §    1630.2(h)(1).           And   the   three\n\nactivities claimed to have been impaired -- hearing, speaking,\n\nand working -- are all explicitly recognized as \"major life\n\nactivities\" under EEOC regulations.                See id. § 1630.2(i); see\n\nalso Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dept., 158 F.3d 635, 642\n\n(2d Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1018 (1999) (activities\n\nlisted in EEOC regulations are treated as major life activities\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fper se, rather than as major life activities only to the extent\n\nthat they are shown to affect a particular ADA plaintiff).2\n\n           Where Santiago’s claim encounters difficulty is at the\n\nthird and final step of the analysis:         her ear impairment was\n\nnot shown to have substantially interfered with her performance\n\nof   any   of   the    identified   major   life   activities.   EEOC\n\nregulations define \"substantially limits\" as:\n\n           (i) Unable to perform a major life activity\n           that the average person in the general\n           population can perform; or\n\n           (ii) Significantly restricted as to the\n           condition, manner or duration under which an\n           individual can perform a particular major\n           life activity as compared to the condition,\n           manner, or duration under which the average\n           person in the general population can perform\n           that same major life activity.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1).       Among the relevant considerations are\n\n(1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration\n\nor expected duration of the impairment; (3) the permanent or\n\nlong term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact\n\nof or resulting from the impairment.        See id. § 1630.2(j)(2).\n\n                      1.   Hearing and speaking\n\n\n\n\n     2We look to the well-reasoned views of the agencies\nimplementing a statute, which \"constitute a body of experience\nand informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly\nresort for guidance.\"      Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 642 (quoting\nSkidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 139-140 (1944)).\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            Santiago    has    not   provided   evidence   sufficient     to\n\ndemonstrate that her claimed impairment substantially interfered\n\nwith hearing or speaking.       The Supreme Court recently emphasized\n\nthat a court must determine on a case-by-case basis whether an\n\nindividual has offered sufficient evidence “that the extent of\n\nthe limitation in terms of [her] own experience . . . is\n\nsubstantial.”       Albertsons, 119 S. Ct. at 2169.           As the EEOC\n\nregulations instruct, we examine the evidence of the duration,\n\nseverity,     and    long-term       impact     of    Santiago’s    alleged\n\nlimitations.    See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2).\n\n            As for duration, it is undisputed that Santiago’s\n\nauditory problems were temporary and that her hearing is now\n\nnormal.      Beginning    in    November,     1995,   Santiago     underwent\n\nsubjective tests.      These reflected a hearing loss in her right\n\near.3 By November, 1997, objective tests showed that her hearing\n\nwas normal in both ears and there is no evidence of hearing loss\n\nbeyond that time.      Hence, a reasonable jury could conclude that,\n\nat most, Santiago experienced moderate to severe hearing loss in\n\none ear for approximately two years.\n\n\n\n\n    3The pain and dizziness Santiago experienced from flying in\nunpressurized cabins are not the basis for her ADA claim, which\nfocuses on her hearing loss.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f            It is true, as the district court acknowledged, that\n\nthe temporary nature of an impairment does not necessarily\n\npreclude it from constituting a disability under the ADA:\n\n            Although short-term, temporary restrictions\n            generally are not substantially limiting, an\n            impairment does not necessarily have to be\n            permanent to rise to the level of a\n            disability.      Some  conditions   may   be\n            long-term or potentially long-term, in that\n            their duration is indefinite and unknowable\n            or is expected to be at least several\n            months.   Such conditions, if severe, may\n            constitute disabilities.\n\nKatz v. City Metal Co., Inc., 87 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(citing 2 EEOC Compliance Manual, Interpretations (CCH) § 902.4,\n\n¶ 6884, p. 5319 (1995)) (emphasis supplied).\n\n            It is debatable whether Santiago’s treating physicians\n\nconsidered her ear-related impairment to be permanent, long-term\n\nor potentially long-term.          For example, in March, 1996, Dr.\n\nGonzález recommended that Santiago not fly \"until\" her condition\n\nimproved,    and   Dr.   Murphy    stated    that   Santiago      should    be\n\ntemporarily    removed   from     flying   duties   until   her   condition\n\nstabilized.\n\n            Even   assuming       that     Santiago’s   impairment         was\n\npotentially long-term, however, there is no evidence that the\n\ntemporary diminution in her right-ear hearing had a severe\n\nimpact on her functional ability to hear.               See 29 C.F.R. §\n\n1630.2(j)(2)(i).    The record at most supports a possible finding\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthat Santiago’s hearing loss was moderate to severe in one ear\n\nonly.   An audiological evaluation summary dated March 3, 1997,\n\nstates that \"Counseling [was] provided relative to impairments\n\nassociated   with   the    unilateral     hearing   loss,   namely,    the\n\ninability to perform sound localization, and difficulty with\n\nspeech discrimination in noisy environments.\"               No evidence,\n\nhowever,   identifies     the   overall   functional   degree   of    loss\n\nsuffered by Santiago.      See Albertsons, 119 S. Ct. at 2169 (fact\n\nthat plaintiff suffered monocular vision was, without more,\n\ninsufficient to establish disability).          Nor is there evidence\n\nthat the hearing loss actually affected Santiago’s activities in\n\nsome specific way.        See Still v. Freeport-McMoran, Inc., 120\n\nF.3d 50, 52 (5th Cir. 1997) (where plaintiff offered no evidence\n\nthat he is unable to engage in any usual activity because of\n\nblindness in one eye, major life activity of seeing is not\n\n\"substantially limited\").       Given her normal hearing in one ear\n\nand the existence of some residual hearing in the other, there\n\nis insufficient basis, without more, for assuming a substantial\n\nloss in overall hearing ability.          In short, Santiago has not\n\nadduced sufficient evidence that, compared to the average person\n\nin the general population, she was significantly restricted in\n\nher hearing.   See Albertsons, 119 S. Ct. at 2168-69; 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1630.2(j)(1).\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f            The same is even more true with regard to the major\n\nlife activity of speaking.              The record contains at most some\n\nevidence suggesting that Santiago’s tone of voice may have been\n\naffected by her impairment.             This is inadequate, without more\n\nand in light of the record discussed supra, for a reasonable\n\njury to conclude that her impairment substantially limited her\n\nspeaking.    See Davidson v. Midelfort Clinic, Ltd., 133 F.3d 499,\n\n507 (7th Cir. 1998) (where there was no evidence that disorder\n\naffected plaintiff’s ability to communicate generally, there was\n\nno   substantial     interference         with   her   ability        to   speak).\n\nMoreover,    Santiago    points    to     no   evidence    of   the    actual      or\n\nexpected long-term impact of her temporary hearing impairment.\n\nSee 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2)(iii).\n\n            In   sum,    under    the    fact-specific      analysis        of    the\n\nduration, severity, and long-term impact of Santiago’s hearing\n\nimpairment mandated by the ADA, see Katz, 87 F.3d at 32, we\n\nconclude     that   it   cannot    be     reasonably      construed        to    have\n\nsubstantially limited her major life activities of hearing and\n\nspeaking.4\n\n\n     4\n     Santiago contends that American Eagle’s denial of her\nrequest not to fly in unpressurized cabins caused her hearing\nloss. Assuming that this contention is true, it reads the ADA’s\nprotections backwards. Santiago’s present claim of disability\nfocuses on her hearing loss. She does not contend that she had\nthat disability at the time of her request, nor is it readily\napparent that the pain and other side effects she then reported\n\n                                        -15-\n\f                         2.     Working\n\n              Similarly, Santiago did not adduce sufficient evidence\n\nthat    her    impairment         substantially     limited      the   major    life\n\nactivity of working. EEOC regulations provide that this activity\n\nis     substantially           limited    only    where     an     individual    is\n\n\"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a\n\nclass of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as\n\ncompared      to   the    average     person     having    comparable   training,\n\nskills and abilities.\"            29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (1998).           The\n\nEEOC    further     identifies       several     factors    that   courts   should\n\nconsider when determining whether an individual is substantially\n\nlimited in working, including \"the number and types of jobs\n\nutilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities,\n\nwithin [the] geographical area [reasonably accessible to the\n\nindividual], from which the individual is also disqualified.\"\n\nId. § 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(B).\n\n              Hence, to be substantially limited in the major life\n\nactivity of working, Santiago must be precluded from more than\n\na particular job.             See Murphy v. United Parcel Servs., Inc., 119\n\nS. Ct. 2133, 2138 (1999); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i).\n\n\nfrom unpressurized flight were themselves disabilities within\nthe meaning of the ADA. See note 3, supra. An employer’s duty\nto accommodate relates only to existing disabilities.     See\nSoileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.\n1997).\n\n                                          -16-\n\fHer temporary hearing loss, however, was not shown to have\n\ninterfered       at   all   in   carrying      out    the    duties    of    a   flight\n\nattendant.       Even if her impairment were defined more broadly --\n\ni.e.,   as   a    condition      precluding        flight     on   non-pressurized\n\nairplanes -- there is no evidence of how many jobs call for this\n\nability, or that she was precluded from any class of jobs.\n\nMoreover, the record indicates that Santiago was qualified for\n\nvarious      ground      positions      at      American       Eagle,       including\n\nreceptionist, payroll clerk, and operational manager.                            Indeed,\n\nSantiago has successfully continued her employment at American\n\nEagle, and earns a higher salary than she did as a flight\n\nattendant.        As a matter of law, therefore, Santiago did not\n\nestablish that her impairment substantially limited her ability\n\nto work.     See Murphy, 119 S. Ct. at 2138-39.\n\n             Without        evidence        that       Santiago’s           impairment\n\nsubstantially         limited    any   of    the     three   claimed    major      life\n\nactivities, the district court correctly concluded that her\n\nclaim could not survive summary judgment.                    “Absent a disability\n\n. . . no obligations are triggered for the employer.”                         Soileau,\n\n105 F.3d at 15.5\n\n\n    5In Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S.\nCt. 2139 (1999), the Supreme Court held that corrective and\nmitigating measures must be considered in determining whether an\nindividual is disabled under the ADA.      119 S. Ct. at 2146.\nHence, courts must examine how an impairment affects a\n\n                                        -17-\n\f           B.           Having a record of such impairment\n\n           Santiago also has not adduced sufficient evidence to\n\nsatisfy    subpart       (B)   of    42    U.S.C.   §   12102(2),   in   which    a\n\ndisability is defined as \"a record of such an impairment.\"                       To\n\nhave a record of such an impairment, a plaintiff must have a\n\nhistory of, or been misclassified as having, an impairment that\n\nsubstantially limited a major life activity.                   See 29 C.F.R. §\n\n1630.2(k).\n\n           The regulations make clear that the recorded impairment\n\nmust be one that substantially limited a major life activity.\n\nSee id.; Sorensen v. University of Utah Hosp., 194 F.3d 1084,\n\n1087 (10th Cir. 1999); Hilburn v. Murata Elec. N. Am., Inc., 181\n\nF.3d   1220,     1229    (11th      Cir.   1999).       Santiago   points   to   no\n\nevidence    of    either       a    history   or    misdiagnosis    of   such    an\n\nimpairment.      Thus, her claim cannot proceed under subpart (B).\n\n           C.           \"Regarded as having such an impairment\"\n\n           Santiago additionally contends that she is entitled to\n\nrelief under the ADA because American Eagle regarded her as\n\n\nplaintiff's life activities in light of her attempts to correct\nher impairment, including hearing aids. See id.; Higgins, 194\nF.3d at 265; Ivy v. Jones, 192 F.3d 514, 516 (5th Cir. 1999).\nHere, the district court did not have the benefit of the Sutton\nopinion at the time it decided this case. Because we conclude\nthat Santiago’s impairment did not rise to the level of a\ndisability even in its unmitigated state, there is no need to\nremand this issue for further consideration by the district\ncourt in light of Sutton.\n\n                                           -18-\n\fhaving a substantially limiting impairment.                 EEOC regulations\n\ndefine “is regarded as having such an impairment” as:\n\n            (1) Has a physical or mental impairment that\n            does not substantially limit major life\n            activities but is treated by a covered\n            entity as constituting such limitation;\n\n            (2) Has a physical or mental impairment that\n            substantially limits major life activities\n            only as a result of the attitudes of others\n            toward such impairment; or\n\n            (3) Has [no physical or mental impairment\n            within the meaning of the regulations] but\n            is treated by a covered entity as having a\n            substantially limiting impairment.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(l).\n\n            In support of her argument, Santiago points to the\n\nfollowing evidence: the company-appointed doctor’s diagnosis of\n\na possible fistula and recommendation that she not fly until her\n\ncondition stabilized; the head of personnel’s suggestion that\n\nshe   see   a   psychologist      because     she    ”had    a    problem    of\n\nadaptation”;    and   her   use   of   a   hearing    aid.       Dr.   Murphy’s\n\nstatements do not, however, support a conclusion that Santiago\n\nwas treated by American Eagle as if she had a substantially\n\nlimiting impairment.        Dr. Murphy simply stated that Santiago\n\n“may have” a fistula, that she “may” not be able to fly again,\n\nand that Santiago should be temporarily removed from flying\n\nduties until her condition stabilized.              His comments concerned\n\nSantiago’s ability to fly in light of her symptoms.                    They did\n\n                                   -19-\n\fnot concern her ability to perform major life activities, i.e.,\n\nto hear, to speak, or to work in a class or range of jobs as\n\ndiscussed supra.\n\n         Moreover, the record indicates that the comment about\n\nSantiago’s problem of “adaptation” and her use of a hearing aid\n\ndid not occur until well after she had been transferred to a\n\npermanent ground position.    As discussed above, the claimed\n\ndisability must precede or at least be immediately related to\n\nthe request for accommodation.      See note 4, supra.   Santiago\n\ncannot complain that she was treated by American Eagle as having\n\na substantially limiting impairment after having received the\n\naccommodation she sought.\n\n         In sum, Santiago has not set forth sufficient evidence\n\nof the existence of a disability under any of the criteria\n\nprescribed by the statute and regulations.      Because American\n\nEagle had no legal duty to Santiago under the ADA, we need not\n\nconsider any of the further issues raised by the parties.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -20-\n\f",

See New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. v. Northeast Dairy Compact Comm'n, 198 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1999). Beginning December1, 1991, Santiago was employed by American Eagle. She became a flight attendant on November 30, 1994. On August 30, 1995, on a flight sequence to St. Croix, Santiago complained of ear pain and requested to be relieved from her schedule upon arrival in San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Santiago awoke with bleeding and pain in her ear. That day, her private physician diagnosed her with otitis media (ear infection) and ordered her to rest. Santiago went on sick leave from American Eagle. When her pain persisted, Santiago sought emergency room care and then treatment from Dr. Germaan Gonzaalez, an ear, nose and throat specialist. Dr. Gonzaalez diagnosed otitis media and sinusitis (sinus infection). Upon his recommendation, on October 10, 1995, Santiago reported her ear problem as a work-related injury to the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Eagle permitted Santiago to take sick leave from August 31, 1995, to early November, 1995. Following her sick leave, Santiago returned to work with no medical restrictions. She continued to experience pain, however, particularly during non-pressurized cabin flights. On November 15, 1995, Santiago underwent an audiogram, a subjective hearing test. This test indicated that she had a moderate hearing loss in the right ear, but no hearing loss in the left ear. In subjective hearing tests, the results depend upon the individual's verbal responses as to her perceptions of her ability or inability to hear certain sounds. In objective hearing tests, a physician determines hearing ability by observing the brain's response to sound; self-reporting is not a factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 5, 1995, Santiago sought additional treatment from the SIF physician, Dr. Pichardo, who diagnosed Santiago with acoustic trauma in her right ear and stated that Santiago should fly only in planes with pressurized cabins in order to \"minimize the effect of pressure\" in that ear. Santiago gave Dr. Pichardo's recommendation to her supervisor, Michelle Fajardo. Fajardo told her that the airline could not assign her to work solely in pressurized cabins because the relevant collective bargaining agreement precluded American Eagle from altering Santiago's flight sequences. Fajardo stated that Santiago had two options: she could continue flying without the requested accommodation, or she could resign. American Eagle did not offer any other options at this time. Other flight attendants who had requested accommodations due to ear problems had been offered ground positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this conversation, Santiago continued to fly on planes both with pressurized and unpressurized cabins. On March 1, 1996, Dr. Gonzaalez noted that Santiago had recovered from her otitis and sinusitis, but found that she had damage to her inner ear, resulting in auditory loss in the right ear and other symptoms. He recommended that she not fly until her condition improved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Santiago's own initiative, she ceased flying on March 19, 1996. A few days later, American Eagle referred her to a company-appointed physician, Dr. Thomas Murphy. Dr. Murphy stated that Santiago may have a fistula (an abnormal passageway) producing chronic ear problems and that she \"may not be able to fly again.\" He ordered that Santiago be temporarily removed from flying duties until her condition stabilized. Subjective hearing tests in or around April, 1996, reflected continued hearing loss in Santiago's right ear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around this time, American Eagle began searching for a ground position for Santiago. Accordingly, in early April, 1996, Santiago was transferred to a temporary receptionist position at the same salary level. In May, 1996, she became a payroll clerk; in June, 1997, Santiago took a permanent position as operational manager, earning a higher salary than she did as a flight attendant. On or around June 19, 1996, a co-worker complained about Santiago's \"tone of voice,\" i.e. that she was speaking too loudly. Ana Torres, the head of personnel, suggested that Santiago be referred to a psychologist because she \"had a problem of adaptation\" to her hearing loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1996, Dr. Gonzaalez performed an exploratory tympanotomy and closed a fistula. In July, 1996, he recommended that Santiago use a hearing aid and that she avoid \"constant airplane flights.\" Additional subjective hearing tests around that time reflected continued hearing loss in her right ear. Santiago did not start using the hearing aid until sometime after August 29, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 1997, Santiago filed a complaint alleging that her employer's conduct violated the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101 et seq., and Act Number 44 of July 2, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167;&#167; 501 (1982 &amp; Supp. 1992) (\"Puerto Rico Disabilities Law\"). In March, 1997, further subjective hearing tests indicated that Santiago had moderate to severe hearing loss in her right ear, while the left ear was normal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1997, Santiago underwent objective hearing tests for the first time, performed by otologist Dr. Fred Telischi. These tests suggested that her hearing was within the normal range in both ears. On January 21, 1998, she had additional objective hearing tests performed at the request of her expert witness, Dr. Josee Arsuaga, an ear, nose and throat specialist. After the tests, Dr. Arsuaga opined that Santiago's hearing capacity was within normal limits in both ears. He concluded that while Santiago had suffered aerotitis (damage to the middle ear caused by ambient pressure changes) and possible damage to the inner ear in 1995, she had recovered. Both Telischi and Arsuaga stated that Santiago may have exaggerated her responses in the earlier subjective audiology tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 17, 1998, Santiago moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, contending that American Eagle had failed to timely provide a reasonable accommodation and that this failure caused her hearing loss. American Eagle opposed Santiago's motion and cross-moved for summary judgment. In its motion, American Eagle did not dispute the facts presented by Santiago but set forth additional facts, some of which concerned the temporary nature of her hearing loss. Santiago opposed American Eagle's cross-motion, contending that some of the additional facts were disputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 1998, in a published opinion, the district court allowed American Eagle's motion for summary judgment. See Santiago Clemente v. Executive Airlines, 7 F. Supp.2d 114 (D.P.R. 1998). The district court determined that Santiago did not set forth sufficient evidence of a substantial limitation to a major life activity. Hence, it concluded, she failed to prove an element of her prima facie case under the ADA: that her impairment amounted to a disability. The court also dismissed Santiago's supplemental state law claim, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court reviews orders for summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999). Santiago contends that the district court did not properly construe the record in her favor, leading it erroneously to the conclusion that her condition did not constitute a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability. See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(a). Here, Santiago alleges that American Eagle failed reasonably to accommodate her alleged ear-related disability. To survive American Eagle's motion for summary judgment, she must furnish \"significantly probative evidence\" that, inter alia, she is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA and that, despite knowing of the disability, her employer did not reasonably accommodate it. See Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir. 1999); see also 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A) (under ADA, the term \"discriminate\" may include not making reasonable accommodations to known physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individual with disability).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we conclude that Santiago's ADA case founders for failure to show that she had a disability as that term has been construed for purposes of the statute. Not all physical impairments rise to the level of disability under the ADA. See Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 119 S. Ct. 2162, 2168-69 (1999). Rather, the ADA defines the term \"disability\" as (A) \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual,\" (B) \"a record of such an impairment,\" or (C) \"being regarded as having such an impairment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12102(2)(A)-(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Substantially limiting impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contending that she qualifies for ADA protection under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12102(2)(A), Santiago argues that her ear problems, principally the temporary right-ear hearing loss, substantially limited her major life activities of hearing, speaking, and working. Whether an impairment substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities is determined in a three-step analysis. See Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 631 (1998). First, we consider whether Santiago's ear problems constituted a physical impairment. Second, we identify the life activities upon which Santiago relies -- hearing, speaking, and working -- and determine whether they constitute major life activities under the ADA. Third, tying the two statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment substantially limited one or more of the activities found to amount to major life activities. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read most favorably to Santiago, her evidence satisfies the first two requirements of this analysis. Her ear problems were an impairment under the relevant EEOC definitions, being a \"physiological disorder or condition\" affecting \"special sense organs.\" See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(h)(1). And the three activities claimed to have been impaired -- hearing, speaking, and working -- are all explicitly recognized as \"major life activities\" under EEOC regulations. See id. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(i); see also Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dept., 158 F.3d 635, 642 (2d Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1018 (1999) (activities listed in EEOC regulations are treated as major life activities per se, rather than as major life activities only to the extent that they are shown to affect a particular ADA plaintiff).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where Santiago's claim encounters difficulty is at the third and final step of the analysis: her ear impairment was not shown to have substantially interfered with her performance of any of the identified major life activities. EEOC regulations define \"substantially limits\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(1). Among the relevant considerations are (1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; (3) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment. See id. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Hearing and speaking</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago has not provided evidence sufficient to demonstrate that her claimed impairment substantially interfered with hearing or speaking. The Supreme Court recently emphasized that a court must determine on a case-by-case basis whether an individual has offered sufficient evidence \"that the extent of the limitation in terms of [her] own experience . . . is substantial.\" Albertsons, 119 S. Ct. at 2169. As the EEOC regulations instruct, we examine the evidence of the duration, severity, and long-term impact of Santiago's alleged limitations. See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for duration, it is undisputed that Santiago's auditory problems were temporary and that her hearing is now normal. Beginning in November, 1995, Santiago underwent subjective tests. These reflected a hearing loss in her right ear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> By November, 1997, objective tests showed that her hearing was normal in both ears and there is no evidence of hearing loss beyond that time. Hence, a reasonable jury could conclude that, at most, Santiago experienced moderate to severe hearing loss in one ear for approximately two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as the district court acknowledged, that the temporary nature of an impairment does not necessarily preclude it from constituting a disability under the ADA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although short-term, temporary restrictions generally are not substantially limiting, an impairment does not necessarily have to be permanent to rise to the level of a disability. Some conditions may be long-term or potentially long-term, in that their duration is indefinite and unknowable or is expected to be at least several months. Such conditions, if severe, may constitute disabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz v. City Metal Co., Inc., 87 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing 2 EEOC Compliance Manual, Interpretations (CCH) &#167;&#167; 902.4, &#182;&#182; 6884, p. 5319 (1995)) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is debatable whether Santiago's treating physicians considered her ear-related impairment to be permanent, long-term or potentially long-term. For example, in March, 1996, Dr. Gonzaalez recommended that Santiago not fly \"until\" her condition improved, and Dr. Murphy stated that Santiago should be temporarily removed from flying duties until her condition stabilized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Santiago's impairment was potentially long-term, however, there is no evidence that the temporary diminution in her right-ear hearing had a severe impact on her functional ability to hear. See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(i). The record at most supports a possible finding that Santiago's hearing loss was moderate to severe in one ear only. An audiological evaluation summary dated March 3, 1997, states that \"Counseling [was] provided relative to impairments associated with the unilateral hearing loss, namely, the inability to perform sound localization, and difficulty with speech discrimination in noisy environments.\" No evidence, however, identifies the overall functional degree of loss suffered by Santiago. See Albertsons, 119 S. Ct. at 2169 (fact that plaintiff suffered monocular vision was, without more, insufficient to establish disability). Nor is there evidence that the hearing loss actually affected Santiago's activities in some specific way. See Still v. Freeport-McMoran, Inc., 120 F.3d 50, 52 (5th Cir. 1997) (where plaintiff offered no evidence that he is unable to engage in any usual activity because of blindness in one eye, major life activity of seeing is not \"substantially limited\"). Given her normal hearing in one ear and the existence of some residual hearing in the other, there is insufficient basis, without more, for assuming a substantial loss in overall hearing ability. In short, Santiago has not adduced sufficient evidence that, compared to the average person in the general population, she was significantly restricted in her hearing. See Albertsons, 119 S. Ct. at 2168-69; 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is even more true with regard to the major life activity of speaking. The record contains at most some evidence suggesting that Santiago's tone of voice may have been affected by her impairment. This is inadequate, without more and in light of the record discussed supra, for a reasonable jury to conclude that her impairment substantially limited her speaking. See Davidson v. Midelfort Clinic, Ltd., 133 F.3d 499, 507 (7th Cir. 1998) (where there was no evidence that disorder affected plaintiff's ability to communicate generally, there was no substantial interference with her ability to speak). Moreover, Santiago points to no evidence of the actual or expected long-term impact of her temporary hearing impairment. See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, under the fact-specific analysis of the duration, severity, and long-term impact of Santiago's hearing impairment mandated by the ADA, see Katz, 87 F.3d at 32, we conclude that it cannot be reasonably construed to have substantially limited her major life activities of hearing and speaking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Working</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Santiago did not adduce sufficient evidence that her impairment substantially limited the major life activity of working. EEOC regulations provide that this activity is substantially limited only where an individual is \"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (1998). The EEOC further identifies several factors that courts should consider when determining whether an individual is substantially limited in working, including \"the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within [the] geographical area [reasonably accessible to the individual], from which the individual is also disqualified.\" Id. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, Santiago must be precluded from more than a particular job. See Murphy v. United Parcel Servs., Inc., 119 S. Ct. 2133, 2138 (1999); see also 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i). Her temporary hearing loss, however, was not shown to have interfered at all in carrying out the duties of a flight attendant. Even if her impairment were defined more broadly -- i.e., as a condition precluding flight on non-pressurized airplanes -- there is no evidence of how many jobs call for this ability, or that she was precluded from any class of jobs. Moreover, the record indicates that Santiago was qualified for various ground positions at American Eagle, including receptionist, payroll clerk, and operational manager. Indeed, Santiago has successfully continued her employment at American Eagle, and earns a higher salary than she did as a flight attendant. As a matter of law, therefore, Santiago did not establish that her impairment substantially limited her ability to work. See Murphy, 119 S. Ct. at 2138-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without evidence that Santiago's impairment substantially limited any of the three claimed major life activities, the district court correctly concluded that her claim could not survive summary judgment. \"Absent a disability . . . no obligations are triggered for the employer.\" Soileau, 105 F.3d at 15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Having a record of such impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also has not adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy subpart (B) of 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12102(2), in which a disability is defined as \"a record of such an impairment.\" To have a record of such an impairment, a plaintiff must have a history of, or been misclassified as having, an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(k).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations make clear that the recorded impairment must be one that substantially limited a major life activity. See id.; Sorensen v. University of Utah Hosp., 194 F.3d 1084, 1087 (10th Cir. 1999); Hilburn v. Murata Elec. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 1999). Santiago points to no evidence of either a history or misdiagnosis of such an impairment. Thus, her claim cannot proceed under subpart (B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. \"Regarded as having such an impairment\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago additionally contends that she is entitled to relief under the ADA because American Eagle regarded her as having a substantially limiting impairment. EEOC regulations define \"is regarded as having such an impairment\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Has [no physical or mental impairment within the meaning of the regulations] but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of her argument, Santiago points to the following evidence: the company-appointed doctor's diagnosis of a possible fistula and recommendation that she not fly until her condition stabilized; the head of personnel's suggestion that she see a psychologist because she \"had a problem of adaptation\"; and her use of a hearing aid. Dr. Murphy's statements do not, however, support a conclusion that Santiago was treated by American Eagle as if she had a substantially limiting impairment. Dr. Murphy simply stated that Santiago \"may have\" a fistula, that she \"may\" not be able to fly again, and that Santiago should be temporarily removed from flying duties until her condition stabilized. His comments concerned Santiago's ability to fly in light of her symptoms. They did not concern her ability to perform major life activities, i.e., to hear, to speak, or to work in a class or range of jobs as discussed supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record indicates that the comment about Santiago's problem of \"adaptation\" and her use of a hearing aid did not occur until well after she had been transferred to a permanent ground position. As discussed above, the claimed disability must precede or at least be immediately related to the request for accommodation. See note 4, supra. Santiago cannot complain that she was treated by American Eagle as having a substantially limiting impairment after having received the accommodation she sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Santiago has not set forth sufficient evidence of the existence of a disability under any of the criteria prescribed by the statute and regulations. Because American Eagle had no legal duty to Santiago under the ADA, we need not consider any of the further issues raised by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To the extent that Santiago's opposition to American Eagle's motion for summary judgment indicated factual controversies, none are material to our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We look to the well-reasoned views of the agencies implementing a statute, which \"constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\" Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 642 (quoting Skidmore v.

Assuming that this contention is true, it reads the ADA's protections backwards. Santiago's present claim of disability focuses on her hearing loss. She does not contend that she had that disability at the time of her request, nor is it readily apparent that the pain and other side effects she then reported from unpressurized flight were themselves disabilities within the meaning of the ADA. See note 3, supra. An employer's duty to accommodate relates only to existing disabilities. See Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139 (1999), the Supreme Court held that corrective and mitigating measures must be considered in determining whether an individual is disabled under the ADA. 119 S. Ct. at 2146. Hence, courts must examine how an impairment affects a plaintiff's life activities in light of her attempts to correct her impairment, including hearing aids. See id.; Higgins, 194 F.3d at 265; Ivy v. Jones, 192 F.3d 514, 516 (5th Cir. 1999). Here, the district court did not have the benefit of the Sutton opinion at the time it decided this case. Because we conclude that Santiago's impairment did not rise to the level of a disability even in its unmitigated state, there is no need to remand this issue for further consideration by the district court in light of Sutton.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Beginning December1, 1991, Santiago was employed by American Eagle. She became a flight attendant on November 30, 1994. On August 30, 1995, on a flight sequence to St. Croix, Santiago complained of ear pain and requested to be relieved from her schedule upon arrival in San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Santiago awoke with bleeding and pain in her ear. That day, her private physician diagnosed her with otitis media (ear infection) and ordered her to rest. Santiago went on sick leave from American Eagle. When her pain persisted, Santiago sought emergency room care and then treatment from Dr. Germaan Gonzaalez, an ear, nose and throat specialist. Dr. Gonzaalez diagnosed otitis media and sinusitis (sinus infection). Upon his recommendation, on October 10, 1995, Santiago reported her ear problem as a work-related injury to the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Eagle permitted Santiago to take sick leave from August 31, 1995, to early November, 1995. Following her sick leave, Santiago returned to work with no medical restrictions. She continued to experience pain, however, particularly during non-pressurized cabin flights. On November 15, 1995, Santiago underwent an audiogram, a subjective hearing test. This test indicated that she had a moderate hearing loss in the right ear, but no hearing loss in the left ear. In subjective hearing tests, the results depend upon the individual's verbal responses as to her perceptions of her ability or inability to hear certain sounds. In objective hearing tests, a physician determines hearing ability by observing the brain's response to sound; self-reporting is not a factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 5, 1995, Santiago sought additional treatment from the SIF physician, Dr. Pichardo, who diagnosed Santiago with acoustic trauma in her right ear and stated that Santiago should fly only in planes with pressurized cabins in order to \"minimize the effect of pressure\" in that ear. Santiago gave Dr. Pichardo's recommendation to her supervisor, Michelle Fajardo. Fajardo told her that the airline could not assign her to work solely in pressurized cabins because the relevant collective bargaining agreement precluded American Eagle from altering Santiago's flight sequences. Fajardo stated that Santiago had two options: she could continue flying without the requested accommodation, or she could resign. American Eagle did not offer any other options at this time. Other flight attendants who had requested accommodations due to ear problems had been offered ground positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this conversation, Santiago continued to fly on planes both with pressurized and unpressurized cabins. On March 1, 1996, Dr. Gonzaalez noted that Santiago had recovered from her otitis and sinusitis, but found that she had damage to her inner ear, resulting in auditory loss in the right ear and other symptoms. He recommended that she not fly until her condition improved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Santiago's own initiative, she ceased flying on March 19, 1996. A few days later, American Eagle referred her to a company-appointed physician, Dr. Thomas Murphy. Dr. Murphy stated that Santiago may have a fistula (an abnormal passageway) producing chronic ear problems and that she \"may not be able to fly again.\" He ordered that Santiago be temporarily removed from flying duties until her condition stabilized. Subjective hearing tests in or around April, 1996, reflected continued hearing loss in Santiago's right ear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around this time, American Eagle began searching for a ground position for Santiago. Accordingly, in early April, 1996, Santiago was transferred to a temporary receptionist position at the same salary level. In May, 1996, she became a payroll clerk; in June, 1997, Santiago took a permanent position as operational manager, earning a higher salary than she did as a flight attendant. On or around June 19, 1996, a co-worker complained about Santiago's \"tone of voice,\" i.e. that she was speaking too loudly. Ana Torres, the head of personnel, suggested that Santiago be referred to a psychologist because she \"had a problem of adaptation\" to her hearing loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1996, Dr. Gonzaalez performed an exploratory tympanotomy and closed a fistula. In July, 1996, he recommended that Santiago use a hearing aid and that she avoid \"constant airplane flights.\" Additional subjective hearing tests around that time reflected continued hearing loss in her right ear. Santiago did not start using the hearing aid until sometime after August 29, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 1997, Santiago filed a complaint alleging that her employer's conduct violated the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101 et seq., and Act Number 44 of July 2, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167;&#167; 501 (1982 &amp; Supp. 1992) (\"Puerto Rico Disabilities Law\"). In March, 1997, further subjective hearing tests indicated that Santiago had moderate to severe hearing loss in her right ear, while the left ear was normal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1997, Santiago underwent objective hearing tests for the first time, performed by otologist Dr. Fred Telischi. These tests suggested that her hearing was within the normal range in both ears. On January 21, 1998, she had additional objective hearing tests performed at the request of her expert witness, Dr. Josee Arsuaga, an ear, nose and throat specialist. After the tests, Dr. Arsuaga opined that Santiago's hearing capacity was within normal limits in both ears. He concluded that while Santiago had suffered aerotitis (damage to the middle ear caused by ambient pressure changes) and possible damage to the inner ear in 1995, she had recovered. Both Telischi and Arsuaga stated that Santiago may have exaggerated her responses in the earlier subjective audiology tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 17, 1998, Santiago moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, contending that American Eagle had failed to timely provide a reasonable accommodation and that this failure caused her hearing loss. American Eagle opposed Santiago's motion and cross-moved for summary judgment. In its motion, American Eagle did not dispute the facts presented by Santiago but set forth additional facts, some of which concerned the temporary nature of her hearing loss. Santiago opposed American Eagle's cross-motion, contending that some of the additional facts were disputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 1998, in a published opinion, the district court allowed American Eagle's motion for summary judgment. See Santiago Clemente v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span> </a></span>(D.P.R. 1998). The district court determined that Santiago did not set forth sufficient evidence of a substantial limitation to a major life activity. Hence, it concluded, she failed to prove an element of her prima facie case under the ADA: that her impairment amounted to a disability. The court also dismissed Santiago's supplemental state law claim, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court reviews orders for summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.

Santiago contends that the district court did not properly construe the record in her favor, leading it erroneously to the conclusion that her condition did not constitute a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability. See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(a). Here, Santiago alleges that American Eagle failed reasonably to accommodate her alleged ear-related disability. To survive American Eagle's motion for summary judgment, she must furnish \"significantly probative evidence\" that, inter alia, she is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA and that, despite knowing of the disability, her employer did not reasonably accommodate it. See Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198690\"><a href=\"/opinion/198690/higgins-v-new-balance/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, 264 (1st Cir. 1999); see also 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A) (under ADA, the term \"discriminate\" may include not making reasonable accommodations to known physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individual with disability).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we conclude that Santiago's ADA case founders for failure to show that she had a disability as that term has been construed for purposes of the statute. Not all physical impairments rise to the level of disability under the ADA. See Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118314\"><a href=\"/opinion/118314/albertsons-inc-v-kirkingburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2162</span></a></span>, 2168-69 (1999). Rather, the ADA defines the term \"disability\" as (A) \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual,\" (B) \"a record of such an impairment,\" or (C) \"being regarded as having such an impairment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12102(2)(A)-(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Substantially limiting impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contending that she qualifies for ADA protection under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12102(2)(A), Santiago argues that her ear problems, principally the temporary right-ear hearing loss, substantially limited her major life activities of hearing, speaking, and working. Whether an impairment substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities is determined in a three-step analysis. See Bragdon v. Abbott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 631 (1998). First, we consider whether Santiago's ear problems constituted a physical impairment. Second, we identify the life activities upon which Santiago relies -- hearing, speaking, and working -- and determine whether they constitute major life activities under the ADA. Third, tying the two statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment substantially limited one or more of the activities found to amount to major life activities. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read most favorably to Santiago, her evidence satisfies the first two requirements of this analysis. Her ear problems were an impairment under the relevant EEOC definitions, being a \"physiological disorder or condition\" affecting \"special sense organs.\" See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(h)(1). And the three activities claimed to have been impaired -- hearing, speaking, and working -- are all explicitly recognized as \"major life activities\" under EEOC regulations.

EEOC regulations define \"substantially limits\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(1). Among the relevant considerations are (1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; (3) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment. See id. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Hearing and speaking</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago has not provided evidence sufficient to demonstrate that her claimed impairment substantially interfered with hearing or speaking. The Supreme Court recently emphasized that a court must determine on a case-by-case basis whether an individual has offered sufficient evidence \"that the extent of the limitation in terms of [her] own experience . . . is substantial.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118314\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Albertsons,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118314/albertsons-inc-v-kirkingburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for duration, it is undisputed that Santiago's auditory problems were temporary and that her hearing is now normal. Beginning in November, 1995, Santiago underwent subjective tests. These reflected a hearing loss in her right ear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> By November, 1997, objective tests showed that her hearing was normal in both ears and there is no evidence of hearing loss beyond that time. Hence, a reasonable jury could conclude that, at most, Santiago experienced moderate to severe hearing loss in one ear for approximately two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as the district court acknowledged, that the temporary nature of an impairment does not necessarily preclude it from constituting a disability under the ADA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although short-term, temporary restrictions generally are not substantially limiting, an impairment does not necessarily have to be permanent to rise to the level of a disability. Some conditions may be long-term or potentially long-term, in that their duration is indefinite and unknowable or is expected to be at least several months. Such conditions, if severe, may constitute disabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz v.

For example, in March, 1996, Dr. Gonzaalez recommended that Santiago not fly \"until\" her condition improved, and Dr. Murphy stated that Santiago should be temporarily removed from flying duties until her condition stabilized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Santiago's impairment was potentially long-term, however, there is no evidence that the temporary diminution in her right-ear hearing had a severe impact on her functional ability to hear. See 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(i). The record at most supports a possible finding that Santiago's hearing loss was moderate to severe in one ear only. An audiological evaluation summary dated March 3, 1997, states that \"Counseling [was] provided relative to impairments associated with the unilateral hearing loss, namely, the inability to perform sound localization, and difficulty with speech discrimination in noisy environments.\" No evidence, however, identifies the overall functional degree of loss suffered by Santiago.

Given her normal hearing in one ear and the existence of some residual hearing in the other, there is insufficient basis, without more, for assuming a substantial loss in overall hearing ability. In short, Santiago has not adduced sufficient evidence that, compared to the average person in the general population, she was significantly restricted in her hearing. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118314\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Albertsons,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118314/albertsons-inc-v-kirkingburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The record contains at most some evidence suggesting that Santiago's tone of voice may have been affected by her impairment. This is inadequate, without more and in light of the record <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">discussed</span> supra</span>, for a reasonable jury to conclude that her impairment substantially limited her speaking.

EEOC regulations provide that this activity is substantially limited only where an individual is \"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (1998). The EEOC further identifies several factors that courts should consider when determining whether an individual is substantially limited in working, including \"the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within [the] geographical area [reasonably accessible to the individual], from which the individual is also disqualified.\" Id. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, Santiago must be precluded from more than a particular job.

Her temporary hearing loss, however, was not shown to have interfered at all in carrying out the duties of a flight attendant. Even if her impairment were defined more broadly -- i.e., as a condition precluding flight on non-pressurized airplanes -- there is no evidence of how many jobs call for this ability, or that she was precluded from any class of jobs. Moreover, the record indicates that Santiago was qualified for various ground positions at American Eagle, including receptionist, payroll clerk, and operational manager. Indeed, Santiago has successfully continued her employment at American Eagle, and earns a higher salary than she did as a flight attendant. As a matter of law, therefore, Santiago did not establish that her impairment substantially limited her ability to work.

EEOC regulations define \"is regarded as having such an impairment\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Has [no physical or mental impairment within the meaning of the regulations] but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1630.2(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of her argument, Santiago points to the following evidence: the company-appointed doctor's diagnosis of a possible fistula and recommendation that she not fly until her condition stabilized; the head of personnel's suggestion that she see a psychologist because she \"had a problem of adaptation\"; and her use of a hearing aid. Dr. Murphy's statements do not, however, support a conclusion that Santiago was treated by American Eagle as if she had a substantially limiting impairment. Dr. Murphy simply stated that Santiago \"may have\" a fistula, that she \"may\" not be able to fly again, and that Santiago should be temporarily removed from flying duties until her condition stabilized. His comments concerned Santiago's ability to fly in light of her symptoms. They did not concern her ability to perform major life activities, i.e., to hear, to speak, or to work in a class or range of jobs as <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">discussed</span> supra</span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record indicates that the comment about Santiago's problem of \"adaptation\" and her use of a hearing aid did not occur until well after she had been transferred to a permanent ground position. As discussed above, the claimed disability must precede or at least be immediately related to the request for accommodation. See note <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">4,</span> supra</span>. Santiago cannot complain that she was treated by American Eagle as having a substantially limiting impairment after having received the accommodation she sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Santiago has not set forth sufficient evidence of the existence of a disability under any of the criteria prescribed by the statute and regulations. Because American Eagle had no legal duty to Santiago under the ADA, we need not consider any of the further issues raised by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To the extent that Santiago's opposition to American Eagle's motion for summary judgment indicated factual controversies, none are material to our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We look to the well-reasoned views of the agencies implementing a statute, which \"constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bragdon,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">642</span> </a></span>(quoting Skidmore v.

Assuming that this contention is true, it reads the ADA's protections backwards. Santiago's present claim of disability focuses on her hearing loss. She does not contend that she had that disability at the time of her request, nor is it readily apparent that the pain and other side effects she then reported from unpressurized flight were themselves disabilities within the meaning of the ADA.

Here, the district court did not have the benefit of the Sutton opinion at the time it decided this case. Because we conclude that Santiago's impairment did not rise to the level of a disability even in its unmitigated state, there is no need to remand this issue for further consideration by the district court in light of Sutton.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
