The Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission (Commission) appeals from a directed verdict entered in\n\nfavor of defendants-appellees, Dennis J. Shepard, Michael G. Sargent,\n\nand Robert J. Scharn. The Commission also challenges the district\n\ncourt's denial of its request for pre-trial discovery and the district\n\ncourt's decision to exclude the criminal convictions of Sargent and\n\nScharn for lying to Commission investigators. The district court had\n\njurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(3), 78u(e), 78u-1,\n\nand 78aa.   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.      We\n\nreverse and remand for new trial.\n\n                                   I\n\n            Shepard and J. Anthony Aldrich (against whom the Commission\n\ndid not file a complaint) were the sole shareholders of a consulting\n\nfirm incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Aldrich was\n\nalso a member of the board of directors for Purolator Products Co.\n\n(Purolator), a manufacturer of automotive parts. On July 13, 1994,\n\nMark IV Industries, Inc. (Mark IV) offered to purchase all of the\n\noutstanding shares of Purolator for $22 a share. Negotiations between\n\nthe two companies ensued, and on October 3, 1994, Purolator and Mark IV\n\npublicly announced Purolator's acceptance of Mark IV's tender offer of\n\n$25 a share.\n\n            Throughout 1994, Shepard and Aldrich ran their consulting\n\nbusiness from a 20' by 15', one-room office located in Shepard's\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fbasement.    The firm used a telephone, voice mail system, and fax\n\nmachine from a single line. Shepard could hear what Aldrich said on\n\nthe telephone and would occasionally retrieve voice mail messages and\n\nfaxes for Aldrich.     Aldrich realized that given the \"very close\n\nquarters,\" it was \"inevitable [Shepard] would know something was going\n\non [with Purolator]. He was going to hear something.\" At some point\n\nin July 1994, Aldrich took Shepard into his confidence and advised him\n\nthat Purolator was being pursued. Aldrich told Shepard that this fact\n\nneeded to be kept confidential and Shepard agreed not to disclose the\n\ninformation.\n\n            The Purolator Board met several times between Mark IV's\n\ninitial offer of July 13 and October 3, 1994. By mid-August, Purolator\n\nhad retained Lehman Brothers, Inc. to advise it in the negotiations.\n\nPurolator initially sought to remain independent, but its focus\n\ngradually changed to getting the best price from the highest bidder.\n\nIt initiated discussion with at least two other companies in an effort\n\nto raise the price.      On September 8, Purolator entered into a\n\nStandstill Agreement with Mark IV in which it agreed to provide Mark IV\n\nwith access to nonpublic information and Mark IV agreed not to effect\n\na hostile takeover while negotiations were pending. Mark IV made two\n\nadditional offers that Purolator rejected before Purolator accepted the\n\noffer of $25 a share on October 3, 1994.\n\n            On Saturday, September 10, 1994, Shepard, Sargent, and their\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fwives met for dinner. Sargent had been Shepard's dentist since 1983,\n\nand the two were \"friendly.\" Shepard had referred at least 75 of his\n\nrelatives, friends, and acquaintances to Sargent for their dental work.\n\nShepard was actively involved in the local chamber of commerce.\n\nBecause Sargent had many community ties, Shepard would \"go to [Sargent]\n\nperiodically\" for \"contacts, networking to other individuals,\" and to\n\nlook for funds on behalf of the chamber of commerce.\n\n          The Sargents and Shepards met for dinner to smooth out some\n\nproblems that had developed between them. Shepard's sister-in-law,\n\nDonna, had been hired to decorate the Sargents' home and had been paid\n\na $1000 retainer. She never completed the work, and the Sargents were\n\nunable to recover the retainer because she had filed for bankruptcy.\n\nSargent was hoping that Shepard could work something out. Another of\n\nShepard's sisters-in-law, Brenda, had skipped several of her dental\n\nappointments with Sargent without giving him notice. Sargent informed\n\nher that the next time she did so, he would charge her for the missed\n\nappointment. Brenda wrote Sargent a \"scathing letter\" complaining of\n\nthis treatment and threatening to use Shepard's influence to draw\n\ncustomers away from Sargent's practice.\n\n          At the dinner, the Sargents and Shepards also talked about\n\nShepard's consulting business. Shepard asked Mrs. Sargent \"whether she\n\ncould give [him] leads in connection with [his] consulting business.\"\n\nHe talked about his partner, Aldrich, and mentioned that Aldrich was on\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe Purolator board. After dinner, the couples attended the opening of\n\na new restaurant. While their wives were in the ladies' room, Sargent\n\nand Shepard continued talking. At some point in that conversation,\n\nShepard said, \"I am aware of a company right now that is probably going\n\nto be bought,\" but \"even if I had the money . . . I can't buy stock in\n\nthis company because I am too close to the situation.\" The Commission\n\nalleges that during this conversation Shepard explicitly identified\n\nPurolator as the company to be bought.\n\n          The following Monday, September 12, Sargent contacted Brian\n\nKelly, his broker at Legg Mason, before the market opened. Sargent\n\ntold Kelly, \"I heard something over the weekend and it concerns\n\nPurolator Products.\" He asked Kelly to do some research on Purolator.\n\nSargent called Kelly back that same morning. When asked by Kelly where\n\nhe had heard about Purolator, Sargent was evasive and may have replied\n\nthat his friend Scharn had overheard two men at a bar talking about\n\nPurolator. Kelly reported that Purolator had not been doing much, that\n\nit was trading close to its 52-week low, and that it was not the kind\n\nof stock Sargent usually chose to purchase. Kelly went so far as to\n\ncall Purolator a \"piece of crap,\" but he told Sargent that if he wanted\n\nto invest in Purolator there was only a $1 to $2 downside risk.\n\nSargent then purchased 2000 shares of Purolator. The next day, Sargent\n\nbought an additional 2000 shares through his account at Charles Schwab\n\nCorp., a discount brokerage firm.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          Between September 12 and October 3, 1994, Sargent purchased\n\na total of 20,400 shares of Purolator at an average price of $17.67 per\n\nshare. This was the largest investment in a single stock that Sargent\n\nhad ever made. To finance his purchases, Sargent borrowed $50,000 from\n\na bank, bought shares on margin, and replaced stock he held in another\n\ncompany with risky call options in that same company. Sargent had\n\nnever before taken out a loan to buy stock. Within a few days of the\n\ntender offer announcement, Sargent sold all of his Purolator stock at\n\na profit of $140,000.\n\n          Sargent notified his close friend Scharn of his purchases in\n\nPurolator. On September 19, 1994, Scharn purchased 5000 shares of\n\nPurolator, his largest stock purchase of the year. Scharn did not\n\nperform any research at all on Purolator. In order to raise the money\n\nfor this purchase, Scharn sold 10,000 shares of Telefonica de Argentina\n\nat a loss of $5000. When his broker asked him where he had heard about\n\nPurolator, Scharn responded that he had overheard two men discussing\n\nPurolator at the bar of the restaurant he owned.      Later, when the\n\ntender offer was announced, Scharn remarked to his broker that \"he knew\n\nthat it was going to happen.\"\n\n          Sargent was first contacted by the Commission on January 4,\n\n1995. Peter Sonnenthal, an attorney with the Commission, conducted the\n\ninterview. When questioned about his stock purchases, Sargent told\n\nSonnenthal that his friend Scharn advised him to buy Purolator after\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fScharn had overheard \"two guys\" at his bar talking about the company.\n\nAfter this interview, Sargent contacted Scharn to tell him about the\n\nphone call with Sonnenthal; Sargent also advised Scharn that the\n\nCommission might contact him as well. The Commission conducted two\n\nadditional telephone interviews with Sargent in which Sargent did not\n\nchange his story and in which he denied talking to Shepard about\n\nPurolator.   The Commission contacted Scharn on January 10, 1995.\n\nScharn repeated the story about overhearing two men discuss Purolator.\n\nHe even provided the Commission with phony descriptions of the two men.\n\n          The Commission subpoenaed both Sargent and Scharn. During\n\ntheir depositions, both Sargent and Scharn admitted lying to the\n\nCommission representative about Purolator. Sargent's new explanation\n\nfor the purchases was that he had acted on a hunch based on two pieces\n\nof information he had learned at the dinner with Shepard, namely the\n\nstatements by Shepard (1) that Aldrich was on the Board of Purolator,\n\nand (2) that he knew of a company that was going to be taken over, but\n\nin which he could not invest because he was too close to the situation.\n\nSargent asserts that Shepard never told him that Purolator was the\n\ncompany that was going to be acquired.\n\n          On May 7, 1996, a grand jury in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts returned indictments against\n\nSargent and Scharn for making false statements to government officials\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.      Sargent was also charged with\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\finsider trading in connection with a tender offer in violation of\n\nSecurities Exchange Act § 14(e), 15 U.S.C. § 78n(e) (section 14(e)),\n\nand Rule 14e-3 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14e-3 (Rule 14e-\n\n3). The court granted Sargent's motion for a judgment of acquittal on\n\nthe insider trading charges. The jury returned guilty verdicts against\n\nSargent and Scharn for lying to the Commission. The court sentenced\n\nSargent and Scharn on December 16, 1998.\n\n           This action was filed March 25, 1996. In its complaint, the\n\nCommission alleged that the defendants had tipped or traded in\n\nPurolator on the basis of material, nonpublic information that Shepard\n\nhad misappropriated from Aldrich. The Commission asserted that this\n\nactivity violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15\n\nU.S.C. § 78j(b) (section 10(b)), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,\n\n17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5 (Rule 10b-5). The complaint also alleged that the\n\ndefendants violated section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3. The Commission\n\nsought orders enjoining Shepard, Sargent, and Scharn from future\n\nviolations of these provisions and requiring them to disgorge their\n\nprofits.\n\n           In June 1996, the United States Attorney intervened in this\n\ncase and successfully moved to stay discovery. In March 1998, the\n\ndistrict court issued another stay of discovery, pending completion of\n\nthe criminal trial of Sargent and Scharn. At the conclusion of the\n\ncriminal trial, all of the defendants moved for summary judgment; the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdistrict court granted another stay of discovery, pending the\n\ndisposition of these motions. On July 29, 1999, the court denied the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment and scheduled a pretrial\n\nconference for August 4, 1999.     At the pretrial conference, the\n\ndistrict court announced that it would not permit further discovery.\n\n          As a result of the many discovery stays, the Commission had\n\nconducted virtually no discovery in this case. The Commission was\n\ntherefore required to rely on the information gathered in its initial\n\ninvestigation and from the criminal trial. The witness list submitted\n\nby the defendants contained three persons whose testimony the\n\nCommission had never taken. Prior to trial, the Commission requested\n\nleave of the district court to take the deposition of Gerald Lippes,\n\ngeneral counsel to Mark IV.     This request was denied.\n\n          At trial, the district court excluded evidence of the\n\nconvictions of Sargent and Scharn for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 over\n\nthe repeated objections of the Commission.      At the close of the\n\nCommission's evidence, the district court orally granted the\n\ndefendants' motion for a directed verdict, holding that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence that Shepard tipped Sargent on the evening of\n\nSeptember 10, 1994.\n\n                                 II\n\n          The Commission appeals from the judgment as a matter of law\n\nentered in favor of the defendants at the close of the Commission's\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fevidence. We review this issue de novo, Wills v. Brown University, 184\n\nF.3d 20, 29 (1st Cir. 1999), mindful that a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)(1) should be\n\ngranted only where, after examining all the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party, the court finds that a reasonable\n\njury could not render a verdict for the non-movant. Irvine v. Murad\n\nSkin Research Labs., Inc., 194 F.3d 313, 316 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                  A.\n\n          In granting the defendants' motion for a directed verdict,\n\nthe district court only addressed the issue of whether Shepard had\n\nprovided Sargent with nonpublic information.       The district court\n\ncorrectly observed, and the Commission conceded, that there could be no\n\nviolation of section 10(b), section 14(e), Rule 10b-5, or Rule 14e-3 if\n\nSargent traded on a mere hunch arrived at by putting together the fact\n\nthat Aldrich was on the Purolator Board, which was public information,\n\nwith the statement made by Shepard that he knew of a company being\n\npursued. To prevail on its claims, the Commission must show that\n\nShepard communicated nonpublic information about Purolator to Sargent.\n\nUnited States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 652, 669 (1997); United States\n\nv. Libera, 989 F.2d 596, 600 (2d Cir. 1993).        To that end, the\n\nCommission alleged that \"Shepard formed the necessary words, moved his\n\nlips, and told Sargent that he was aware of a company, Purolator, that\n\nwas 'probably going to be bought.' \"\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          As is often true in securities fraud cases, the Commission\n\nwas unable to produce direct testimony establishing that Shepard\n\ncommunicated nonpublic information to Sargent. The Commission instead\n\nrelied on circumstantial evidence to prove its allegation. It pointed\n\nto Sargent's behavior following his dinner with Shepard as evidence\n\nthat Sargent must have been proceeding on something more than a hunch.\n\nThe district judge rejected this evidence, stating, \"you can't build\n\ninference on inference on inference.\" He commented that the Commission\n\nwas not making \"reasonable use of circumstantial evidence\" and that\n\ntheir circumstantial evidence could not \"be a surrogate for a [direct]\n\nstatement of insider information.\"\n\n          Although it is true that mere conjecture or speculation over\n\nthe evidence will not rise to a triable issue of fact, Irvine, 194 F.3d\n\nat 317, a plaintiff is not required to produce direct evidence:\n\n\"circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of\n\nadmissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is\n\nentitled to be given whatever weight the jury deems it should be given\n\nunder the circumstances within which it unfolds.\" United States v.\n\nGamache, 156 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Here, the Commission presented evidence that the first\n\nbusiness day following his dinner with Shepard, Sargent contacted his\n\nbroker before the market opened and stated that he had heard something\n\nover the weekend about Purolator. A few hours later, Sargent bought\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fPurolator even after receiving a negative recommendation from his\n\nbroker. When asked by his broker how he had heard about Purolator,\n\nSargent was evasive, and there was some evidence that even at that\n\nearly stage, he was telling the \"two guys in a bar\" lie. Over the next\n\nthree weeks, Sargent purchased 20,400 shares, his largest investment\n\never in a single stock.    He even took out a $50,000 bank loan to\n\nfinance the purchase.\n\n          After resolving all doubts and credibility issues in favor\n\nof the Commission, we conclude that a jury could reasonably infer from\n\nthis evidence that Sargent was operating on more than just a hunch and\n\nthat he had received nonpublic information from Shepard about\n\nPurolator.\n\n                                 B.\n\n          In their joint motion for a directed verdict, Shepard,\n\nSargent, and Scharn raised additional grounds that the district court\n\ndid not reach in granting their motion. On appeal, they argue that\n\nthese alternate grounds independently require us to affirm all or part\n\nof the district court's judgment. We are not restricted to reviewing\n\nonly those grounds explicitly addressed by the district court in its\n\nruling; rather, we may affirm the judgment on any independently\n\nsufficient ground squarely presented to us and to the district court.\n\nOlsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 57-58 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                 1.\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f          In order to prevail on its section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5\n\nclaims against the appellees, the Commission must demonstrate that\n\nShepard, the alleged misappropriator, breached a fiduciary duty owed to\n\nAldrich, the source of the nonpublic, material information about\n\nPurolator. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. at 652. The appellees contend that the\n\nCommission failed to present sufficient evidence of a fiduciary\n\nrelationship between Shepard and Aldrich to survive a motion for\n\ndirected verdict as to these claims.\n\n          In the context of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 liability\n\npremised on the misappropriation theory, the existence of a fiduciary\n\nrelationship turns on whether the source of the misappropriated\n\ninformation granted the misappropriator access to confidential\n\ninformation in reliance on a promise by the misappropriator that the\n\ninformation would be safeguarded. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. at 652 (\"[T]he\n\nmisappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-\n\ntrader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to\n\nconfidential information.\"); United States v. Chestman, 947 F.2d 551,\n\n569 (2d Cir. 1991) (en banc) (\"In relying on a fiduciary to act for his\n\nbenefit, the beneficiary of the relation may entrust the fiduciary with\n\n. . . property . . . . Because the fiduciary obtains access to this\n\nproperty to serve the ends of the fiduciary relationship, he becomes\n\nduty-bound not to appropriate the property for his own use.\").\n\n          At trial, the Commission presented evidence that Aldrich\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fexpressly told Shepard that Purolator was being pursued and that\n\nShepard promised not to divulge this information. Further, there was\n\ntrial testimony from which a jury could reasonably infer that Aldrich\n\nrelied on this promise, since throughout the Purolator negotiations\n\nAldrich continued to share an office with Shepard, an office which he\n\ndescribed as being \"very close quarters\" and in which it was\n\n\"inevitable [that Shepard] would know something was going on.\"\n\n          In addition, the Commission presented evidence of a pre-\n\nexisting fiduciary relationship between Shepard and Aldrich arising out\n\nof their status as sole shareholders of their closely-held business\n\ncorporation.    Under Massachusetts law, stockholders of such a\n\ncorporation \"owe one another a duty of 'utmost good faith and loyalty.'\n\n\" Leader v. Hycor, Inc., 479 N.E.2d 173, 177 (Mass. 1985), quoting\n\nDonahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co., 328 N.E.2d 505, 515 (Mass. 1975).\n\nThus, the duties between Shepard and Aldrich as shareholders mirror\n\nthose owed between partners in a partnership. Donahue, 328 N.E.2d at\n\n512 (\"Just as in a partnership, the relationship among stockholders\n\nmust be one of trust, confidence and absolute loyalty if the enterprise\n\nis to succeed.\"). Shareholders \"may not act out of avarice, expediency\n\nor self-interest in derogation of their duty of loyalty to the other\n\nstockholders and to the corporation.\" Id. at 515. This strict duty\n\napplies to \"actions relative to the operations of the enterprise and\n\nthe effects of that operation on the rights and investments of other\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fstockholders.\"    Id. at 515 n.18.\n\n          Shepard argues that he could not have breached this duty to\n\nhis co-shareholder because any information regarding Purolator did not\n\nrelate to the operations of the Aldrich-Shepard consulting firm. The\n\ndefendant in SEC v. Peters, 735 F. Supp. 1505 (D. Kan. 1990), made the\n\nsame argument in the context of a partnership.      In that case, the\n\ndefendant had misappropriated from his partner confidential information\n\nregarding a non-partnership, business interest. The defendant argued\n\nthat he had breached no fiduciary duty because the information did not\n\nrelate to partnership matters. The court disagreed, holding that it\n\nwas clear \"under the expectations of the [] partners, a partner's\n\nconversion for personal use of confidential information belonging to\n\nanother partner would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. The\n\npartnership expected that all business matters of each partner would be\n\nheld in trust and confidence.\"       Id. at 1521.\n\n          In the case before us, evidence was presented that both\n\nShepard and Aldrich considered it improper to open the other's personal\n\nmail delivered to the office, to read the other's personal faxes that\n\ncame in on the office's sole fax machine, or to go through the other's\n\npersonal files. Even though Aldrich knew Shepard might inadvertently\n\noverhear information about Purolator, Aldrich remained in the small\n\noffice with Shepard because he trusted Shepard to keep such information\n\nconfidential. Shepard testified that he would not have disclosed\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\finformation regarding Purolator to anyone because he knew \"that it was\n\nconfidential, [Aldrich] didn't even have to tell me that . . . I\n\nunderstand,   you   know,   my   responsibilities,     you   know,   my\n\nresponsibilities to anyone.\" We conclude, after reviewing the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the Commission, that a jury could\n\nreasonably find that Shepard and Aldrich expected that confidential\n\nbusiness matters, even those unrelated to the consulting firm, would be\n\nheld in trust and that Shepard thereby owed a fiduciary duty to\n\nsafeguard information relating to Purolator.\n\n                                  2.\n\n          In addition, the appellees urge that we affirm the district\n\ncourt's entry of judgment on the section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims on\n\nthe basis that the Commission failed to present evidence that Shepard\n\nbenefitted from the alleged tip to Sargent. Under the classical theory\n\nof insider trading, an insider who provides a tip but who does not\n\nhimself trade will be liable under 10b-5 only if he \"will benefit,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, from his disclosure.\" Dirks v. SEC, 463 U.S.\n\n646, 662 (1983). In addition, tippees are not liable under Rule 10b-5\n\nunless benefit to the original tipper is proven. SEC v. Warde, 151\n\nF.3d 42, 47 (2d Cir. 1998). The \"benefit\" to the tipper need not be\n\n\"specific or tangible.\" Id. at 48-49. A gift to a friend or relative\n\nis sufficient.    Id.\n\n          There is some disagreement about whether benefit to a\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fmisappropriating tipper is a required element of section 10(b) and Rule\n\n10b-5 liability. A few district court opinions, one of which was\n\nvacated on other grounds, hold that there is a benefit requirement in\n\nmisappropriation cases. SEC v. Trikilis, 1992 WL 301398, at *3 (C.D.\n\nCal. July 28, 1992), vacated, 1993 WL 43571 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 1993);\n\nUnited States v. Santoro, 647 F. Supp. 153, 170 (E.D.N.Y. 1986); SEC v.\n\nGaspar, 1985 WL 521, at *16-17 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 1985). However, two\n\ndistrict court opinions have stated outright, albeit in dicta, that\n\nthere is no benefit requirement in misappropriation cases. SEC v.\n\nWillis, 777 F. Supp. 1165, 1172 n. 7 (S.D.N.Y. 1991); SEC v. Musella,\n\n748 F. Supp. 1028, 1038 n. 4 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). In addition, the Second\n\nCircuit strongly implied, also in dicta, that there was no need to make\n\nan affirmative showing of benefit in cases of misappropriation. It\n\nwrote:\n\n          The tipper's knowledge that he or she was\n          breaching a duty to the owner of confidential\n          information suffices to establish the tipper's\n          expectation that the breach will lead to some\n          kind of misuse of the information. This is so\n          because it may be presumed that the tippee's\n          interest in the information is, in contemporary\n          jargon, not for nothing.\n\nLibera, 989 F.2d at 600. Further, in the context of tippee liability,\n\nthe court stated in the same case that, \"the misappropriation theory\n\nrequires the establishment of two elements: (i) a breach by the tipper\n\nof a duty owed to the owner of nonpublic information; and (ii) the\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\ftippee's knowledge that the tipper had breached the duty. We believe\n\nthese two elements, without more, are sufficient for tippee liability.\"\n\nId. (citations omitted). Thus, it appears from these statements that\n\nthe Second Circuit would probably not require a showing of benefit to\n\nthe tipper for tipper (or tippee) liability, but would create a\n\npresumption of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 liability if there was\n\nmisappropriation followed by a tip.\n\n          We need not resolve this conflict to reach a decision in this\n\ncase because, whether or not a misappropriating tipper must benefit in\n\norder to violate section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, the Commission presented\n\nsufficient evidence at trial from which a jury could reasonably\n\nconclude that Shepard did benefit from his alleged tip to Sargent. At\n\ntrial, Shepard testified that he and Sargent were \"friendly.\" Shepard\n\nhad referred over 75 people to Sargent for their dental work. Further,\n\nShepard stated that he often went to Sargent for help in connection\n\nwith Shepard's service to the local chamber of commerce. Shepard's\n\nsister-in-law owed Sargent money and another of Shepard's relatives was\n\nthreatening to harm Sargent's business. From this evidence, a jury\n\ncould infer that Shepard tipped Sargent about Purolator in an effort to\n\neffect a reconciliation with his friend and to maintain a useful\n\nnetworking contact.\n\n                                  3.\n\n          Scharn asserts separately that we should affirm the judgment\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fas to him because there was insufficient evidence for a jury reasonably\n\nto find that Sargent provided him with nonpublic information. Scharn\n\ndid not perform any research prior to his purchase of Purolator;\n\ninstead, he relied solely on Sargent's recommendation. His investment\n\nin Purolator was his largest investment of that year. When asked by\n\nhis broker where he had heard about Purolator, Scharn lied and said he\n\nhad overheard two men at his restaurant discussing the company. This\n\nis the same story that both Sargent and Scharn would later tell the\n\nCommission. After the tender offer was publicly announced, Scharn told\n\nhis broker that \"he knew it was going to happen.\"\n\n          Of course, Scharn sees it differently. He points out that\n\nhe claimed to have said the same thing whenever he made a profit on an\n\ninvestment and that he frequently bought stock based on what Sargent\n\nwas doing.   He also states that his purchase in Purolator was not\n\naberrational because he had made investments of similar magnitude\n\nwithout doing any research.\n\n          So there is a conflict as to inferences to be drawn. The\n\nCommission and Scharn have their own argument.        In reaching our\n\ndecision, however, we must resolve all doubts and questions of\n\ncredibility in favor of the Commission's case. Irvine, 194 F.3d at\n\n316-17.   We conclude that a jury could reasonably find from the\n\ncircumstantial evidence presented by the Commission that Scharn\n\npossessed nonpublic, material information given him by Sargent.\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f                                  4.\n\n          The appellees also argue that the Commission failed to\n\nproduce evidence that they knew Purolator would be purchased by means\n\nof a tender offer, a fact appellees contend must be established as a\n\nprerequisite to Rule 14e-3 liability. Were we to agree with appellees'\n\ninterpretation of Rule 14e-3, this argument would have some merit. The\n\ntestimony about the conditions in the office shared by Shepard and\n\nAldrich is the only evidence from which a jury could infer that Shepard\n\nknew the form that the acquisition of Purolator would take. To find\n\nthat Sargent and Scharn knew the form the transaction would take, a\n\njury would have to speculate about the exact content of Shepard's\n\ncommunication to Sargent and of Sargent's tip to Scharn.\n\n          The plain language of Rule 14e-3, however, contradicts the\n\nappellees’ interpretation:\n\n            (a) If any person has taken a substantial step\n          or steps to commence . . . a tender offer . . .\n          it shall constitute a fraudulent . . . act . . .\n          within the meaning of section 14(e) of the Act\n          for any other person who is in possession of\n          material information relating to such tender\n          offer which information he knows or has reason to\n          know is nonpublic and which he knows or has\n          reason to know has been acquired directly or\n          indirectly from [an inside source]. . . to\n          purchase or sell . . . any of such securities .\n          . . unless within a reasonable time prior to any\n          purchase or sale such information and its source\n          are publicly disclosed . . . .\n\n             . . . .\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f            (d)(1) . . . it shall be unlawful for any\n          person . . . to communicate nonpublic information\n          relating to a tender offer to any other person\n          under circumstances in which it is reasonably\n          foreseeable that such communication is likely to\n          result in a violation of this section . . . .\n\n17 C.F.R. § 240.14e-3.     There is simply no language in the Rule\n\nindicating that a defendant must know that the nonpublic information in\n\nhis possession relates to a tender offer.\n\n          The Eighth Circuit reached a similar conclusion when faced\n\nwith the issue of whether Rule 14e-3 requires that a defendant know\n\nthat substantial steps toward a tender offer have been taken. United\n\nStates v. O’Hagan, 139 F.3d 641, 650 (8th Cir. 1998), holds:\n\n          Rule 14e-3(a) requires that \"any person\" must\n          have taken \"a substantial step or steps\" towards\n          the tender offer. The rule does not require the\n          defendant to have knowledge of these acts.\n          Instead, the defendant need only \"know[] or have\n          reason to know\" that the material information is\n          \"nonpublic and has been acquired directly or\n          indirectly from\" the tender offeror in some way.\"\n\n\nId.\n\n          Further, when the Commission promulgated Rule 14e-3, it\n\nexplained in the accompanying release that the Rule did not require the\n\ntrader to know that the nonpublic information related to a tender\n\noffer:\n\n          As adopted, the information which will trigger\n          the operation of the Rule (1) must be material,\n          (2) must relate to a tender offer, (3) must be\n          nonpublic and (4) must have been acquired\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f          directly or indirectly from the offering person,\n          from the issuer or from another specified person.\n          For the last two requisites, there is a \"knows or\n          has reason to know\" standard by the person who\n          has possession of the information. For the first\n          two requisites, i.e., materiality and relation to\n          a tender offer, there is no \"knows or has reason\n          to know\" standard.\n\nTender Offers, Exchange Act Release No. 17120, 1980 WL 20869, at *6\n\n(Sept. 4, 1980).   The Supreme Court has observed that \"[b]ecause\n\nCongress has authorized the Commission, in § 14(e), to prescribe\n\nlegislative rules, we owe the Commission's judgment 'more than mere\n\ndeference or weight.' \" O’Hagan, 521 U.S. at 673, quoting Batterton v.\n\nFrancis, 432 U.S. 416, 424-26 (1977); see also Cohen v. Brown\n\nUniversity, 101 F.3d 155, 173 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that it is\n\n\"well settled\" that if Congress has expressly delegated to an agency\n\nthe power to prescribe regulations, the resulting regulations must be\n\naccorded controlling weight if they are not arbitrary or capricious).\n\nWe must defer to the Commission's interpretation \"unless [it is]\n\narbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\" Chevron\n\nU.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n\n844 (1984); see also Beaver Plant Operations, Inc. v. Herman, 2000 WL\n\n1239950, at *3 (1st Cir. Sept 7, 2000) (stating that an \"agency's\n\ninterpretation [of its own regulation] should be given full effect if\n\nit is reasonable\"). Since the plain language of the rule leads us to\n\nthe same interpretation the Commission reached, the Commission's\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fapproach is manifestly reasonable. We hold that Rule 14e-3 does not\n\nrequire that a person charged with violating the rule have knowledge\n\nthat the nonpublic information in his possession relates to a tender\n\noffer.   Therefore, appellees' contention is rejected.\n\n          Thus, neither the basis upon which the district court made\n\nits ruling nor the reasons suggested by appellees to save the directed\n\nverdict can be sustained.     A new trial is required.\n\n                                 III\n\n          In its appeal, the Commission asserts that the district court\n\nincorrectly excluded the convictions of Sargent and Scharn for lying to\n\nthe Commission in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001. The district court\n\napplied the balancing test of Federal Rule of Evidence 403 (Rule 403)\n\nto exclude these convictions, reasoning that since the defendants had\n\ntestified at trial about their lies, the prejudicial impact of\n\nadmitting the convictions outweighed the probative value of the\n\nevidence. The district judge remarked to the Commission, \"[Y]ou get\n\nall the probative value you need because the witness admitted he lied.\"\n\nThe Commission asserts that the trial court misconstrued 609(a)(2) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 609(a)(2)) when it applied Rule 403\n\nto exclude the convictions. We address this issue because it will\n\nundoubtedly arise during a new trial.\n\n          The interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a\n\nquestion of law which we review de novo. Correiro, 189 F.3d at 58;\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fUnited States v. Sposito, 106 F.3d 1042, 1046 (1st Cir. 1997). Rule\n\n609(a)(2) provides:     \"(a) . . . For the purpose of attacking the\n\ncredibility of a witness, . . . . (2) evidence that any witness has\n\nbeen convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty\n\nor false statement, regardless of the punishment.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nWithout question, a conviction for lying to a government official is a\n\ncrime of \"dishonesty or false statement,\" and we have plainly held that\n\ndistrict courts do not have discretion to exclude prior convictions\n\ninvolving dishonesty or false statements. United States v. Tracy, 36\n\nF.3d 187, 192 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Kiendra, 663 F.2d 349,\n\n354 (1st Cir. 1981) (\"[W]e are driven by the force of explicit\n\nstatutory language and legislative history to hold that evidence\n\noffered under Rule 609(a)(2) is not subject to the general balancing\n\nprovision of Rule 403.\").\n\n          Further, it is of no consequence that Sargent and Scharn\n\ntestified about their lies. The Commission was entitled to attack the\n\ndefendants' credibility more forcefully by presenting the fact that the\n\ndefendants had been convicted of \"knowingly and willfully\" making a\n\n\"materially    false,   fictitious,     or   fraudulent   statement   or\n\nrepresentation\" to a government official.           18 U.S.C. § 1001.\n\nRule 609(a)(2) simply does not allow for any judicial discretion on\n\nthis point. The district court committed error in excluding these\n\nconvictions.\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f                                  IV\n\n          The Commission also contends in its appeal that the district\n\ncourt erred when it denied the Commission's motion for pre-trial\n\ndiscovery. Trial judges enjoy broad discretion in managing pretrial\n\ndiscovery. We may intervene \"only upon a clear showing of manifest\n\ninjustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly\n\nwrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"\n\nMack v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir.\n\n1989); see also City of Waltham v. U.S. Postal Service, 11 F.3d 235,\n\n243 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          The Supreme Court has long recognized that the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure are to be construed liberally in favor of discovery.\n\nHickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507 (1947) (\"[T]he deposition-\n\ndiscovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment.\").\n\nHere, even though the Commission had already conducted a pre-filing\n\ninvestigation and had access to the evidence from the criminal trial of\n\nSargent and Scharn, \"there is no authority which suggests that it is\n\nappropriate to limit the SEC's right to take discovery based upon the\n\nextent of its previous investigation into the facts underlying its\n\ncase.\" SEC v. Saul, 133 F.R.D. 115, 118 (N.D. Ill. 1990). We need\n\nnot, however, decide whether the district court was \"plainly wrong\" in\n\nlimiting discovery since a new trial is required, and the opportunity\n\nof pretrial discovery will be reconsidered. At that time, the district\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fcourt will have the benefit of our view that discovery should not have\n\nbeen foreclosed to the Commission merely because of its pre-filing\n\ninvestigation or information secured from the Sargent and Scharn\n\ncriminal trials.\n\n          REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.\n\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f",

The Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission (Commission) appeals from a directed verdict entered in\n\nfavor of defendants-appellees, Dennis J. Shepard, Michael G. Sargent,\n\nand Robert J. Scharn. The Commission also challenges the district\n\ncourt's denial of its request for pre-trial discovery and the district\n\ncourt's decision to exclude the criminal convictions of Sargent and\n\nScharn for lying to Commission investigators. The district court had\n\njurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(3), 78u(e), 78u-1,\n\nand 78aa.   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.      We\n\nreverse and remand for new trial.\n\n                                   I\n\n            Shepard and J. Anthony Aldrich (against whom the Commission\n\ndid not file a complaint) were the sole shareholders of a consulting\n\nfirm incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Aldrich was\n\nalso a member of the board of directors for Purolator Products Co.\n\n(Purolator), a manufacturer of automotive parts. On July 13, 1994,\n\nMark IV Industries, Inc. (Mark IV) offered to purchase all of the\n\noutstanding shares of Purolator for $22 a share. Negotiations between\n\nthe two companies ensued, and on October 3, 1994, Purolator and Mark IV\n\npublicly announced Purolator's acceptance of Mark IV's tender offer of\n\n$25 a share.\n\n            Throughout 1994, Shepard and Aldrich ran their consulting\n\nbusiness from a 20' by 15', one-room office located in Shepard's\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fbasement.    The firm used a telephone, voice mail system, and fax\n\nmachine from a single line. Shepard could hear what Aldrich said on\n\nthe telephone and would occasionally retrieve voice mail messages and\n\nfaxes for Aldrich.     Aldrich realized that given the \"very close\n\nquarters,\" it was \"inevitable [Shepard] would know something was going\n\non [with Purolator]. He was going to hear something.\" At some point\n\nin July 1994, Aldrich took Shepard into his confidence and advised him\n\nthat Purolator was being pursued. Aldrich told Shepard that this fact\n\nneeded to be kept confidential and Shepard agreed not to disclose the\n\ninformation.\n\n            The Purolator Board met several times between Mark IV's\n\ninitial offer of July 13 and October 3, 1994. By mid-August, Purolator\n\nhad retained Lehman Brothers, Inc. to advise it in the negotiations.\n\nPurolator initially sought to remain independent, but its focus\n\ngradually changed to getting the best price from the highest bidder.\n\nIt initiated discussion with at least two other companies in an effort\n\nto raise the price.      On September 8, Purolator entered into a\n\nStandstill Agreement with Mark IV in which it agreed to provide Mark IV\n\nwith access to nonpublic information and Mark IV agreed not to effect\n\na hostile takeover while negotiations were pending. Mark IV made two\n\nadditional offers that Purolator rejected before Purolator accepted the\n\noffer of $25 a share on October 3, 1994.\n\n            On Saturday, September 10, 1994, Shepard, Sargent, and their\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fwives met for dinner. Sargent had been Shepard's dentist since 1983,\n\nand the two were \"friendly.\" Shepard had referred at least 75 of his\n\nrelatives, friends, and acquaintances to Sargent for their dental work.\n\nShepard was actively involved in the local chamber of commerce.\n\nBecause Sargent had many community ties, Shepard would \"go to [Sargent]\n\nperiodically\" for \"contacts, networking to other individuals,\" and to\n\nlook for funds on behalf of the chamber of commerce.\n\n          The Sargents and Shepards met for dinner to smooth out some\n\nproblems that had developed between them. Shepard's sister-in-law,\n\nDonna, had been hired to decorate the Sargents' home and had been paid\n\na $1000 retainer. She never completed the work, and the Sargents were\n\nunable to recover the retainer because she had filed for bankruptcy.\n\nSargent was hoping that Shepard could work something out. Another of\n\nShepard's sisters-in-law, Brenda, had skipped several of her dental\n\nappointments with Sargent without giving him notice. Sargent informed\n\nher that the next time she did so, he would charge her for the missed\n\nappointment. Brenda wrote Sargent a \"scathing letter\" complaining of\n\nthis treatment and threatening to use Shepard's influence to draw\n\ncustomers away from Sargent's practice.\n\n          At the dinner, the Sargents and Shepards also talked about\n\nShepard's consulting business. Shepard asked Mrs. Sargent \"whether she\n\ncould give [him] leads in connection with [his] consulting business.\"\n\nHe talked about his partner, Aldrich, and mentioned that Aldrich was on\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe Purolator board. After dinner, the couples attended the opening of\n\na new restaurant. While their wives were in the ladies' room, Sargent\n\nand Shepard continued talking. At some point in that conversation,\n\nShepard said, \"I am aware of a company right now that is probably going\n\nto be bought,\" but \"even if I had the money . . . I can't buy stock in\n\nthis company because I am too close to the situation.\" The Commission\n\nalleges that during this conversation Shepard explicitly identified\n\nPurolator as the company to be bought.\n\n          The following Monday, September 12, Sargent contacted Brian\n\nKelly, his broker at Legg Mason, before the market opened. Sargent\n\ntold Kelly, \"I heard something over the weekend and it concerns\n\nPurolator Products.\" He asked Kelly to do some research on Purolator.\n\nSargent called Kelly back that same morning. When asked by Kelly where\n\nhe had heard about Purolator, Sargent was evasive and may have replied\n\nthat his friend Scharn had overheard two men at a bar talking about\n\nPurolator. Kelly reported that Purolator had not been doing much, that\n\nit was trading close to its 52-week low, and that it was not the kind\n\nof stock Sargent usually chose to purchase. Kelly went so far as to\n\ncall Purolator a \"piece of crap,\" but he told Sargent that if he wanted\n\nto invest in Purolator there was only a $1 to $2 downside risk.\n\nSargent then purchased 2000 shares of Purolator. The next day, Sargent\n\nbought an additional 2000 shares through his account at Charles Schwab\n\nCorp., a discount brokerage firm.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          Between September 12 and October 3, 1994, Sargent purchased\n\na total of 20,400 shares of Purolator at an average price of $17.67 per\n\nshare. This was the largest investment in a single stock that Sargent\n\nhad ever made. To finance his purchases, Sargent borrowed $50,000 from\n\na bank, bought shares on margin, and replaced stock he held in another\n\ncompany with risky call options in that same company. Sargent had\n\nnever before taken out a loan to buy stock. Within a few days of the\n\ntender offer announcement, Sargent sold all of his Purolator stock at\n\na profit of $140,000.\n\n          Sargent notified his close friend Scharn of his purchases in\n\nPurolator. On September 19, 1994, Scharn purchased 5000 shares of\n\nPurolator, his largest stock purchase of the year. Scharn did not\n\nperform any research at all on Purolator. In order to raise the money\n\nfor this purchase, Scharn sold 10,000 shares of Telefonica de Argentina\n\nat a loss of $5000. When his broker asked him where he had heard about\n\nPurolator, Scharn responded that he had overheard two men discussing\n\nPurolator at the bar of the restaurant he owned.      Later, when the\n\ntender offer was announced, Scharn remarked to his broker that \"he knew\n\nthat it was going to happen.\"\n\n          Sargent was first contacted by the Commission on January 4,\n\n1995. Peter Sonnenthal, an attorney with the Commission, conducted the\n\ninterview. When questioned about his stock purchases, Sargent told\n\nSonnenthal that his friend Scharn advised him to buy Purolator after\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fScharn had overheard \"two guys\" at his bar talking about the company.\n\nAfter this interview, Sargent contacted Scharn to tell him about the\n\nphone call with Sonnenthal; Sargent also advised Scharn that the\n\nCommission might contact him as well. The Commission conducted two\n\nadditional telephone interviews with Sargent in which Sargent did not\n\nchange his story and in which he denied talking to Shepard about\n\nPurolator.   The Commission contacted Scharn on January 10, 1995.\n\nScharn repeated the story about overhearing two men discuss Purolator.\n\nHe even provided the Commission with phony descriptions of the two men.\n\n          The Commission subpoenaed both Sargent and Scharn. During\n\ntheir depositions, both Sargent and Scharn admitted lying to the\n\nCommission representative about Purolator. Sargent's new explanation\n\nfor the purchases was that he had acted on a hunch based on two pieces\n\nof information he had learned at the dinner with Shepard, namely the\n\nstatements by Shepard (1) that Aldrich was on the Board of Purolator,\n\nand (2) that he knew of a company that was going to be taken over, but\n\nin which he could not invest because he was too close to the situation.\n\nSargent asserts that Shepard never told him that Purolator was the\n\ncompany that was going to be acquired.\n\n          On May 7, 1996, a grand jury in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts returned indictments against\n\nSargent and Scharn for making false statements to government officials\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.      Sargent was also charged with\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\finsider trading in connection with a tender offer in violation of\n\nSecurities Exchange Act § 14(e), 15 U.S.C. § 78n(e) (section 14(e)),\n\nand Rule 14e-3 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14e-3 (Rule 14e-\n\n3). The court granted Sargent's motion for a judgment of acquittal on\n\nthe insider trading charges. The jury returned guilty verdicts against\n\nSargent and Scharn for lying to the Commission. The court sentenced\n\nSargent and Scharn on December 16, 1998.\n\n           This action was filed March 25, 1996. In its complaint, the\n\nCommission alleged that the defendants had tipped or traded in\n\nPurolator on the basis of material, nonpublic information that Shepard\n\nhad misappropriated from Aldrich. The Commission asserted that this\n\nactivity violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15\n\nU.S.C. § 78j(b) (section 10(b)), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,\n\n17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5 (Rule 10b-5). The complaint also alleged that the\n\ndefendants violated section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3. The Commission\n\nsought orders enjoining Shepard, Sargent, and Scharn from future\n\nviolations of these provisions and requiring them to disgorge their\n\nprofits.\n\n           In June 1996, the United States Attorney intervened in this\n\ncase and successfully moved to stay discovery. In March 1998, the\n\ndistrict court issued another stay of discovery, pending completion of\n\nthe criminal trial of Sargent and Scharn. At the conclusion of the\n\ncriminal trial, all of the defendants moved for summary judgment; the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdistrict court granted another stay of discovery, pending the\n\ndisposition of these motions. On July 29, 1999, the court denied the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment and scheduled a pretrial\n\nconference for August 4, 1999.     At the pretrial conference, the\n\ndistrict court announced that it would not permit further discovery.\n\n          As a result of the many discovery stays, the Commission had\n\nconducted virtually no discovery in this case. The Commission was\n\ntherefore required to rely on the information gathered in its initial\n\ninvestigation and from the criminal trial. The witness list submitted\n\nby the defendants contained three persons whose testimony the\n\nCommission had never taken. Prior to trial, the Commission requested\n\nleave of the district court to take the deposition of Gerald Lippes,\n\ngeneral counsel to Mark IV.     This request was denied.\n\n          At trial, the district court excluded evidence of the\n\nconvictions of Sargent and Scharn for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 over\n\nthe repeated objections of the Commission.      At the close of the\n\nCommission's evidence, the district court orally granted the\n\ndefendants' motion for a directed verdict, holding that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence that Shepard tipped Sargent on the evening of\n\nSeptember 10, 1994.\n\n                                 II\n\n          The Commission appeals from the judgment as a matter of law\n\nentered in favor of the defendants at the close of the Commission's\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fevidence.

A few hours later, Sargent bought\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fPurolator even after receiving a negative recommendation from his\n\nbroker. When asked by his broker how he had heard about Purolator,\n\nSargent was evasive, and there was some evidence that even at that\n\nearly stage, he was telling the \"two guys in a bar\" lie. Over the next\n\nthree weeks, Sargent purchased 20,400 shares, his largest investment\n\never in a single stock.    He even took out a $50,000 bank loan to\n\nfinance the purchase.\n\n          After resolving all doubts and credibility issues in favor\n\nof the Commission, we conclude that a jury could reasonably infer from\n\nthis evidence that Sargent was operating on more than just a hunch and\n\nthat he had received nonpublic information from Shepard about\n\nPurolator.\n\n                                 B.\n\n          In their joint motion for a directed verdict, Shepard,\n\nSargent, and Scharn raised additional grounds that the district court\n\ndid not reach in granting their motion.

In addition, the Second\n\nCircuit strongly implied, also in dicta, that there was no need to make\n\nan affirmative showing of benefit in cases of misappropriation. It\n\nwrote:\n\n          The tipper's knowledge that he or she was\n          breaching a duty to the owner of confidential\n          information suffices to establish the tipper's\n          expectation that the breach will lead to some\n          kind of misuse of the information. This is so\n          because it may be presumed that the tippee's\n          interest in the information is, in contemporary\n          jargon, not for nothing.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603511\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Libera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/603511/united-states-v-benjamin-b-libera-and-francis-r-sablone-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Further, in the context of tippee liability,\n\nthe court stated in the same case that, \"the misappropriation theory\n\nrequires the establishment of two elements: (i) a breach by the tipper\n\nof a duty owed to the owner of nonpublic information; and (ii) the\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\ftippee's knowledge that the tipper had breached the duty. We believe\n\nthese two elements, without more, are sufficient for tippee liability.\"\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603511\"><a href=\"/opinion/603511/united-states-v-benjamin-b-libera-and-francis-r-sablone-jr/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citations omitted). </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Thus, it appears from these statements that\n\nthe Second Circuit would probably not require a showing of benefit to\n\nthe tipper for tipper (or tippee) liability, but would create a\n\npresumption of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 liability if there was\n\nmisappropriation followed by a tip.\n\n          We need not resolve this conflict to reach a decision in this\n\ncase because, whether or not a misappropriating tipper must benefit in\n\norder to violate section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, the Commission presented\n\nsufficient evidence at trial from which a jury could reasonably\n\nconclude that Shepard did benefit from his alleged tip to Sargent. At\n\ntrial, Shepard testified that he and Sargent were \"friendly.\" Shepard\n\nhad referred over 75 people to Sargent for their dental work. Further,\n\nShepard stated that he often went to Sargent for help in connection\n\nwith Shepard's service to the local chamber of commerce. Shepard's\n\nsister-in-law owed Sargent money and another of Shepard's relatives was\n\nthreatening to harm Sargent's business. From this evidence, a jury\n\ncould infer that Shepard tipped Sargent about Purolator in an effort to\n\neffect a reconciliation with his friend and to maintain a useful\n\nnetworking contact.\n\n                                  3.\n\n          Scharn asserts separately that we should affirm the judgment\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fas to him because there was insufficient evidence for a jury reasonably\n\nto find that Sargent provided him with nonpublic information. Scharn\n\ndid not perform any research prior to his purchase of Purolator;\n\ninstead, he relied solely on Sargent's recommendation. His investment\n\nin Purolator was his largest investment of that year. When asked by\n\nhis broker where he had heard about Purolator, Scharn lied and said he\n\nhad overheard two men at his restaurant discussing the company. This\n\nis the same story that both Sargent and Scharn would later tell the\n\nCommission. After the tender offer was publicly announced, Scharn told\n\nhis broker that \"he knew it was going to happen.\"\n\n          Of course, Scharn sees it differently. He points out that\n\nhe claimed to have said the same thing whenever he made a profit on an\n\ninvestment and that he frequently bought stock based on what Sargent\n\nwas doing.   He also states that his purchase in Purolator was not\n\naberrational because he had made investments of similar magnitude\n\nwithout doing any research.\n\n          So there is a conflict as to inferences to be drawn. The\n\nCommission and Scharn have their own argument.        In reaching our\n\ndecision, however, we must resolve all doubts and questions of\n\ncredibility in favor of the Commission's case. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198713\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Irvine,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198713/irvine-v-murad/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at\n\n<span class=\"page\">316-17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   We conclude that a jury could reasonably find from the\n\ncircumstantial evidence presented by the Commission that Scharn\n\npossessed nonpublic, material information given him by Sargent.\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f                                  4.\n\n          The appellees also argue that the Commission failed to\n\nproduce evidence that they knew Purolator would be purchased by means\n\nof a tender offer, a fact appellees contend must be established as a\n\nprerequisite to Rule 14e-3 liability. Were we to agree with appellees'\n\ninterpretation of Rule 14e-3, this argument would have some merit. The\n\ntestimony about the conditions in the office shared by Shepard and\n\nAldrich is the only evidence from which a jury could infer that Shepard\n\nknew the form that the acquisition of Purolator would take. To find\n\nthat Sargent and Scharn knew the form the transaction would take, a\n\njury would have to speculate about the exact content of Shepard's\n\ncommunication to Sargent and of Sargent's tip to Scharn.\n\n          The plain language of Rule 14e-3, however, contradicts the\n\nappellees’ interpretation:\n\n            (a) If any person has taken a substantial step\n          or steps to commence . . . a tender offer . . .\n          it shall constitute a fraudulent . . . act . . .\n          within the meaning of section 14(e) of the Act\n          for any other person who is in possession of\n          material information relating to such tender\n          offer which information he knows or has reason to\n          know is nonpublic and which he knows or has\n          reason to know has been acquired directly or\n          indirectly from [an inside source]. . . to\n          purchase or sell . . . any of such securities .\n          . . unless within a reasonable time prior to any\n          purchase or sale such information and its source\n          are publicly disclosed . . . .\n\n             . . . .\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f            (d)(1) . . . it shall be unlawful for any\n          person . . . to communicate nonpublic information\n          relating to a tender offer to any other person\n          under circumstances in which it is reasonably\n          foreseeable that such communication is likely to\n          result in a violation of this section . . . .\n\n17 C.F.R. § 240.14e-3.     There is simply no language in the Rule\n\nindicating that a defendant must know that the nonpublic information in\n\nhis possession relates to a tender offer.\n\n          The Eighth Circuit reached a similar conclusion when faced\n\nwith the issue of whether Rule 14e-3 requires that a defendant know\n\nthat substantial steps toward a tender offer have been taken.

The district court\n\napplied the balancing test of Federal Rule of Evidence 403 (Rule 403)\n\nto exclude these convictions, reasoning that since the defendants had\n\ntestified at trial about their lies, the prejudicial impact of\n\nadmitting the convictions outweighed the probative value of the\n\nevidence. The district judge remarked to the Commission, \"[Y]ou get\n\nall the probative value you need because the witness admitted he lied.\"\n\nThe Commission asserts that the trial court misconstrued 609(a)(2) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 609(a)(2)) when it applied Rule 403\n\nto exclude the convictions.
