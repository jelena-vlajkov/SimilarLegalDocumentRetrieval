The Internal Revenue Service\n\n(“IRS”) appeals a judgment holding that Wayne and Mary Cousins\n\n(“Debtors”),      who     had    filed    for    bankruptcy     protection   under\n\nChapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code (“the Code”), were not liable\n\nafter   discharge         for    postpetition      interest      on   prepetition,\n\nnondischargeable tax liabilities.                 We reverse.\n\n                                           I.\n\n           On November 14, 1990, Debtors filed a petition for\n\nbankruptcy protection under Chapter 12, which is available only\n\nto farmers.    On March 14, 1991, the IRS filed a Proof of Claim\n\nfor $43,194.42 in assessed federal tax liabilities.                         Debtors\n\nthen filed with the bankruptcy court a Chapter 12 Plan, which\n\nprovided for the payment of the government's unsecured priority\n\nclaim, but did not provide for the payment of postpetition\n\ninterest on the obligation.              The bankruptcy court confirmed the\n\ninitial Plan and Debtors' subsequent First Modified Revised\n\nChapter 12 Plan.          Each plan required “full payment in deferred\n\ncash    payment      of    all    claims        entitled   to    priority    under\n\n11 U.S.C. § 507 including . . . the debt to the Internal Revenue\n\nService   in   the      amount    of     $43,194.42.”      The    IRS   raised   no\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fobjection to the confirmation of either plan, and during the\n\nlife   of   the   plan,       the   trustee    paid    the     IRS    $43,195.00    in\n\nsatisfaction      of     Debtors'     prepetition      tax        liabilities.      On\n\nJanuary 31, 1997, the bankruptcy court discharged Debtors after\n\nfull satisfaction of all plan payments.\n\n            The IRS subsequently demanded a payment from Debtors\n\nof $15,560.11 for interest that had accrued postpetition on the\n\nprepetition tax liability.               In response, Debtors brought an\n\nadversarial proceeding, seeking a determination that they were\n\nnot    liable     for       postpetition      interest       on    prepetition     tax\n\nliabilities, fully paid pursuant to their Chapter 12 plan.\n\n            The bankruptcy court held that a Chapter 12 debtor is\n\ndischarged        from       personal      postdischarge             liability     for\n\npostpetition interest on a nondischargeable tax debt because\n\nthis   interest        is    not    assertable    as     a    claim     against    the\n\nbankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. § 1222.                    The IRS appealed, and\n\nthe district court affirmed.             Once again, the IRS appeals.\n\n            We review de novo the legal question presented by this\n\nappeal.     See Prebor v. Collins (In re I Don't Trust), 143 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998);               Thinking Machs. Corp. v.            Mellon Fin.\n\nServs. Corp. (In re Thinking Machs. Corp.), 67 F.3d 1021, 1023\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                         II.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            When a debtor files for protection under Chapter 12,\n\nany actions against the debtor or his property are stayed.                See\n\n11 U.S.C. § 1201 (1994).           The United States trustee appoints a\n\ntrustee     who      manages   the    bankruptcy    estate.         See   id.\n\n§ 1202(b)(1).        Creditors file claims with the trustee, but may\n\nnot include in their filings claims for postpetition interest.\n\nSee id. § 502(b)(2).           The debtor then files a plan, see id.\n\n§ 1221, which must “provide for the full payment, in deferred\n\ncash payments, of all claims entitled to priority under section\n\n507,”     id.   §    1222(a)(2).       Section    507(a)(8)    renders    the\n\ngovernment      an     unsecured     priority    creditor     for   its   tax\n\nliabilities.        The bankruptcy court ultimately decides whether to\n\nconfirm the debtor's plan.           See id. § 1225.   If it does so, it\n\ncharges the trustee with “ensur[ing] that the debtor commences\n\nmaking timely payments required by [the] confirmed plan.”                 Id.\n\n§ 1202(b)(4).        Once these payments are completed, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt discharges all debts provided for by the plan, except\n\nthose specified by § 523(a) as nondischargeable, such as a tax\n\nliability, see § 523(a)(1)(A).              The debtor remains personally\n\nresponsible for any debt not discharged in bankruptcy.                    See\n\nMarvin E. Jacob & Jacqueline B. Stuart, The Search for Balance\n\nin Bankruptcy: Congress Debates Bankruptcy Overhaul as Consumer\n\nBankruptcies Rise, 116 Banking L.J. 369, 377 (1999) (“[D]ebts\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat are nondischargeable pass or ride through the bankruptcy\n\nunaffected and are a postbankruptcy liability of the former\n\ndebtor.”).\n\n          In Bruning v. United States, 376 U.S. 358 (1964), the\n\nSupreme Court addressed whether the government is entitled to\n\nrecover from the debtor postpetition interest on a tax liability\n\nthat was not discharged through bankruptcy.               See id. at 358\n\n(interpreting the superseded Bankruptcy Act of 1898).              As the\n\nThird Circuit explained, in holding that the debtor remains\n\npersonally responsible for postpetition accrued interest, the\n\nBruning Court “distinguished between denial of post-petition\n\ninterest against the bankruptcy estate on a nondischargeable\n\ndebt and the accrual of interest on a nondischargeable debt\n\nduring the pendency of the bankruptcy to be collected from the\n\ndebtor after the bankruptcy proceeding is completed.”            Leeper v.\n\nPennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency, 49 F.3d 98, 101 (3d\n\nCir.   1995)   (emphasis   added).     The    Court   reasoned    that   by\n\ncategorizing postpetition interest as nondischargeable, Congress\n\n“intended personal liability to continue as to the interest on\n\nthat debt as well as to its principal amount.”              Bruning, 376\n\nU.S. at 360.    Therefore, it held that postpetition interest on\n\na   nondischargeable   tax   claim   “remains,    after    bankruptcy,   a\n\npersonal liability of the debtor.”           Id. at 363.    Bruning thus\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fstands for the proposition that a debtor with tax liabilities in\n\nexistence prior to seeking bankruptcy protection is liable after\n\nhis debts are discharged for postpetition interest on this tax\n\ndebt.\n\n           While Bruning addressed the issue under section 17 of\n\nthe Federal Bankruptcy Act, ch. 541, § 17, 30 Stat. 544, 550\n\n(1899), repealed by Bankruptcy Code, Pub. L. No. 95-598, 92\n\nStat. 2549 (1978), its holding is applicable to cases arising\n\nunder § 523(a)(1)(A) of the Code.                See, e.g., Ward v. Board of\n\nEqualization (In re Artisan Woodworkers), 204 F.3d 888, 891 (9th\n\nCir.    2000)    (noting   that    “§    17     of    the   Bankruptcy    Act   and\n\n§   523(a)(1)(A)     of    the     Bankruptcy          Code    are   functionally\n\nequivalent”); Burns v. United States (In re Burns), 887 F.2d\n\n1541,     1543     (11th    Cir.        1989)        (noting    that     “pre-Code\n\ninterpretations are presumed to have survived the enactment of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code unless Congress has expressed an intention\n\nto change the interpretation of judicially created concepts in\n\nenacting the Code” and concluding that with regard to Bruning,\n\n“Congress did not intend to change the pre-Code law”).\n\n           Debtors convinced the bankruptcy and district courts\n\nthat, while the Bruning rule might apply to some chapters of the\n\nCode, it does not apply to Chapter 12.                  The Debtors argue that\n\nCongress wrote § 1222(a)(2) to escape Bruning's dictates.                       They\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fcontend that “[i]f Congress had intended that unsecured priority\n\nclaimholders were to receive [postpetition] interest, it would\n\nhave added . . . 'present value' language to § 1222(a)(2).”\n\nThis argument obscures the difference between a Chapter 12\n\ndebtor's responsibility to satisfy his plan during the pendency\n\nof   the    bankruptcy      proceeding          and   his    remaining       personal\n\npostbankruptcy obligation.                While it is true that § 1222's\n\nwording frees the estate from any obligation to pay postpetition\n\ninterest, it does not speak to the debtor's personal obligation\n\nfor such interest.          When a debtor files for bankruptcy under\n\nChapter     12,    his   assets     and   liabilities        become   part     of   the\n\nbankruptcy estate, which the trustee manages throughout the\n\nbankruptcy proceeding.            The debtor must file a plan that will\n\nresolve his debts, which the Code explicitly states may not\n\ninclude “unmatured interest,” 11 U.S.C. § 502(b)(2).                         Upon the\n\ndebtor's        satisfaction   of    those      debts,     the    bankruptcy    court\n\ndischarges all of his outstanding dischargeable debts and the\n\nbankruptcy proceeding is over.                  See id. § 1228.         The debtor\n\nremains personally liable, however, for any nondischargeable\n\ndebts.     See Jacob & Stuart, supra, at 377.                    Thus, § 1222(a)(2)\n\nonly governs how debts must be paid to satisfy the Chapter 12\n\nplan.    When § 1222(a)(2), without the “present value” language,\n\nspeaks     of    fully   paying     the   debts,      it    means   that   prior    to\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdebtor's release from bankruptcy, the estate must pay the full\n\namount of his debts as they stood at the time of the petition,\n\nas opposed to the current amount plus postpetition interest.\n\nSection 1222 “do[es] not affect the exception of tax debts from\n\ndischarge or a debtor's personal liability.”           In re Artisan\n\nWoodworkers, 204 F.3d at 892.\n\n          Debtors contend that because § 1222(a)(2) prohibits the\n\ninclusion of postpetition interest under the plan, Congress\n\ncould not have intended for a debtor postdischarge personally to\n\nhave to pay postpetition interest.         But, “[i]n all situations\n\nwhere the Bruning rule is applicable, the bankruptcy plan cannot\n\nmake allowances for post-petition interest; the interest merely\n\naccrues and is collectable against the debtor [as opposed to the\n\nestate] after the bankruptcy is completed.”         Leeper, 49 F.3d at\n\n102.   Moreover, Congress intended this scheme.             See Hanna v.\n\nUnited States (In re Hanna), 872 F.2d 829, 831 (8th Cir. 1989)\n\n(“Taken   together,   sections   502   and   523   simply    demonstrate\n\nCongress' intent to codify the general principle that applied\n\nunder Bruning.   Postpetition interest is disallowed against the\n\nbankruptcy estate under section 502.       Priority tax claims remain\n\nnondischargeable for individual debtors.”).\n\n          We   turn   to   whether   the   postpetition     interest   on\n\nDebtors' tax liability survived § 1228(a) discharge.             Debtors\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fnote that § 1228(a) mandates that all debts under the plan must\n\nbe paid in full before the debtor can be discharged.               Proceeding\n\nfrom this premise, they argue that because nondischargeable tax\n\ndebts must be satisfied before discharge is entered, neither the\n\ntax   liability    nor    its   interest    can    survive   discharge,       and\n\nBruning is inapplicable.          We have a different view.\n\n            The   plain   language    of    §   1228(a)(2)   provides        that\n\ndischarge specifically does not apply to any debt listed in\n\n§ 523(a).    Section 523(a)(1)(A), in turn, unequivocally notes\n\nthat “[a] discharge under section . . . 1228(a) . . . does not\n\ndischarge    an   individual      debtor    from    any   debt”    for   a    tax\n\nliability, irrespective of “whether or not a claim for such tax\n\nwas filed or allowed.”          11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(A).         In addition,\n\nDebtors' reading of the Code would render even the principal of\n\na tax liability extinguished after the plan is completed if, for\n\nexample, the claim for tax liability was not filed or allowed\n\nand therefore was not included in the Chapter 12 plan.                       This\n\ninterpretation is untenable.         See Bruning, 376 U.S. at 360 (“It\n\nis undisputed that . . . petitioner remained personally liable\n\nafter his discharge for that part of the principal amount of the\n\ntax debt and pre-petition interest not satisfied out of the\n\nbankruptcy estate.”).           Tax liabilities survive the bankruptcy\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fproceeding's termination, and as      Bruning held, so does the\n\ninterest upon these liabilities.\n\n         Debtors also contend that allowing the IRS to pursue\n\npostpetition interest contradicts the purpose of Chapter 12,\n\nwhich is designed to aid a struggling family farmer to escape\n\nfrom under the thumb of debt.      Undoubtedly, Congress intended\n\nthat Chapter 12 aid debtor-farmers in their attempts to resolve\n\ntheir financial difficulties.      See 132 Cong. Rec. S15074-05\n\n(daily ed. Oct. 3, 1986) (statement of Sen. Thurmond) (“[Chapter\n\n12] is meant to assist those farmers who have the true potential\n\nto reorganize and to allow them relief from heavy debt burden,\n\nand yet allow farmers to pay creditors what is reasonable under\n\ntoday's difficult economic situation.”).   But, Congress also has\n\ndecided that “certain problems--e.g., those of financing the\n\ngovernment--override the value of giving the debtor a wholly\n\nfresh start.”   Bruning, 376 U.S. at 361; see also In re Hanna,\n\n872 F.2d at 831 (“Congress attempted to balance the interests of\n\nthe debtor, creditors and the government, and in the instance of\n\ntaxes and interest on such, Congress has determined that the\n\nproblems of financing the government override granting debtors\n\na wholly fresh start.”).   We must respect Congress's judgment.\n\nSee Leeper, 49 F.3d at 105 (“Congress . . . may choose to amend\n\nthe statute with respect to the treatment of post-petition\n\n\n                              -10-\n\finterest [for student loans1].   But until and unless it does so,\n\nwe see no basis for the courts to change the longstanding rule\n\nas to nondischargeability of post-petition interest.”).\n\n                             III.\n\n         We reverse the judgment of the district court and\n\nremand the matter to the district court for entry of judgment in\n\nfavor of the IRS.\n\n\n\n\n    1Debtors argue that because student loans do not have\npriority under 11 U.S.C. § 507, the application of Bruning to\nthem does not support its application here. We disagree. The\nabsence of student loans in § 507 merely means that such claims\nreceive no priority under a bankruptcy plan.      That fact is\nirrelevant to whether the bankruptcy court can discharge a\nstudent loan's principal and interest.      Section 1328(a)(2)\nprovides that discharge does not apply to “any debt of the kind\nspecified in paragraph (5), (8), or (9) of section 523(a).”\nSection 523(a)(8) covers student loans. Similarly, § 1228(a)\nprovides that discharge does not apply to “any debt of the kind\nspecified in section 523(a).” This similarity indicates that\nstudent loans under § 1328(a) and tax liabilities under\n§ 1228(a) receive identical treatment under Bruning.\n\n                             -11-\n\f",

See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1201 (1994). The United States trustee appoints a trustee who manages the bankruptcy estate. See id. &#167; 1202(b)(1). Creditors file claims with the trustee, but may not include in their filings claims for post-petition interest. See id. &#167; 502(b)(2). The debtor then files a plan, see id. &#167; 1221, which must \"provide for the full payment, in deferred cash payments, of all claims entitled to priority under section 507,\" id. &#167; 1222(a)(2). Section 507(a)(8) renders the government an unsecured priority creditor for its tax liabilities. The bankruptcy court ultimately decides whether to confirm the debtor's plan. See id. &#167; 1225. If it does so, it charges the trustee with \"ensur[ing] that the debtor commences making timely payments required by [the] confirmed plan.\" Id. &#167; 1202(b)(4). Once these payments are completed, the bankruptcy court discharges all debts provided for by the plan, except those specified by &#167; 523(a) as non-dischargeable, such as a tax liability, see &#167; 523(a)(1)(A). The debtor remains personally responsible for any debt not discharged in bankruptcy. See Marvin E. Jacob &amp; Jacqueline B. Stuart, The Search for Balance in Bankruptcy: Congress Debates Bankruptcy Overhaul as Consumer Bankruptcies Rise, 116 Banking L.J. 369, 377 (1999) (\"[D]ebts that are non-dischargeable pass or ride through the bankruptcy unaffected and are a postbankruptcy liability of the former debtor.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bruning v. United States, 376 U.S. 358 (1964), the Supreme Court addressed whether the government is entitled to recover from the debtor post-petition interest on a tax liability that was not discharged through bankruptcy. See id. at 358 (interpreting the superseded Bankruptcy Act of 1898). As the Third Circuit explained, in holding that the debtor remains personally responsible for post-petition accrued interest, the Bruning Court \"distinguished between denial of post-petition interest against the bankruptcy estate on a non-dischargeable debt and the accrual of interest on a non-dischargeable debt during the pendency of the bankruptcy to be collected from the debtor after the bankruptcy proceeding is completed.\" Leeper v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency, 49 F.3d 98, 101 (3d Cir. 1995) (emphasis added). The Court reasoned that by categorizing post-petition interest as non-dischargeable, Congress \"intended personal liability to continue as to the interest on that debt as well as to its principal amount.\" Bruning, 376 U.S. at 360. Therefore, it held that post-petition interest on a non-dischargeable tax claim \"remains, after bankruptcy, a personal liability of the debtor.\" Id. at 363. Bruning thus stands for the proposition that a debtor with tax liabilities in existence prior to seeking bankruptcy protection is liable after his debts are discharged for post-petition interest on this tax debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Bruning addressed the issue under section 17 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, ch. 541, &#167; 17, 30 Stat. 544, 550 (1899), repealed by Bankruptcy Code, Pub. L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 (1978), its holding is applicable to cases arising under &#167; 523(a)(1)(A) of the Code. See, e.g., Ward v. Board of Equalization (In re Artisan Woodworkers), 204 F.3d 888, 891 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that \"&#167; 17 of the Bankruptcy Act and &#167; 523(a)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code are functionally equivalent\"); Burns v. United States (In re Burns), 887 F.2d 1541, 1543 (11th Cir. 1989) (noting that \"pre-Code interpretations are presumed to have survived the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code unless Congress has expressed an intention to change the interpretation of judicially created concepts in enacting the Code\" and concluding that with regard to Bruning, \"Congress did not intend to change the pre-Code law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debtors convinced the bankruptcy and district courts that, while the Bruning rule might apply to some chapters of the Code, it does not apply to Chapter 12. The Debtors argue that Congress wrote &#167; 1222(a)(2) to escape Bruning's dictates. They contend that \"[i]f Congress had intended that unsecured priority claimholders were to receive [post-petition] interest, it would have added . . . 'present value' language to &#167; 1222(a)(2).\" This argument obscures the difference between a Chapter 12 debtor's responsibility to satisfy his plan during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding and his remaining personal postbankruptcy obligation. While it is true that &#167; 1222's wording frees the estate from any obligation to pay post-petition interest, it does not speak to the debtor's personal obligation for such interest. When a debtor files for bankruptcy under Chapter 12, his assets and liabilities become part of the bankruptcy estate, which the trustee manages throughout the bankruptcy proceeding. The debtor must file a plan that will resolve his debts, which the Code explicitly states may not include \"unmatured interest,\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 502(b)(2). Upon the debtor's satisfaction of those debts, the bankruptcy court discharges all of his outstanding dischargeable debts and the bankruptcy proceeding is over. See id. &#167; 1228. The debtor remains personally liable, however, for any non-dischargeable debts. See Jacob &amp; Stuart, supra, at 377. Thus, &#167; 1222(a)(2) only governs how debts must be paid to satisfy the Chapter 12 plan. When &#167; 1222(a)(2), without the \"present value\" language, speaks of fully paying the debts, it means that prior to debtor's release from bankruptcy, the estate must pay the full amount of his debts as they stood at the time of the petition, as opposed to the current amount plus post-petition interest. Section 1222 \"do[es] not affect the exception of tax debts from discharge or a debtor's personal liability.\" In re Artisan Woodworkers, 204 F.3d at 892.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debtors contend that because &#167; 1222(a)(2) prohibits the inclusion of post-petition interest under the plan, Congress could not have intended for a debtor postdischarge personally to have to pay post-petition interest. But, \"[i]n all situations where the Bruning rule is applicable, the bankruptcy plan cannot make allowances for post-petition interest; the interest merely accrues and is collectable against the debtor [as opposed to the estate] after the bankruptcy is completed.\" Leeper, 49 F.3d at 102. Moreover, Congress intended this scheme. See Hanna v. United States (In re Hanna), 872 F.2d 829, 831 (8th Cir. 1989) (\"Taken together, sections 502 and 523 simply demonstrate Congress' intent to codify the general principle that applied under Bruning. Post-petition interest is disallowed against the bankruptcy estate under section 502. Priority tax claims remain non-dischargeable for individual debtors.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to whether the post-petition interest on Debtors' tax liability survived &#167; 1228(a) discharge. Debtors note that &#167; 1228(a) mandates that all debts under the plan must be paid in full before the debtor can be discharged. Proceeding from this premise, they argue that because non-dischargeable tax debts must be satisfied before discharge is entered, neither the tax liability nor its interest can survive discharge, and Bruning is inapplicable. We have a different view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of &#167; 1228(a)(2) provides that discharge specifically does not apply to any debt listed in &#167; 523(a). Section 523(a)(1)(A), in turn, unequivocally notes that \"[a] discharge under section . . . 1228(a) . . . does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\" for a tax liability, irrespective of \"whether or not a claim for such tax was filed or allowed.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(1)(A). In addition, Debtors' reading of the Code would render even the principal of a tax liability extinguished after the plan is completed if, for example, the claim for tax liability was not filed or allowed and therefore was not included in the Chapter 12 plan. This interpretation is untenable. See Bruning, 376 U.S. at 360 (\"It is undisputed that . . . petitioner remained personally liable after his discharge for that part of the principal amount of the tax debt and pre-petition interest not satisfied out of the bankruptcy estate.\"). Tax liabilities survive the bankruptcy proceeding's termination, and as Bruning held, so does the interest upon these liabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debtors also contend that allowing the IRS to pursue post-petition interest contradicts the purpose of Chapter 12, which is designed to aid a struggling family farmer to escape from under the thumb of debt. Undoubtedly, Congress intended that Chapter 12 aid debtor-farmers in their attempts to resolve their financial difficulties. See 132 Cong. Rec. S15074-05 (daily ed. Oct. 3, 1986) (statement of Sen. Thurmond) (\"[Chapter 12] is meant to assist those farmers who have the true potential to reorganize and to allow them relief from heavy debt burden, and yet allow farmers to pay creditors what is reasonable under today's difficult economic situation.\"). But, Congress also has decided that \"certain problems--e.g., those of financing the government--override the value of giving the debtor a wholly fresh start.\" Bruning, 376 U.S. at 361; see also In re Hanna, 872 F.2d at 831 (\"Congress attempted to balance the interests of the debtor, creditors and the government, and in the instance of taxes and interest on such, Congress has determined that the problems of financing the government override granting debtors a wholly fresh start.\"). We must respect Congress's judgment. See Leeper, 49 F.3d at 105 (\"Congress . . . may choose to amend the statute with respect to the treatment of post-petition interest [for student loans<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> ]. But until and unless it does so, we see no basis for the courts to change the longstanding rule as to nondischargeability of post-petition interest.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the matter to the district court for entry of judgment in favor of the IRS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Debtors argue that because student loans do not have priority under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 507, the application of Bruning to them does not support its application here. We disagree. The absence of student loans in &#167; 507 merely means that such claims receive no priority under a bankruptcy plan. That fact is irrelevant to whether the bankruptcy court can discharge a student loan's principal and interest. Section 1328(a)(2) provides that discharge does not apply to \"any debt of the kind specified in paragraph (5), (8), or (9) of section 523(a).\" Section 523(a)(8) covers student loans. Similarly, &#167; 1228(a) provides that discharge does not apply to \"any debt of the kind specified in section 523(a).\" This similarity indicates that student loans under &#167; 1328(a) and tax liabilities under &#167; 1228(a) receive identical treatment under Bruning.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Section 1222 \"do[es] not affect the exception of tax debts from discharge or a debtor's personal liability.\" In re Artisan <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767794\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Woodworkers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/767794/in-re-artisan-woodworkers-debtor-john-c-ward-dba-artisan-woodworkers/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debtors contend that because &#167; 1222(a)(2) prohibits the inclusion of post-petition interest under the plan, Congress could not have intended for a debtor postdischarge personally to have to pay post-petition interest. But, \"[i]n all situations where the Bruning rule is applicable, the bankruptcy plan cannot make allowances for post-petition interest; the interest merely accrues and is collectable against the debtor [as opposed to the estate] after the bankruptcy is completed.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691041\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Leeper,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/691041/lisa-leeper-william-leeper-dwight-webster-and-della-webster-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>. Moreover, Congress intended this scheme. See Hanna v. United States (In re Hanna), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521587\"><a href=\"/opinion/521587/in-re-ronald-joseph-hanna-and-marjorie-ruth-saunders-hanna-ronald-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 831 (8th Cir. 1989) (\"Taken together, sections 502 and 523 simply demonstrate Congress' intent to codify the general principle that applied under Bruning. Post-petition interest is disallowed against the bankruptcy estate under section 502. Priority tax claims remain non-dischargeable for individual debtors.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to whether the post-petition interest on Debtors' tax liability survived &#167; 1228(a) discharge. Debtors note that &#167; 1228(a) mandates that all debts under the plan must be paid in full before the debtor can be discharged. Proceeding from this premise, they argue that because non-dischargeable tax debts must be satisfied before discharge is entered, neither the tax liability nor its interest can survive discharge, and Bruning is inapplicable. We have a different view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of &#167; 1228(a)(2) provides that discharge specifically does not apply to any debt listed in &#167; 523(a). Section 523(a)(1)(A), in turn, unequivocally notes that \"[a] discharge under section . . . 1228(a) . . . does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\" for a tax liability, irrespective of \"whether or not a claim for such tax was filed or allowed.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(1)(A). In addition, Debtors' reading of the Code would render even the principal of a tax liability extinguished after the plan is completed if, for example, the claim for tax liability was not filed or allowed and therefore was not included in the Chapter 12 plan. This interpretation is untenable. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106770\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bruning,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/106770/bruning-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">360</span> </a></span>(\"It is undisputed that . . . petitioner remained personally liable after his discharge for that part of the principal amount of the tax debt and pre-petition interest not satisfied out of the bankruptcy estate.\"). Tax liabilities survive the bankruptcy proceeding's termination, and as Bruning held, so does the interest upon these liabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debtors also contend that allowing the IRS to pursue post-petition interest contradicts the purpose of Chapter 12, which is designed to aid a struggling family farmer to escape from under the thumb of debt. Undoubtedly, Congress intended that Chapter 12 aid debtor-farmers in their attempts to resolve their financial difficulties. See 132 Cong. Rec. S15074-05 (daily ed. Oct. 3, 1986) (statement of Sen. Thurmond) (\"[Chapter 12] is meant to assist those farmers who have the true potential to reorganize and to allow them relief from heavy debt burden, and yet allow farmers to pay creditors what is reasonable under today's difficult economic situation.\").

We disagree. The absence of student loans in &#167; 507 merely means that such claims receive no priority under a bankruptcy plan. That fact is irrelevant to whether the bankruptcy court can discharge a student loan's principal and interest. Section 1328(a)(2) provides that discharge does not apply to \"any debt of the kind specified in paragraph (5), (8), or (9) of section 523(a).\" Section 523(a)(8) covers student loans. Similarly, &#167; 1228(a) provides that discharge does not apply to \"any debt of the kind specified in section 523(a).\" This similarity indicates that student loans under &#167; 1328(a) and tax liabilities under &#167; 1228(a) receive identical treatment under Bruning.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
