Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Luisa Soto-Rivera on brief pro se.\r\n   Carlos Lugo Fiol, Solicitor General, Edda Serrano Blasini,\r\nDeputy Solicitor General, and Leticia Casalduc-Rabell, Assistant\r\nSolicitor General, on brief for appellees.\r\n\nOctober 5, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.       Plaintiffs were  warned in two\r\ncourt orders that a failure to clarify their claims of\r\npolitical discrimination could lead to a dismissal of their\r\ncomplaint with prejudice.  They also were directed to attend\r\nthe initial scheduling conference through a representative who\r\nwas prepared to explain the complaint.  Although two amended\r\ncomplaints were filed, the allegations against each defendant\r\nremained too vague and ambiguous to enable the defendants to\r\nfile meaningful answers.  The attorney who appeared for\r\nplaintiffs at the pretrial conference was not prepared to\r\nexplain their claims,  and the response to defendants' motion\r\nto dismiss indicated that there would be no further\r\nclarification.\r\n          Under the circumstances (1) we see no abuse of\r\ndiscretion nor other error in the dismissal with prejudice of\r\nthe federal claims against the defendants in their individual\r\ncapacities, and the dismissal of the supplemental state-law\r\nclaims without prejudice for want of jurisdiction.  We also see\r\n(2) no basis for objection to the dismissal of the official\r\ncapacity claims since plaintiffs conceded the ground for\r\ndismissal below, and (3) no prejudice to plaintiffs from the\r\nearlier decision that a proposed claim under the Americans with\r\nDisabilities Act could not be properly joined in this action. \r\n          We do not reach defendants' argument for a\r\n\"heightened pleading\" standard, since this complaint was\r\nproperly dismissed for failure to comply with two court orders. \r\nCf. Judge v. Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 73 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding\r\nthat to protect the policies underlying the doctrine of\r\nqualified immunity a trial court may exercise its discretion to\r\nrequire specificity in the pleading of the element of intent). \r\n          The judgment is affirmed.\r\n",
