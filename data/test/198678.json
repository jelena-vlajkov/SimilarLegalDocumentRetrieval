Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Michael A. Tucker on brief for appellant.\r\n\nOCTOBER 12, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  This appeal raises the following issue:\r\nwhether the district court erred in allowing appellant to\r\ninclude in his plea agreement with the government a waiver of\r\nhis right to appeal his sentence.  With respect to any or all\r\nother issues on appeal, defense counsel has filed his brief\r\npursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967); 1st\r\nCir. Loc. R. 46.6(4).  Defendant has not filed a separate\r\nbrief, although he was notified of his right to do so.\r\n          We have conducted a full examination of the\r\nproceedings, including review of the transcripts of the guilty\r\nplea hearing and sentencing hearing, the plea agreement and the\r\npresentence report.  On the basis of that thorough review, we\r\nagree with defense counsel that there are no arguable appellate\r\nissues as to defendant's conviction, plea and sentence.  The\r\nundisputed facts amply support defendant's conviction of the\r\ncrimes charged.  The district court fully complied with the\r\nrequirements under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 at the change of plea\r\nhearing.  The government complied with the plea agreement.\r\nDefendant received the statutory mandatory minimum sentences\r\nfor the offenses to which he pled guilty.\r\n          For purposes of this appeal, we assume without\r\ndeciding that defendant's waiver of his right to appeal his\r\nsentence is not enforceable.  We find, however, that the case\r\npresents no meritorious issues for appeal.  Therefore,\r\ncounsel's motion to withdraw is granted, and appellant's\r\nconviction and sentence are affirmed. See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c)\r\n(formerly Loc. R. 27.1).\r\n",
