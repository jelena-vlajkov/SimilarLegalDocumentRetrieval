Plaintiff-appellant\n\nFelix    Landrau-Romero    (“Landrau”)      appeals     from   the    district\n\ncourt’s    entry    of   summary    judgment    in    favor    of    Landrau’s\n\nemployer, defendant-appellee Banco Popular.              We affirm in part\n\nand vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings not\n\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n\nI.         BACKGROUND\n\n           We set forth the relevant facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to the appellant.          See New York State Dairy Foods,\n\nInc. v. Northeast Dairy Compact Comm'n, 198 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).    Landrau, a black man, was employed by Banco Popular from\n\n1981 until his resignation in 1995.            He began as a clerk in the\n\ncollection   department,     and    was    transferred    in   1988    to   the\n\ninsurance unit of the mortgage department for the remainder of\n\nhis employment.\n\n           On April 1, 1993, Landrau’s supervisor, Carmen Sandín,\n\nretired    from    her   position   as     supervisor    of    the    mortgage\n\ninsurance services.      Several Banco Popular employees applied for\n\nthe vacant position, including Landrau.           In April, 1993, a white\n\nman, Jaime Bou, was selected and became Landrau’s supervisor.\n\n           Bou subjected Landrau’s work to closer scrutiny than\n\nthat of the other employees in the unit, and closely monitored\n\nLandrau’s whereabouts. This monitoring included forcing Landrau\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fto leave a note on his desk every time he went on break, to the\n\nbathroom, or to get a drink of water.          At one point after June\n\n30, 1994, Bou verbally admonished Landrau for taking a break\n\nwithout providing notification of his whereabouts (“the break\n\nincident”).    When Landrau brought co-workers to explain to Bou\n\nthat Landrau had in fact informed them of his whereabouts, Bou\n\n“said nothing.”\n\n          Bou criticized and “yelled” at Landrau more frequently\n\nthan other employees, sometimes in front of Landrau’s coworkers.\n\nMoreover, after Landrau suffered an injury at work and returned\n\nfrom disability leave on December 29, 1993, Bou assigned him\n\nphysically strenuous tasks in disregard of an accommodation\n\nordered   by   the   State    Insurance   Fund.     This   disregard   of\n\nLandrau’s disability continued through June or July, 1994.\n\n          In March or April, 1994, Landrau received a written\n\nreprimand for misidentifying the date on certain paperwork,\n\nwhich caused duplicate payments to be made.           On June 30, 1994,\n\nBou gave Landrau another reprimand for continuing to repeat\n\nthese mistakes.      Landrau’s performance evaluations, which had\n\nbeen   excellent     under    his   previous   supervisors,    declined.\n\nLandrau contends that the errors were due to the bank’s failure\n\nto   provide   him   with    adequate   computer   training,   which   his\n\ncoworkers received.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            Landrau      alleges       other      harassment,        including      Bou’s\n\nattempt    to    “frame”       him   in    June,      1994,    by    using     Landrau’s\n\ncomputer to commit errors for which Landrau was blamed.                            Bou and\n\nother   supervisors       made       jokes      and   comments       about    his   race,\n\nincluding       remarking      upon       his    “kinky   hair.”         One       of   the\n\nsupervisors also complained in writing about Landrau’s meeting\n\nwith other Banco Popular employees to discuss filing a race\n\ndiscrimination complaint.\n\n            In     an     attempt         to     remove       himself    from       these\n\ncircumstances,          Landrau       submitted        applications          for    other\n\npositions within Banco Popular, but was not hired.1                                Landrau\n\ncomplained to Banco Popular about the alleged harassment and\n\nracial discrimination.            In a letter dated March 7, 1994, Landrau\n\nstated that he had been unfairly subjected to reprimands after\n\nBou replaced Sandín, and that “work became hell.”                            On June 14,\n\n1994, Landrau wrote a letter to general manager Felipe Franco\n\nalleging        that     Bou    was       mistreating          him     due     to       race\n\ndiscrimination; on August 26 of that year, Landrau wrote another\n\nletter to Franco complaining that he had been turned down for\n\n\n\n\n    1 As to at least two of those positions, Landrau admitted\nthat he was not hired because he lacked the necessary experience\nand training.   He does not contend that he was denied any of\nthese positions due to racial discrimination.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fSandín’s    position    and    that   his   performance    evaluations   had\n\nfallen since Bou became his supervisor.\n\n            Banco Popular investigated the allegations, and, in a\n\nreport dated November 3, 1994, concluded that Landau’s problems\n\nwere not caused by discrimination.            Landrau’s job duties, pay,\n\nand physical working environment did not change while Bou was\n\nhis supervisor.\n\n            On February 15, 1995, Landrau submitted a letter of\n\nresignation stating that he was leaving Banco Popular because he\n\nhad another job opportunity.          On February 28, 1995, the day that\n\nresignation was to be effective, he submitted another letter,\n\nthis time stating that the true reason for his resignation was\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n            Landrau filed charges of discrimination with the Anti-\n\nDiscrimination Unit of Puerto Rico’s Labor Department and the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on or about March\n\n9, 1995.2     The EEOC issued him a “right-to-sue” letter on January\n\n16,   1996.      On    April   16,    1996,   Landrau     filed   employment\n\ndiscrimination claims against Banco Popular in the District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico pursuant to Title VII of\n\n\n      2\n     March 9, 1995, is the date on the Department of Labor\ndiscrimination charge form contained in the record, although\nLandrau’s complaint and the district court’s opinion state that\nthe charge was filed on February 28, 1995. This discrepancy is\nnot material.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and\n\nPuerto Rico’s anti-discrimination statute, Law 100, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. 29, § 146 et seq.3            He appears to have alleged three adverse\n\nemployment actions on the basis of his race and color: (1) that\n\nBanco Popular failed to promote him to Sandín’s position; (2)\n\nthat       he   was    subjected       to   harassment   after    Bou     became   his\n\nsupervisor; and (3) that the harassment became so intolerable\n\nthat it resulted in his constructive termination.\n\n                On August 11, 1997, Banco Popular moved for summary\n\njudgment        on    the    grounds    that    (1)   Landrau    could    not   adduce\n\nsufficient evidence to support his constructive discharge claim;\n\nand    (2)      Landrau’s      failure-to-promote        claim    was    time-barred\n\nbecause he did not file a charge of discrimination within the\n\n300-day time limit set forth in Title VII.                    Landrau opposed the\n\nsummary judgment motion, contending that his working conditions\n\namounted to actionable harassment and constructive discharge,\n\nand     that         Banco    Popular’s        failure   to     promote     him    was\n\ndiscriminatory.              Landrau did not, however, explicitly counter\n\ndefendants’ time bar argument or address the state law claims.\n\n                In support of his opposition to Banco Popular’s summary\n\njudgment motion, Landrau submitted, inter alia, affidavits by\n\n\n\n       3\n     The complaint originally alleged age discrimination as well\nas race discrimination; the age claim was later dropped.\n\n                                             -7-\n\fSandín and another former supervisor that discussed a general\n\nclimate   of   racial   discrimination    at     Banco   Popular.\n\nSpecifically, Sandín stated in her affidavit that she “always\n\nhad the impression that black candidates like Mr. Landrau were\n\nnot welcome [sic] by the top management of Banco Popular for\n\ntrainee positions in management nor for supervisory positions.”\n\nThe other former Banco Popular supervisor, Angel Rivera Colon,\n\nstated:\n\n          I had my reservations that [Landrau] would not be\n          selected just for been [sic] black, considering\n          that a white applicant, Mr. Jaime Bou, had\n          already applied for the position.       In fact,\n          during my 29 years of experience in Banco Popular\n          it was an unwritten law that somehow was conveyed\n          to us officials, that if there was a white\n          applicant and a black applicant for the same\n          position, the white applicant would get the\n          position, and that was accepted as an implied\n          rule, although nobody dared to publicly talk\n          about it or openly admitting [sic] it. Also it\n          was well known to me that blacks were not\n          welcomed for management positions, although\n          nobody told me so explicitly.\n\n          The district court allowed Banco Popular’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment on February 23, 1999.     See Romero v.    Banco\n\nPopular de Puerto Rico, 35 F. Supp. 2d 195 (D.P.R. 1999).     The\n\ncourt stated in a footnote that Landrau’s failure to file a\n\ntimely charge of discrimination with the EEOC provided a basis\n\nfor awarding summary judgment to Banco Popular, but went on to\n\naddress the merits of Landrau’s claims.        The district court\n\n\n                              -8-\n\fdetermined that Landrau had established a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination based upon the fact that Bou had been hired to\n\nfill Sandín’s position.    Landrau failed to rebut Banco Popular’s\n\nnondiscriminatory explanation for the selection of Bou, however,\n\nwith sufficient evidence of discrimination.4       The district court\n\nstated that the affidavits offered by Sandín and Rivera did not\n\nsufficiently establish discriminatory intent. It also concluded\n\nthat Landrau did not adduce sufficient evidence of race-based\n\nharassment or constructive discharge.\n\n          On March 9, 1999, Landrau filed a motion to set aside\n\nthe opinion and order and for reconsideration pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 59(e).    For the first time, Landrau asserted that the\n\ntime period for filing his charge of discrimination should be\n\ntolled   due   to   operation    of   the   discovery   rule   and   the\n\n“continuing violation” doctrine.        The district court denied the\n\nmotion on March 29, 1999.       Landrau appeals.\n\n\n\n    4 The district court appeared to confuse or conflate the\ndifferent adverse employment actions in applying the burden-\nshifting analysis.     For example, it stated that Landrau\nestablished a prima facie case of racial discrimination because\nBou was hired instead of him, but pointed to Landrau’s failure\nto adduce evidence of harassment or constructive discharge in\nconcluding that Landrau did not rebut Banco Popular’s\nexplanation that Bou was the more qualified applicant. Because\nthe alleged adverse employment actions are factually distinct,\nwe analyze them separately on appeal. See Lattimore v. Polaroid\nCorp., 99 F.3d 456, 463 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fII.         DISCUSSION\n\n            This Court reviews orders for summary judgment de novo,\n\nconstruing       the   record   in     the    light   most   favorable        to    the\n\nnonmovant    and       resolving     all     reasonable   inferences      in       that\n\nparty's favor.           See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.               Town of\n\nHoulton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).                     This standard of\n\nreview does not limit us to\n\nthe district court's rationale; we may affirm the entry of\n\nsummary judgment on \"any ground revealed by the record.\"                           Id.\n\n            A.         Failure to promote\n\n            The district court correctly determined that Landrau’s\n\nfailure    to     promote    claim     was       time-barred.      42    U.S.C.          §\n\n2000e-5(e) provides that a charge shall be filed with the EEOC\n\n\"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurred,\" or within 300 days after the\n\nunlawful    practice       if   \"the       person   aggrieved     has    initially\n\ninstituted       proceedings    with       [an   authorized]     State   or    local\n\nagency.\"        The longer period is available only in so-called\n\n\"deferral\" jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico.                  See Bonilla v.\n\nMuebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275, 278 & n.4 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            Assuming that the longer period applied, Landrau had\n\n300 days after the alleged adverse employment action to file his\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fcharge with the EEOC.        For purposes of his failure to promote\n\nclaim, the clock began to run no later than April, 1993, when\n\nBou     filled   the   position     Landrau      had    sought,      necessarily\n\nnotifying Landrau that Bou had been selected instead of him.\n\nLandrau did not file his charge of discrimination until March 9,\n\n1995, nearly two years later.         He thus failed to comply with the\n\n300-day limitation period.          “This omission, if unexcused, bars\n\nthe courthouse door, as courts long have recognized that Title\n\nVII’s     charge-filing    requirement      is    a    prerequisite      to   the\n\ncommencement of suit.”       Id. at 278.\n\n            Landrau contends on appeal that the doctrines of notice\n\nand   “continuing      violation”    equitably        tolled   the    limitation\n\nperiod.    He argues that he was unaware that defendant’s actions\n\nwere motivated by racial discrimination until July 14, 1994, and\n\nthat all of the adverse actions were part of a continuous\n\npattern of harassment and discrimination.                Hence, he contends,\n\nhis failure to timely file his charge of discrimination was\n\nexcused.\n\n            Landrau failed to make this argument, however, in his\n\nopposition to Banco Popular’s motion for summary judgment.5\n\n\n      5\n      Although Landrau’s opposition to the motion for summary\njudgment made passing mention of “continuous” harassment, he did\nnot explicitly assert a tolling argument in his accompanying\nbrief.    To the extent that he discussed a “pattern” of\ntreatment, it was in the context of harassment and constructive\n\n                                     -11-\n\fTherefore, he has waived it.                See    Bullington v.    United Air\n\nLines, Inc., 186 F.3d 1301, 1311 (10th Cir. 1999) (refusing to\n\nconsider continuing violation theory that was not adequately\n\npresented       in    district    court);    see   also   Rivera-Muriente     v.\n\nAgosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             To be sure, Landrau asserted a tolling argument in his\n\nmotion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\n\nIt   is    well-settled,         however,   that   new    legal   arguments   or\n\nevidence may not be presented via Rule 59(e); rather, motions\n\nunder that rule must either clearly establish a manifest error\n\nof   law   or    present    newly    discovered     evidence.      See   Federal\n\nDeposit Ins. Corp. v. World Univ., Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).          As Landrau’s tolling argument was available to him\n\nbefore judgment was entered, he could not raise it under Rule\n\n59(e), and we are not obliged to consider it now.                  See id.\n\n             In any event, Landrau’s tolling argument lacks merit.\n\n No continuing violation can be found where the plaintiff was\n\naware of the alleged discrimination outside of the time for\n\nfiling a charge:\n\n             Even where a plaintiff alleges a violation within\n             the appropriate statute of limitations period,\n             the continuing violation claim will fail if the\n\n\ndischarge, not tolling of the limitations period for his\ndiscrimination charge. Nor does Landrau argue on appeal that he\nhad timely raised this argument below.\n\n                                            -12-\n\f             plaintiff was or should have been aware that he\n             was being unlawfully discriminated against while\n             the earlier acts, now untimely, were taking\n             place.\n\nProvencher v. CVS Pharmacy, Div. of Melville Corp., 145 F.3d 5,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 1998).          The record contains a handwritten note by\n\nLandrau dated March 9, 1994, stating, “we, who are black, were\n\ndenied the position and [it] was given to the only white that\n\napplied for it, Mr. Jaime Bou.”                Thus, Landrau apparently was\n\naware of the alleged discrimination with regard to Bou’s hiring\n\napproximately       a    full   year    before    he     filed    his   charge    of\n\ndiscrimination with the EEOC.           Accordingly, neither the doctrine\n\nof notice nor of continuing violation could resuscitate his\n\nfailure to promote claim.          See id.\n\n             As Landrau’s failure to promote claim was time-barred,\n\nwe need go no further with respect to that claim.\n\n             B.         Constructive discharge\n\n             Landrau contends that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that there was insufficient evidence to support his\n\nclaim   of    constructive       discharge       under    Title    VII.     In    an\n\nemployment        discrimination       case    alleging      termination,        the\n\nplaintiff first must establish a prima facie case, i.e., that he\n\n(1)   was    within     a   protected    class;    (2)     met    the   employer's\n\nlegitimate        performance    expectations;         (3)   was    actually      or\n\nconstructively discharged; and (4) was replaced by another with\n\n                                        -13-\n\fsimilar skills and qualifications.             See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\n\nHicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993).\n\n            Alleging constructive discharge presents a “special\n\nwrinkle” that amounts to an additional prima facie element.\n\nSanchez v.       Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 719 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).      In   such    cases,   the    plaintiff   must    prove   that   his\n\nemployer imposed \"’working conditions so intolerable [] that a\n\nreasonable person would feel compelled to forsake his job rather\n\nthan   to   submit      to   looming    indignities.’\"       Simas   v.   First\n\nCitizens' Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 46 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 480 (1st\n\nCir. 1993)) (alteration in original); see also Sanchez, 37 F.3d\n\nat 719.\n\n            Here, the district court concluded that Landrau did not\n\nadduce sufficient evidence to support a constructive discharge\n\nclaim, noting that the alleged events did not occur close in\n\ntime   to   Landrau’s        termination.       We   think   that    Landrau’s\n\nresignation came too late after the offensive conduct to be\n\nlabeled a constructive discharge.              See Smith v. Bath Iron Works\n\nCorp., 943 F.2d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 1991).              If a plaintiff does\n\nnot resign within a reasonable time period after the alleged\n\nharassment, he was not constructively discharged.                See id. (no\n\nconstructive discharge found where plaintiff quit six months\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fafter last reported incident of sexual harassment), and cases\n\ncited.\n\n         Here, Landrau has not adduced evidence of any incidents\n\nof mistreatment within a reasonable time of his resignation in\n\nFebruary, 1995.    The specific events to which he has affixed\n\ndates -- i.e., the written reprimands, Bou’s attempt to frame\n\nhim, Bou’s failure to accommodate his disability -- occurred no\n\nlater than June or July, 1994, at least seven months before\n\nLandrau’s resignation.    Landrau has therefore failed to provide\n\nsufficient evidence of constructive discharge, and, accordingly,\n\nfailed to make out a prima case of discriminatory termination.6\n\nSee Vega, 3 F.3d at 480.     Hence, the district court properly\n\nawarded summary judgment for Banco Popular on the issue of\n\nconstructive discharge.\n\n         C.       Race-based harassment\n\n         In his amended complaint and trial court brief, as well\n\nas in his appellate brief, Landrau asserted a claim of race-\n\nbased harassment that is separable from the failure to promote\n\n\n\n\n    6Although the district court correctly determined that no\nrational   juror  could   have  believed   that  Landrau  was\nconstructively discharged, it nonetheless held that he passed\nthe prima facie hurdle because he was qualified for Sandín’s\nposition.   As to Landrau’s termination claim, this was a non\nsequitur. See note 4, supra.\n\n                               -15-\n\fand constructive termination claims.7           See Lattimore, 99 F.3d at\n\n463.       An employee states a claim under Title VII if he alleges\n\noffensive, race-based conduct that is severe or pervasive enough\n\nto create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment and\n\nis subjectively perceived by the victim as abusive.               See id.\n\n              [W]hether   an  environment   is   \"hostile\"   or\n              \"abusive\" can be determined only by looking at\n              all the circumstances.    These may include the\n              frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its\n              severity; whether it is physically threatening or\n              humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and\n              whether it unreasonably interferes with an\n              employee's work performance.\n\nHarris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993).\n\n              Unlike   the   failure   to      promote   claim,   Landrau’s\n\nharassment claim is not time-barred.              As discussed supra, he\n\ndescribed specific episodes of mistreatment as well as ongoing\n\nharassment occurring within the 300-day limitations period set\n\nforth in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e).\n\n              The district court stated that Landrau had not provided\n\n“enough evidence to support a finding of continuous harassment,\n\nunreasonably      tight   supervision,    or    imposition   of   a   hostile\n\n\n\n       7\n      Although Landrau sometimes characterizes the harassment as\n“retaliatory” in his briefs, he makes no effort to address the\nestablished framework for a Title VII retaliation claim, see,\ne.g., Simas, 170 F.3d at 44, i.e., he does not explicitly set\nforth evidence of protected activity or its causal connection to\nthe harassment.      Hence, we do not consider a separate\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fworking environment.”         In so concluding, it referenced only the\n\ntwo written reprimands Landrau received after Bou became his\n\nsupervisor and the break incident (in which Landrau brought co-\n\nworkers to Bou to explain that he had given proper notice when\n\nhe took a meal break).           The court apparently did not take into\n\naccount   other    specific      aspects     of   the   mistreatment      Landrau\n\nalleged in his deposition and affidavit -- including, inter\n\nalia, the verbal criticisms, the monitoring of his whereabouts,\n\nthe   reference    to    “kinky     hair,”   Bou’s      purported   attempt     to\n\n“frame” him, Bou’s failure to accommodate Landrau’s physical\n\ninjury, and the complaint about his meeting with other black\n\nemployees to discuss a discrimination claim -- that were not\n\nimposed on white employees.\n\n           There is, to be sure, some tension between Landrau’s\n\naffidavit in support of his opposition to summary judgment and\n\nhis   deposition.        In   his    affidavit     he    states   that    he   was\n\nsubjected to ongoing criticism and harassment, including Bou’s\n\n“almost   daily”        verbal    reprimands,      weekly     “yelling,”       and\n\nheightened monitoring of his work and whereabouts.                       But when\n\nasked   earlier    to    describe     specific     “admonishments”        in   his\n\ndeposition, Landrau enumerated only the two written reprimands\n\nand the break incident.          The comprehensiveness of this response,\n\nhowever, is rendered somewhat ambiguous by the fact that when\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fasked whether he had received any “verbal admonishments,” he\n\nmentioned “[t]he persecutions that I have always had,” then went\n\non to discuss the break incident.                  He later stated in his\n\ndeposition that he did not “recall” other “admonishments” at\n\nthat time.        While fodder for impeachment, Landrau’s statements\n\ndo not involve the sort of direct contradiction that we have\n\nheld fails to create a “genuine” factual dispute for summary\n\njudgment purposes.          See, e.g., Borowiec v. Local No. 1570, 889\n\nF.2d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n                Looking at the totality of the circumstances, we find\n\nthe evidence in Landrau’s affidavit and deposition, while close\n\nto the line, to be sufficient to withstand summary judgment.8\n\nWe must, of course, consider the evidence and all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to Landrau.\n\nSee Buenrostro v. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nThis evidence might, if proven, support a race-based harassment\n\nclaim.         See, e.g., Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 178\n\nF.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 1999) (plaintiff alleged comments or jokes\n\nof   a       racial   nature);   Lattimore,   99   F.3d   at   463   (plaintiff\n\n\n         8\n     Also contained in the summary judgment record below is an\nexcerpt from the deposition of Landrau’s psychiatrist, who\nstated (based on his sessions with Landrau) that Landrau was\ncalled a “good Negro” by Banco Popular personnel. This evidence\nis inadmissible hearsay, however, and thus cannot be taken into\naccount for purposes of the summary judgment calculus.      See\nVazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                      -18-\n\falleged that he was coerced into performing tasks inconsistent\n\nwith his medical restriction, unlike white employees).                   Alleged\n\nconduct    that     is   not    explicitly    racial    in     nature   may,   in\n\nappropriate circumstances, be considered along with more overtly\n\ndiscriminatory       conduct     in   assessing   a    Title    VII   harassment\n\nclaim.    See DeGrace v. Rumsfield, 614 F.2d 796, 800 (1st Cir.\n\n1980) (evidence of equipment sabotage and co-workers’ “silent\n\ntreatment” considered along with racially explicit notes); see\n\nalso Williams v. General Motors Corp., 187 F.3d 553, 563-64 (6th\n\nCir. 1999) (sexual harassment); O’Shea v. Yellow Tech. Servs.,\n\nInc., 185 F.3d 1093, 1097 (10th Cir. 1999); Carter v. Chrysler\n\nCorp., 173 F.3d 693, 701 (8th Cir. 1999).               We note further that\n\nthere is evidence that Landrau complained about his alleged\n\nmistreatment to Banco Popular’s management, and that he suffered\n\nemotional harm as a result of the harassment.                   On the present\n\nstate of the record, we cannot say that there is no genuine\n\nissue     of     material      fact   concerning      Landrau’s       race-based\n\nharassment claim.        Thus, while we take no view on its ultimate\n\nmerits, we must vacate the district court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment on that claim and remand it for further proceedings not\n\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n\n               D. State law claim\n\n\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f             On appeal, Landrau asserts that his discrimination\n\nclaim under Puerto Rico Law 100 should survive summary judgment.9\n\nThe district court did not analyze or even mention his Law 100\n\nclaim, but simply dismissed Landrau’s complaint in its entirety.\n\nIt seems likely that the district court, having decided that\n\nLandrau’s Title VII claims should be dismissed, declined to\n\nretain jurisdiction over the state law claim.               This disposition\n\ncannot stand in light of our reversal of the ruling on the Title\n\nVII harassment claim.        We therefore vacate the district court’s\n\ndismissal of Landrau’s harassment claim under Law 100, and\n\nremand it for further consideration not inconsistent with this\n\nopinion.10\n\n             Banco Popular contends that Landrau has waived his Law\n\n100 claim because he failed to argue it below in his opposition\n\nto   summary    judgment.      In   its   brief    in   support   of   summary\n\njudgment,      however,     Banco   Popular       focused   exclusively     on\n\nLandrau’s Title VII claims and did not address the Law 100 claim\n\n\n\n      9\n     As with Landrau’s Title VII claim, the state law claim\nappears to encompass discriminatory failure to promote,\nharassment and constructive discharge.\n      10\n      For the reasons we have set forth regarding the similar\nfederal claims, we affirm the dismissal of Landrau’s state-law\nfailure to promote and constructive discharge claims. In all\nevents, we note that Landrau does not argue on appeal that the\ntimeliness of these claims should be analyzed differently under\nLaw 100 than under Title VII.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fin any manner.11   Landrau could fairly have understood that Banco\n\nPopular was moving for summary judgment only on the Title VII\n\nclaims, and that he was not required to address the merits of\n\nthe Law 100 claim.\n\n          Affirmed in part and reversed in part, and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.      Each\n\nparty to bear his or its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      This failure, therefore, is distinguishable from Landrau’s\nfailure to oppose Banco Popular’s statute of limitations\nargument. See section A, supra.\n\n                                -21-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the appellant. See New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. v. Northeast Dairy Compact Comm'n, 198 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1999). Landrau, a black man, was employed by Banco Popular from 1981 until his resignation in 1995. He began as a clerk in the collection department, and was transferred in 1988 to the insurance unit of the mortgage department for the remainder of his employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, 1993, Landrau's supervisor, Carmen Sandn, retired from her position as supervisor of the mortgage insurance services. Several Banco Popular employees applied for the vacant position, including Landrau. In April, 1993, a white man, Jaime Bou, was selected and became Landrau's supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bou subjected Landrau's work to closer scrutiny than that of the other employees in the unit, and closely monitored Landrau's whereabouts. This monitoring included forcing Landrau to leave a note on his desk every time he went on break, to the bathroom, or to get a drink of water. At one point after June 30, 1994, Bou verbally admonished Landrau for taking a break without providing notification of his whereabouts (\"the break incident\"). When Landrau brought co-workers to explain to Bou that Landrau had in fact informed them of his whereabouts, Bou \"said nothing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bou criticized and \"yelled\" at Landrau more frequently than other employees, sometimes in front of Landrau's co-workers. Moreover, after Landrau suffered an injury at work and returned from disability leave on December 29, 1993, Bou assigned him physically strenuous tasks in disregard of an accommodation ordered by the State Insurance Fund. This disregard of Landrau's disability continued through June or July, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March or April, 1994, Landrau received a written reprimand for misidentifying the date on certain paperwork, which caused duplicate payments to be made. On June 30, 1994, Bou gave Landrau another reprimand for continuing to repeat these mistakes. Landrau's performance evaluations, which had been excellent under his previous supervisors, declined. Landrau contends that the errors were due to the bank's failure to provide him with adequate computer training, which his co-workers received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau alleges other harassment, including Bou's attempt to \"frame\" him in June, 1994, by using Landrau's computer to commit errors for which Landrau was blamed. Bou and other supervisors made jokes and comments about his race, including remarking upon his \"kinky hair.\" One of the supervisors also complained in writing about Landrau's meeting with other Banco Popular employees to discuss filing a race discrimination complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to remove himself from these circumstances, Landrau submitted applications for other positions within Banco Popular, but was not hired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Landrau complained to Banco Popular about the alleged harassment and racial discrimination. In a letter dated March 7, 1994, Landrau stated that he had been unfairly subjected to reprimands after Bou replaced Sandn, and that \"work became hell.\" On June 14, 1994, Landrau wrote a letter to general manager Felipe Franco alleging that Bou was mistreating him due to race discrimination; on August 26 of that year, Landrau wrote another letter to Franco complaining that he had been turned down for Sandn's position and that his performance evaluations had fallen since Bou became his supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Banco Popular investigated the allegations, and, in a report dated November 3, 1994, concluded that Landau's problems were not caused by discrimination. Landrau's job duties, pay, and physical working environment did not change while Bou was his supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 1995, Landrau submitted a letter of resignation stating that he was leaving Banco Popular because he had another job opportunity. On February 28, 1995, the day that resignation was to be effective, he submitted another letter, this time stating that the true reason for his resignation was discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau filed charges of discrimination with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of Puerto Rico's Labor Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on or about March 9, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The EEOC issued him a \"right-to-sue\" letter on January 16, 1996. On April 16, 1996, Landrau filed employment discrimination claims against Banco Popular in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. and Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination statute, Law 100, P.R. Laws Ann. 29, &#167; 146 et seq.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He appears to have alleged three adverse employment actions on the basis of his race and color: (1) that Banco Popular failed to promote him to Sandn's position; (2) that he was subjected to harassment after Bou became his supervisor; and (3) that the harassment became so intolerable that it resulted in his constructive termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1997, Banco Popular moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) Landrau could not adduce sufficient evidence to support his constructive discharge claim; and (2) Landrau's failure-to-promote claim was time-barred because he did not file a charge of discrimination within the 300-day time limit set forth in Title VII. Landrau opposed the summary judgment motion, contending that his working conditions amounted to actionable harassment and constructive discharge, and that Banco Popular's failure to promote him was discriminatory. Landrau did not, however, explicitly counter defendants' time bar argument or address the state law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his opposition to Banco Popular's summary judgment motion, Landrau submitted, inter alia, affidavits by Sandn and another former supervisor that discussed a general climate of racial discrimination at Banco Popular. Specifically, Sandn stated in her affidavit that she \"always had the impression that black candidates like Mr. Landrau were not welcome [sic] by the top management of Banco Popular for trainee positions in management nor for supervisory positions.\" The other former Banco Popular supervisor, Angel Rivera Colon, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I had my reservations that [Landrau] would not be selected just for been [sic] black, considering that a white applicant, Mr. Jaime Bou, had already applied for the position. In fact, during my 29 years of experience in Banco Popular it was an unwritten law that somehow was conveyed to us officials, that if there was a white applicant and a black applicant for the same position, the white applicant would get the position, and that was accepted as an implied rule, although nobody dared to publicly talk about it or openly admitting [sic] it. Also it was well known to me that blacks were not welcomed for management positions, although nobody told me so explicitly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court allowed Banco Popular's motion for summary judgment on February 23, 1999. See Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 35 F. Supp. 2d 195 (D.P.R. 1999). The court stated in a footnote that Landrau's failure to file a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC provided a basis for awarding summary judgment to Banco Popular, but went on to address the merits of Landrau's claims. The district court determined that Landrau had established a prima facie case of discrimination based upon the fact that Bou had been hired to fill Sandn's position. Landrau failed to rebut Banco Popular's nondiscriminatory explanation for the selection of Bou, however, with sufficient evidence of discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court stated that the affidavits offered by Sandn and Rivera did not sufficiently establish discriminatory intent. It also concluded that Landrau did not adduce sufficient evidence of race-based harassment or constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1999, Landrau filed a motion to set aside the opinion and order and for reconsideration pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). For the first time, Landrau asserted that the time period for filing his charge of discrimination should be tolled due to operation of the discovery rule and the \"continuing violation\" doctrine. The district court denied the motion on March 29, 1999. Landrau appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court reviews orders for summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999). This standard of review does not limit us to the district court's rationale; we may affirm the entry of summary judgment on \"any ground revealed by the record.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Failure to promote</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly determined that Landrau's failure to promote claim was time-barred. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e) provides that a charge shall be filed with the EEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\" or within 300 days after the unlawful practice if \"the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with [an authorized] State or local agency.\" The longer period is available only in so-called \"deferral\" jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico. See Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275, 278 &amp; n.4 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the longer period applied, Landrau had 300 days after the alleged adverse employment action to file his charge with the EEOC. For purposes of his failure to promote claim, the clock began to run no later than April, 1993, when Bou filled the position Landrau had sought, necessarily notifying Landrau that Bou had been selected instead of him. Landrau did not file his charge of discrimination until March 9, 1995, nearly two years later. He thus failed to comply with the 300-day limitation period. \"This omission, if unexcused, bars the courthouse door, as courts long have recognized that Title VII's charge-filing requirement is a prerequisite to the commencement of suit.\" Id. at 278.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau contends on appeal that the doctrines of notice and \"continuing violation\" equitably tolled the limitation period. He argues that he was unaware that defendant's actions were motivated by racial discrimination until July 14, 1994, and that all of the adverse actions were part of a continuous pattern of harassment and discrimination. Hence, he contends, his failure to timely file his charge of discrimination was excused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau failed to make this argument, however, in his opposition to Banco Popular's motion for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Therefore, he has waived it. See Bullington v. United Air Lines, Inc., 186 F.3d 1301, 1311 (10th Cir. 1999) (refusing to consider continuing violation theory that was not adequately presented in district court); see also Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Landrau asserted a tolling argument in his motion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). It is well-settled, however, that new legal arguments or evidence may not be presented via Rule 59(e); rather, motions under that rule must either clearly establish a manifest error of law or present newly discovered evidence. See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. World Univ., Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1992). As Landrau's tolling argument was available to him before judgment was entered, he could not raise it under Rule 59(e), and we are not obliged to consider it now. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Landrau's tolling argument lacks merit. No continuing violation can be found where the plaintiff was aware of the alleged discrimination outside of the time for filing a charge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where a plaintiff alleges a violation within the appropriate statute of limitations period, the continuing violation claim will fail if the plaintiff was or should have been aware that he was being unlawfully discriminated against while the earlier acts, now untimely, were taking place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, Div. of Melville Corp., 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998). The record contains a handwritten note by Landrau dated March 9, 1994, stating, \"we, who are black, were denied the position and [it] was given to the only white that applied for it, Mr. Jaime Bou.\" Thus, Landrau apparently was aware of the alleged discrimination with regard to Bou's hiring approximately a full year before he filed his charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Accordingly, neither the doctrine of notice nor of continuing violation could resuscitate his failure to promote claim. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Landrau's failure to promote claim was time-barred, we need go no further with respect to that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Constructive discharge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau contends that the district court erred in concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support his claim of constructive discharge under Title VII. In an employment discrimination case alleging termination, the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case, i.e., that he (1) was within a protected class; (2) met the employer's legitimate performance expectations; (3) was actually or constructively discharged; and (4) was replaced by another with similar skills and qualifications. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alleging constructive discharge presents a \"special wrinkle\" that amounts to an additional prima facie element. Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 719 (1st Cir. 1994). In such cases, the plaintiff must prove that his employer imposed \"'working conditions so intolerable [] that a reasonable person would feel compelled to forsake his job rather than to submit to looming indignities.'\" Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 46 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir. 1993)) (alteration in original); see also Sanchez, 37 F.3d at 719.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court concluded that Landrau did not adduce sufficient evidence to support a constructive discharge claim, noting that the alleged events did not occur close in time to Landrau's termination. We think that Landrau's resignation came too late after the offensive conduct to be labeled a constructive discharge. See Smith v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 943 F.2d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 1991). If a plaintiff does not resign within a reasonable time period after the alleged harassment, he was not constructively discharged. See id. (no constructive discharge found where plaintiff quit six months after last reported incident of sexual harassment), and cases cited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Landrau has not adduced evidence of any incidents of mistreatment within a reasonable time of his resignation in February, 1995. The specific events to which he has affixed dates -- i.e., the written reprimands, Bou's attempt to frame him, Bou's failure to accommodate his disability -- occurred no later than June or July, 1994, at least seven months before Landrau's resignation. Landrau has therefore failed to provide sufficient evidence of constructive discharge, and, accordingly, failed to make out a prima case of discriminatory termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See Vega, 3 F.3d at 480. Hence, the district court properly awarded summary judgment for Banco Popular on the issue of constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Race-based harassment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his amended complaint and trial court brief, as well as in his appellate brief, Landrau asserted a claim of race-based harassment that is separable from the failure to promote and constructive termination claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> See Lattimore, 99 F.3d at 463. An employee states a claim under Title VII if he alleges offensive, race-based conduct that is severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment and is subjectively perceived by the victim as abusive. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hether an environment is \"hostile\" or \"abusive\" can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity;whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the failure to promote claim, Landrau's harassment claim is not time-barred. As discussed supra, he described specific episodes of mistreatment as well as ongoing harassment occurring within the 300-day limitations period set forth in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that Landrau had not provided \"enough evidence to support a finding of continuous harassment, unreasonably tight supervision, or imposition of a hostile working environment.\" In so concluding, it referenced only the two written reprimands Landrau received after Bou became his supervisor and the break incident (in which Landrau brought co-workers to Bou to explain that he had given proper notice when he took a meal break). The court apparently did not take into account other specific aspects of the mistreatment Landrau alleged in his deposition and affidavit --including, inter alia, the verbal criticisms, the monitoring of his whereabouts, the reference to \"kinky hair,\" Bou's purported attempt to \"frame\" him, Bou's failure to accommodate Landrau's physical injury, and the complaint about his meeting with other black employees to discuss a discrimination claim -- that were not imposed on white employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, to be sure, some tension between Landrau's affidavit in support of his opposition to summary judgment and his deposition. In his affidavit he states that he was subjected to ongoing criticism and harassment, including Bou's \"almost daily\" verbal reprimands, weekly \"yelling,\" and heightened monitoring of his work and whereabouts. But when asked earlier to describe specific \"admonishments\" in his deposition, Landrau enumerated only the two written reprimands and the break incident. The comprehensiveness of this response, however, is rendered somewhat ambiguous by the fact that when asked whether he had received any \"verbal admonishments,\" he mentioned \"[t]he persecutions that I have always had,\" then went on to discuss the break incident. He later stated in his deposition that he did not \"recall\" other \"admonishments\" at that time. While fodder for impeachment, Landrau's statements do not involve the sort of direct contradiction that we have held fails to create a \"genuine\" factual dispute for summary judgment purposes. See, e.g., Borowiec v. Local No. 1570, 889 F.2d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking at the totality of the circumstances, we find the evidence in Landrau's affidavit and deposition, while close to the line, to be sufficient to withstand summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We must, of course, consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to Landrau. See Buenrostro v. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1992). This evidence might, if proven, support a race-based harassment claim. See, e.g., Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 178 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 1999) (plaintiff alleged comments or jokes of a racial nature); Lattimore, 99 F.3d at 463 (plaintiff alleged that he was coerced into performing tasks inconsistent with his medical restriction, unlike white employees). Alleged conduct that is not explicitly racial in nature may, in appropriate circumstances, be considered along with more overtly discriminatory conduct in assessing a Title VII harassment claim. See DeGrace v. Rumsfield, 614 F.2d 796, 800 (1st Cir. 1980) (evidence of equipment sabotage and co-workers' \"silent treatment\" considered along with racially explicit notes); see also Williams v. General Motors Corp., 187 F.3d 553, 563-64 (6th Cir. 1999) (sexual harassment); O'Shea v. Yellow Tech. Servs., Inc., 185 F.3d 1093, 1097 (10th Cir. 1999); Carter v. Chrysler Corp., 173 F.3d 693, 701 (8th Cir. 1999). We note further that there is evidence that Landrau complained about his alleged mistreatment to Banco Popular's management, and that he suffered emotional harm as a result of the harassment. On the present state of the record, we cannot say that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning Landrau's race-based harassment claim. Thus, while we take no view on its ultimate merits, we must vacate the district court's entry of summary judgment on that claim and remand it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. State law claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Landrau asserts that his discrimination claim under Puerto Rico Law 100 should survive summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The district court did not analyze or even mention his Law 100 claim, but simply dismissed Landrau's complaint in its entirety. It seems likely that the district court, having decided that Landrau's Title VII claims should be dismissed, declined to retain jurisdiction over the state law claim. This disposition cannot stand in light of our reversal of the ruling on the Title VII harassment claim. We therefore vacate the district court's dismissal of Landrau's harassment claim under Law 100, and remand it for further consideration not inconsistent with this opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Banco Popular contends that Landrau has waived his Law 100 claim because he failed to argue it below in his opposition to summary judgment. In its brief in support of summary judgment, however, Banco Popular focused exclusively on Landrau's Title VII claims and did not address the Law 100 claim in any manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Landrau could fairly have understood that Banco Popular was moving for summary judgment only on the Title VII claims, and that he was not required to address the merits of the Law 100 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

He does not contend that he was denied any of these positions due to racial discrimination.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> March 9, 1995, is the date on the Department of Labor discrimination charge form contained in the record, although Landrau's complaint and the district court's opinion state that the charge was filed on February 28, 1995. This discrepancy is not material.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The complaint originally alleged age discrimination as well as race discrimination; the age claim was later dropped.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court appeared to confuse or conflate the different adverse employment actions in applying the burden-shifting analysis. For example, it stated that Landrau established a prima facie case of racial discrimination because Bou was hired instead of him, but pointed to Landrau's failure to adduce evidence of harassment or constructive discharge in concluding that Landrau did not rebut Banco Popular's explanation that Bou was the more qualified applicant. Because the alleged adverse employment actions are factually distinct, we analyze them separately on appeal. See Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456, 463 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although Landrau's opposition to the motion for summary judgment made passing mention of \"continuous\" harassment, he did not explicitly assert a tolling argument in his accompanying brief. To the extent that he discussed a \"pattern\" of treatment, it was in the context of harassment and constructive discharge, not tolling of the limitations period for his discrimination charge. Nor does Landrau argue on appeal that he had timely raised this argument below.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although the district court correctly determined that no rational juror could have believed that Landrau was constructively discharged, it nonetheless held that he passed the prima facie hurdle because he was qualified for Sandn's position. As to Landrau's termination claim, this was a non sequitur. See note 4, supra.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although Landrau sometimes characterizes the harassment as \"retaliatory\" in his briefs, he makes no effort to address the established framework for a Title VII retaliation claim, see, e.g., Simas, 170 F.3d at 44, i.e., he does not explicitly set forth evidence of protected activity or its causal connection to the harassment. Hence, we do not consider a separate retaliation claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Also contained in the summary judgment record below is an excerpt from the deposition of Landrau's psychiatrist, who stated (based on his sessions with Landrau) that Landrau was called a \"good Negro\" by Banco Popular personnel. This evidence is inadmissible hearsay, however, and thus cannot be taken into account for purposes of the summary judgment calculus. See Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> As with Landrau's Title VII claim, the state law claim appears to encompass discriminatory failure to promote, harassment and constructive discharge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> For the reasons we have set forth regarding the similar federal claims, we affirm the dismissal of Landrau's state-law failure to promote and constructive discharge claims. In all events, we note that Landrau does not argue on appeal that the timeliness of these claims should be analyzed differently under Law 100 than under Title VII.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> This failure, therefore, is distinguishable from Landrau's failure to oppose Banco Popular's statute of limitations argument.

Landrau, a black man, was employed by Banco Popular from 1981 until his resignation in 1995. He began as a clerk in the collection department, and was transferred in 1988 to the insurance unit of the mortgage department for the remainder of his employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, 1993, Landrau's supervisor, Carmen Sandn, retired from her position as supervisor of the mortgage insurance services. Several Banco Popular employees applied for the vacant position, including Landrau. In April, 1993, a white man, Jaime Bou, was selected and became Landrau's supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bou subjected Landrau's work to closer scrutiny than that of the other employees in the unit, and closely monitored Landrau's whereabouts. This monitoring included forcing Landrau to leave a note on his desk every time he went on break, to the bathroom, or to get a drink of water. At one point after June 30, 1994, Bou verbally admonished Landrau for taking a break without providing notification of his whereabouts (\"the break incident\"). When Landrau brought co-workers to explain to Bou that Landrau had in fact informed them of his whereabouts, Bou \"said nothing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bou criticized and \"yelled\" at Landrau more frequently than other employees, sometimes in front of Landrau's co-workers. Moreover, after Landrau suffered an injury at work and returned from disability leave on December 29, 1993, Bou assigned him physically strenuous tasks in disregard of an accommodation ordered by the State Insurance Fund. This disregard of Landrau's disability continued through June or July, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March or April, 1994, Landrau received a written reprimand for misidentifying the date on certain paperwork, which caused duplicate payments to be made. On June 30, 1994, Bou gave Landrau another reprimand for continuing to repeat these mistakes. Landrau's performance evaluations, which had been excellent under his previous supervisors, declined. Landrau contends that the errors were due to the bank's failure to provide him with adequate computer training, which his co-workers received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau alleges other harassment, including Bou's attempt to \"frame\" him in June, 1994, by using Landrau's computer to commit errors for which Landrau was blamed. Bou and other supervisors made jokes and comments about his race, including remarking upon his \"kinky hair.\" One of the supervisors also complained in writing about Landrau's meeting with other Banco Popular employees to discuss filing a race discrimination complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to remove himself from these circumstances, Landrau submitted applications for other positions within Banco Popular, but was not hired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Landrau complained to Banco Popular about the alleged harassment and racial discrimination. In a letter dated March 7, 1994, Landrau stated that he had been unfairly subjected to reprimands after Bou replaced Sandn, and that \"work became hell.\" On June 14, 1994, Landrau wrote a letter to general manager Felipe Franco alleging that Bou was mistreating him due to race discrimination; on August 26 of that year, Landrau wrote another letter to Franco complaining that he had been turned down for Sandn's position and that his performance evaluations had fallen since Bou became his supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Banco Popular investigated the allegations, and, in a report dated November 3, 1994, concluded that Landau's problems were not caused by discrimination. Landrau's job duties, pay, and physical working environment did not change while Bou was his supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 1995, Landrau submitted a letter of resignation stating that he was leaving Banco Popular because he had another job opportunity. On February 28, 1995, the day that resignation was to be effective, he submitted another letter, this time stating that the true reason for his resignation was discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau filed charges of discrimination with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of Puerto Rico's Labor Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on or about March 9, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The EEOC issued him a \"right-to-sue\" letter on January 16, 1996. On April 16, 1996, Landrau filed employment discrimination claims against Banco Popular in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. and Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination statute, Law 100, P.R. Laws Ann. 29, &#167; 146 et seq.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He appears to have alleged three adverse employment actions on the basis of his race and color: (1) that Banco Popular failed to promote him to Sandn's position; (2) that he was subjected to harassment after Bou became his supervisor; and (3) that the harassment became so intolerable that it resulted in his constructive termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1997, Banco Popular moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) Landrau could not adduce sufficient evidence to support his constructive discharge claim; and (2) Landrau's failure-to-promote claim was time-barred because he did not file a charge of discrimination within the 300-day time limit set forth in Title VII. Landrau opposed the summary judgment motion, contending that his working conditions amounted to actionable harassment and constructive discharge, and that Banco Popular's failure to promote him was discriminatory. Landrau did not, however, explicitly counter defendants' time bar argument or address the state law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his opposition to Banco Popular's summary judgment motion, Landrau submitted, inter alia, affidavits by Sandn and another former supervisor that discussed a general climate of racial discrimination at Banco Popular. Specifically, Sandn stated in her affidavit that she \"always had the impression that black candidates like Mr. Landrau were not welcome [sic] by the top management of Banco Popular for trainee positions in management nor for supervisory positions.\" The other former Banco Popular supervisor, Angel Rivera Colon, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I had my reservations that [Landrau] would not be selected just for been [sic] black, considering that a white applicant, Mr. Jaime Bou, had already applied for the position. In fact, during my 29 years of experience in Banco Popular it was an unwritten law that somehow was conveyed to us officials, that if there was a white applicant and a black applicant for the same position, the white applicant would get the position, and that was accepted as an implied rule, although nobody dared to publicly talk about it or openly admitting [sic] it. Also it was well known to me that blacks were not welcomed for management positions, although nobody told me so explicitly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court allowed Banco Popular's motion for summary judgment on February 23, 1999. See Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2491661\"><a href=\"/opinion/2491661/romero-v-banco-popular-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span> </a></span>(D.P.R. 1999). The court stated in a footnote that Landrau's failure to file a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC provided a basis for awarding summary judgment to Banco Popular, but went on to address the merits of Landrau's claims. The district court determined that Landrau had established a prima facie case of discrimination based upon the fact that Bou had been hired to fill Sandn's position. Landrau failed to rebut Banco Popular's nondiscriminatory explanation for the selection of Bou, however, with sufficient evidence of discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court stated that the affidavits offered by Sandn and Rivera did not sufficiently establish discriminatory intent. It also concluded that Landrau did not adduce sufficient evidence of race-based harassment or constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1999, Landrau filed a motion to set aside the opinion and order and for reconsideration pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). For the first time, Landrau asserted that the time period for filing his charge of discrimination should be tolled due to operation of the discovery rule and the \"continuing violation\" doctrine. The district court denied the motion on March 29, 1999. Landrau appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court reviews orders for summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763565\"><a href=\"/opinion/763565/houlton-citizens-coalition-v-town-of-houlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 184 (1st Cir. 1999). This standard of review does not limit us to the district court's rationale; we may affirm the entry of summary judgment on \"any ground revealed by the record.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Failure to promote</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly determined that Landrau's failure to promote claim was time-barred. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e) provides that a charge shall be filed with the EEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\" or within 300 days after the unlawful practice if \"the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with [an authorized] State or local agency.\" The longer period is available only in so-called \"deferral\" jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico. See Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198699\"><a href=\"/opinion/198699/bonilla-v-muebles/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 278 &amp; n.4 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the longer period applied, Landrau had 300 days after the alleged adverse employment action to file his charge with the EEOC. For purposes of his failure to promote claim, the clock began to run no later than April, 1993, when Bou filled the position Landrau had sought, necessarily notifying Landrau that Bou had been selected instead of him. Landrau did not file his charge of discrimination until March 9, 1995, nearly two years later. He thus failed to comply with the 300-day limitation period. \"This omission, if unexcused, bars the courthouse door, as courts long have recognized that Title VII's charge-filing requirement is a prerequisite to the commencement of suit.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198699\"><a href=\"/opinion/198699/bonilla-v-muebles/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 278.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau contends on appeal that the doctrines of notice and \"continuing violation\" equitably tolled the limitation period. He argues that he was unaware that defendant's actions were motivated by racial discrimination until July 14, 1994, and that all of the adverse actions were part of a continuous pattern of harassment and discrimination. Hence, he contends, his failure to timely file his charge of discrimination was excused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau failed to make this argument, however, in his opposition to Banco Popular's motion for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Therefore, he has waived it. See Bullington v. United Air Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158416\"><a href=\"/opinion/158416/bullington-v-united-air-lines/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span>, 1311 (10th Cir. 1999) (refusing to consider continuing violation theory that was not adequately presented in district court); see also Rivera-Muriente v.

R. Civ. P. 59(e). It is well-settled, however, that new legal arguments or evidence may not be presented via Rule 59(e); rather, motions under that rule must either clearly establish a manifest error of law or present newly discovered evidence. See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. World Univ., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593291\"><a href=\"/opinion/593291/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-world-university-inc-santa/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1992). As Landrau's tolling argument was available to him before judgment was entered, he could not raise it under Rule 59(e), and we are not obliged to consider it now. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Landrau's tolling argument lacks merit. No continuing violation can be found where the plaintiff was aware of the alleged discrimination outside of the time for filing a charge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where a plaintiff alleges a violation within the appropriate statute of limitations period, the continuing violation claim will fail if the plaintiff was or should have been aware that he was being unlawfully discriminated against while the earlier acts, now untimely, were taking place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provencher v.

The record contains a handwritten note by Landrau dated March 9, 1994, stating, \"we, who are black, were denied the position and [it] was given to the only white that applied for it, Mr. Jaime Bou.\" Thus, Landrau apparently was aware of the alleged discrimination with regard to Bou's hiring approximately a full year before he filed his charge of discrimination with the EEOC.

Constructive discharge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landrau contends that the district court erred in concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support his claim of constructive discharge under Title VII. In an employment discrimination case alleging termination, the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case, i.e., that he (1) was within a protected class; (2) met the employer's legitimate performance expectations; (3) was actually or constructively discharged; and (4) was replaced by another with similar skills and qualifications. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.

We think that Landrau's resignation came too late after the offensive conduct to be labeled a constructive discharge. See Smith v. Bath Iron Works Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567596\"><a href=\"/opinion/567596/56-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1297-57-empl-prac-dec-p-41015-jane-thayer/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 167 (1st Cir. 1991). If a plaintiff does not resign within a reasonable time period after the alleged harassment, he was not constructively discharged. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567596\"><a href=\"/opinion/567596/56-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1297-57-empl-prac-dec-p-41015-jane-thayer/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> (no constructive </a></span>discharge found where plaintiff quit six months after last reported incident of sexual harassment), and cases cited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Landrau has not adduced evidence of any incidents of mistreatment within a reasonable time of his resignation in February, 1995. The specific events to which he has affixed dates -- i.e., the written reprimands, Bou's attempt to frame him, Bou's failure to accommodate his disability -- occurred no later than June or July, 1994, at least seven months before Landrau's resignation. Landrau has therefore failed to provide sufficient evidence of constructive discharge, and, accordingly, failed to make out a prima case of discriminatory termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628958\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vega,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/628958/62-fair-emplpraccas-1198-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42530-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>.

As <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">discussed</span> supra</span>, he described specific episodes of mistreatment as well as ongoing harassment occurring within the 300-day limitations period set forth in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that Landrau had not provided \"enough evidence to support a finding of continuous harassment, unreasonably tight supervision, or imposition of a hostile working environment.\" In so concluding, it referenced only the two written reprimands Landrau received after Bou became his supervisor and the break incident (in which Landrau brought co-workers to Bou to explain that he had given proper notice when he took a meal break). The court apparently did not take into account other specific aspects of the mistreatment Landrau alleged in his deposition and affidavit --including, inter alia, the verbal criticisms, the monitoring of his whereabouts, the reference to \"kinky hair,\" Bou's purported attempt to \"frame\" him, Bou's failure to accommodate Landrau's physical injury, and the complaint about his meeting with other black employees to discuss a discrimination claim -- that were not imposed on white employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, to be sure, some tension between Landrau's affidavit in support of his opposition to summary judgment and his deposition. In his affidavit he states that he was subjected to ongoing criticism and harassment, including Bou's \"almost daily\" verbal reprimands, weekly \"yelling,\" and heightened monitoring of his work and whereabouts. But when asked earlier to describe specific \"admonishments\" in his deposition, Landrau enumerated only the two written reprimands and the break incident. The comprehensiveness of this response, however, is rendered somewhat ambiguous by the fact that when asked whether he had received any \"verbal admonishments,\" he mentioned \"[t]he persecutions that I have always had,\" then went on to discuss the break incident. He later stated in his deposition that he did not \"recall\" other \"admonishments\" at that time. While fodder for impeachment, Landrau's statements do not involve the sort of direct contradiction that we have held fails to create a \"genuine\" factual dispute for summary judgment purposes. See, e.g., Borowiec v. Local No. 1570, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531871\"><a href=\"/opinion/531871/frederick-borowiec-v-local-no-1570-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking at the totality of the circumstances, we find the evidence in Landrau's affidavit and deposition, while close to the line, to be sufficient to withstand summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We must, of course, consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to Landrau. See Buenrostro v.

This evidence might, if proven, support a race-based harassment claim. See, e.g., Danco, Inc. v.

Chrysler Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763253\"><a href=\"/opinion/763253/gloria-s-carter-v-chrysler-corporation-united-auto-workers-local-110/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 701 (8th Cir. 1999). We note further that there is evidence that Landrau complained about his alleged mistreatment to Banco Popular's management, and that he suffered emotional harm as a result of the harassment. On the present state of the record, we cannot say that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning Landrau's race-based harassment claim. Thus, while we take no view on its ultimate merits, we must vacate the district court's entry of summary judgment on that claim and remand it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. State law claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Landrau asserts that his discrimination claim under Puerto Rico Law 100 should survive summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The district court did not analyze or even mention his Law 100 claim, but simply dismissed Landrau's complaint in its entirety. It seems likely that the district court, having decided that Landrau's Title VII claims should be dismissed, declined to retain jurisdiction over the state law claim. This disposition cannot stand in light of our reversal of the ruling on the Title VII harassment claim. We therefore vacate the district court's dismissal of Landrau's harassment claim under Law 100, and remand it for further consideration not inconsistent with this opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Banco Popular contends that Landrau has waived his Law 100 claim because he failed to argue it below in his opposition to summary judgment. In its brief in support of summary judgment, however, Banco Popular focused exclusively on Landrau's Title VII claims and did not address the Law 100 claim in any manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Landrau could fairly have understood that Banco Popular was moving for summary judgment only on the Title VII claims, and that he was not required to address the merits of the Law 100 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Each party to bear his or its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As to at least two of those positions, Landrau admitted that he was not hired because he lacked the necessary experience and training. He does not contend that he was denied any of these positions due to racial discrimination.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> March 9, 1995, is the date on the Department of Labor discrimination charge form contained in the record, although Landrau's complaint and the district court's opinion state that the charge was filed on February 28, 1995. This discrepancy is not material.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The complaint originally alleged age discrimination as well as race discrimination; the age claim was later dropped.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court appeared to confuse or conflate the different adverse employment actions in applying the burden-shifting analysis. For example, it stated that Landrau established a prima facie case of racial discrimination because Bou was hired instead of him, but pointed to Landrau's failure to adduce evidence of harassment or constructive discharge in concluding that Landrau did not rebut Banco Popular's explanation that Bou was the more qualified applicant. Because the alleged adverse employment actions are factually distinct, we analyze them separately on appeal. See Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728907\"><a href=\"/opinion/728907/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-397-36-fedrserv3d-569-ollie-lattimore-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 463 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although Landrau's opposition to the motion for summary judgment made passing mention of \"continuous\" harassment, he did not explicitly assert a tolling argument in his accompanying brief. To the extent that he discussed a \"pattern\" of treatment, it was in the context of harassment and constructive discharge, not tolling of the limitations period for his discrimination charge. Nor does Landrau argue on appeal that he had timely raised this argument below.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although the district court correctly determined that no rational juror could have believed that Landrau was constructively discharged, it nonetheless held that he passed the prima facie hurdle because he was qualified for Sandn's position. As to Landrau's termination claim, this was a non sequitur. See note <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">4,</span> supra</span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although Landrau sometimes characterizes the harassment as \"retaliatory\" in his briefs, he makes no effort to address the established framework for a Title VII retaliation claim, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762262\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Simas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/762262/victor-e-simas-v-first-citizens-federal-credit-union-and-barbara-mw/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, i.e., he does not explicitly set forth evidence of protected activity or its causal connection to the harassment. Hence, we do not consider a separate retaliation claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Also contained in the summary judgment record below is an excerpt from the deposition of Landrau's psychiatrist, who stated (based on his sessions with Landrau) that Landrau was called a \"good Negro\" by Banco Popular personnel. This evidence is inadmissible hearsay, however, and thus cannot be taken into account for purposes of the summary judgment calculus. See Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750689\"><a href=\"/opinion/750689/waldo-g-vazquez-v-carlos-lopez-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> As with Landrau's Title VII claim, the state law claim appears to encompass discriminatory failure to promote, harassment and constructive discharge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> For the reasons we have set forth regarding the similar federal claims, we affirm the dismissal of Landrau's state-law failure to promote and constructive discharge claims. In all events, we note that Landrau does not argue on appeal that the timeliness of these claims should be analyzed differently under Law 100 than under Title VII.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> This failure, therefore, is distinguishable from Landrau's failure to oppose Banco Popular's statute of limitations argument.
