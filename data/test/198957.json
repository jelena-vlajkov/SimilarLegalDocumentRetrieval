GARCIA-RODRIGUEZ,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n      [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Juan J. Hernandez Lopez De Victoria on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco\nand Camille Vélez-Rivé, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\fMay 19, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam.        The sole ground of this appeal is the\n\nappellant's      contention        that    his   trial    counsel     rendered\n\nineffective assistance and thereby induced him to plead guilty\n\nto a crime that he did not commit.                  We have held, with a\n\nregularity      bordering     on    the     monotonous,    that     claims   of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel ordinarily cannot make their\n\ndebut on direct review of a criminal conviction, but, rather,\n\nmust first be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\n\nSee United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(\"Since    claims     of   ineffective      assistance    involve    a   binary\n\nanalysis    —   the   defendant     must    show,   first,   that    counsel's\n\nperformance was constitutionally deficient and, second, that the\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defense . . . — such claims\n\ntypically require the resolution of factual issues that cannot\n\nefficaciously be addressed in the first instance by an appellate\n\ntribunal.\") (internal citations omitted); see also United States\n\nv. Berríos, 132 F.3d 834, 841 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.\n\nMcGill, 952 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v.\n\nHunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.\n\nCosta, 890 F.2d 480, 482-83 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.\n\nHoyos-Medina, 878 F.2d 21, 22 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.\n\nKobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir. 1983).                      Because the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fappellant's ineffective assistance claim was not raised in the\n\ndistrict court, this rule comes to mind here.\n\n           To be sure, a narrow exception to this rule exists\n\n\"where the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the\n\nrecord is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration\n\nof an ineffective assistance claim.\"              United States v. Natanel,\n\n938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).             Here, however, the record is\n\nvery scantily developed on the key issues, the subsidiary facts\n\nare uncertain, and the parties' briefs are redolent with the\n\nfamiliar    scents     of     speculation       and    surmise.           Thus,    the\n\nappropriate     method      for   pursuing      this     claim       is   through     a\n\ncollateral proceeding in the district court under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2255 (1994 & Supp. 1996).         See United States v. Soldevila-López,\n\n17 F.3d 480, 485 (1st Cir. 1994); Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063; United\n\nStates v. Daniels, 3 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1993); McGill, 952\n\nF.2d at 19 n.5; Hunnewell, 891 F.2d at 956 n.1.\n\n           One circumstance in this case, however, requires us to\n\ntake a special prophylaxis.             Like Mala, 7 F.3d at 1064, this\n\nstrikes us as the rare occasion on which the appointment of\n\ncounsel    is   warranted      for   the      handling    of     a    section     2255\n\nproceeding.      See     18    U.S.C.    §    3006A(a)(2)(B)          (Supp.      2000)\n\n(stipulating that, if \"the interests of justice so require,\n\nrepresentation may be provided [under the Criminal Justice Act]\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\ffor any financially eligible person who . . . is seeking relief\n\nunder section ... 2255 of title 28\").                  We thus direct the\n\ndistrict court, if appellant petitions for section 2255 relief\n\nand demonstrates continued financial eligibility, to appoint\n\ncounsel for him under section 3006A(a)(2)(B).\n\n              We   need    go    no   further.    Since    the       ineffective\n\nassistance issue is not ripe for review, and the appellant\n\nasserts no other grounds for appeal, we dismiss the appeal.\n\nThis ruling is without prejudice to the appellant's right to\n\nraise   his    claim      of    ineffective   assistance   in    a    collateral\n\nproceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.                    The district\n\ncourt shall, subject to the Criminal Justice Act's strictures,\n\nappoint   counsel         for     appellant   should   such     a     proceeding\n\neventuate.\n\n\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f",
