Plaintiff-appellant\n\nCaribe Industrial Systems Inc. (“Caribe”) sued its principal,\n\ndefendant-appellee          National     Starch        and     Chemical     Company\n\n(“National”), under the Puerto Rico Dealer’s Act.                   The district\n\ncourt dismissed Caribe’s complaint for failure to state a claim,\n\nholding    that     National   did    not     violate    the    Dealer’s    Act    by\n\nselling      goods        directly     to      Checkpoint        Systems,      Inc.\n\n(“Checkpoint”), a company with which Caribe had been dealing.\n\nWe affirm the decision below, although on different grounds than\n\nthose stated by the district court.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n            In its complaint, Caribe alleges the following facts:\n\nNational manufactures adhesive products, which are sold through\n\na network of distributors.           Caribe is a Puerto Rican distributor\n\nthat    markets     and    sells   industrial     packaging       machinery       and\n\nmaterials, including adhesive products.\n\n            On August 1, 1983, Caribe and National entered into a\n\nwritten      Distributor       Agreement       (“the     Agreement”),       wherein\n\nNational    agreed     to   supply     and    Caribe    agreed    to   distribute\n\ncertain adhesive products in a designated territory.                         Caribe\n\nagreed to be a “non-exclusive” distributor of National’s product\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fline in Puerto Rico.        The Agreement provided in Article 2 that\n\n“Distributor’s territory shall be non-exclusive territory.”2 The\n\nAgreement    further      provided,     in    Article   7,    that   “National\n\nreserves    the   right    to   sell    the    Products      directly   to   its\n\ncustomers.”       Notwithstanding the non-exclusivity provisions,\n\nCaribe was the sole distributor of National’s products in Puerto\n\nRico for approximately fourteen years.\n\n            Beginning in 1993, Caribe sold National’s “hot melt”\n\nadhesive products to Checkpoint.              Caribe obtained Checkpoint’s\n\nbusiness through its promotional and marketing efforts, and its\n\nsales to Checkpoint represented approximately sixty percent of\n\nCaribe’s total sales of adhesives.            In December 1996, Checkpoint\n\nand Caribe executed an open-ended purchase order that terminated\n\nin December 1997.\n\n            In or around March of 1997, Checkpoint informed Caribe\n\nthat it intended to locally manufacture the hot melt adhesives\n\nthat it had been purchasing from Caribe.                Caribe attempted to\n\ndissuade Checkpoint from doing so.            On or around March 26, 1997,\n\n\n    2The Agreement was attached as an exhibit to Caribe’s\ncomplaint in this action, and so we consider it incorporated by\nreference. Although the parties mention other documents beyond\nthe complaint and Agreement, the district court apparently did\nnot consider any such materials, and nor will we. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b); 5A Charles Alan Wright and Arthur R. Miller,\nFederal  Practice   and  Procedure   §   1366  (2d   ed.  1990)\n(consideration of matters outside pleadings converts Rule\n12(b)(6) motion into summary judgment motion).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCaribe met with Checkpoint to “discuss the situation and to\n\nattempt    to     discourage       [Checkpoint]             from      manufacturing           the\n\nproducts.”        Checkpoint       stated     at    this         meeting        that    it    had\n\nalready ordered equipment to manufacture the adhesives.                                  Hence,\n\nCaribe and Checkpoint were unable to reach agreement.\n\n            Caribe        notified       National           of   Checkpoint’s           plans.\n\nNational    initially       expressed       skepticism             as   to      Checkpoint’s\n\nability to manufacture its own adhesives.                          Together, Caribe and\n\nNational “attempted to seek economically viable alternatives\n\nthat     would     convince        Checkpoint           not      to     engage         in     the\n\nmanufacturing of hot melt adhesives. . .”                           In or around April\n\n1997, National told Caribe that in response to Checkpoint’s\n\nactions, it wished to lower its prices.                            Caribe responded by\n\noffering    to    reduce     its     profits       to       make    its      products        more\n\neconomically       attractive       to     Checkpoint,           and    to      exclude      the\n\nCheckpoint account from the distributorship arrangement. Caribe\n\ndrafted and sent a “Memorandum of Understanding” to National\n\nsetting    forth    these     proposals.           National           rejected         Caribe’s\n\nproposals,       asking    Caribe     to    take        a    larger       cut    in     profits\n\ninstead.     Caribe refused to do so.\n\n            National and Checkpoint met in May, 1997, to discuss\n\nCheckpoint’s announcement that it would be making adhesives in-\n\nhouse.    At this time, National became convinced that Checkpoint\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\findeed had the capacity to manufacture its own adhesives.                    On\n\nJune 26, 1997, National told Caribe that it had met privately\n\nwith Checkpoint earlier that month.               At that meeting, National\n\nand Checkpoint had agreed that instead of manufacturing the\n\nadhesives     itself,      Checkpoint     would   buy   them   directly    from\n\nNational, omitting Caribe from the distribution chain.\n\n             In June, 1997, Checkpoint told Caribe that effective\n\nJune   30,   1997,    it    would   be   buying   materials    directly    from\n\nNational without an intermediary.              Checkpoint agreed, however,\n\nto honor a ninety-day cancellation clause in the open-ended\n\npurchase order.           On July 25, 1997, Checkpoint sent another\n\nletter “officially” terminating the purchase order.               Checkpoint\n\nbought hot melt adhesives directly from National beginning in\n\nSeptember or October, 1997.\n\n             On September 29, 1997, Caribe filed a complaint in the\n\nfederal district court for the District of Puerto Rico against\n\nNational, seeking damages and provisional relief pursuant to the\n\nPuerto Rico Dealer's Act of June 24, 1964 (\"Law 75\"), P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 10, § 278 et seq.               Caribe contended that National\n\nviolated     Law     75    by   performing     acts     detrimental   to    the\n\nestablished relationship between the parties by setting up its\n\nown distribution system directly with Checkpoint.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f            On October 29, 1997, National filed a motion to dismiss\n\nfor failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).        National contended that it did nothing wrong by\n\nentering     a     direct     relationship          with     Checkpoint,            because\n\nCheckpoint had already terminated its customer relationship with\n\nCaribe and the Agreement was non-exclusive.                     Caribe opposed the\n\nmotion to dismiss and amended its complaint to add a cause of\n\naction      for     tortious       interference            with      a        contractual\n\nrelationship.\n\n            On     February      23,   1999,      the   district         court      allowed\n\nNational’s        motion    to   dismiss,         although     based         on    somewhat\n\ndifferent reasoning than that advanced by National.                               See Caribe\n\nIndus. Sys., Inc. v. National Starch & Chem. Co., 36 F. Supp. 2d\n\n448 (D.P.R. 1999).            It characterized the issue before it as\n\n“whether a non-exclusive distribution agreement under Law 75,\n\nalthough flexible to allow multiple distributors, nevertheless\n\nforbids the principal from supplying its products directly to\n\nthe customers of its own distributors.”                            Id. at 450.            It\n\nconcluded that no cause of action lies under Law 75 where a\n\nprincipal    sells     directly        to   a     customer    of    a       non-exclusive\n\ndealer.     The district court also held that Caribe did not state\n\na   claim    for      tortious         interference          with       a    contractual\n\nrelationship.        Caribe appeals.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fII          DISCUSSION\n\n            We apply “a de novo standard of review to a district\n\ncourt's allowance of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim.”      New   England    Cleaning   Servs.,   Inc.   v.   American\n\nArbitration Ass'n, 199 F.3d 542, 544 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation\n\nomitted).    Caribe contends that the district court incorrectly\n\napplied Rule 12(b)(6) in that it failed to take as true the\n\nallegation that Checkpoint was Caribe’s customer, not National’s\n\ncustomer.    In Caribe’s view, this distinction made it improper\n\nfor National to sell directly to Checkpoint, notwithstanding the\n\nAgreement’s non-exclusivity. Caribe contends that the provision\n\nin Article 7 stating that “National reserves the right to sell\n\nthe Products directly to       its customers” (emphasis supplied)\n\nshould be read as limiting National’s sales to those who are not\n\nthe customers of its distributors.       In support of that argument,\n\nCaribe suggests that Checkpoint remained its customer even after\n\nCheckpoint announced its intention to discontinue purchasing\n\nproduct from Caribe.         Caribe further argues that the court\n\nmisapplied controlling case law in concluding that National did\n\nnot perform any acts detrimental to the established relationship\n\nbetween the parties.\n\n            Puerto Rico's Law 75 governs the business relationship\n\nbetween principals and the locally appointed distributors who\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fmarket their products.            See Irvine v. Murad Skin Research Labs.,\n\nInc., 194 F.3d 313, 317-18 (1st Cir. 1999).                            In order to avoid\n\nthe        inequity     of     arbitrary       termination             of    distribution\n\nrelationships once the distributor has developed a local market\n\nfor the principal's products or services, Law 75 limits the\n\nprincipal's ability to unilaterally end the relationship except\n\nfor \"just cause.\"            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 278a.                  In 1966, the\n\nprotection afforded to distributors under Law 75 was extended to\n\ninclude       the     conduct    of    a    principal        “detrimental          to     the\n\nestablished         relationship,”         even    where     the       contract    was    not\n\nterminated.         See id.; see also Irvine, 194 F.3d at 317-18.\n\n               In   the      present   case,       National        did      not   terminate\n\nCaribe’s status as a distributor of its products.                                 The sole\n\nissue is whether National engaged in conduct detrimental to the\n\ndistribution relationship.             See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 278a.3\n\n“The       question    whether    there      has    been     a    ‘detriment’       to    the\n\nexisting       relationship       between         supplier       and     dealer    is    just\n\nanother way of asking whether the terms of the contract existing\n\nbetween the parties have been impaired.”                     Vulcan Tools of Puerto\n\nRico v. Makita U.S.A., Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 569 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n       3\n     Section 278a provides: “Notwithstanding the existence in a\ndealer’s contract of a clause reserving to the parties the\nunilateral right to terminate the existing relationship, no\nprincipal or grantor may directly or indirectly perform any act\ndetrimental to the established relationship . . .”\n\n                                            -8-\n\fHence, the parameters of Caribe’s Law 75 rights, as the district\n\ncourt   correctly      noted,        are     established    by    the     terms     of\n\nAgreement. “[T]he ‘established relationship’ between dealer and\n\nprincipal    is    bounded      by     the       distribution    agreement,        and\n\ntherefore    the    Act    only        protects        against   detriments         to\n\ncontractually acquired rights.”                  Id. (citation omitted).\n\n            The district court framed Caribe’s legal argument as\n\nfollows:\n\n            (1)   Even  if   Caribe   has   a   non-exclusive\n            distributorship agreement with National, National\n            cannot sell directly to Caribe's clients. (2)\n            Checkpoint would have never ceased purchasing\n            adhesives from Caribe had National never offered\n            them directly to Checkpoint. (3) National's\n            appropriation of Caribe's clientele violates\n            Puerto Rico's Law 75.\n\nCaribe Indus. Sys., Inc., 36 F. Supp. 2d at 450.                  The court went\n\non to state, “Since the second step of the progression is\n\ninherently a question of fact, for purposes of resolving this\n\nmotion to dismiss it shall be assumed that had it not been for\n\nNational's    direct      selling          efforts,    Checkpoint       would     have\n\nremained as Caribe's customer.”                  Id.   The district court then\n\nconcluded that Caribe had no cause of action for impairment\n\nunder Law 75 because the Agreement established a non-exclusive\n\ndistribution arrangement and permitted National to sell directly\n\nto its customers.      Id. at 450-51.\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f            We disagree that the facts set forth in the complaint\n\nsupport an inference that Checkpoint would never have stopped\n\npurchasing adhesives from Caribe had National not made direct\n\nselling efforts.       What is plain from the pleaded facts is that\n\nCheckpoint had made clear that it would no longer purchase\n\nadhesives     from    Caribe      --   i.e.,    that     Checkpoint      effectively\n\nannounced its plans to end its existing customer relationship\n\nwith Caribe -- before it entered a new arrangement to purchase\n\nproducts directly from National.\n\n            According        to    the     allegations      in    the     complaint,\n\nCheckpoint     informed        Caribe      that    it     intended       to   locally\n\nmanufacture its own hot melt adhesives in March of 1997.                         This\n\nassertion was further supported at a meeting on March 26, 1997,\n\nwhen   Checkpoint      told       Caribe    that    it    had     already     ordered\n\nequipment to manufacture the adhesives.                     Caribe’s efforts at\n\nthat meeting to dissuade Checkpoint failed.                     Thus, it was clear\n\nat this point that unless Checkpoint somehow could be persuaded\n\nto reconsider its new, in-house plans, Caribe’s status as a\n\ndealer supplying Checkpoint with National’s product was at an\n\nend.   Caribe obviously recognized this; otherwise, there would\n\nhave   been   no     need,    in   Caribe’s       own    words,    for    Caribe   to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f“attempt[] to convince Checkpoint . . . to continue to buy\n\nproduct from them.”4\n\n           National did not enter into its own arrangement with\n\nCheckpoint until May or June of 1997.        National’s arrangement\n\noccurred some months after Checkpoint had informed Caribe that\n\nit had already purchased manufacturing equipment, thus making it\n\nplain that it would no longer need to buy hot melt adhesives\n\nfrom Caribe.    There are no facts pleaded in the complaint to\n\nsuggest that National initiated action to steal Checkpoint’s\n\nongoing business away from Caribe.\n\n           Caribe argues that we should infer that Checkpoint\n\nwould not have ended its customer relationship with Caribe had\n\nNational not “persuaded” Checkpoint to enter into a direct\n\nrelationship.   This, however, cannot be reasonably inferred from\n\nCaribe’s    pleaded    facts.          See    Correa-Martinez      v.\n\nArrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 58 (1st Cir. 1990) (no need to\n\nstrain against plausibility in construing complaint).           Those\n\nfacts indicate that Checkpoint had already communicated that it\n\nwould no longer proceed with its relationship with Caribe.         It\n\n\n     4Caribe argues that National also was involved in efforts to\nconvince Checkpoint not to manufacture its own adhesives and\ncontinue purchasing National products from Caribe. It is true\nthat Caribe pleaded these facts in its complaint, but we fail to\nsee how these facts contravene a conclusion that Checkpoint had\nalready made clear that it would be discontinuing its existing\npurchasing arrangement with Caribe.\n\n                                -11-\n\fis entirely conjectural that, had National stayed out of the\n\npicture, Caribe eventually could have negotiated terms with\n\nCheckpoint      sufficiently     attractive         for    Checkpoint   to   have\n\nabandoned its stated plans to manufacture its own adhesives.\n\nThus, while we take as true that Checkpoint once had been\n\nCaribe’s customer, we must conclude that Checkpoint effectively\n\nceased to be its customer after Checkpoint announced its in-\n\nhouse manufacturing plans.\n\n            In these circumstances, we see no provision in the\n\nAgreement that prohibited National’s direct sales to Checkpoint.\n\nThe only potentially relevant provision is Article 7, which\n\npermits    National     to   sell    to    “its    customers.”       Under   this\n\nlanguage, it might be argued (whether or not correctly, we need\n\nnot   decide)    that   a    company      that    was   purchasing   National’s\n\nmaterials from a distributor could not be also a “customer” of\n\nNational     (viz.    because       it    was    already    the   distributor’s\n\ncustomer).      Under that theory, the Agreement arguably might be\n\nambiguous as to whether it prevented National from dealing\n\ndirectly with Checkpoint while the latter remained Caribe’s\n\ncustomer.\n\n            But here, as noted, the complaint makes it abundantly\n\nplain that Checkpoint had already effectively ended its existing\n\ncustomer relationship with Caribe.                Hence, nothing in the terms\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fof   the        Agreement      prohibited     National      from       entering     a    new\n\narrangement             with   Checkpoint.         Under    these        circumstances,\n\nNational’s          actions     cannot   be       found    to    have     violated      the\n\nAgreement so as to impair Caribe’s relationship with Checkpoint.5\n\nSee Caribbean Wholesales & Serv. Corp. v. U.S. JVC Corp., 963 F.\n\nSupp.           1342,     1351-52    (S.D.N.Y.        1997)           (where   customer\n\nindependently             decided   to    stop      purchasing           products       from\n\ndistributor, principal did not cause detriment within meaning of\n\nLaw 75).\n\n                 Since there has been no impairment of the terms of the\n\ncontract, there is no Law 75 liability.

Caribe’s argument boils down to saying that its\nprior customer relationship with Checkpoint gave it some sort of\nright, notwithstanding the Agreement’s non-exclusivity, to act\nexclusively for National in seeking to recapture Checkpoint’s\nbusiness.   Under this approach, if Caribe were not able to\npersuade Checkpoint to purchase National’s product through it,\nthen National would have no recourse but to accept the loss of\nCheckpoint’s business.    We see nothing in the terms of the\nAgreement that imposes such an extreme restriction on National’s\nright to sell directly. Cf. Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d at 569. We\ncannot read the “its customers” language as implying such a\nsweeping barrier given the language’s lack of explicitness and\nthe non-exclusivity provisions elsewhere in the Agreement.\n       6\n     Initially, Caribe made the additional argument that it was\nentitled to a presumption of impairment under Section 278a-1(b)\n\n                                          -13-\n\fand do not now decide, the broader question addressed by the\n\ndistrict court, i.e. whether National could have sold goods\n\ndirectly to Checkpoint at a time when Checkpoint was Caribe’s\n\nongoing customer.\n\n           Finally, Caribe does not argue on appeal that the\n\ndistrict   court   erred   in   dismissing   its   claim   of   tortious\n\ninterference with a contractual relationship.         Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the dismissal of that claim as well.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nof Law 75 by alleging that National engaged in private meetings\nwith Checkpoint that resulted in a direct selling arrangement.\nNational pointed out that the 1988 amendments to Law 75 that\nestablished the relevant presumption do not apply to preexisting\ncontracts such as the one between it and Caribe.          Caribe\nconcedes this point in its reply brief, and we need not deal\nwith it further.\n\n                                  -14-\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n            In its complaint, Caribe alleges the following facts:\n\nNational manufactures adhesive products, which are sold through\n\na network of distributors.           Caribe is a Puerto Rican distributor\n\nthat    markets     and    sells   industrial     packaging       machinery       and\n\nmaterials, including adhesive products.\n\n            On August 1, 1983, Caribe and National entered into a\n\nwritten      Distributor       Agreement       (“the     Agreement”),       wherein\n\nNational    agreed     to   supply     and    Caribe    agreed    to   distribute\n\ncertain adhesive products in a designated territory.                         Caribe\n\nagreed to be a “non-exclusive” distributor of National’s product\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fline in Puerto Rico.        The Agreement provided in Article 2 that\n\n“Distributor’s territory shall be non-exclusive territory.”2 The\n\nAgreement    further      provided,     in    Article   7,    that   “National\n\nreserves    the   right    to   sell    the    Products      directly   to   its\n\ncustomers.”       Notwithstanding the non-exclusivity provisions,\n\nCaribe was the sole distributor of National’s products in Puerto\n\nRico for approximately fourteen years.\n\n            Beginning in 1993, Caribe sold National’s “hot melt”\n\nadhesive products to Checkpoint.              Caribe obtained Checkpoint’s\n\nbusiness through its promotional and marketing efforts, and its\n\nsales to Checkpoint represented approximately sixty percent of\n\nCaribe’s total sales of adhesives.            In December 1996, Checkpoint\n\nand Caribe executed an open-ended purchase order that terminated\n\nin December 1997.\n\n            In or around March of 1997, Checkpoint informed Caribe\n\nthat it intended to locally manufacture the hot melt adhesives\n\nthat it had been purchasing from Caribe.                Caribe attempted to\n\ndissuade Checkpoint from doing so.            On or around March 26, 1997,\n\n\n    2The Agreement was attached as an exhibit to Caribe’s\ncomplaint in this action, and so we consider it incorporated by\nreference. Although the parties mention other documents beyond\nthe complaint and Agreement, the district court apparently did\nnot consider any such materials, and nor will we. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b); 5A Charles Alan Wright and Arthur R. Miller,\nFederal  Practice   and  Procedure   §   1366  (2d   ed.  1990)\n(consideration of matters outside pleadings converts Rule\n12(b)(6) motion into summary judgment motion).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCaribe met with Checkpoint to “discuss the situation and to\n\nattempt    to     discourage       [Checkpoint]             from      manufacturing           the\n\nproducts.”        Checkpoint       stated     at    this         meeting        that    it    had\n\nalready ordered equipment to manufacture the adhesives.                                  Hence,\n\nCaribe and Checkpoint were unable to reach agreement.\n\n            Caribe        notified       National           of   Checkpoint’s           plans.\n\nNational    initially       expressed       skepticism             as   to      Checkpoint’s\n\nability to manufacture its own adhesives.                          Together, Caribe and\n\nNational “attempted to seek economically viable alternatives\n\nthat     would     convince        Checkpoint           not      to     engage         in     the\n\nmanufacturing of hot melt adhesives. . .”                           In or around April\n\n1997, National told Caribe that in response to Checkpoint’s\n\nactions, it wished to lower its prices.                            Caribe responded by\n\noffering    to    reduce     its     profits       to       make    its      products        more\n\neconomically       attractive       to     Checkpoint,           and    to      exclude      the\n\nCheckpoint account from the distributorship arrangement. Caribe\n\ndrafted and sent a “Memorandum of Understanding” to National\n\nsetting    forth    these     proposals.           National           rejected         Caribe’s\n\nproposals,       asking    Caribe     to    take        a    larger       cut    in     profits\n\ninstead.     Caribe refused to do so.\n\n            National and Checkpoint met in May, 1997, to discuss\n\nCheckpoint’s announcement that it would be making adhesives in-\n\nhouse.    At this time, National became convinced that Checkpoint\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\findeed had the capacity to manufacture its own adhesives.                    On\n\nJune 26, 1997, National told Caribe that it had met privately\n\nwith Checkpoint earlier that month.               At that meeting, National\n\nand Checkpoint had agreed that instead of manufacturing the\n\nadhesives     itself,      Checkpoint     would   buy   them   directly    from\n\nNational, omitting Caribe from the distribution chain.\n\n             In June, 1997, Checkpoint told Caribe that effective\n\nJune   30,   1997,    it    would   be   buying   materials    directly    from\n\nNational without an intermediary.              Checkpoint agreed, however,\n\nto honor a ninety-day cancellation clause in the open-ended\n\npurchase order.           On July 25, 1997, Checkpoint sent another\n\nletter “officially” terminating the purchase order.               Checkpoint\n\nbought hot melt adhesives directly from National beginning in\n\nSeptember or October, 1997.\n\n             On September 29, 1997, Caribe filed a complaint in the\n\nfederal district court for the District of Puerto Rico against\n\nNational, seeking damages and provisional relief pursuant to the\n\nPuerto Rico Dealer's Act of June 24, 1964 (\"Law 75\"), P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 10, § 278 et seq.               Caribe contended that National\n\nviolated     Law     75    by   performing     acts     detrimental   to    the\n\nestablished relationship between the parties by setting up its\n\nown distribution system directly with Checkpoint.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f            On October 29, 1997, National filed a motion to dismiss\n\nfor failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).        National contended that it did nothing wrong by\n\nentering     a     direct     relationship          with     Checkpoint,            because\n\nCheckpoint had already terminated its customer relationship with\n\nCaribe and the Agreement was non-exclusive.                     Caribe opposed the\n\nmotion to dismiss and amended its complaint to add a cause of\n\naction      for     tortious       interference            with      a        contractual\n\nrelationship.\n\n            On     February      23,   1999,      the   district         court      allowed\n\nNational’s        motion    to   dismiss,         although     based         on    somewhat\n\ndifferent reasoning than that advanced by National.

Caribe contends that the district court incorrectly\n\napplied Rule 12(b)(6) in that it failed to take as true the\n\nallegation that Checkpoint was Caribe’s customer, not National’s\n\ncustomer.    In Caribe’s view, this distinction made it improper\n\nfor National to sell directly to Checkpoint, notwithstanding the\n\nAgreement’s non-exclusivity. Caribe contends that the provision\n\nin Article 7 stating that “National reserves the right to sell\n\nthe Products directly to       its customers” (emphasis supplied)\n\nshould be read as limiting National’s sales to those who are not\n\nthe customers of its distributors.       In support of that argument,\n\nCaribe suggests that Checkpoint remained its customer even after\n\nCheckpoint announced its intention to discontinue purchasing\n\nproduct from Caribe.         Caribe further argues that the court\n\nmisapplied controlling case law in concluding that National did\n\nnot perform any acts detrimental to the established relationship\n\nbetween the parties.\n\n            Puerto Rico's Law 75 governs the business relationship\n\nbetween principals and the locally appointed distributors who\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fmarket their products.

What is plain from the pleaded facts is that\n\nCheckpoint had made clear that it would no longer purchase\n\nadhesives     from    Caribe      --   i.e.,    that     Checkpoint      effectively\n\nannounced its plans to end its existing customer relationship\n\nwith Caribe -- before it entered a new arrangement to purchase\n\nproducts directly from National.\n\n            According        to    the     allegations      in    the     complaint,\n\nCheckpoint     informed        Caribe      that    it     intended       to   locally\n\nmanufacture its own hot melt adhesives in March of 1997.                         This\n\nassertion was further supported at a meeting on March 26, 1997,\n\nwhen   Checkpoint      told       Caribe    that    it    had     already     ordered\n\nequipment to manufacture the adhesives.                     Caribe’s efforts at\n\nthat meeting to dissuade Checkpoint failed.                     Thus, it was clear\n\nat this point that unless Checkpoint somehow could be persuaded\n\nto reconsider its new, in-house plans, Caribe’s status as a\n\ndealer supplying Checkpoint with National’s product was at an\n\nend.   Caribe obviously recognized this; otherwise, there would\n\nhave   been   no     need,    in   Caribe’s       own    words,    for    Caribe   to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f“attempt[] to convince Checkpoint . . . to continue to buy\n\nproduct from them.”4\n\n           National did not enter into its own arrangement with\n\nCheckpoint until May or June of 1997.        National’s arrangement\n\noccurred some months after Checkpoint had informed Caribe that\n\nit had already purchased manufacturing equipment, thus making it\n\nplain that it would no longer need to buy hot melt adhesives\n\nfrom Caribe.    There are no facts pleaded in the complaint to\n\nsuggest that National initiated action to steal Checkpoint’s\n\nongoing business away from Caribe.\n\n           Caribe argues that we should infer that Checkpoint\n\nwould not have ended its customer relationship with Caribe had\n\nNational not “persuaded” Checkpoint to enter into a direct\n\nrelationship.   This, however, cannot be reasonably inferred from\n\nCaribe’s    pleaded    facts.          See    Correa-Martinez      v.\n\nArrillaga-Belendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1st Cir. 1990) (no need to\n\nstrain against plausibility in construing complaint).           Those\n\nfacts indicate that Checkpoint had already communicated that it\n\nwould no longer proceed with its relationship with Caribe.         It\n\n\n     4Caribe argues that National also was involved in efforts to\nconvince Checkpoint not to manufacture its own adhesives and\ncontinue purchasing National products from Caribe. It is true\nthat Caribe pleaded these facts in its complaint, but we fail to\nsee how these facts contravene a conclusion that Checkpoint had\nalready made clear that it would be discontinuing its existing\npurchasing arrangement with Caribe.\n\n                                -11-\n\fis entirely conjectural that, had National stayed out of the\n\npicture, Caribe eventually could have negotiated terms with\n\nCheckpoint      sufficiently     attractive         for    Checkpoint   to   have\n\nabandoned its stated plans to manufacture its own adhesives.\n\nThus, while we take as true that Checkpoint once had been\n\nCaribe’s customer, we must conclude that Checkpoint effectively\n\nceased to be its customer after Checkpoint announced its in-\n\nhouse manufacturing plans.\n\n            In these circumstances, we see no provision in the\n\nAgreement that prohibited National’s direct sales to Checkpoint.\n\nThe only potentially relevant provision is Article 7, which\n\npermits    National     to   sell    to    “its    customers.”       Under   this\n\nlanguage, it might be argued (whether or not correctly, we need\n\nnot   decide)    that   a    company      that    was   purchasing   National’s\n\nmaterials from a distributor could not be also a “customer” of\n\nNational     (viz.    because       it    was    already    the   distributor’s\n\ncustomer).      Under that theory, the Agreement arguably might be\n\nambiguous as to whether it prevented National from dealing\n\ndirectly with Checkpoint while the latter remained Caribe’s\n\ncustomer.\n\n            But here, as noted, the complaint makes it abundantly\n\nplain that Checkpoint had already effectively ended its existing\n\ncustomer relationship with Caribe.                Hence, nothing in the terms\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fof   the        Agreement      prohibited     National      from       entering     a    new\n\narrangement             with   Checkpoint.         Under    these        circumstances,\n\nNational’s          actions     cannot   be       found    to    have     violated      the\n\nAgreement so as to impair Caribe’s relationship with Checkpoint.5\n\nSee Caribbean Wholesales & Serv.
