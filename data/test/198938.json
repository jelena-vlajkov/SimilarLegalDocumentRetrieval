The panel\nopinion holds that the statute neither prohibits the Provider\nReimbursement Review Board from taking jurisdiction, nor requires it\nto do so. In its petition, the government asserts that \"[p]ermitting\nproviders to entirely bypass the intermediary's expertise in favor of\ninitial PRRB consideration of cost claims will have potentially\ndisastrous consequences for Medicare's carefully-constructed system\nof review of such claims.\" (Pet. at 13.) That is not so. As the panel\nopinion states, the Board may, in its discretion, take steps to\nprevent providers from bypassing intermediaries. The Board need not\nreview on a case-by-case basis claims not presented to\nintermediaries; it can adopt an across-the-board policy of refusing\nto hear such claims. \"In light of the statutory scheme here, a rule\nof consistently refusing to hear inadvertently omitted claims would\nbe rational. . . .\" MaineGeneral Med. Ctr. v. Shalala, 205 F.3d 493,\n501 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                      --Dissent Follows–\n\f     CYR, Senior Circuit Judge (dissenting). For the reasons stated\nin my dissent, I believe the panel majority disregards the central\nreality that the ultimate ratio decidendi in this case is whether the\nmethod chosen by the Secretary to deter the types of appeals here\ninvolved rests on a rational interpretation of the medicare statute,\nper Chevron. It is not the function of the courts to suggest that the\nSecretary must consider other rational means for accomplishing the\nsame end. I therefore respectfully dissent from the denial of the\ngovernment's petition for panel rehearing.\n\n                                      By the Court:\n\n                                      Phoebe D.
