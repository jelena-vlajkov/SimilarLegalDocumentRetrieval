Rodway, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\r\n   F. Mark Terison, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nOctober 19, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Laurier Doyon was tried by a jury\r\nof attempting to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, 21\r\nU.S.C.  841, 846, and convicted of the offense.  Because he had\r\ntwo prior drug felonies, he was sentenced as a career offender to\r\n262 months in prison and now appeals.  One of his claims is that\r\nthe evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, so we set\r\nforth the facts in the light most favorable to the government. \r\nUnited States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1234 (1st Cir. 1994), cert.\r\ndenied, 513 U.S. 1179 (1995).  The evidence at trial permitted the\r\njury to find that the following had occurred.\r\nIn late August or early September 1997, one Eduardo\r\nEscobar-Reyes shared an apartment in Portland, Maine, with a drug\r\ndealer named Johnny and became involved in Johnny's drug\r\noperations.  They sold powder cocaine which they obtained from a\r\nsource in New York.  In late October 1997, Doyon helped Escobar and\r\nJohnny move to a hotel.  Shortly thereafter, at another location,\r\nEscobar sold three ounces of cocaine to Doyon for approximately \r\n$3,300; the drug was \"fronted\" to Doyon, meaning that he paid an\r\nextra amount per ounce but did not have to pay Escobar up front, a\r\npractice that is common in deals between drug traffickers.\r\nThereafter, Escobar left for New York, where he and\r\nJohnny purchased five ounces of cocaine; Escobar returned to\r\nPortland on November 4, 1997.  At some point thereafter, Doyon\r\ncalled Escobar at the hotel and said that he had the money he owed\r\nEscobar from the prior deal and wanted to meet him.  (Doyon knew\r\nabout the New York buying trip because he had driven Johnny part of\r\nthe way there.)  Doyon also indicated an interest in a possible\r\nfurther purchase, but Escobar--who was planning to sell his new\r\ninventory to another of his customers (one Harry Brady)--told Doyon\r\nthat he did not have any drugs to supply.  Escobar and Doyon agreed\r\nto meet later.  This call was not recorded, but Escobar testified\r\nto it at trial.\r\nOn November 6, 1997, Escobar met with Brady to transfer\r\nthe cocaine, but Brady was in fact an undercover government agent\r\nand Escobar was arrested.  Escobar then agreed to cooperate and,\r\nwhile giving a statement, received a pager signal from Doyon and\r\nreturned Doyon's call in the presence of government agents.  That\r\ncall, and a second occurring soon thereafter, were recorded by the\r\nagents using a tape recording device.  The tapes and transcripts\r\nwere offered at trial together with agent testimony that the tapes\r\naccurately reflected what they had heard Escobar say.\r\nIn the first conversation Escobar indicated that Doyon\r\ncould not buy any more drugs until he paid off his earlier debt, to\r\nwhich Doyon replied: \"I have the money Eduardo.\"  Later in the\r\nconversation, Escobar stated: \"How, how much you, you want?\"  Doyon\r\nreplied: \"What do you mean?  I want four ounces, at least dude.  I\r\nwant ten.\"  Doyon asked to have Johnny call him and concluded that\r\nhe and Escobar would meet that night.\r\nAt 12:30 p.m., about half an hour after the first call, \r\nEscobar (acting under the government's supervision) paged Doyon and\r\na second telephone conversation ensued.  In the second\r\nconversation, Doyon and Escobar agreed to meet at the hotel at\r\naround 5 p.m. Escobar asked Doyon whether he had \"all the money\";\r\nand Doyon replied: \"Of course.\"  Doyon agreed that they would meet\r\nat 5 p.m. and persisted in asking Escobar to have Johnny page\r\nDoyon.  \r\nUnder police surveillance, Doyon arrived at the hotel\r\nshortly before 6 p.m., entered Escobar's room briefly and then\r\n(after not finding Escobar) returned to his truck and started to\r\ndrive away.  When police cars turned on their lights and sirens,\r\nDoyon raced away, hitting one vehicle and just missing another, and\r\nwas caught when he stopped about a quarter mile away.  Agents\r\nretrieved large amounts of cash from Doyon's pocket and wallet, but\r\nevidence of the exact amount was not provided at trial.\r\nPrior to trial, Doyon had sought unsuccessfully to\r\nsuppress the tape recordings.  Following the government's\r\npresentation of its case, Doyon asked for a directed judgment of\r\nacquittal for lack of sufficient evidence.  The district court,\r\nalthough regarding the issue as a close one, denied the motion and\r\nthe case was submitted to the jury.  After several hours of\r\ndeliberation, the jury convicted Doyon of attempting to possess\r\ncocaine with intent to distribute.\r\nAt sentencing, the district court attributed to Doyon the \r\nfour ounces of cocaine that the court thought Doyon had attempted\r\nto buy and, as related conduct, the three ounces he had purchased\r\nin late October.  This would ordinarily have produced an offense\r\nlevel of 18, which the district court adjusted upward for Doyon's\r\npossession of a weapon and for endangerment of others caused by\r\nDoyon's flight.  In addition, based on two prior drug felony\r\nconvictions in state court, the district court determined that\r\nDoyon was a career offender, U.S.S.G.  4B1.1, and, after declining\r\nto depart, imposed the minimum sentence of 262 months.\r\nThe law of attempt is reasonably clear in the center but\r\nquite fuzzy around the edges; different formulations have been used\r\nto cope with a range of problems, such as degree of involvement,\r\nimpossibility and withdrawal.  See Model Penal Code  5.01 cmt.\r\n(1985).  In this circuit, as in a number of others, the court has\r\ntaken the Model Penal Code as its guide.  See United States v.\r\nDworken, 855 F.2d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1988).  Under the Code\r\ndefinition, set forth in section 5.01 (reprinted as an appendix to\r\nthis opinion), we have viewed the two key elements of the offense\r\nof attempt as (1) an \"intent\" to commit the substantive offense and\r\n(2) a \"substantial step towards [its] commission.\"  See United\r\nStates v. Rivera-Sola, 713 F.2d 866, 869 (1st Cir. 1983).\r\nIn this case, Doyon's \"intent\" to acquire cocaine is\r\ndifficult to dispute (and Doyon does not now challenge the\r\ninference that he intended to distribute what he got).  Doyon had\r\nsaid at the outset that he wanted to acquire four to ten ounces; he\r\nhad acquired three ounces from the same source on a prior occasion;\r\nand his alacrity in pressing to pay off a prior drug debt supported\r\nthe inference that he had further interest in acquiring more\r\ninventory and reasonably soon.\r\nOn appeal, Doyon's attack on the evidence rests on the\r\npremise that Doyon could not have intended to accept the new\r\ndelivery at the same time that he paid off his old debt (because\r\nEscobar had said earlier that he did not have any drugs) and that\r\nthe payment of an old debt as a first step in securing a later\r\ndelivery is not the \"substantial step\" toward possession required\r\nto make out an attempt.  The case law, says Doyon, usually involves\r\nconduct by defendant that brings him somewhat closer to final\r\ncommission of the object crime.  E.g., United States v. Fisher, 3\r\nF.3d 456, 462 n.18 (1st Cir. 1993) (planning deal, accepting\r\nsample, arriving at scene of planned deal).\r\nIt is a close question whether the evidence taken as a\r\nwhole would permit the jury to conclude that Doyon expected to buy\r\ncocaine at the same time that he paid off his old debt.  Based on\r\nevidence not presented to the jury, it appears that Doyon may well\r\nhave expected to make an immediate purchase; but, of course, our\r\nconcern is solely with what the jury could reasonably have found on\r\nthe evidence before it.  Escobar's statement that he had no drugs\r\noccurred before Doyon came to the hotel, yet it might well be a\r\nstretch to suppose that the jury could find beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that Doyon expected to make a purchase on November 6.\r\nThe point need not be pursued.  In considering the motion\r\nto acquit, the district judge rejected the notion that the jury\r\ncould find that Doyon had an intent to make a simultaneous\r\npurchase, and in closing arguments both lawyers invited the jury to\r\nfocus on a different question, namely, whether in context Doyon's\r\neffort to pay off his drug debt could be regarded as a substantial\r\nstep toward a purchase in the near future and might therefore\r\nconstitute a substantial step toward possession with intent to\r\ndistribute.  We consider the issue in the same light and, while\r\nagreeing that this could be regarded as a close case, uphold the\r\nrefusal to direct a verdict.\r\nThe evidence already mentioned was ample for the jury to\r\nfind beyond a reasonable doubt that Doyon intended to make a\r\npurchase of cocaine from Escobar or Johnny in the near future and\r\nthat Doyon's effort to pay his prior drug debt was intended by him\r\nto remove an express obstacle to this purchase.  The more difficult\r\nquestion is whether Doyon's effort to make the payoff constituted\r\na substantial step \"toward\" the commission of the possession,\r\nUnited States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1459 (1st Cir. 1992),\r\ncert. denied, 507 U.S. 943 (1993), or (as the Code frames the\r\nissue) a substantial step \"in a course of conduct planned to\r\nculminate in [the defendant's] commission of the crime\" in\r\nquestion.  Model Penal Code  5.01(1)(c).\r\nBoth the Code, and instructions we have approved, say\r\nthat the substantial step must be one \"strongly corroborative of\r\nthe actor's criminal purpose.\"  Model Penal Code  5.01.  But \"[i]f\r\nthere is separate evidence of criminal intent independent from that\r\nprovided by the substantial steps (e.g., a confessed admission of\r\na design to commit a crime), then the substantial steps need not\r\nthemselves be unequivocally indicative of criminal intent--they\r\nmust merely corroborate that intent.\"  Dworken, 855 F.2d at 17 n.3. \r\nDoyon's original, express statement of his aim to acquire four to\r\nten ounces after paying off his debt provides this independent\r\nevidence of his intent, and his arrival at the hotel with ample\r\ncash corroborates that intent.\r\nThe difficult question is whether the conduct, here\r\nDoyon's travel to the hotel with cash to pay off the prior debt, is\r\nsubstantial in relation to reaching the criminal goal.  Decisions\r\noften distinguish between a \"substantial step\" and \"mere\r\npreparation,\" but whether this comparison helps or hinders the\r\njury, it simply shifts the locus of ambiguity from one term to\r\nanother.  However, both our case law and the Code's specific\r\nexamples of conduct that may be found sufficient as a substantial\r\nstep show that the defendant does not have to get very far along\r\nthe line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to\r\ncommit the attempt offense.\r\nContrary to at least some common law cases, the Code\r\nnames, as examples of acts that may be a substantial step, \"lying\r\nin wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the\r\ncrime,\" \"reconnoitering\" the place where the crime is to be\r\ncommitted, and \"possession of materials to be employed\" in the\r\ncrime if specially designed for unlawful use.  Model Penal Code \r\n5.01(2).  The cases often involve somewhat more robust facts, but\r\nthe defendant's arrival at the scene ready to commit the crime has\r\nbeen found adequate to constitute a substantial step in a number of\r\ncases.  See United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1304 (1st\r\nCir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1061 (1994); Chapdelaine, 989\r\nF.2d at 33.\r\nThe main purpose of the substantial step requirement is\r\nto distinguish between those who express criminal aims without\r\ndoing much to act on them and others who have proved themselves\r\ndangerous by taking a \"substantial step\" down a path of conduct\r\nreasonably calculated to end in the substantive offense.  Model\r\nPenal Code  5.01 cmt. 6, at 329-31.  It is this purpose that\r\ninforms the judgment whether a specific act or acts, in context and\r\ncoupled with proof of intent, can be regarded as substantial, and\r\nit helps explain the Code's otherwise confusing conflation of\r\nintent and conduct in defining what is a substantial step.\r\nGiven this guiding purpose, one can imagine a step toward\r\nthe offense--literally substantial in time and effort--that might\r\nstill not qualify as an attempt, at least if the intent was very\r\ngeneral.  But here, Doyon did not merely seek to pay off a drug\r\ndebt while generally contemplating some future purchase.  Doyon had\r\na prior relationship with his \"wholesalers,\" he had made a prior\r\npurchase on credit, he was paying off the first debt as a condition\r\nof making a second purchase from the same wholesalers, and his plan\r\nto acquire more drugs was specific down to the quantity of drugs\r\nbeing sought.  Thus, the \"fit\" was tight enough for the jury to\r\nconclude that Doyon's effort to pay off his prior debt was\r\neffectively a substantial step toward possessing more drugs.\r\nThere is one further concern.  Too ready classification\r\nof an otherwise lawful act as a substantial step may capture\r\nsomeone who might well have thought better, and abandoned the\r\neffort, before the attempt flowered into the substantive crime. \r\nThe Code attempts to deal with this problem by giving the defendant\r\nan affirmative defense where he abandons the attempt by manifesting\r\n\"a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.\" \r\nId.  5.01(4); see also Dworken, 855 F.2d at 20.  This is of no use\r\nto Doyon whose attempt was frustrated and not voluntarily\r\nabandoned.\r\nDoyon's other ground of appeal is his claim that the\r\ndistrict court erred in admitting the tape recordings.  He argues\r\nthat there was an inadequate \"foundation\" for admitting the tapes\r\nbecause the government did not establish that the recording device\r\nwas in proper working order.  Indeed, the government admitted in\r\ncourt that the tape recorder was an old one that had to be operated\r\nmanually and, at least in this instance, omitted the first few\r\nseconds of both of the taped conversations that were introduced in\r\nevidence.  Doyon argues that this undermined the necessary\r\nfoundation and also rendered the evidence misleading and subject to\r\nexclusion under Fed. R. Evid. 403.\r\nThe \"foundation\" required in order to authenticate real\r\nevidence--here the tape recordings--is simply an evidentiary\r\nshowing of whatever facts are necessary in the circumstances to\r\nprove that the item is what the proponent claims it to be.  Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 901.  In the case of recorded conversations, some courts have\r\na recipe for this showing, e.g., United States v. McMillan, 508\r\nF.2d 101, 104 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 916 (1975),\r\nbut this circuit has simply required proof that the tape recording\r\naccurately reflects the conversation in question.  \r\nIt is true, as Doyon argues, that evidence derived from\r\nthe operation of a machine or instrument normally depends for its\r\nvalidity on the premise that the device was in proper working\r\norder, but the nature and stringency of this requirement varies\r\nwith the circumstances.  A scale that produces wildly disparate\r\nreadings is unlikely to furnish usable evidence of drug weight; but\r\na tape recorder that cuts off introductory remarks may (and so far\r\nas we know here did) produce a perfectly accurate recording of the\r\nremainder of the conversation.  An accurate tape recording of part\r\nof a conversation is not inherently less admissible than the\r\ntestimony of a witness who heard only part of a conversation and\r\nrecounts the part that he heard.\r\nThis brings us to the real issue, which is whether the\r\ntapes' probative value was substantially outweighed by their\r\ntendency to mislead on account of the missing portions.  Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 403.  Such judgments, as to which the trial judge has\r\nconsiderable latitude, United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42,\r\n47 (1st Cir. 1991), require a certain amount of imagination\r\nwherever the exact content of the omitted portion is unknown.  But\r\nthe recorded portion of the conversation may contain\r\nstraightforward admissions and there may be no reason to suspect\r\nthat they were qualified by anything said in the omitted portions.\r\nThis appears to be just such a case:  the key admissions\r\non the tapes were Doyon's expressed desire to purchase four to ten\r\nounces of cocaine, his intent to pay off his old debt as a\r\npredicate, and his plan to meet promptly with Escobar at the hotel. \r\nThese intentions were either confirmed by or at least consistent\r\nwith other evidence (the trip to the hotel, the possession of\r\nmoney, the attempted flight), and Doyon himself is unable to\r\nsuggest what else would likely be on the missing portions of the\r\ntwo tapes that might have tempered or contradicted the admissions.\r\nThus, no basis exists to suppose that the tapes were\r\nmisleading at all, let alone that the district judge abused his\r\ndiscretion in rejecting the objection.  Nor was there any\r\nsuggestion that the government chose to cut off portions of the\r\nconversation or that it was doing anything other than its best to\r\nobtain a complete recording.  See generally 1 Weinstein's Federal\r\nEvidence  106.07[2], at 106-26 (McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 1999). \r\nThus, the conviction was proper and, while the sentence was\r\ncertainly severe, federal sentencing is largely outside the control\r\nof federal judges.\r\nAffirmed.                             APPENDIX\r\n\nModel Penal Code  5.01 (1985).  Criminal Attempt.\r\n (1) Definition of Attempt.  A person is guilty of an attempt to\r\ncommit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise\r\nrequired for commission of the crime, he:\r\n\n  (a) purposely engages in conduct that would\r\nconstitute the crime if the attendant\r\ncircumstances were as he believes them to be;\r\nor\r\n\n  (b) when causing a particular result is an\r\nelement of the crime, does or omits to do\r\nanything with the purpose of causing or with\r\nthe belief that it will cause such result\r\nwithout further conduct on his part; or\r\n\n  (c) purposely does or omits to do anything\r\nthat, under the circumstances as he believes\r\nthem to be, is an act or omission constituting\r\na substantial step in a course of conduct\r\nplanned to culminate in his commission of the\r\ncrime.\r\n\n (2) Conduct That May Be Held Substantial Step Under Subsection\r\n(1)(c).  Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step\r\nunder Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly\r\ncorroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.  Without negativing\r\nthe sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly\r\ncorroborative of the actor's criminal purpose, shall not be held\r\ninsufficient as a matter of law:\r\n\n  (a) lying in wait, searching for or following\r\nthe contemplated victim of the crime;\r\n\n  (b) enticing or seeking to entice the\r\ncontemplated victim of the crime to go to the \r\nplace contemplated for its commission;\r\n\n  (c) reconnoitering the place contemplated for\r\nthe commission of the crime;\r\n\n  (d) unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or\r\nenclosure in which it is contemplated that the\r\ncrime will be committed;\r\n\n  (e) possession of materials to be employed in\r\nthe commission of the crime, that are\r\nspecially designed for such unlawful use or\r\nthat can serve no lawful purpose of the actor\r\nunder the circumstances;\r\n\n  (f) possession, collection or fabrication of\r\nmaterials to be employed in the commission of\r\nthe crime, at or near the place contemplated\r\nfor its commission, if such possession,\r\ncollection or fabrication serves no lawful\r\npurpose of the actor under the circumstances;\r\n\n  (g) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in\r\nconduct constituting an element of the crime.\r\n\n (3) Conduct Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime. \r\nA person who engages in conduct designed to aid another to commit\r\na crime that would establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if\r\nthe crime were committed by such other person, is guilty of an\r\nattempt to commit the crime, although the crime is not committed or\r\nattempted by such other person.\r\n\n  (4) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose.  When the actor's conduct\r\nwould otherwise constitute an attempt under Subsection (1)(b) or\r\n(1)(c) of this Section, it is an affirmative defense that he\r\nabandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its\r\ncommission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and\r\nvoluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.  The establishment\r\nof such defense does not, however, affect the liability of an\r\naccomplice who did not join in such abandonment or prevention.\r\n\n Within the meaning of this Article, renunciation of criminal\r\npurpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part,\r\nby circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the\r\nactor's course of conduct, that increase the probability of\r\ndetection or apprehension or that make more difficult the\r\naccomplishment of the criminal purpose.  Renunciation is not\r\ncomplete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal\r\nconduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal\r\neffort to another but similar objective or victim.\n",

The tapes and transcripts were offered at trial together with agent testimony that the tapes accurately reflected what they had heard Escobar say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first conversation Escobar indicated that Doyon could not buy any more drugs until he paid off his earlier debt, to which Doyon replied: \"I have the money Eduardo.\" Later in the conversation, Escobar stated: \"How, how much you, you want?\" Doyon replied: \"What do you mean? I want four ounces, at least dude. I want ten.\" Doyon asked to have Johnny call him and concluded that he and Escobar would meet that night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 12:30 p.m., about half an hour after the first call, Escobar (acting under the government's supervision) paged Doyon and a second telephone conversation ensued. In the second conversation, Doyon and Escobar agreed to meet at the hotel at around 5 p.m. Escobar asked Doyon whether he had \"all the money\"; and Doyon replied: \"Of course.\" Doyon agreed that they would meet at 5 p.m. and persisted in asking Escobar to have Johnny page Doyon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under police surveillance, Doyon arrived at the hotel shortly before 6 p.m., entered Escobar's room briefly and then (after not finding Escobar) returned to his truck and started to drive away. When police cars turned on their lights and sirens, Doyon raced away, hitting one vehicle and just missing another, and was caught when he stopped about a quarter mile away. Agents retrieved large amounts of cash from Doyon's pocket and wallet, but evidence of the exact amount was not provided at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Doyon had sought unsuccessfully to suppress the tape recordings. Following the government's presentation of its case, Doyon asked for a directed judgment of acquittal for lack of sufficient evidence. The district court, although regarding the issue as a close one, denied the motion and the case was submitted to the jury. After several hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Doyon of attempting to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court attributed to Doyon the four ounces of cocaine that the court thought Doyon had attempted to buy and, as related conduct, the three ounces he had purchased in late October. This would ordinarily have produced an offense level of 18, which the district court adjusted upward for Doyon's possession of a weapon and for endangerment of others caused by Doyon's flight. In addition, based on two prior drug felony convictions in state court, the district court determined that Doyon was a career offender, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, and, after declining to depart, imposed the minimum sentence of 262 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law of attempt is reasonably clear in the center but quite fuzzy around the edges; different formulations have been used to cope with a range of problems, such as degree of involvement, impossibility and withdrawal. See Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01 cmt. (1985). In this circuit, as in a number of others, the court has taken the Model Penal Code as its guide. See United States v. Dworken, 855 F.2d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1988). Under the Code definition, set forth in section 5.01 (reprinted as an appendix to this opinion), we have viewed the two key elements of the offense of attempt as (1) an \"intent\" to commit the substantive offense and (2) a \"substantial step towards [its] commission.\" See United States v. Rivera-Sola, 713 F.2d 866, 869 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Doyon's \"intent\" to acquire cocaine is difficult to dispute (and Doyon does not now challenge the inference that he intended to distribute what he got<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>). Doyon had said at the outset that he wanted to acquire four to ten ounces; he had acquired three ounces from the same source on a prior occasion; and his alacrity in pressing to pay off a prior drug debt supported the inference that he had further interest in acquiring more inventory and reasonably soon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Doyon's attack on the evidence rests on the premise that Doyon could not have intended to accept the new delivery at the same time that he paid off his old debt (because Escobar had said earlier that he did not have any drugs) and that the payment of an old debt as a first step in securing a later delivery is not the \"substantial step\" toward possession required to make out an attempt. The case law, says Doyon, usually involves conduct by defendant that brings him somewhat closer to final commission of the object crime. E.g., United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462 n.18 (1st Cir. 1993) (planning deal, accepting sample, arriving at scene of planned deal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a close question whether the evidence taken as a whole would permit the jury to conclude that Doyon expected to buy cocaine at the same time that he paid off his old debt. Based on evidence not presented to the jury, it appears that Doyon may well have expected to make an immediate purchase;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> but, of course, our concern is solely with what the jury could reasonably have found on the evidence before it. Escobar's statement that he had no drugs occurred before Doyon came to the hotel, yet it might well be a stretch to suppose that the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Doyon expected to make a purchase on November 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point need not be pursued. In considering the motion to acquit, the district judge rejected the notion that the jury could find that Doyon had an intent to make a simultaneous purchase, and in closing arguments both lawyers invited the jury to focus on a different question, namely, whether in context Doyon's effort to pay off his drug debt could be regarded as a substantial step toward a purchase in the near future and might therefore constitute a substantial step toward possession with intent to distribute. We consider the issue in the same light and, while agreeing that this could be regarded as a close case, uphold the refusal to direct a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence already mentioned was ample for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Doyon intended to make a purchase of cocaine from Escobar or Johnny in the near future and that Doyon's effort to pay his prior drug debt was intended by him to remove an express obstacle to this purchase. The more difficult question is whether Doyon's effort to make the payoff constituted a substantial step \"toward\" the commission of the possession, United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1459 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 943 (1993), or (as the Code frames the issue) a substantial step \"in a course of conduct planned to culminate in [the defendant's] commission of the crime\" in question. Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(1)(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Code, and instructions we have approved, say that the substantial step must be one \"strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.\" Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01. But \"[i]f there is separate evidence of criminal intent independent from that provided by the substantial steps (e.g., a confessed admission of a design to commit a crime), then the substantial steps need not themselves be unequivocally indicative of criminal intent--they must merely corroborate that intent.\" Dworken, 855 F.2d at 17 n.3. Doyon's original, express statement of his aim to acquire four to ten ounces after paying off his debt provides this independent evidence of his intent, and his arrival at the hotel with ample cash corroborates that intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficult question is whether the conduct, here Doyon's travel to the hotel with cash to pay off the prior debt, is substantial in relation to reaching the criminal goal. Decisions often distinguish between a \"substantial step\" and \"mere preparation,\" but whether this comparison helps or hinders the jury, it simply shifts the locus of ambiguity from one term to another.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> However, both our case law and the Code's specific examples of conduct that may be found sufficient as a substantial step show that the defendant does not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to at least some common law cases, the Code names, as examples of acts that may be a substantial step, \"lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime,\" \"reconnoitering\" the place where the crime is to be committed, and \"possession of materials to be employed\" in the crime if specially designed for unlawful use. Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(2). The cases often involve somewhat more robust facts, but the defendant's arrival at the scene ready to commit the crime has been found adequate to constitute a substantial step in a number of cases. See United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1304 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1061 (1994); Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main purpose of the substantial step requirement is to distinguish between those who express criminal aims without doing much to act on them and others who have proved themselves dangerous by taking a \"substantial step\" down a path of conduct reasonably calculated to end in the substantive offense. Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01 cmt. 6, at 329-31. It is this purpose that informs the judgment whether a specific act or acts, in context and coupled with proof of intent, can be regarded as substantial, and it helps explain the Code's otherwise confusing conflation of intent and conduct in defining what is a substantial step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this guiding purpose, one can imagine a step toward the offense--literally substantial in time and effort--that might still not qualify as an attempt, at least if the intent was very general.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But here, Doyon did not merely seek to pay off a drug debt while generally contemplating some future purchase. Doyon had a prior relationship with his \"wholesalers,\" he had made a prior purchase on credit, he was paying off the first debt as a condition of making a second purchase from the same wholesalers, and his plan to acquire more drugs was specific down to the quantity of drugs being sought. Thus, the \"fit\" was tight enough for the jury to conclude that Doyon's effort to pay off his prior debt was effectively a substantial step toward possessing more drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one further concern. Too ready classification of an otherwise lawful act as a substantial step may capture someone who might well have thought better, and abandoned the effort, before the attempt flowered into the substantive crime. The Code attempts to deal with this problem by giving the defendant an affirmative defense where he abandons the attempt by manifesting \"a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.\" Id. &#167; 5.01(4); see also Dworken, 855 F.2d at 20. This is of no use to Doyon whose attempt was frustrated and not voluntarily abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doyon's other ground of appeal is his claim that the district court erred in admitting the tape recordings. He argues that there was an inadequate \"foundation\" for admitting the tapes because the government did not establish that the recording device was in proper working order. Indeed, the government admitted in court that the tape recorder was an old one that had to be operated manually and, at least in this instance, omitted the first few seconds of both of the taped conversations that were introduced in evidence. Doyon argues that this undermined the necessary foundation and also rendered the evidence misleading and subject to exclusion under Fed. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"foundation\" required in order to authenticate real evidence--here the tape recordings--is simply an evidentiary showing of whatever facts are necessary in the circumstances to prove that the item is what the proponent claims it to be. Fed. R. Evid. 901. In the case of recorded conversations, some courts have a recipe for this showing, e.g., United States v. McMillan, 508 F.2d 101, 104 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 916 (1975), but this circuit has simply required proof that the tape recording accurately reflects the conversation in question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as Doyon argues, that evidence derived from the operation of a machine or instrument normally depends for its validity on the premise that the device was in proper working order, but the nature and stringency of this requirement varies with the circumstances. A scale that produces wildly disparate readings is unlikely to furnish usable evidence of drug weight; but a tape recorder that cuts off introductory remarks may (and so far as we know here did) produce a perfectly accurate recording of the remainder of the conversation. An accurate tape recording of part of a conversation is not inherently less admissible than the testimony of a witness who heard only part of a conversation and recounts the part that he heard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the real issue, which is whether the tapes' probative value was substantially outweighed by their tendency to mislead on account of the missing portions. Fed. R. Evid. 403. Such judgments, as to which the trial judge has considerable latitude, United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 1991), require a certain amount of imagination wherever the exact content of the omitted portion is unknown. But the recorded portion of the conversation may contain straightforward admissions and there may be no reason to suspect that they were qualified by anything said in the omitted portions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appears to be just such a case: the key admissions on the tapes were Doyon's expressed desire to purchase four to ten ounces of cocaine, his intent to pay off his old debt as a predicate, and his plan to meet promptly with Escobar at the hotel. These intentions were either confirmed by or at least consistent with other evidence (the trip to the hotel, the possession of money, the attempted flight), and Doyon himself is unable to suggest what else would likely be on the missing portions of the two tapes that might have tempered or contradicted the admissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, no basis exists to suppose that the tapes were misleading at all, let alone that the district judge abused his discretion in rejecting the objection. Nor was there any suggestion that the government chose to cut off portions of the conversation or that it was doing anything other than its best to obtain a complete recording. See generally 1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 106.07[2], at 106-26 (McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 1999). Thus, the conviction was proper and, while the sentence was certainly severe, federal sentencing is largely outside the control of federal judges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01 (1985).

Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195659\"><a href=\"/opinion/195659/united-states-v-delgado-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1234 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span> </span>(1995). The evidence at trial permitted the jury to find that the following had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late August or early September 1997, one Eduardo Escobar-Reyes shared an apartment in Portland, Maine, with a drug dealer named Johnny and became involved in Johnny's drug operations. They sold powder cocaine which they obtained from a source in New York. In late October 1997, Doyon helped Escobar and Johnny move to a hotel. Shortly thereafter, at another location, Escobar sold three ounces of cocaine to Doyon for approximately $3,300; the drug was \"fronted\" to Doyon, meaning that he paid an extra amount per ounce but did not have to pay Escobar up front, a practice that is common in deals between drug traffickers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Escobar left for New York, where he and Johnny purchased five ounces of cocaine; Escobar returned to Portland on November 4, 1997. At some point thereafter, Doyon called Escobar at the hotel and said that he had the money he owed Escobar from the prior deal and wanted to meet him. (Doyon knew about the New York buying trip because he had driven Johnny part of the way there.) Doyon also indicated an interest in a possible further purchase, but Escobar--who was planning to sell his new inventory to another of his customers (one Harry Brady)--told Doyon that he did not have any drugs to supply. Escobar and Doyon agreed to meet later. This call was not recorded, but Escobar testified to it at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 6, 1997, Escobar met with Brady to transfer the cocaine, but Brady was in fact an undercover government agent and Escobar was arrested. Escobar then agreed to cooperate and, while giving a statement, received a pager signal from Doyon and returned Doyon's call in the presence of government agents. That call, and a second occurring soon thereafter, were recorded by the agents using a tape recording device. The tapes and transcripts were offered at trial together with agent testimony that the tapes accurately reflected what they had heard Escobar say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first conversation Escobar indicated that Doyon could not buy any more drugs until he paid off his earlier debt, to which Doyon replied: \"I have the money Eduardo.\" Later in the conversation, Escobar stated: \"How, how much you, you want?\" Doyon replied: \"What do you mean? I want four ounces, at least dude. I want ten.\" Doyon asked to have Johnny call him and concluded that he and Escobar would meet that night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 12:30 p.m., about half an hour after the first call, Escobar (acting under the government's supervision) paged Doyon and a second telephone conversation ensued. In the second conversation, Doyon and Escobar agreed to meet at the hotel at around 5 p.m. Escobar asked Doyon whether he had \"all the money\"; and Doyon replied: \"Of course.\" Doyon agreed that they would meet at 5 p.m. and persisted in asking Escobar to have Johnny page Doyon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under police surveillance, Doyon arrived at the hotel shortly before 6 p.m., entered Escobar's room briefly and then (after not finding Escobar) returned to his truck and started to drive away. When police cars turned on their lights and sirens, Doyon raced away, hitting one vehicle and just missing another, and was caught when he stopped about a quarter mile away. Agents retrieved large amounts of cash from Doyon's pocket and wallet, but evidence of the exact amount was not provided at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Doyon had sought unsuccessfully to suppress the tape recordings. Following the government's presentation of its case, Doyon asked for a directed judgment of acquittal for lack of sufficient evidence. The district court, although regarding the issue as a close one, denied the motion and the case was submitted to the jury. After several hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Doyon of attempting to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court attributed to Doyon the four ounces of cocaine that the court thought Doyon had attempted to buy and, as related conduct, the three ounces he had purchased in late October. This would ordinarily have produced an offense level of 18, which the district court adjusted upward for Doyon's possession of a weapon and for endangerment of others caused by Doyon's flight. In addition, based on two prior drug felony convictions in state court, the district court determined that Doyon was a career offender, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, and, after declining to depart, imposed the minimum sentence of 262 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law of attempt is reasonably clear in the center but quite fuzzy around the edges; different formulations have been used to cope with a range of problems, such as degree of involvement, impossibility and withdrawal. See Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01 cmt. (1985). In this circuit, as in a number of others, the court has taken the Model Penal Code as its guide. See United States v. Dworken, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510631\"><a href=\"/opinion/510631/united-states-v-jay-lewis-dworken-aka-jason-lewis-jay-lewis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1988). Under the Code definition, set forth in section 5.01 (reprinted as an appendix to this opinion), we have viewed the two key elements of the offense of attempt as (1) an \"intent\" to commit the substantive offense and (2) a \"substantial step towards [its] commission.\" See United States v. Rivera-Sola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422230\"><a href=\"/opinion/422230/united-states-v-sigfredo-rivera-sola-aka-freddy/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span>, 869 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Doyon's \"intent\" to acquire cocaine is difficult to dispute (and Doyon does not now challenge the inference that he intended to distribute what he got<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>). Doyon had said at the outset that he wanted to acquire four to ten ounces; he had acquired three ounces from the same source on a prior occasion; and his alacrity in pressing to pay off a prior drug debt supported the inference that he had further interest in acquiring more inventory and reasonably soon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Doyon's attack on the evidence rests on the premise that Doyon could not have intended to accept the new delivery at the same time that he paid off his old debt (because Escobar had said earlier that he did not have any drugs) and that the payment of an old debt as a first step in securing a later delivery is not the \"substantial step\" toward possession required to make out an attempt. The case law, says Doyon, usually involves conduct by defendant that brings him somewhat closer to final commission of the object crime. E.g., United States v. Fisher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194868\"><a href=\"/opinion/194868/united-states-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 462 n.18 (1st Cir. 1993) (planning deal, accepting sample, arriving at scene of planned deal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a close question whether the evidence taken as a whole would permit the jury to conclude that Doyon expected to buy cocaine at the same time that he paid off his old debt. Based on evidence not presented to the jury, it appears that Doyon may well have expected to make an immediate purchase;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> but, of course, our concern is solely with what the jury could reasonably have found on the evidence before it. Escobar's statement that he had no drugs occurred before Doyon came to the hotel, yet it might well be a stretch to suppose that the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Doyon expected to make a purchase on November 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point need not be pursued. In considering the motion to acquit, the district judge rejected the notion that the jury could find that Doyon had an intent to make a simultaneous purchase, and in closing arguments both lawyers invited the jury to focus on a different question, namely, whether in context Doyon's effort to pay off his drug debt could be regarded as a substantial step toward a purchase in the near future and might therefore constitute a substantial step toward possession with intent to distribute. We consider the issue in the same light and, while agreeing that this could be regarded as a close case, uphold the refusal to direct a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence already mentioned was ample for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Doyon intended to make a purchase of cocaine from Escobar or Johnny in the near future and that Doyon's effort to pay his prior drug debt was intended by him to remove an express obstacle to this purchase. The more difficult question is whether Doyon's effort to make the payoff constituted a substantial step \"toward\" the commission of the possession, United States v. Figueroa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592204\"><a href=\"/opinion/592204/united-states-v-angel-luis-figueroa-united-states-of-america-v-tomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1459 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span> </span>(1993), or (as the Code frames the issue) a substantial step \"in a course of conduct planned to culminate in [the defendant's] commission of the crime\" in question. Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(1)(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Code, and instructions we have approved, say that the substantial step must be one \"strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.\" Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01. But \"[i]f there is separate evidence of criminal intent independent from that provided by the substantial steps (e.g., a confessed admission of a design to commit a crime), then the substantial steps need not themselves be unequivocally indicative of criminal intent--they must merely corroborate that intent.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510631\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dworken,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/510631/united-states-v-jay-lewis-dworken-aka-jason-lewis-jay-lewis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">17</span> </a></span>n.3. Doyon's original, express statement of his aim to acquire four to ten ounces after paying off his debt provides this independent evidence of his intent, and his arrival at the hotel with ample cash corroborates that intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficult question is whether the conduct, here Doyon's travel to the hotel with cash to pay off the prior debt, is substantial in relation to reaching the criminal goal. Decisions often distinguish between a \"substantial step\" and \"mere preparation,\" but whether this comparison helps or hinders the jury, it simply shifts the locus of ambiguity from one term to another.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> However, both our case law and the Code's specific examples of conduct that may be found sufficient as a substantial step show that the defendant does not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to at least some common law cases, the Code names, as examples of acts that may be a substantial step, \"lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime,\" \"reconnoitering\" the place where the crime is to be committed, and \"possession of materials to be employed\" in the crime if specially designed for unlawful use. Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(2). The cases often involve somewhat more robust facts, but the defendant's arrival at the scene ready to commit the crime has been found adequate to constitute a substantial step in a number of cases. See United States v. Argencourt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610550\"><a href=\"/opinion/610550/united-states-v-joseph-argencourt-aka-joe-black-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span>, 1304 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1061</span> </span>(1994); <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Chapdelaine,</span> <span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">33</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main purpose of the substantial step requirement is to distinguish between those who express criminal aims without doing much to act on them and others who have proved themselves dangerous by taking a \"substantial step\" down a path of conduct reasonably calculated to end in the substantive offense. Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01 cmt. 6, at 329-31. It is this purpose that informs the judgment whether a specific act or acts, in context and coupled with proof of intent, can be regarded as substantial, and it helps explain the Code's otherwise confusing conflation of intent and conduct in defining what is a substantial step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this guiding purpose, one can imagine a step toward the offense--literally substantial in time and effort--that might still not qualify as an attempt, at least if the intent was very general.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But here, Doyon did not merely seek to pay off a drug debt while generally contemplating some future purchase. Doyon had a prior relationship with his \"wholesalers,\" he had made a prior purchase on credit, he was paying off the first debt as a condition of making a second purchase from the same wholesalers, and his plan to acquire more drugs was specific down to the quantity of drugs being sought. Thus, the \"fit\" was tight enough for the jury to conclude that Doyon's effort to pay off his prior debt was effectively a substantial step toward possessing more drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one further concern. Too ready classification of an otherwise lawful act as a substantial step may capture someone who might well have thought better, and abandoned the effort, before the attempt flowered into the substantive crime. The Code attempts to deal with this problem by giving the defendant an affirmative defense where he abandons the attempt by manifesting \"a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.\" Id. &#167; 5.01(4); see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510631\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dworken,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/510631/united-states-v-jay-lewis-dworken-aka-jason-lewis-jay-lewis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>. This is of no use to Doyon whose attempt was frustrated and not voluntarily abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doyon's other ground of appeal is his claim that the district court erred in admitting the tape recordings. He argues that there was an inadequate \"foundation\" for admitting the tapes because the government did not establish that the recording device was in proper working order. Indeed, the government admitted in court that the tape recorder was an old one that had to be operated manually and, at least in this instance, omitted the first few seconds of both of the taped conversations that were introduced in evidence. Doyon argues that this undermined the necessary foundation and also rendered the evidence misleading and subject to exclusion under Fed. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"foundation\" required in order to authenticate real evidence--here the tape recordings--is simply an evidentiary showing of whatever facts are necessary in the circumstances to prove that the item is what the proponent claims it to be. Fed. R. Evid. 901. In the case of recorded conversations, some courts have a recipe for this showing, e.g., United States v. McMillan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span>, 104 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span> </span>(1975), but this circuit has simply required proof that the tape recording accurately reflects the conversation in question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as Doyon argues, that evidence derived from the operation of a machine or instrument normally depends for its validity on the premise that the device was in proper working order, but the nature and stringency of this requirement varies with the circumstances. A scale that produces wildly disparate readings is unlikely to furnish usable evidence of drug weight; but a tape recorder that cuts off introductory remarks may (and so far as we know here did) produce a perfectly accurate recording of the remainder of the conversation. An accurate tape recording of part of a conversation is not inherently less admissible than the testimony of a witness who heard only part of a conversation and recounts the part that he heard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the real issue, which is whether the tapes' probative value was substantially outweighed by their tendency to mislead on account of the missing portions. Fed. R. Evid. 403. Such judgments, as to which the trial judge has considerable latitude, United States v. Font-Ramirez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567923\"><a href=\"/opinion/567923/united-states-v-octavio-font-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir. 1991), require a certain amount of imagination wherever the exact content of the omitted portion is unknown. But the recorded portion of the conversation may contain straightforward admissions and there may be no reason to suspect that they were qualified by anything said in the omitted portions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appears to be just such a case: the key admissions on the tapes were Doyon's expressed desire to purchase four to ten ounces of cocaine, his intent to pay off his old debt as a predicate, and his plan to meet promptly with Escobar at the hotel. These intentions were either confirmed by or at least consistent with other evidence (the trip to the hotel, the possession of money, the attempted flight), and Doyon himself is unable to suggest what else would likely be on the missing portions of the two tapes that might have tempered or contradicted the admissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, no basis exists to suppose that the tapes were misleading at all, let alone that the district judge abused his discretion in rejecting the objection. Nor was there any suggestion that the government chose to cut off portions of the conversation or that it was doing anything other than its best to obtain a complete recording. See generally 1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 106.07[2], at 106-26 (McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 1999). Thus, the conviction was proper and, while the sentence was certainly severe, federal sentencing is largely outside the control of federal judges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01 (1985).

Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The latter inference was reasonably easy for the jury in light of Doyon's earlier \"fronted\" purchase, suggesting that he intended to resell the drug, coupled with the amount (four to ten ounces) that he proposed to purchase in the second transaction.
