We must decide whether a\n\ndefendant convicted of a single count of laundering the proceeds of\n\nbankruptcy fraud was properly ordered to make restitution to the\n\nbankruptcy trustee.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          This case arises out of a scheme to conceal assets from the\n\nbankruptcy court, the trustee and creditors in the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings of Catherine Petit, defendant Robert Paradis's employer.\n\nPrior to her bankruptcy, Petit was pursuing a multi-million dollar\n\nclaim against various parties. To help finance the litigation, Petit\n\nand several associates (not including Paradis) persuaded investors to\n\npurchase stakes in the outcome of the litigation. From 1989 until\n\n1997, they raised roughly $8.2 million from numerous investors. In\n\nJune 1993, an involuntary Chapter 7 (later converted to Chapter 11)\n\npetition was filed against Petit. During the course of the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings, Petit falsely denied receiving any income from the sale of\n\nher interest in the litigation. This fraud on the bankruptcy court\n\nultimately led to the October 1997 arrests of Petit, Paradis, and\n\nseveral of Petit's associates.\n\n          Paradis's role in the scheme was to conceal Petit's\n\ninvestment income from her creditors and the bankruptcy court. As\n\noffice manager of a company Petit controlled, Paradis received a\n\nportion of the funds Petit raised through the investment scheme and\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdeposited them in personal accounts held by him and his wife. From\n\nthose accounts, Paradis paid Petit's business and personal expenses.\n\nAll told, Paradis passed roughly $3 million through his accounts,\n\ndepriving Petit's bankruptcy estate and her creditors of potential\n\naccess to those funds.\n\n          Shortly after his arrest in October 1997, Paradis pled guilty\n\nto one count of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. The district court sentenced\n\nParadis to fifteen months in prison and three years of supervised\n\nrelease, and ordered Paradis to pay $3 million in restitution to the\n\nUnited States Trustee in Petit's bankruptcy case. On this appeal,\n\nParadis challenges the restitution order and the length of the term of\n\nsupervised release. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and\n\n2253.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.   RESTITUTION\n\n          A.   Standard of Review\n\n          We customarily review restitution orders for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See United States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579, 586 (1st Cir.\n\n1997). \"To the extent that a challenge to a restitution order hinges\n\non a legal question, however, the sentencing court's answer to that\n\nquestion is reviewed de novo.\"      Id.\n\n          B.   Application of Restitution to Money Laundering\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           At sentencing, both Paradis and the government argued that\n\nbecause in the usual case--laundering of the proceeds of drug\n\ntransactions--the victim is society, restitution is improper in a case\n\nwhere money laundering is the only offense.      The district court,\n\nhowever, concluded that because Paradis's money laundering deprived the\n\nbankruptcy trustee of the ability to distribute the laundered funds to\n\nPetit's creditors, restitution was appropriate and the trustee was a\n\nvictim for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 3663A. The court ordered Paradis to\n\npay restitution of roughly $3 million--the aggregate of the laundered\n\nfunds--to the trustee in Petit's bankruptcy case. On appeal, Paradis\n\nurges us to reverse the restitution order on the same ground he argued\n\nin the district court, i.e., that there can be no identifiable victim\n\nfor purposes of § 3663A because the victim of money laundering is\n\nsociety.   Although the government also took that position in the\n\ndistrict court, on appeal it defends the district court's order to\n\nfacilitate our consideration of this issue.\n\n           Paradis's argument rests on decisions applying the grouping\n\nprovisions of United States Sentencing Guideline § 3D1.2, under which\n\noffenses are grouped for sentence calculation where they are based on\n\ndifferent acts but harm the same victims. He relies principally on\n\nUnited States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568 (1st Cir. 1993). The issue there\n\nwas whether a defendant's sentence for mail fraud and for money\n\nlaundering should have been included in a single group. In rejecting\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthe defendant's argument that his mail fraud and money laundering\n\nconvictions involved the same victims for purposes of grouping under\n\nthe guidelines, we said, \"[t]he guidelines are clear that, for purposes\n\nof these subsections, the victim of fraud is the insurance company and\n\nthe victim of money laundering is society.\"      The decision is not\n\napposite; it does not implicate the construction of the restitution\n\nstatute, 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, nor does it purport to decide that money\n\nlaundering could not produce an identifiable victim. For the same\n\nreasons, the other decisions on which Paradis relies are inapposite.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Kunzman, 54 F.3d 1522, 1531 (10th Cir.\n\n1995) (securities fraud and money laundering); United States v. Gallo,\n\n927 F.2d 815, 824 (5th Cir. 1991) (drug offenses and money laundering).\n\n          We turn now to the statute.      Under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A,\n\nrestitution is mandatory where the defendant is convicted of \"any . .\n\n. offense against property under [Title 18], including any offense\n\ncommitted by fraud or deceit . . . in which an identifiable victim or\n\nvictims has suffered a . . . pecuniary loss.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(1);\n\nid. § 3663A(a)(1). Paradis does not dispute that money laundering is\n\nan offense against property. See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1) (\"Whoever,\n\nknowing that the property involved in a financial transaction\n\nrepresents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts .\n\n. . a financial transaction . . .\") (emphasis added). A \"victim\" under\n\nthe statute is \"a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered . .\n\n. .\"   18 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)(2).\n\n          Here, Paradis diverted funds he knew were the proceeds of\n\nPetit's fraud on the bankruptcy court from the bankruptcy estate. To\n\nconceal the existence of those funds from the bankruptcy court, Paradis\n\nchanneled them through his own accounts, out of which he paid Petit's\n\npersonal and business expenses. The direct result of Paradis's actions\n\nwas to conceal from the bankruptcy court and from the estate $3 million\n\nthat could have been available to satisfy claims of creditors. On\n\nthese facts, Paradis's argument that society alone was the victim is\n\nuntenable and restitution may be appropriate to the extent identifiable\n\nvictims exist.\n\n          C.   Identification of the Victim\n\n          The district court determined that the bankruptcy trustee was\n\nthe victim for purposes of § 3663A. The victim must be one who was\n\n\"harmed as a result of the commission of [the] offense.\" 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3663A(a)(2). While the trustee may be a victim of bankruptcy fraud,\n\nthat was not the charge against Paradis. His offense was laundering\n\nthe proceeds of the fraud. There is no evidence that the trustee was\n\nharmed as a result of this offense. Its effect was to conceal the\n\nproceeds of the fraud and to divert those funds from the estate where\n\nthey could have been available to pay creditors who had filed claims.\n\nBut again there is no evidence of harm to creditors, i.e., no evidence\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fof creditors who filed claims that went unpaid. Because there is no\n\nevidence of identifiable victims who suffered harm as a result of\n\nParadis's money laundering, the restitution order must be vacated.\n\nII.   SUPERVISED RELEASE\n\n          For the first time on appeal, Paradis challenges the three-\n\nyear term of supervised release imposed as part of his sentence.\n\nBecause he did not raise this objection in the district court, our\n\nreview is for plain error. See United States v. Merric, 166 F.3d 406,\n\n409 (1st Cir. 1999). Paradis must establish \"an obvious and clear\n\nerror under law that seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Id. at 409-10 (internal\n\nquotations omitted).   His argument is merely that three years of\n\nsupervised release is unnecessary.     This falls well short of an\n\nassertion of plain error. We therefore reject Paradis's challenge to\n\nhis term of supervised release.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          The order of restitution is vacated. In all other respects,\n\nthe judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

Vaknin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197346\"><a href=\"/opinion/197346/united-states-v-vaknin/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 586 (1st  Cir. 1997).  \"To the extent that a challenge to a restitution order  hinges on a legal question, however, the sentencing court's answer  to that question is reviewed de novo.\"  Id.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.  Application of Restitution to Money Laundering</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, both Paradis and the government argued  that because in the usual case--laundering of the proceeds of drug  transactions--the victim is society, restitution is improper in a  case where money laundering is the only offense.  The district  court, however, concluded that because Paradis's money laundering  deprived the bankruptcy trustee of the ability to distribute the  laundered funds to Petit's creditors, restitution was appropriate  and the trustee was a victim for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A. The court ordered Paradis to pay restitution of roughly $3 million--the aggregate of the laundered funds--to the trustee in Petit's  bankruptcy case.  On appeal, Paradis urges us to reverse the  restitution order on the same ground he argued in the district  court, i.e., that there can be no identifiable victim for purposes  of &#167; 3663A because the victim of money laundering is society. Although the government also took that position in the district  court, on appeal it defends the district court's order to  facilitate our consideration of this issue.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paradis's argument rests on decisions applying the  grouping provisions of United States Sentencing Guideline &#167; 3D1.2,  under which offenses are grouped for sentence calculation where  they are based on different acts but harm the same victims.  He  relies principally on United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span> </a></span>(1st  Cir. 1993).  The issue there was whether a defendant's sentence for  mail fraud and for money laundering should have been included in a  single group.  In rejecting the defendant's argument that his mail  fraud and money laundering convictions involved the same victims  for purposes of grouping under the guidelines, we said, \"[t]he  guidelines are clear that, for purposes of these subsections, the  victim of fraud is the insurance company and the victim of money  laundering is society.\"  The decision is not apposite; it does not  implicate the construction of the restitution statute, 18 U.S.C.  &#167; 3663A, nor does it purport to decide that money laundering could  not produce an identifiable victim.  For the same reasons, the  other decisions on which Paradis relies are inapposite.  See, e.g., United States v. Kunzman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696243\"><a href=\"/opinion/696243/united-states-v-charles-william-kunzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span>, 1531 (10th Cir. 1995)  (securities fraud and money laundering); United States v. Gallo,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557219\"><a href=\"/opinion/557219/united-states-v-jose-alvaro-gallo/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>, 824 (5th Cir. 1991) (drug offenses and money  laundering).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the statute.  Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A,  restitution is mandatory where the defendant is convicted of \"any  . . . offense against property under [Title 18], including any  offense committed by fraud or deceit . . . in which an identifiable  victim or victims has suffered a . . . pecuniary loss.\"  18 U.S.C.  &#167; 3663A(c)(1); id. &#167; 3663A(a)(1).  Paradis does not dispute that  money laundering is an offense against property.  See 18 U.S.C.  &#167; 1956(a)(1) (\"Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a  financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of  unlawful activity, conducts . . . a financial transaction . . .\")  (emphasis added).  A \"victim\" under the statute is \"a person  directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an  offense for which restitution may be ordered . . . .\"  18 U.S.C.  &#167; 3663A(a)(2).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Paradis diverted funds he knew were the proceeds of  Petit's fraud on thebankruptcy court from the bankruptcy estate. To conceal the existence of those funds from the bankruptcy court,  Paradis channeled them through his own accounts, out of which he  paid Petit's personal and business expenses.  The direct result of  Paradis's actions was to conceal from the bankruptcy court and from  the estate $3 million that could have been available to satisfy  claims of creditors.  On these facts, Paradis's argument that  society alone was the victim is untenable and restitution may be  appropriate to the extent identifiable victims exist.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.  Identification of the Victim</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the bankruptcy trustee  was the victim for purposes of &#167; 3663A.  The victim must be one who  was \"harmed as a result of the commission of [the] offense.\"  18  U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(a)(2).  While the trustee may be a victim of  bankruptcy fraud, that was not the charge against Paradis.  His  offense was laundering the proceeds of the fraud.  There is no  evidence that the trustee was harmed as a result of this offense. Its effect was to conceal the proceeds of the fraud and to divert  those funds from the estate where they could have been available to  pay creditors who had filed claims.  But again there is no evidence  of harm to creditors, i.e., no evidence of creditors who filed  claims that went unpaid.  Because there is no evidence of  identifiable victims who suffered harm as a result of Paradis's  money laundering, the restitution order must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  SUPERVISED RELEASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, Paradis challenges the  three-year term of supervised release imposed as part of his  sentence.  Because he did not raise this objection in the district  court, our review is for plain error.  See United States v. Merric, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198307\"><a href=\"/opinion/198307/united-states-v-merric/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 409 (1st Cir. 1999).  Paradis must establish  \"an obvious and clear error under law that seriously affect[s] the  fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198307\"><a href=\"/opinion/198307/united-states-v-merric/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 409-10 </a></span>(internal quotations omitted).  His argument is  merely that three years of supervised release is unnecessary.  This  falls well short of an assertion of plain error.  We therefore  reject Paradis's challenge to his term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of restitution is vacated.  In all other  respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>   Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
