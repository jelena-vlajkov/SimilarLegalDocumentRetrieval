Arias-Marxuach with whom Rossell M. Barrios-Amy and\r\nMcConnell Valds were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 7, 2000\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff Basic Controlex\r\nCorporation (\"Basic Controlex\") appeals a judgment in favor of the\r\ndefendant, Klockner Moeller Corporation (\"KMC\").  For the following\r\nreasons, we affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\n                         Background\r\nOn October 28, 1986, KMC and Basic Industries Company,\r\nInc., executed a letter of intent whereby a to-be-formed company,\r\nBasic Controlex, would become the exclusive agent to sell KMC\r\nproducts in Puerto Rico.  Although the letter of intent left open\r\nmany details that the parties were to negotiate in good faith at a\r\nlater date, these further negotiations never took place. \r\nNevertheless, both parties acted upon the letter as though it\r\nconstituted a binding contract.  \r\nOn May 3, 1993, KMC informed Basic Controlex that it\r\nintended to sell its products through other distributors in Puerto\r\nRico, \"effective immediately.\"  The parties dispute whether KMC\r\nactually began to do so.  Although Basic Controlex took no\r\nimmediate legal action in response to this letter, it did write to\r\nKMC urging it to abide by its contractual obligations.  KMC\r\nresponded in November 1995 by asking Basic Controlex to agree to a\r\nnonexclusive dealing arrangement and to waive any claims that it\r\nmight have against KMC under either the letter of intent or Puerto\r\nRico law.  Basic Controlex refused.\r\nDwindling sales caused Basic Controlex to dissolve on\r\nDecember 13, 1995 and to sell its assets to Powerline, which\r\nassumed Basic Controlex's rights under the letter of intent as a\r\nsuccessor-in-interest.  On January 7, 1997, the two companies filed\r\nthis diversity action in the United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, alleging violations of the Puerto Rico\r\nDealers' Act,  see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278 (1964) (\"Act 75\"),\r\nand other provisions of the Puerto Rico Civil Code (\"the Code\").  \r\nOn September 3, 1998, the district court granted summary\r\njudgment for KMC on the grounds that Basic Controlex had failed to\r\nbring suit within the three-year statute of limitations established\r\nby Act 75.  The court also concluded that, because Act 75 governed\r\nthe relationship between the two companies, its three-year statute\r\nof limitations superceded the longer limitations period that\r\notherwise would have applied to the breach of contract claim under\r\nthe Code.  Basic Controlex then filed a cryptic Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment which, even generously\r\nconstrued, largely reargued its summary judgment position.  The\r\ncourt denied the motion.                              II.\r\nAs KMC points out in its appellate brief, Basic\r\nControlex's notice of appeal challenged only the district court's\r\ndenial of the Rule 59(e) motion.  While it is true that we review\r\nthe denial of such a motion only for a \"manifest abuse of\r\ndiscretion,\" Mariani-Giron v. Acevedo-Ruiz, 945 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\r\n1991), the issues raised in both the motion and on this appeal are\r\npurely legal, to a large extent repetitive of Basic Controlex's\r\nsummary judgment arguments, and unpersuasive even under a de novo\r\nstandard of review.  We thus reject them on the merits without\r\nfurther exploring what it might mean to manifestly abuse one's\r\ndiscretion in handing down a purely legal ruling.  \r\n                            III.\r\nBasic Controlex's appeal raises three issues: (1) whether\r\nthe statute of limitations began to run as soon as Basic Controlex\r\nknew of KMC's detrimental acts, or only once Basic Controlex's\r\ndissolution caused the agreement to expire; (2) whether Basic\r\nControlex's degree of knowledge was a question for the jury; and\r\n(3) whether the dismissal of Basic Controlex's breach of contract\r\nclaim under the Code was erroneous. \r\n                             A.\r\nAct 75 renders a supplier liable for impairing or\r\nterminating a distribution agreement without \"just cause.\"  P.R.\r\nLaws Ann. tit. 10,  278(d) (1964).  The statute imposes a three-\r\nyear statute of limitations by providing that \"[e]very action\r\narising from this chapter shall prescribe in three years reckoning\r\nfrom the date of the definitive termination of the dealer's\r\ncontract, or of the performing of the detrimental acts, as the case\r\nmay be.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  We strictly construe a statute the\r\nterms of which are clear and unambiguous.  See Pritzker v. Yari, 42\r\nF.3d 53, 68 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nBasic Controlex contends that the statute of limitations\r\non its Act 75 claim did not begin to run until its dissolution as\r\na corporate entity definitively caused its agreement with KMC to\r\nexpire.  But as the district court properly concluded, Basic\r\nControlex had notice of its claim as soon as KMC announced its plan\r\nto use other distributors in 1993.  That announcement constituted\r\nthe \"performing of [a] detrimental act[]\" under Act 75, sufficient\r\nto trigger the statute.\r\n                             B.\r\nWe are similarly unpersuaded that a jury should have\r\nevaluated Basic Controlex's knowledge in 1993 of KMC's detrimental\r\nacts.  A genuine issue of fact exists only if a reasonable jury\r\ncould resolve it in favor of either party.  See Maldonado-Denis v.\r\nCastillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994).  But summary\r\njudgment is appropriate, and a case need not go to the jury, if\r\nevidence for one side is \"merely colorable, or is not significantly\r\nprobative.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50\r\n(1986) (citations omitted).\r\nOn May 3, 1993, KMC expressly informed Basic Controlex of\r\nits intent to use other distributors in alleged violation of the\r\nparties' agreement.  Basic Controlex recognized the detrimental\r\neffect that KMC's conduct would have on their relationship, and on\r\nOctober 28, 1993, Basic Controlex's president responded that the\r\ncompany would suffer \"irreversible damage\" because of KMC's\r\n\"repeated and deliberate acts . . . to unilaterally cancel our\r\nagreement.\"  Although another Basic Controlex officer, Federico\r\nBengoa, tried to present in his deposition a different version of\r\nevents, he eventually acknowledged that the company knew in 1993 of\r\nKMC's intent to impair the agreement.  On this undisputed evidence,\r\nthe district court appropriately concluded, as a matter of law,\r\nthat Basic Controlex knew of KMC's detrimental acts more than three\r\nyears before it filed suit.  See Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957,\r\n960 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\n                             C.\r\nWith respect to Basic Controlex's Code-based contract\r\nclaim, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has made it clear that,\r\nwhen faced with a conflict between provisions in a specific statute\r\n(here, Act 75) and the terms of a general law (here, Article 1864),\r\nthe provisions of the specific statute prevail.  See PaineWebber\r\nInc. v. First Boston (Puerto Rico) Inc., 1994 WL 909748, at *2\r\n(P.R. Offic. Trans. June 30, 1994) (invoking the principle of lex\r\nspecialis derogat lex generali).  Moreover,  the legislature's\r\nintent to preempt general contract principles in enacting Act 75\r\ncannot seriously be questioned:\r\n  The traditional provisions which regulate\r\ncontracts between parties have shown their\r\ninefficacy in protecting the legitimate rights\r\nof the representative or agent, making it thus\r\nnecessary to legislate in order to regulate\r\nthis relationship and guarantee that\r\nmanufacturers act in good faith, fairly, and\r\nnot in an arbitrary manner, and to safeguard\r\nthe rights and justified expectation of the\r\nrepresentatives and agents inherent to the\r\nrelationship. . . . This is a serious\r\nsituation that we intend to remedy with the\r\napproval of this project.\r\nMedina &amp; Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd., 858 F.2d 817, 820\r\n(1st Cir. 1988) (citing the legislative history).  The question\r\nthus becomes whether Act 75 in fact governs Basic Controlex's\r\n\"breach of contract\" claim.  Clearly it does. \r\nA relationship is governed by Act 75 \"irrespective[] of\r\nthe manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute\r\nsuch relationship,\" so long as the parties participate in the\r\nsupply and distribution of merchandise.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, \r\n278(b).  KMC began supplying Basic Controlex with merchandise on an\r\nexclusive basis shortly after they reached their agreement in 1986. \r\nAct 75's statute of limitations therefore applied to the\r\nrelationship between the parties and overrode the limitations\r\nperiod that otherwise might have applied.  See PaineWebber, 1994\r\nWL 909748, at *4 (applying the specific three-year statute of\r\nlimitations in Puerto Rico's Uniform Securities Act over the\r\ngeneral fifteen-year limitations period in Article 1864).\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellee.\n",

For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 28, 1986, KMC and Basic Industries Company, Inc., executed a letter of intent whereby a to-be-formed company, Basic Controlex, would become the exclusive agent to sell KMC products in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Although the letter of intent left open many details that the parties were to negotiate in good faith at a later date, these further negotiations never took place. Nevertheless, both parties acted upon the letter as though it constituted a binding contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 1993, KMC informed Basic Controlex that it intended to sell its products through other distributors in Puerto Rico, \"effective immediately.\" The parties dispute whether KMC actually began to do so. Although Basic Controlex took no immediate legal action in response to this letter, it did write to KMC urging it to abide by its contractual obligations. KMC responded in November 1995 by asking Basic Controlex to agree to a nonexclusive dealing arrangement and to waive any claims that it might have against KMC under either the letter of intent or Puerto Rico law. Basic Controlex refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dwindling sales caused Basic Controlex to dissolve on December 13, 1995 and to sell its assets to Powerline, which assumed Basic Controlex's rights under the letter of intent as a successor-in-interest. On January 7, 1997, the two companies filed this diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging violations of the Puerto Rico Dealers' Act, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278 (1964) (\"Act 75\"), and other provisions of the Puerto Rico Civil Code (\"the Code\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3, 1998, the district court granted summary judgment for KMC on the grounds that Basic Controlex had failed to bring suit within the three-year statute of limitations established by Act 75. The court also concluded that, because Act 75 governed the relationship between the two companies, its three-year statute of limitations superceded the longer limitations period that otherwise would have applied to the breach of contract claim under the Code. Basic Controlex then filed a cryptic Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment which, even generously construed, largely reargued its summary judgment position. The court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As KMC points out in its appellate brief, Basic Controlex's notice of appeal challenged only the district court's denial of the Rule 59(e) motion. While it is true that we review the denial of such a motion only for a \"manifest abuse of discretion,\" Mariani-Giron v. Acevedo-Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568542\"><a href=\"/opinion/568542/william-mariani-giron-v-heriberto-acevedo-ruiz-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1991), the issues raised in both the motion and on this appeal are purely legal, to a large extent repetitive of Basic Controlex's summary judgment arguments, and unpersuasive even under a de novo standard of review. We thus reject them on the merits without further exploring what it might mean to manifestly abuse one's discretion in handing down a purely legal ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basic Controlex's appeal raises three issues: (1) whether the statute of limitations began to run as soon as Basic Controlex knew of KMC's detrimental acts, or only once Basic Controlex's dissolution caused the agreement to expire; (2) whether Basic Controlex's degree of knowledge was a question for the jury; and (3) whether the dismissal of Basic Controlex's breach of contract claim under the Code was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act 75 renders a supplier liable for impairing or terminating a distribution agreement without \"just cause.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278(d) (1964). The statute imposes a three-year statute of limitations by providing that \"[e]very action arising from this chapter shall prescribe in three years reckoning from the date of the definitive termination of the dealer's contract, or of the performing of the detrimental acts, as the case may be.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added). </span>We strictly construe a statute the terms of which are clear and unambiguous. See Pritzker v. Yari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684076\"><a href=\"/opinion/684076/jay-a-pritzker-v-bob-yari/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basic Controlex contends that the statute of limitations on its Act 75 claim did not begin to run until its dissolution as a corporate entity definitively caused its agreement with KMC to expire. But as the district court properly concluded, Basic Controlex had notice of its claim as soon as KMC announced its plan to use other distributors in 1993. That announcement constituted the \"performing of [a] detrimental act[]\" under Act 75, sufficient to trigger the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are similarly unpersuaded that a jury should have evaluated Basic Controlex's knowledge in 1993 of KMC's detrimental acts. A genuine issue of fact exists only if a reasonable jury could resolve it in favor of either party. See Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 581 (1st Cir. 1994). But summary judgment is appropriate, and a case need not go to the jury, if evidence for one side is \"merely colorable, or is not significantly probative.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 249-50 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 1993, KMC expressly informed Basic Controlex of its intent to use other distributors in alleged violation of the parties' agreement. Basic Controlex recognized the detrimental effect that KMC's conduct would have on their relationship, and on October 28, 1993, Basic Controlex's president responded that the company would suffer \"irreversible damage\" because of KMC's \"repeated and deliberate acts... to unilaterally cancel our agreement.\" Although another Basic Controlex officer, Federico Bengoa, tried to present in his deposition a different version of events, he eventually acknowledged that the company knew in 1993 of KMC's intent to impair the agreement. On this undisputed evidence, the district court appropriately concluded, as a matter of law, that Basic Controlex knew of KMC's detrimental acts more than three years before it filed suit. See Cadle Co. v. Hayes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197442\"><a href=\"/opinion/197442/cadle-v-hayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span>, 960 (1st Cir. 1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Basic Controlex's Code-based contract claim, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has made it clear that, when faced with a conflict between provisions in a specific statute (here, Act 75) and the terms of a general law (here, Article 1864), the provisions of the specific statute prevail. See PaineWebber Inc. v. First Boston (Puerto Rico) Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">909748</span></span>, at *2 (P.R. Offic. Trans. June 30, 1994) (invoking the principle of lex specialis derogat lex generali). Moreover, the legislature's intent to preempt general contract principles in enacting Act 75 cannot seriously be questioned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The traditional provisions which regulate contracts between parties have shown their inefficacy in protecting the legitimate rights of the representative or agent, making it thus necessary to legislate in order to regulate this relationship and guarantee that manufacturers act in good faith, fairly, and not in an arbitrary manner, and to safeguard the rights and justified expectation of the representatives and agents inherent to the relationship.... This is a serious situation that we intend to remedy with the approval of this project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina &amp; Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512579\"><a href=\"/opinion/512579/medina-medina-v-country-pride-foods-ltd-medina-medina-v-country/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 820 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing the legislative history). The question thus becomes whether Act 75 in fact governs Basic Controlex's \"breach of contract\" claim. Clearly it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A relationship is governed by Act 75 \"irrespective[] of the manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute such relationship,\" so long as the parties participate in the supply and distribution of merchandise. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278(b). KMC began supplying Basic Controlex with merchandise on an exclusive basis shortly after they reached their agreement in 1986. Act 75's statute of limitations therefore applied to the relationship between the parties and overrode the limitations period that otherwise might have applied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See PaineWebber, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">909748</span></span>, at *4 (applying the specific three-year statute of limitations in Puerto Rico's Uniform Securities Act over the general fifteen-year limitations period in Article 1864).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Basic Industries Company, Inc., was in the process of acquiring Controlex Corporation to form Basic Controlex. Because Powerline Industries Corporation (\"Powerline\") later acquired Basic Controlex's assets, it has joined the suit as well.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Basic Controlex alternatively asks that we certify the question raised in its first appellate issue to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. We decline to do so for two reasons: (1) the statute is unambiguous on this issue; and (2) parties who choose to litigate state law questions in federal court under diversity jurisdiction are presumptively disallowed a second bite at the apple via the certification process. See, e.g., Santiago v. Sherwin-Williams Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628965\"><a href=\"/opinion/628965/monica-santiago-v-sherwin-williams-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 548 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  Basic Controlex also contends that the running of the statute of limitations should have been tolled while KMC tried to convince it that the violation of the agreement was only temporary. See Rodriguez- Suris v. Montesinos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745319\"><a href=\"/opinion/745319/prodliabrep-cch-p-15038-edna-rodriguez-suris-v-bertha-montesinos/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1997) (reversing a grant of summary judgment because there existed genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendant sought to conceal or minimize a plaintiff's cause of action in tort). But as we explained above, Basic Controlex knew of KMC's detrimental acts and recognized their significance, even if KMC tried to downplay them. Once Basic Controlex was put on notice of the injury, the statute of limitations could not have been tolled for further \"subjective appraisal or judgment.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745319\"><a href=\"/opinion/745319/prodliabrep-cch-p-15038-edna-rodriguez-suris-v-bertha-montesinos/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 13.</a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  In light of this conclusion, we need not address whether Basic Controlex's breach of contract claim could have survived summary judgment on the merits.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
