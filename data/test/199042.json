Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Edgar R.

Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Camille Velez-\nRive, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         July 5, 2000\n\f             Per Curiam.   After a thorough review of the record\n\nand    of   the   submissions   of   the    parties,   we   affirm   the\n\ndistrict court’s decision to detain the defendant based on\n\nrisk of flight.\n\n             The evidence proffered by the government showed\n\nthat    appellant    Michael    Cruz   Reyes     (“Cruz”)    possesses\n\nextensive financial resources, and Cruz lied to Pretrial\n\nServices about those resources.            In light of the extent of\n\nthose resources and Cruz’ dishonest statements, the amount\n\nof the bond suggested by Cruz seems woefully inadequate,\n\nespecially where the real estate securing that bond does not\n\nbelong to Cruz.      For a defendant allegedly involved in drug\n\ntrafficking of this magnitude, forfeiture of bond may be\n\n“simply a cost of doing business.”          United States v. Jessup,\n\n757 F.2d 378, 385 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting S.Rep. No. 225,\n\n98th Cong., 1 st Sess. 23-24 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.Code\n\nCong. & Admin. News, pp. 26, 27).\n\n             We find no error in the lower court’s decision to\n\ndiscount the evidence of Cruz’ self-surrender in the instant\n\nmatter, in light of the government’s proffer indicating Cruz\n\nfled from an officer attempting to arrest him in a 1995\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fincident.     Further, the lower court was entitled to reject\n\nCruz’ suggestion that he be placed on electronic monitoring;\n\nwhile increasing the likelihood that flight will be detected\n\n(and thereby deterring flight), electronic monitoring is not\n\nalways effective.           See United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d\n\n810,   815-16       (1 st   Cir.    1990)   (recognizing     that   while\n\nelectronic monitoring acts as a deterrent against flight,\n\ndefendants do escape while being monitored and are never\n\nfound).     We see no error in the lower court’s conclusion\n\nthat in light of all the factors in § 3142(g), electronic\n\nmonitoring      would        be     insufficient    here,     especially\n\nconsidering the financial resources of the defendant, the\n\ninadequate bond offered, and Cruz’ prior false statements.\n\n            Finally, while the witnesses who make up the bulk\n\nof   the   government’s       case    against   Cruz   are   cooperating\n\nwitnesses, and therefore are more vulnerable to impeachment\n\nattempts, we find no error in the lower court’s reliance on\n\nthat evidence, see 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(2), especially since\n\nmore   than   one     witness      apparently   identifies   Cruz   as   a\n\nsignificant actor in the charged conspiracy.\n\n            Affirmed.        1st Cir.
