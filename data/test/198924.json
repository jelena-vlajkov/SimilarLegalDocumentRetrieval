After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.    By appellant’s own admissions, he used a firearm “in\n\nconnection with” his efforts to collect a debt owed to crack\n\ndealers    he    had    allowed   to    use   his       apartment.    These\n\nadmissions      provided      ample    evidence     to    establish    by   a\n\npreponderance      of   the    evidence   that      a    drug   distribution\n\nconspiracy existed, that Marley had aided and abetted that\n\nconspiracy by attempting to collect money owed for drugs,\n\nand that he sought by use of the shotgun to ensure his\n\ncollection efforts would not be thwarted.                 See United States\n\nv.

Thus, we see no error in the sentencing court’s\n\napplication of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(d)(5) for appellant’s use of\n\na firearm “in connection with another felony offense.”\n\n            Affirmed.      1st Cir.
