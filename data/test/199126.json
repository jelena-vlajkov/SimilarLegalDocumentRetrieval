Sanchez Maceira, by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Jacabed Rodriguez-Coss, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E.\nVega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        October 11, 2000\n\f\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.              On April 10, 1997, a federal\n\ngrand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned a\n\nthree-count indictment against a number of individuals.                          In\n\nCount   2   of    the    indictment,     the    grand    jury    charged    several\n\npersons, including Luis A. Hernández Vega (Hernández), with\n\nconspiring to distribute controlled substances in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 846.           Following a five-week trial, a petit jury\n\nfound     Hernández      guilty     as   charged.         The    district     court\n\nthereafter sentenced Hernández to serve 235 months in prison.\n\nHernández appeals.1          Having carefully reviewed the record, we\n\naffirm.\n\n            On     appeal,       Hernández's     basic    argument    entails     a\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.                   In particular, he\n\nasseverates that the government's proof failed to show that he\n\nwas privy to the conspiracy.             This challenge invokes a familiar\n\nstandard of review:              when evaluating the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence presented against a defendant in a criminal case, an\n\nappellate        court    must     \"canvass     the     evidence    (direct     and\n\ncircumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution\n\n\n\n    1 Hernández stood trial with eight codefendants (all of whom\nwere found guilty), and we consolidated all nine appeals. Seven\nof them, including this one, were argued together on September\n14, 2000.   The other two were submitted on the briefs to the\nsame panel.    Because this appeal raises issues peculiar to\nHernández, we have chosen to decide it in a separate opinion.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fand    decide    whether   that        evidence,    including       all    plausible\n\ninferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder\n\nto    conclude    beyond     a    reasonable       doubt   that     the    defendant\n\ncommitted the charged crime.\"              United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d\n\n490, 494 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           A     defendant       may    culpably    join     a    drug-trafficking\n\nconspiracy without knowing the full extent of the enterprise or\n\nthe identities of all the coconspirators.                  See United States v.\n\nRivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989).                              The\n\ncontrolling statute is 21 U.S.C. § 846.                To convict a defendant\n\nof violating section 846, the government must \"show beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed and that a particular\n\ndefendant agreed to participate in it, intending to commit the\n\nunderlying substantive offense.\"               United States v. Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d   1161,     1173   (1st     Cir.    1993);     accord       United   States    v.\n\nMarréro-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 772 (1st Cir. 1998).                         In proving\n\nthe agreement, however, \"[t]here are no particular formalities.\"\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1173.             Conspiratorial agreements may take\n\na wide variety of forms.               Moreover, they        \"may be express or\n\ntacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\"\n\nId.    It follows logically that the conspiracy's existence, and\n\na particular defendant's membership in it, may be inferred from\n\nthe participants' \"words and actions and the interdependence of\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\factivities and persons involved.\"          United States v. Boylan, 898\n\nF.2d 230, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the appellant's\n\nprincipal assignment of error.           Hernández concedes, as he must,\n\nthat the government proved the existence of a large, long-\n\nlasting conspiracy to peddle various controlled substances.              The\n\nquestion, then, is whether the government proved that he agreed\n\nto join it.      We conclude that this question must be answered\n\naffirmatively.\n\n            At   trial,      the   government    adduced     evidence   that\n\nHernández sold contraband at \"drug points\" operated by the\n\nconspiracy and that he was entrusted with the safekeeping of\n\nfirearms used by the gang in the murders of rival drug dealers.\n\nStanding alone, this evidence likely would suffice to undergird\n\nhis conviction.       See, e.g., Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d at 1079\n\n(holding that \"[t]he fact that [the defendant] participated in\n\none retail link of the distribution chain, knowing that it\n\nextended    beyond    his    individual     role,   [is]   sufficient\"    to\n\ndemonstrate his membership in a drug-trafficking conspiracy).\n\nHere,   however,     the    government   also   introduced    more   damning\n\nevidence:    testimony from a percipient witness who stated that\n\nHernández would \"settle out\" dealers, that is,             he would come to\n\na drug point, count the receipts collected by the ring's retail\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fvendors at that drug point, allow each vendor to keep his or her\n\nagreed remuneration, and ensure that the remainder of the funds\n\nwas remitted to the ringleaders.               This level of involvement\n\nplainly sufficed to sustain the challenged conviction.\n\n            The appellant seeks to deflect the force of this proof\n\nby   assailing     its   source.      This   translates     into    an   all-out\n\nassault on the credibility of the government's witnesses.                   This\n\nline of attack is forcefully mounted, but it does not avail the\n\nappellant.    In passing upon challenges to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence,    we    are   bound   to   refrain      from   making    independent\n\njudgments as to the credibility of witnesses.                     See Noah, 130\n\nF.3d at 494; United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).        We recently summed up this principle in United\n\nStates v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480 (1st Cir. 2000), in which we\n\nwrote that \"[e]xcept in the most unusual circumstances . . .\n\ncredibility       determinations      are    for   the    jury,    not   for   an\n\nappellate court.\"         Id. at 483.         This case comes within the\n\ngeneral rule, not the long-odds exception to it.                         And the\n\nappellant's effort to highlight the trial testimony of other\n\n(more favorable) witnesses suffers from the same infirmity.\n\n            The short of it is that the evidence introduced at\n\ntrial, taken in the light most congenial to the government's\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ftheory of the case, sufficed to ground a conviction.                      No more\n\nwas exigible.\n\n          The    appellant     puts      a    twist   on    his   insufficiency\n\nchallenge, arguing that he was tried and convicted on the wrong\n\ncharge.    As he sees it, the evidence shows at most that he\n\nassisted only after the conspiracy was up and running (that is,\n\nonly   after   the     agreement   to    distribute        narcotics   had   been\n\nforged) and that, therefore, \"he cannot be charged with aiding\n\nand abetting a conspiracy because, when the drug conspirators\n\nagreed to [commit] one of the specified offenses . . ., all the\n\nelements of 21 U.S.C. § 846 had been met.\"                   Appellant's Reply\n\nBrief at 7.      Hernández suggests, instead, that he should have\n\nbeen   charged    as    an   accessory        after   the    fact   and    not   a\n\ncoconspirator.       This argument is disingenuous.\n\n          To be sure, an agreement to commit the substantive\n\noffense is an essential element of a conspiracy charge.                       See\n\nUnited States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\nEcheverri, 982 F.2d at 679.         But whether or not a defendant is\n\nprivy to the scheme at its commencement is not determinative of\n\nhis guilt.     To the contrary, the law is settled that a defendant\n\ncannot \"escape criminal responsibility on the grounds that he\n\ndid not join the conspiracy until well after its inception.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fUnited States v. Pool, 660 F.2d 547, 560 (5th Cir. 1981).     Judge\n\nAldrich captured the essence of this point in memorable prose:\n\n          [A] conspiracy is like a train.       When a\n          party knowingly steps aboard, he is part of\n          the   crew,   and   assumes    conspirator's\n          responsibility for the existing freight — or\n          conduct — regardless of whether he is aware\n          of just what it is composed.\n\nUnited States v. Baines, 812 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 1987).     Here,\n\nthe jury had before it evidence from which it reasonably could\n\ninfer beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant knew of the\n\nconspiratorial plan, shared the coconspirators' common purpose,\n\nand acted to further that plan and purpose.      On that basis, he\n\nwas properly charged with, and lawfully convicted of, a section\n\n846 conspiracy.\n\n          The appellant has one more arrow in his quiver — but\n\nit will not fly.    He attempts in conclusory fashion to adopt\n\n\"the discussion and arguments set forth\" by his codefendants.\n\nAppellant's Brief at 3.      We need not linger long over this\n\nfeeble effort.\n\n          In general, appellants prosecuting consolidated appeals\n\nmay adopt each other's arguments.       See Fed. R. App. P. 28(i).\n\nBut   arguments    adopted   by    reference   \"must   be   readily\n\ntransferrable from the proponent's case to the adopter's case.\"\n\nUnited States v.   David, 940 F.2d 722, 737 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nThus, to free-ride on another appellant's issue, a party has a\n\n                                  -8-\n\fburden to show that he is in the same legal and factual position\n\nas the proponent vis-à-vis the issue, or, at least, to show how\n\nthe issue relates to his situation.          See, e.g., United States v.\n\nCastro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 982 (1st Cir. 1992); David, 940 F.2d\n\nat 737; United States v.          Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   In this instance, Hernández has not made the slightest\n\neffort   to   show   that   the   arguments     he   seeks    to   adopt   are\n\napplicable to him (or if so, how they pertain).              Hence, we treat\n\nhis perfunctory attempt at adoption as insufficient to put those\n\nissues in play.      See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n            We need go no further.          We conclude, without serious\n\nquestion,     that   the   evidence   presented,     when    viewed   in   the\n\nrequisite light, supports the jury's conclusion.              Consequently,\n\nthe appellant's conviction must be\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Hernández concedes, as he must,\n\nthat the government proved the existence of a large, long-\n\nlasting conspiracy to peddle various controlled substances.              The\n\nquestion, then, is whether the government proved that he agreed\n\nto join it.      We conclude that this question must be answered\n\naffirmatively.\n\n            At   trial,      the   government    adduced     evidence   that\n\nHernández sold contraband at \"drug points\" operated by the\n\nconspiracy and that he was entrusted with the safekeeping of\n\nfirearms used by the gang in the murders of rival drug dealers.\n\nStanding alone, this evidence likely would suffice to undergird\n\nhis conviction.       See, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521900\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera-Santiago,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/521900/united-states-v-antonio-rivera-santiago-aka-junior-vivique-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1079</span>\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(holding that \"[t]he fact that [the defendant] participated in\n\none retail link of the distribution chain, knowing that it\n\nextended    beyond    his    individual     role,   [is]   sufficient\"    to\n\ndemonstrate his membership in a drug-trafficking conspiracy).\n\nHere,   however,     the    government   also   introduced    more   damning\n\nevidence:    testimony from a percipient witness who stated that\n\nHernández would \"settle out\" dealers, that is,             he would come to\n\na drug point, count the receipts collected by the ring's retail\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fvendors at that drug point, allow each vendor to keep his or her\n\nagreed remuneration, and ensure that the remainder of the funds\n\nwas remitted to the ringleaders.               This level of involvement\n\nplainly sufficed to sustain the challenged conviction.\n\n            The appellant seeks to deflect the force of this proof\n\nby   assailing     its   source.      This   translates     into    an   all-out\n\nassault on the credibility of the government's witnesses.                   This\n\nline of attack is forcefully mounted, but it does not avail the\n\nappellant.    In passing upon challenges to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence,    we    are   bound   to   refrain      from   making    independent\n\njudgments as to the credibility of witnesses.

And the\n\nappellant's effort to highlight the trial testimony of other\n\n(more favorable) witnesses suffers from the same infirmity.\n\n            The short of it is that the evidence introduced at\n\ntrial, taken in the light most congenial to the government's\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ftheory of the case, sufficed to ground a conviction.                      No more\n\nwas exigible.\n\n          The    appellant     puts      a    twist   on    his   insufficiency\n\nchallenge, arguing that he was tried and convicted on the wrong\n\ncharge.    As he sees it, the evidence shows at most that he\n\nassisted only after the conspiracy was up and running (that is,\n\nonly   after   the     agreement   to    distribute        narcotics   had   been\n\nforged) and that, therefore, \"he cannot be charged with aiding\n\nand abetting a conspiracy because, when the drug conspirators\n\nagreed to [commit] one of the specified offenses . . ., all the\n\nelements of 21 U.S.C. § 846 had been met.\"                   Appellant's Reply\n\nBrief at 7.      Hernández suggests, instead, that he should have\n\nbeen   charged    as    an   accessory        after   the    fact   and    not   a\n\ncoconspirator.       This argument is disingenuous.\n\n          To be sure, an agreement to commit the substantive\n\noffense is an essential element of a conspiracy charge.                       See\n\nUnited States v.

But whether or not a defendant is\n\nprivy to the scheme at its commencement is not determinative of\n\nhis guilt.     To the contrary, the law is settled that a defendant\n\ncannot \"escape criminal responsibility on the grounds that he\n\ndid not join the conspiracy until well after its inception.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fUnited States v.

Here,\n\nthe jury had before it evidence from which it reasonably could\n\ninfer beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant knew of the\n\nconspiratorial plan, shared the coconspirators' common purpose,\n\nand acted to further that plan and purpose.      On that basis, he\n\nwas properly charged with, and lawfully convicted of, a section\n\n846 conspiracy.\n\n          The appellant has one more arrow in his quiver — but\n\nit will not fly.    He attempts in conclusory fashion to adopt\n\n\"the discussion and arguments set forth\" by his codefendants.\n\nAppellant's Brief at 3.      We need not linger long over this\n\nfeeble effort.\n\n          In general, appellants prosecuting consolidated appeals\n\nmay adopt each other's arguments.       See Fed. R.
