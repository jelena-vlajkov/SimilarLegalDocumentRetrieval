Loh with whom Marcigliano &amp; Campise was on brief for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nJanuary 24, 2000\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This marine insurance case, which\r\nturns on the meaning of an exclusion for \"discoloration and\r\ncorrosion,\" begins with an ocean shipment made in December 1995. \r\nAt that time, the plaintiff-appellant, Central International\r\nCompany (\"Central\")--a trading company doing business in\r\nMassachusetts--arranged for the transportation of galvanized steel\r\ncoils from Aviles, Spain, to a customer in St. Vincent, West\r\nIndies, aboard the M/V Andrealon.  The shipment was insured under\r\nan \"all risk\" ocean marine open cargo insurance policy previously\r\nissued to Central by the principal defendant-appellee, American\r\nMotorists Insurance Company (\"AMICO\").  The policy was not limited\r\neither to this shipment or to steel products.\r\nThe vessel in question encountered heavy seas en route to\r\nSt. Vincent, resulting in damage to the vessel and its hatches.  It\r\nis apparently undisputed that the steel coils in question were in\r\ngood condition when shipped but arrived in damaged condition.  The\r\nlaboratory analyses conducted on the damaged cargo showed that the\r\ncoils were \"severely corroded\" and displayed a variety of light and\r\ndark stains.  The initial direct loss, independent of consequential\r\ndamages, was estimated by Central at several hundred thousand\r\ndollars.\r\nCentral then brought suit on its insurance policy in a\r\nMassachusetts trial court seeking approximately $221,000 in damages\r\nto the coils plus additional related expenses.  For simplicity, we\r\ntreat AMICO as the only defendant.  AMICO removed the case to\r\nfederal district court on the ground that it fell within that\r\ncourt's admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1333(1). \r\nIn due course, both sides moved for summary judgment.  In April\r\n1999, the district court filed a decision granting AMICO's motion\r\nfor summary judgment and ordering dismissal of the complaint.\r\nThe district court pointed out that the policy covered\r\nall risks of \"physical loss or damage [to the cargo] from any\r\nexternal cause\" but was subject to a specific exclusion:\r\n  However, as respects steel products and all\r\nmetals:  excluding rusting, oxidation,\r\ndiscoloration and corrosion; also excluding\r\nbending, twisting, crimping, and end damage.\r\n\nSince corrosion and discoloration were the admitted damage, the\r\ndistrict court found that the policy exclusion applied.  The court\r\nrejected Central's effort to avoid the exclusion by saying that the\r\ncorrosion and discoloration had not occurred naturally but had been\r\nprimarily caused by water and by the improper stowage of powder\r\nash, which had allegedly leaked onto the steel coils during the\r\nstorm or otherwise.  Central now appeals.\r\nOur review of a summary judgment is de novo, EEOC v.\r\nGreen, 76 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 1996), and we begin with the choice\r\nof law.  Suits on maritime insurance policies are classic examples\r\nof matters within federal maritime jurisdiction, see Gilmore &amp;\r\nBlack, The Law of Admiralty  1-10, at 22 n.71 (2d ed. 1975)\r\n(citing Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 1 (1871)). \r\nAccordingly, Central's brief says that such contracts are \"subject\r\nto general admiralty law when there is an established federal rule\r\nand by state law when there is not.\"  AMICO purports to agree but\r\nsays that there is enough federal precedent in analogous cases to\r\nmake Massachusetts law irrelevant.\r\nBeneath this surface agreement on general principles lies\r\nan abyss of confusion.  One might think that construing a maritime\r\ninsurance policy, in relation to damage occurring on the high seas,\r\nwould be a paradigm case for a uniform body of federal law, see\r\nGilmore &amp; Black, supra,  1-17, at 49.  But the tensions in Supreme\r\nCourt precedents are legendary, both with regard to the reach of\r\nstate law in federal maritime law generally and its effect on cases\r\ninitially brought in state court under the saving to suitors\r\nclause.  Since Massachusetts law in the end is no better for\r\nCentral than any federal precedent cited to us, we (like the\r\ndistrict court) need not pursue the matter.\r\nTurning to the merits, Central must accept in light of\r\nits own affidavits that the harm to the steel coils manifested\r\nitself as corrosion and discoloration.  Conversely, at least for\r\npurposes of this appeal, we must assume the truth of Central's\r\nclaim that the anterior cause of the corrosion and discoloration\r\nwas the exposure of the steel to improperly stowed powder ash as\r\nwell as to sea water and that unexpected storm conditions at sea\r\ncontributed to that exposure.  See Green, 76 F.3d at 21.  The case\r\nthus involves a generally covered risk (actually, two risks:  sea\r\nperil and negligent stowage) resulting in excluded consequences\r\n(corrosion and discoloration).\r\nThis is a recurring issue and, under ordinary principles\r\nof contract interpretation, there is little doubt that the\r\nexclusion is presumptively a qualification on the risk coverage. \r\nNormally, specific language is treated as a limitation on general\r\nlanguage; and in this case fixing the relationship of the two\r\nclauses is made even easier because the all-risk language in\r\nCentral's policy is followed by the term \"[h]owever,\" which\r\nintroduces the exclusion.  In other words, facially read, there is\r\nliability for damage to cargo from all risks including storm or\r\naccident unless the damage is corrosion or discoloration.  \r\nCuriously, this straightforward approach is not always\r\nreflected in the cases.  There is language, in Massachusetts\r\ndecisions as elsewhere, that purports to treat a covered risk and\r\nan excluded consequence as legitimate rivals whose priorities are\r\nto be tested by asking questions about \"causation\"; these\r\ndiscussions, often in opinions with defensible results, tend not to\r\nbe very illuminating.  See Keeton &amp; Widiss, Insurance Law  5.5(c),\r\n(d) (Practitioner's ed. 1988).  The better explanation, where the\r\ninsurer is held liable, appears to be that the court has chosen to\r\nread the exclusion in context more narrowly than its literal\r\nlanguage might suggest.\r\nA good example in Massachusetts is Standard Elec. Supply\r\nCo. v. Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 307 N.E.2d 11 (1973),\r\nwhere water from a burst pipe leaked into and damaged the basement\r\nof an adjoining building; the policy on the latter building\r\ngenerally covered physical damage but specifically excluded water\r\ndamage in various specified forms (e.g., flood, underground\r\nseepage).  Yet recovery was allowed, seemingly because the court\r\nthought the exclusion in context was directed at natural flooding\r\nor seepage and not that resulting from an accidentally burst pipe. \r\n307 N.E.2d at 12-13.  What is confusing is the court's reliance,\r\nlater in the opinion, on an alleged \"well established principle\"\r\nthat recovery is allowed \"where the insured risk [caused] . . . an\r\nexcepted risk.\"  Id. at 13.\r\nThe smattering of authority for this \"well-established\"\r\nprinciple is not very impressive, see, e.g., 5 Appleman &amp; Appleman,\r\nInsurance Law and Practice  3083, at 311 (1970) (discussing fire\r\ninsurance), and the cases usually--but perhaps not always, see\r\nJussim v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., 610 N.E.2d 954, 955-58 (Mass.\r\n1993)--can be better explained as a limiting construction of the\r\nexclusion.  The attempt to give priority to the initial covered\r\ncause in the \"train of events\" over the excluded consequence is\r\ndoubtful in principle even where the covered risk is narrowly\r\ndefined (e.g., fire), but it becomes absurd where the initial\r\ncoverage is all risk, since every excluded harm has some cause.\r\nStill, there is nothing wrong with reading policy\r\nlanguage more narrowly (or broadly) than its literal wording might\r\nat first suggest where this better captures the reasonable\r\nexpectation of the parties--the central object of all contract\r\ninterpretation.  See 1 Corbin, Contracts, supra,  1.1, at 2; see\r\nalso Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., 7 F.3d 1047,\r\n1052 (1st Cir. 1993).  Courts have made such adjustments on a range\r\nof bases, including not only surrounding language or other specific\r\nevidence of the parties' intent but also--to a surprising extent--\r\nthe common-sense intuition of judges as to what the parties likely\r\nhad in mind.  Although the readings often favor the insured,\r\nimplied exceptions to coverage are not unknown.  See Keeton &amp;\r\nWidiss, supra,  5.3(a), (c).\r\nIn this case, Central does make a pair of colorable\r\narguments for a narrowing interpretation of the exclusion.  The\r\nfirst is that the exclusion should apply only to naturally\r\noccurring corrosion or discoloration, say, as a result of exposure\r\nto salt air, and not to that produced by a fortuitous event like\r\nstorm exposure or negligent stowage of adjacent cargo.  This is not\r\nan impossible interpretation, cf. Standard, 307 N.E.2d at 12-13--an\r\ninsurer might specially wish to prevent such liability for natural\r\ncorrosion--but, of course, there is nothing in the policy to\r\nsuggest such a limitation, and at least two further arguments exist\r\nagainst it.\r\n One is that some authority exists for excluding natural\r\ndeterioration of shipped goods from coverage without a specific\r\nexclusion, see Keeton &amp; Widiss, supra,  5.3(c), which would make\r\nthe express exclusion from corrosion redundant if it were read so\r\nnarrowly.  The other is that the full exclusion in this policy\r\nincludes some excluded harms (e.g., bending of the steel) that\r\ncould rarely occur \"naturally\" in a voyage, so Central's argument\r\nimplies that one part of the exclusion is subject to an implicit\r\nlimitation that could not be applied to the other part--hardly a\r\nnatural reading.\r\nCentral's other argument for coverage is that unless the\r\nexclusion were read narrowly, the protection offered for steel\r\nshipments would be empty; its premise is that the only foreseeable\r\ndamage to steel on a sea voyage would be discoloration, corrosion\r\nor some form of physical distortion covered by the above-quoted\r\n\"bending\" clause of the exclusion.  We agree that a reading of a\r\npolicy that entirely nullified meaningful protection would raise\r\ndoubts that the parties intended that reading.  E.g., Titan Indem.\r\nCo. v. Newton, 39 F. Supp. 2d 1336, 1344-45 (N.D. Ala. 1999);\r\nEmployers Mut. Cas. Co. v. Pires, 723 A.2d 295, 298 (R.I. 1999).\r\nYet it is not true that all maritime loss as to steel\r\nwould trigger the literal language of the exclusion; if the ship\r\nsank in deep water, the inability to recover the cargo would create\r\na covered loss without regard to any corrosion or discoloration\r\nthat might ensue.  Further, this policy was \"open,\" embracing\r\nvarious kinds of cargo that Central might ship on different\r\nvoyages; the failure to provide much protection for steel did not\r\nrender the policy generally useless.  And it appears from the\r\npolicy that the exclusion could have been modified, although\r\nperhaps not to provide unlimited coverage for steel, by payment of\r\na higher premium.\r\nAs for case law, neither side has cited us to maritime\r\nlaw cases that are closely in point, but there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that on this issue maritime law would differ from the\r\nordinary application of contract rules customarily applied by state\r\ncourts in insurance cases.  However, Massachusetts case law does\r\noffer a number of examples, including the burst pipe case described\r\nabove, which are somewhat helpful to Central--even beyond their\r\nsupport for the view (with which we agree) that the presumptive\r\nliteral reading is not always the one that prevails.\r\nBut the precedent most closely in point from\r\nMassachusetts--whose law Central wants to govern this case--cuts\r\nthe opposite way.  In Bettigole v. American Employers Insurance\r\nCo., 567 N.E.2d 1259 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991) (Kaplan, J.), the Court\r\nheld that an insurance policy exclusion for \"corrosion\" negated\r\ncoverage where the supporting steel in a parking facility\r\ndeteriorated after exposure to ice, water and de-icing salts\r\ncarried in by cars, id. at 272-73; the court rejected the insured's\r\nclaim that the true \"cause\" was the \"release of chloride ions,\r\nwhich was not named as an excluded risk, with the corrosion\r\nfollowing as a consequence,\" id. at 275.\r\nWe cite Bettigole primarily because its facts are apt and\r\nnot because we attach conclusive weight to Massachusetts case law\r\nconstruing a particular policy.  The Supreme Court's intermittent\r\nresort to state law to resolve maritime law issues usually involves\r\nnot random state-law precedents but something closer to an\r\naffirmative state policy, typically in cases involving local\r\nmaritime matters (e.g., coastal or inland waterways).  Gilmore &amp;\r\nBlack, supra,  1-17.  Thus, there may be no compulsion here to\r\ntreat state precedent as binding rather than merely instructive,\r\ncf. Southworth Mach. v. F/V Corey Pride, 994 F.2d 37, 41 (1st Cir.\r\n1993), but Bettigole is certainly instructive.\r\nCentral has also sought review of the district court's\r\nrefusal to allow Central leave to amend in order to add a very\r\nlarge claim for consequential damages over and above the value of\r\nthe coils.  Since we affirm the district court's reading of the\r\nexclusion, such an amendment would be futile; whether or not\r\nconsequential damages are consistent with maritime law, they can\r\nhardly be awarded under this policy to offset the further\r\nconsequences of an expressly excluded loss.\r\nThe judgment is affirmed.  AMICO's motion for damages and\r\ndouble costs is denied.\n",

The other is that the full exclusion in this policy includes some excluded harms (e.g., bending of the steel) that could rarely occur \"naturally\" in a voyage, so Central's argument implies that one part of the exclusion is subject to an implicit limitation that could not be applied to the other part--hardly a natural reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central's other argument for coverage is that unless the exclusion were read narrowly, the protection offered for steel shipments would be empty; its premise is that the only foreseeable damage to steel on a sea voyage would be discoloration, corrosion or some form of physical distortion covered by the above-quoted \"bending\" clause of the exclusion. We agree that a reading of a policy that entirely nullified meaningful protection would raise doubts that the parties intended that reading. E.g., Titan Indem. Co. v. Newton, 39 F. Supp. 2d 1336, 1344-45 (N.D. Ala. 1999); Employers Mut. Cas. Co. v. Pires, 723 A.2d 295, 298 (R.I. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet it is not true that all maritime loss as to steel would trigger the literal language of the exclusion; if the ship sank in deep water, the inability to recover the cargo would create a covered loss without regard to any corrosion or discoloration that might ensue. Further, this policy was \"open,\" embracing various kinds of cargo that Central might ship on different voyages; the failure to provide much protection for steel did not render the policy generally useless. And it appears from the policy that the exclusion could have been modified, although perhaps not to provide unlimited coverage for steel, by payment of a higher premium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for case law, neither side has cited us to maritime law cases that are closely in point, but there is no reason to believe that on this issue maritime law would differ from the ordinary application of contract rules customarily applied by state courts in insurance cases. However, Massachusetts case law does offer a number of examples, including the burst pipe case described above, which are somewhat helpful to Central--even beyond their support for the view (with which we agree) that the presumptive literal reading is not always the one that prevails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the precedent most closely in point from Massachusetts--whose law Central wants to govern this case--cuts the opposite way. In Bettigole v. American Employers Insurance Co., 567 N.E.2d 1259 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991) (Kaplan, J.), the Court held that an insurance policy exclusion for \"corrosion\" negated coverage where the supporting steel in a parking facility deteriorated after exposure to ice, water and de-icing salts carried in by cars, id. at 272-73; the court rejected the insured's claim that the true \"cause\" was the \"release of chloride ions, which was not named as an excluded risk, with the corrosion following as a consequence,\" id. at 275, 567 N.E.2d 1259.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cite Bettigole primarily because its facts are apt and not because we attach conclusive weight to Massachusetts case law construing a particular policy. The Supreme Court's intermittent resort to state law to resolve maritime law issues usually involves not random state-law precedents but something closer to an affirmative state policy, typically in cases involving local maritime matters (e.g., coastal or inland waterways). Gilmore &amp; Black, supra, &#167; 1-17. Thus, there may be no compulsion here to treat state precedent as binding rather than merely instructive, cf. Southworth Mach. v. F/V Corey Pride, 994 F.2d 37, 41 (1st Cir. 1993), but Bettigole is certainly instructive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central has also sought review of the district court's refusal to allow Central leave to amend in order to add a very large claim for consequential damages over and above the value of the coils. Since we affirm the district court's reading of the exclusion, such an amendment would be futile; whether or not consequential damages are consistent with maritime law, they can hardly be awarded under this policy to offset the further consequences of an expressly excluded loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed.

At that time, the plaintiff-appellant, Central International Company (\"Central\")--a trading company doing business in Massachusetts--arranged for the transportation of galvanized steel coils from Aviles, Spain, to a customer in St. Vincent, West Indies, aboard the M/V Andrealon. The shipment was insured under an \"all risk\" ocean marine open cargo insurance policy previously issued to Central by the principal defendant-appellee, American Motorists Insurance Company (\"AMICO\"). The policy was not limited either to this shipment or to steel products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vessel in question encountered heavy seas en route to St. Vincent, resulting in damage to the vessel and its hatches. It is apparently undisputed that the steel coils in question were in good condition when shipped but arrived in damaged condition. The laboratory analyses conducted on the damaged cargo showed that the coils were \"severely corroded\" and displayed a variety of light and dark stains. The initial direct loss, independent of consequential damages, was estimated by Central at several hundred thousand dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central then brought suit on its insurance policy in a Massachusetts trial court seeking approximately $221,000 in damages to the coils plus additional related expenses. For simplicity, we treat AMICO as the only defendant. AMICO removed the case to federal district court on the ground that it fell within that court's admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(1). In due course, both sides moved for summary judgment. In April 1999, the district court filed a decision granting AMICO's motion for summary judgment and ordering dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court pointed out that the policy covered all risks of \"physical loss or damage [to the cargo] from any external cause\" but was subject to a specific exclusion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as respects steel products and all metals: excluding rusting, oxidation, discoloration and corrosion; also excluding bending, twisting, crimping, and end damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since corrosion and discoloration were the admitted damage, the district court found that the policy exclusion applied. The court rejected Central's effort to avoid the exclusion by saying that the corrosion and discoloration had not occurred naturally but had been primarily caused by water and by the improper stowage of powder ash, which had allegedly leaked onto the steel coils during the storm or otherwise. Central now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a summary judgment is de novo, EEOC v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712246\"><a href=\"/opinion/712246/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-88-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43900-equal/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 1996), and we begin with the choice of law. Suits on maritime insurance policies are classic examples of matters within federal maritime jurisdiction, see Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty &#167; 1-10, at 22 n.71 (2d ed. 1975) (citing Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 1 (1871)). Accordingly, Central's brief says that such contracts are \"subject to general admiralty law when there is an established federal rule and by state law when there is not.\" AMICO purports to agree but says that there is enough federal precedent in analogous cases to make Massachusetts law irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beneath this surface agreement on general principles lies an abyss of confusion. One might think that construing a maritime insurance policy, in relation to damage occurring on the high seas, would be a paradigm case for a uniform body of federal law, see Gilmore &amp; Black, supra, &#167; 1-17, at 49. But the tensions in Supreme Court precedents are legendary, both with regard to the reach of state law in federal maritime law generally and its effect on cases initially brought in state court under the saving to suitors clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Since Massachusetts law in the end is no better for Central than any federal precedent cited to us, we (like the district court) need not pursue the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, Central must accept in light of its own affidavits that the harm to the steel coils manifested itself as corrosion and discoloration. Conversely, at least for purposes of this appeal, we must assume the truth of Central's claim that the anterior cause of the corrosion and discoloration was the exposure of the steel to improperly stowed powder ash as well as to sea water and that unexpected storm conditions at sea contributed to that exposure. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712246\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Green,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/712246/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-88-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43900-equal/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>. The case thus involves a generally covered risk (actually, two risks: sea peril and negligent stowage) resulting in excluded consequences (corrosion and discoloration).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a recurring issue and, under ordinary principles of contract interpretation, there is little doubt that the exclusion is presumptively a qualification on the risk coverage. Normally, specific language is treated as a limitation on general language;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and in this case fixing the relationship of the two clauses is made even easier because the all-risk language in Central's policy is followed by the term \"[h]owever,\" which introduces the exclusion. In other words, facially read, there is liability for damage to cargo from all risks including storm or accident unless the damage is corrosion or discoloration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curiously, this straightforward approach is not always reflected in the cases. There is language, in Massachusetts decisions as elsewhere,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that purports to treat a covered risk and an excluded consequence as legitimate rivals whose priorities are to be tested by asking questions about \"causation\"; these discussions, often in opinions with defensible results, tend not to be very illuminating. See Keeton &amp; Widiss, Insurance Law &#167; 5.5(c), (d) (Practitioner's ed. 1988). The better explanation, where the insurer is held liable, appears to be that the court has chosen to read the exclusion in context more narrowly than its literal language might suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A good example in Massachusetts is Standard Elec. Supply Co. v. Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span> </span>(1973), where water from a burst pipe leaked into and damaged the basement of an adjoining building; the policy on the latter building generally covered physical damage but specifically excluded water damage in various specified forms (e.g., flood, underground seepage). Yet recovery was allowed, seemingly because the court thought the exclusion in context was directed at natural flooding or seepage and not that resulting from an accidentally burst <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">pipe.</span> <span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12-13</span></span>. What is confusing is the court's reliance, later in the opinion, on an alleged \"well established principle\" that recovery is allowed \"where the insured risk [caused]... an excepted risk.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 13.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The smattering of authority for this \"well-established\" principle is not very impressive, see, e.g., 5 Appleman &amp; Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice &#167; 3083, at 311 (1970) (discussing fire insurance), and the cases usually--but perhaps not always, see Jussim v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></span>, 955-58 (Mass. 1993)--can be better explained as a limiting construction of the exclusion. The attempt to give priority to the initial covered cause in the \"train of events\" over the excluded consequence is doubtful in principle even where the covered risk is narrowly defined (e.g., fire), but it becomes absurd where the initial coverage is all risk, since every excluded harm has some cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, there is nothing wrong with reading policy language more narrowly (or broadly) than its literal wording might at first suggest where this better captures the reasonable expectation of the parties--the central object of all contract interpretation. See 1 Corbin, Contracts, supra, &#167; 1.1, at 2; see also Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655503\"><a href=\"/opinion/655503/commercial-union-insurance-co-v-walbrook-insurance-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span>, 1052 (1st Cir. 1993). Courts have made such adjustments on a range of bases, including not only surrounding language or other specific evidence of the parties' intent but also--to a surprising extent--the common-sense intuition of judges as to what the parties likely had in mind. Although the readings often favor the insured, implied exceptions to coverage are not unknown. See Keeton &amp; Widiss, supra, &#167; 5.3(a), (c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Central does make a pair of colorable arguments for a narrowing interpretation of the exclusion. The first is that the exclusion should apply only to naturally occurring corrosion or discoloration, say, as a result of exposure to salt air, and not to that produced by a fortuitous event like storm exposure or negligent stowage of adjacent cargo. This is not an impossible interpretation, cf. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Standard,</span> <span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12-13</span></span>--an insurer might specially wish to prevent such liability for natural corrosion--but, of course, there is nothing in the policy to suggest such a limitation, and at least two further arguments exist against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One is that some authority exists for excluding natural deterioration of shipped goods from coverage without a specific exclusion, see Keeton &amp; Widiss, supra, &#167; 5.3(c), which would make the express exclusion from corrosion redundant if it were read so narrowly. The other is that the full exclusion in this policy includes some excluded harms (e.g., bending of the steel) that could rarely occur \"naturally\" in a voyage, so Central's argument implies that one part of the exclusion is subject to an implicit limitation that could not be applied to the other part--hardly a natural reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central's other argument for coverage is that unless the exclusion were read narrowly, the protection offered for steel shipments would be empty; its premise is that the only foreseeable damage to steel on a sea voyage would be discoloration, corrosion or some form of physical distortion covered by the above-quoted \"bending\" clause of the exclusion.
