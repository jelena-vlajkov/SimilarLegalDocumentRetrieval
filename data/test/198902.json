Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n               Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n\n\n     Carlos Rodriguez Garcia for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 2, 2000\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.         Much to his later chagrin,\n\ndefendant-appellant       Angel    Ortiz-Santiago       (Ortiz)     joined     a\n\nmassive conspiracy that imported drugs into Puerto Rico and then\n\ndistributed them.       Ortiz participated in a successful November\n\n1996 smuggle and an unsuccessful December 1996 smuggle that came\n\nto naught when federal authorities seized the drugs.                   On the\n\nfirst occasion he helped to off-load the contraband and on the\n\nsecond he served as a lookout.\n\n             In due course, a federal grand jury returned a twenty-\n\none count indictment against more than four dozen defendants.\n\nThree counts targeted the appellant:               an omnibus count that\n\ncharged the master conspiracy and specific transaction counts\n\ncorresponding to the two smuggles in which he had participated.\n\nAttorneys for the appellant and the government proceeded to\n\nnegotiate a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement) under the\n\naegis of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B).             The Agreement provided\n\nin   substance   that   the   appellant    would      plead   guilty   to    the\n\nconspiracy count, and that the government would dismiss the\n\nother charges against him.         The Agreement further contemplated\n\nthat   the   government    would   (a)    seek   to    hold   the   appellant\n\nresponsible for only 50-150 kilograms of cocaine, (b) recommend\n\nan optimum three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fsee USSG §3E1.1, and (c) recommend a sentence at the nadir of\n\nthe applicable guideline sentencing range.\n\n            At the disposition hearing, the appellant requested\n\nthree other dispensations:      a downward departure, a role-in-the-\n\noffense adjustment, and recourse to the so-called \"safety valve\"\n\nprovision.     The court rebuffed all three requests.                It then\n\npremised the appellant's base offense level on the parties' drug\n\nquantity stipulation, reduced the offense level by applying the\n\nthree-level    adjustment      for    acceptance        of   responsibility,\n\ndismissed    the   \"specific    transaction\"          counts,   computed   the\n\nguideline sentencing range at 135-168 months, and imposed a 135-\n\nmonth incarcerative sentence.             The sentence exceeded the ten-\n\nyear mandatory minimum sentence applicable to the offense of\n\nconviction.    See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).           This appeal ensued.\n\n            The appellant launches a multi-pronged attack on his\n\nconviction and sentence.       We arrange his contentions in groups\n\nand discuss them sequentially.\n\n                                      I\n\n            The appellant asseverates that the district court erred\n\nin failing to grant his request for a downward departure.                   He\n\nsought that largesse under the Sentencing Guidelines' general\n\ndeparture provision, which permits a court to sentence outside\n\nthe   applicable   guideline    range       if   it   discerns   significant\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fatypicality due to an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not\n\nadequately taken into account by the Sentencing Commission.   See\n\nUSSG §5K2.0; see also 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).     The operation of\n\nthis provision depends, to a large extent, on the informed\n\ndiscretion of the sentencing judge.   See Koon v. United States,\n\n518 U.S. 81, 98 (1996); United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 68\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n         Here, the appellant predicated his departure request\n\non his responsibility to care for his ailing father.   The record\n\nmakes manifest that the trial court knew that it could have\n\ndeparted had it found that the appellant's family situation\n\nwarranted such a benefice.   The court, however, considered and\n\nrejected the claimed mitigation.\n\n         We cannot second-guess this implicit conclusion that\n\nthe appellant's familial responsibilities did not sufficiently\n\ndistinguish his case from the mine-run.    The court of appeals\n\nhas no authority to review a district court's discretionary\n\ndecision not to depart, whether upward or downward, unless the\n\nputative appellant can show that the district court acted in the\n\nmistaken belief that it lacked the ability to depart.         See\n\nUnited States v.   Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Hilton, 946 F.2d 955, 957 (1st Cir. 1991).   The\n\nappellant has made no such showing.   His case thus fits snugly\n\n\n                              -4-\n\fwithin the general rule, not within the long-odds exception to\n\nit.   Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to entertain his plaint.\n\nSee United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 236 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (refusing to review a district court's denial of a\n\nsection 5K2.0 departure request based on family hardship).\n\n\n\n                                         II\n\n           The appellant next assails the lower court for refusing\n\nto make a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment.                    In mounting\n\nthis attack, he points out that, whereas the drug-smuggling ring\n\ncut   quite   a    wide      swath,   his     participation     was   limited     to\n\ninfrequent, relatively low-level tasks.                  Because he acted once\n\nas a stevedore and once as a lookout, nothing more, he claims an\n\nentitlement       to   a   reduced     offense     level.      See    USSG    §3B1.2\n\n(describing possible offense-level adjustments for defendants\n\nwho occupy \"minor\" or \"minimal\" roles).\n\n           Role-in-the-offense           determinations        are    notoriously\n\nfact-sensitive,        and    this    case    is   no   exception.      The    party\n\nseeking the adjustment bears the burden of persuasion.                           See\n\nUnited States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nMoreover, appellate review is deferential:                  the district court's\n\nresolution of a dispute over a defendant's role is reviewed only\n\nfor clear error.           See id. at 333.         \"Thus, absent a mistake of\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\flaw, battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always\n\nbe won or lost in the district court.\"         United States v.\n\nGraciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n         These principles control here.   As the phrase implies,\n\na minimal participant is one who \"plays a minimal role in\n\nconcerted activity.\"   USSG §3B1.2, comment. (n.1).   The district\n\ncourt found that this description did not fit the appellant.    In\n\nview of the appellant's on-the-scene involvement in two large-\n\nscale smuggles, that finding is not open to serious challenge.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Dimarzo, 80 F.3d 656, 662 (1st Cir.\n\n1996); United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1238 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); see also United States v. McCarthy, 97 F.3d 1562, 1573\n\n(8th Cir. 1996) (affirming decision not to treat lookout in\n\nlarge marijuana processing conspiracy as \"minimal\" participant).\n\n         The second wave of the appellant's attack presents a\n\ncloser call.   Although involved in two smuggles, the appellant\n\nperformed only menial tasks and his argument for classification\n\nas a minor participant is not without force.     The standard of\n\nreview looms large, however, and in the final analysis we uphold\n\nthe district court's contrary determination.\n\n         A minor participant \"means any participant who is less\n\nculpable than most other participants, but whose role could not\n\nbe described as minimal.\"    USSG §3B1.2, comment. (n.3).      The\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fdefendant    has   the    burden   of    proving   that   he   is   both   less\n\nculpable than most others involved in the offense of conviction\n\nand   less   culpable     than   most    other   miscreants     convicted    of\n\ncomparable crimes.        See United States v. Isienyi, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n___ (7th Cir. 2000) [2000 WL 291182, at *2]; Ocasio, 914 F.2d at\n\n333; see also USSG §3B1.2, comment. (n.3 & backg'd.).                       The\n\nsentencing     court     supportably     found   that   the    appellant    had\n\nunloaded a sizable drug shipment and had conducted surveillance\n\nas a member of the conspiracy, and that this participation,\n\nwhile peripheral in a sense, was enough to warrant categorizing\n\nhim as a player rather than as a dabbler.\n\n             In the sentencing court's view, this conclusion was\n\nfortified by the fact that the government had not charged the\n\nappellant with anything near the full drug quantity attributable\n\nto the conspiracy.1       A defendant cannot insist on having it both\n\nways:     if he receives a reduced offense level because the\n\ngovernment agrees to understate the quantity of drugs with which\n\nhe has been involved, the sentencing court, if it sees fit, may\n\nkeep the scales of justice balanced by denying him the added\n\n\n      1\n     The government had agreed to limit the drug quantity to 50-\n150 kilograms of cocaine. To place this into perspective, we\nnote that the authorities had seized approximately 1,000\nkilograms of cocaine at the time of the December 1996 smuggle\nalone, not to mention quantities of heroin and marijuana. The\nNovember 1996 affair involved additional (not insubstantial)\namounts of contraband.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fbenefit of a mitigating role adjustment.           See Isienyi, ___ F.3d\n\nat ___ [2000 WL 291182, at *2]; McCarthy, 97 F.3d at 1574; see\n\nalso USSG §3B1.2, comment. (n.4).            Given this background, we\n\ncannot say that the district court clearly erred in not finding\n\nthat the appellant was entitled to a downward role-in-the-\n\noffense adjustment.2     See Isienyi, ___ F.3d at ___ [2000 WL\n\n291182, at *2]; Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d at 234; Graciani, 61\n\nF.3d at 75; Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333.\n\n                                    III\n\n         The appellant's third argument is a variation on the\n\nforegoing themes.     Citing       United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S.\n\n368, 380-81 (1982), and United States v. Marrapese, 826 F.2d\n\n145, 147 (1st Cir. 1987), he theorizes that the prosecutors were\n\ndisappointed that he could give them no useful information about\n\nthe activities of the ring; that this disappointment led them to\n\nbecome vindictive; and that this vindictiveness prompted them to\n\nmisrepresent   key   facts   and    oppose   any   leniency   (such   as   a\n\ndownward departure or role-in-the-offense adjustment).\n\n\n    2Because this claim falters on the facts, we do not need to\nconsider at any length the possible effect of the Agreement's\n\"no further adjustments\" clause (discussed in section IV,\ninfra). We note, however, that while the parties' consent to\neschew an adjustment, expressed in a non-binding plea agreement,\ndoes not deprive the sentencing court of power to make the\nadjustment, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), it nonetheless may\nbe considered by the court for what evidentiary value it may\npossess.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f              This suppositious chain of inferences need not detain\n\nus.   Absent some evidentiary predicate, direct or circumstantial\n\n— and we discern none in the appellant's wholly conclusory\n\npresentation      —   merely    chanting     the    mantra    of   prosecutorial\n\nvindictiveness gets a defendant nowhere.                See United States v.\n\nLanoue, 137 F.3d 656, 665 (1st Cir. 1998);                    United States v.\n\nStokes, 124 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v.\n\nSutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 772 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n              To be sure, the appellant points to one hard fact:               he\n\nnotes that certain other coconspirators pled guilty and then\n\nreceived somewhat shorter sentences than he did.                       But this\n\ncircumstance      does   not     advance      his    cause.        Disparity   in\n\nsentencing amongst coconspirators, without more, is not enough\n\nto justify a downward departure.               See United States v. Wogan,\n\n938 F.2d 1446, 1448 (1st Cir. 1991).                   By like token, such\n\ndifferentials, in and of themselves, are inadequate to raise a\n\npresumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness.                  See United States\n\nv. Ellis, 975 F.2d 1061, 1066 & n.2 (4th Cir. 1992); cf. United\n\nStates   v.    Rodriguez,      162   F.3d    135,   151-52    (1st   Cir.   1998)\n\n(discussing wide variety of factors that might justify disparate\n\nsentences as between coconspirators), cert. denied, 526 U.S.\n\n1152 (1999).\n\n                                       IV\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f            The most salient issue in this appeal implicates the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the appellant did not qualify\n\nfor the safety valve.           Insofar as such a ruling hinges on\n\ndifferential factfinding, we review it for clear error.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 527 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).     Here, however, the material facts are not in genuine\n\ndispute and the court's ruling rests on a determination of law.\n\n Hence, our review is plenary.           See United States v. White, 119\n\nF.3d 70, 73 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Congress enacted the safety valve provision, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(f), in order to mitigate the harsh effect of mandatory\n\nminimum    sentences      on   certain    first   offenders    who    played\n\nsupporting roles in drug-trafficking schemes.                 See   Miranda-\n\nSantiago, 96 F.3d at 527 & n.22 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103-460,\n\n2d   Sess.,    at   4   (1994)).    The     Sentencing   Commission     then\n\nincorporated the statutory text verbatim into the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.     See USSG §5C1.2.    When applicable, these provisions\n\nmandate both reduction of the defendant's offense level and\n\njudicial      disregard   of   statutes     imposing   mandatory     minimum\n\nsentences.3     The safety valve applies if\n\n\n\n\n     3\n     Here, for example, the safety valve, if applicable, would\noperate to reduce the appellant's base offense level by two\nlevels, yielding a guideline sentencing range of 108-135 months.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          (1) the defendant does not have more than 1\n          criminal history point . . . ;\n          (2) the defendant did not use violence or\n          credible threats of violence or possess a\n          firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce\n          another participant to do so) in connection\n          with the offense;\n          (3) the offense did not result in death or\n          serious bodily injury to any person;\n          (4) the defendant was not an organizer,\n          leader, manager, or supervisor of others in\n          the offense . . . and was not engaged in a\n          continuing criminal enterprise . . . ; and\n          (5) not later than the time of the\n          sentencing   hearing,  the   defendant   has\n          truthfully provided to the Government all\n          information and evidence the defendant has\n          concerning the offense or offenses that were\n          part of the same course of conduct or of a\n          common scheme or plan . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(f); USSG §5C1.2.\n\n          The record strongly suggests — and at oral argument in\n\nthis court the Assistant United States Attorney pretty much\n\nconceded — that the appellant satisfies all these criteria:         he\n\nhas no prior criminal record; he did not carry a firearm,\n\nthreaten violence, engage in activity that was shown to involve\n\ndeath or serious bodily harm to others, or occupy a leadership\n\nrole in the criminal enterprise.        Moreover, he seems to have\n\nbeen   forthcoming   in   his   post-arrest   discussions   with   the\n\nauthorities.   Citing these facts, the appellant's counsel asked\n\nthe sentencing court to apply the safety valve.      The government\n\nobjected, asserting that the request contravened the Agreement.\n\nThe court accepted this assertion.      We do not.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            The language in the Agreement on which the government\n\nrelied declares that, aside from those adjustments that are\n\nexpressly delineated in the Agreement, \"no further adjustments\n\nto the defendant's total offense level shall be made.\"     We do\n\nnot believe the quoted language can support the gloss that the\n\ngovernment places upon it, or that it can be read to bar\n\njudicial recourse to the safety valve.    We explain briefly.\n\n            In general, courts interpret plea agreements more or\n\nless as contracts.    See United States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179,\n\n183 (1st Cir. 1999).    \"That means, of course, that an inquiring\n\ncourt should construe the written document within its four\n\ncorners, 'unfestooned with covenants the parties did not see fit\n\nto mention.'\"    Id. at 185 (quoting United States v. Anderson,\n\n921 F.2d 335, 338 (1st Cir. 1990)).    We have been scrupulous in\n\nholding defendants to the terms of the plea agreements that they\n\nenter knowingly and voluntarily, see, e.g., id.; United States\n\nv. Guzman, 85 F.3d 823, 829 (1st Cir. 1996); Anderson, 921 F.2d\n\nat 337-38; United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d 386, 388-89 (1st\n\nCir. 1988), and we must be equally steadfast in dealing with the\n\ngovernment, cf. United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390,\n\n393 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that, \"in fairness, what is\n\nsauce for the defendant's goose is sauce for the government's\n\ngander\").\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f         The    term   \"adjustments,\"        when    used   in   the    federal\n\nsentencing context, simply does not encompass the safety valve\n\nprovision.     Chapter three of the Guidelines Manual, entitled\n\n\"adjustments,\" describes a variety of potential increases and\n\ndecreases that may be made in the course of determining a\n\ndefendant's adjusted offense level.                 That chapter does not\n\nmention the safety valve — a provision that is located in\n\nchapter five, see USSG §5C1.2, along with other provisions that\n\nguide the ultimate sentencing determination.                Those provisions\n\noperate dehors the Sentencing Guidelines proper.                   See United\n\nStates v. Joetzki, 952 F.2d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir. 1991).                     Thus,\n\nthe items delineated in chapter five, including the safety\n\nvalve, are not \"adjustments.\"      In the case of the safety valve,\n\nthis distinction is critical:       the safety valve is not intended\n\nto affect the calculation of the defendant's offense level per\n\nse, but, rather, to operate as a limitation on the applicability\n\nof mandatory minimum sentences.          See United States v. Scharon,\n\n187 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1999); H.R. Rep. No. 103-460, supra.\n\nThe short of it is that the language in the Agreement to which\n\nthe government alludes cannot be stretched to relate to the\n\nsafety valve.\n\n         If     any   doubt   remains    —   and    we   have    none   —    this\n\nconclusion is bolstered by considering the nature of the safety\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fvalve.      Even within chapter five, the safety valve is sui\n\ngeneris.     While it operates somewhat like a downward departure\n\n(i.e., it yields, in the end, a reduced sentence), an important\n\ndifference exists.          Departures are inherently permissive, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Dethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 44-45 (1st Cir.\n\n1997),     whereas    the    safety    valve       —    when    it    applies    —   is\n\nmandatory.        Congress provided in clear language that, if a\n\ndefendant satisfies the statutory criteria (virtually all of\n\nwhich are objective), the court shall disregard the mandatory\n\nminimum and fashion the sentence accordingly.                        See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(f); accord USSG §5C1.2; see also Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d\n\nat   528    (noting    that    if     \"a     defendant         has   met   the   five\n\nrequirements of the [safety valve], the judge is required to set\n\naside the mandatory minimum\").\n\n            The    obligatory       nature    of       the   provision     possesses\n\ndecretory significance for the purposes of this case.                      In a non-\n\nbinding plea agreement, the government cannot contract around\n\nthe safety valve; the most that it can do is attempt to persuade\n\nthe sentencing court that the provision does not apply.                      See Fed\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B); see also United States v. Bradstreet,\n\n___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 99-1267, slip op. at 10]\n\n(\"Sentencing, after all, is a matter for the district court and\n\nnot for the government.\").            The court then must pass upon the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fmatter, exercising its independent judgment.                See United States\n\nv.    Thompson,   81   F.3d   877,   880    (9th   Cir.     1996).    In    that\n\nexercise, the court must bear in mind that the safety valve is\n\na    congressional     directive.     The    court   cannot    reject      it   on\n\nequitable grounds, but must sift through the statutory criteria\n\nand, if it determines that those criteria have not been met,\n\nmust elucidate specific reasons why the provision does not\n\napply.    See Scharon, 187 F.3d at 23 (finding \"bare conclusions\"\n\ninsufficient      to   disqualify    defendant       from    safety     valve);\n\nMiranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 529-30 (similar).\n\n            In this instance, the court made no such findings.                  It\n\nsimply concluded that the Agreement blocked the application of\n\nthe safety valve.       In reaching this conclusion, it gave to the\n\nAgreement more force than it deserved and read into it an\n\nunderstanding that was not conveyed in the text.                      In these\n\nrespects, the court erred as a matter of law.               Consequently, the\n\nappellant's sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for\n\nresentencing.\n\n                                      V\n\n            We have one more bridge to cross.             When the probation\n\ndepartment produced the appellant's presentence investigation\n\nreport (PSI Report), difficulties           immediately      became apparent.\n\nThe government had for some unexplained reason created two\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fdifferent versions of the facts anent Ortiz's culpability.                                One\n\nversion (which had been used during the change-of-plea colloquy\n\nand in the Agreement) accurately limited his participation to\n\nsurveillance        and        off-loading.          The     PSI     Report,      however,\n\ncontained      a    different,         more       sinister   version        —    one    which\n\nincluded      apparently erroneous statements to the effect that the\n\nappellant had distributed cocaine and helped to collect drug-\n\ntrafficking proceeds.              To make a bad situation worse, the PSI\n\nReport characterized both surveillance and unloading in the\n\nplural, making it appear that the appellant had performed each\n\ntask more than once.\n\n              The    appellant          objected      to     these    rather       blatant\n\ninaccuracies.        The district court indicated its awareness of the\n\ntrue   facts       and    stated       that    it    would   ignore        the   unfounded\n\nallegations and correct the PSI.                     The appellant complains that\n\nthe district court should have followed through on this pledge.\n\nWe agree.\n\n              Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1) provides that the district\n\ncourt,   when       faced      with    a   timely     challenge,      must       deal    with\n\nfactual disputes about material contained in a PSI Report in one\n\nof two ways:             either resolving the conflict or deeming the\n\nmaterial irrelevant to the sentencing determination.                             See United\n\nStates   v.    Van,       87    F.3d    1,    3    (1st   Cir.     1996)    (explicating\n\n\n                                              -16-\n\foperation of Rule 32(c)).     But the court also must correct the\n\nerror or otherwise indicate in writing that the challenged\n\nmaterial is either wrong or irrelevant.            See United States v.\n\nLevy, 897 F.2d 596, 599 (1st Cir. 1990).              Insistence on this\n\nprotocol is not mere pettifoggery:            corrections to the PSI\n\nReport   are   important   because    the    Report    will   follow    the\n\ndefendant as he passes through the justice system affecting\n\nclassification    decisions    and     a    wide    variety    of   other\n\ndeterminations.\n\n          On this occasion, the district court stated that it\n\nwould see that the necessary corrections were made, but, for\n\naught that appears, did not follow through.             The court should\n\nhave appended an appropriate written statement to the PSI Report\n\nor otherwise ensured that the necessary modifications were made.\n\nOn remand, the court should attend to this detail.            See id.\n\n                                 VI\n\n          We need go no further.           For the reasons stated, we\n\nvacate the appellant's sentence and remand for resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nVacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

Vega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Torruella, Chief Judge, Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Selya, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much to his later chagrin, defendant-appellant Angel Ortiz-Santiago (Ortiz) joined a massive conspiracy that imported drugs into Puerto Rico and then distributed them. Ortiz participated in a successful November 1996 smuggle and an unsuccessful December 1996 smuggle that came to naught when federal authorities seized the drugs. On the first occasion he helped to off-load the contraband and on the second he served as a lookout.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury returned a twenty-one count indictment against more than four dozen defendants. Three counts targeted the appellant: an omnibus count that charged the master conspiracy and specific transaction counts corresponding to the two smuggles in which he had participated. Attorneys for the appellant and the government proceeded to negotiate a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement) under the aegis of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B). The Agreement provided in substance that the appellant would plead guilty to the conspiracy count, and that the government would dismiss the other charges against him. The Agreement further contemplated that the government would (a) seek to hold the appellant responsible for only 50-150 kilograms of cocaine, (b) recommend an optimum three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility, see USSG &#167;3E1.1, and (c) recommend a sentence at the nadir of the applicable guideline sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the appellant requested three other dispensations: a downward departure, a role-in-the-offense adjustment, and recourse to the so-called \"safety valve\" provision. The court rebuffed all three requests. It then premised the appellant's base offense level on the parties' drug quantity stipulation, reduced the offense level by applying the three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, dismissed the \"specific transaction\" counts, computed the guideline sentencing range at 135-168 months, and imposed a 135-month incarcerative sentence. The sentence exceeded the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence applicable to the offense of conviction. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b). This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant launches a multi-pronged attack on his conviction and sentence. We arrange his contentions in groups and discuss them sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant asseverates that the district court erred in failing to grant his request for a downward departure. He sought that largesse under the Sentencing Guidelines' general departure provision, which permits a court to sentence outside the applicable guideline range if it discerns significant atypicality due to an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not adequately taken into account by the Sentencing Commission. See USSG &#167;5K2.0; see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). The operation of this provision depends, to a large extent, on the informed discretion of the sentencing judge. See Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98 (1996); United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 68 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellant predicated his departure request on his responsibility to care for his ailing father. The record makes manifest that the trial court knew that it could have departed had it found that the appellant's family situation warranted such a benefice. The court, however, considered and rejected the claimed mitigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot second-guess this implicit conclusion that the appellant's familial responsibilities did not sufficiently distinguish his case from the mine-run. The court of appeals has no authority to review a district court's discretionary decision not to depart, whether upward or downward, unless the putative appellant can show that the district court acted in the mistaken belief that it lacked the ability to depart. See United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Hilton, 946 F.2d 955, 957 (1st Cir. 1991). The appellant has made no such showing. His case thus fits snugly within the general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to entertain his plaint. See United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 236 (1st Cir. 1999) (refusing to review a district court's denial of a section 5K2.0 departure request based on family hardship).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next assails the lower court for refusing to make a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment. In mounting this attack, he points out that, whereas the drug-smuggling ring cut quite a wide swath, his participation was limited to infrequent, relatively low-level tasks. Because he acted once as a stevedore and once as a lookout, nothing more, he claims an entitlement to a reduced offense level. See USSG &#167;3B1.2 (describing possible offense-level adjustments for defendants who occupy \"minor\" or \"minimal\" roles).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Role-in-the-offense determinations are notoriously fact-sensitive, and this case is no exception. The party seeking the adjustment bears the burden of persuasion. See United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir. 1990). Moreover, appellate review is deferential: the district court's resolution of a dispute over a defendant's role is reviewed only for clear error. See id. at 333. \"Thus, absent a mistake of law, battles over a defendant's status... will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles control here. As the phrase implies, a minimal participant is one who \"plays a minimal role in concerted activity.\" USSG &#167;3B1.2, comment. (n.1). The district court found that this description did not fit the appellant. In view of the appellant's on-the-scene involvement in two large-scale smuggles, that finding is not open to serious challenge. See, e.g., United States v. Dimarzo, 80 F.3d 656, 662 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1238 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States v. McCarthy, 97 F.3d 1562, 1573 (8th Cir. 1996) (affirming decision not to treat lookout in large marijuana processing conspiracy as \"minimal\" participant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second wave of the appellant's attack presents a closer call. Although involved in two smuggles, the appellant performed only menial tasks and his argument for classification as a minor participant is not without force. The standard of review looms large, however, and in the final analysis we uphold the district court's contrary determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A minor participant \"means any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\" USSG &#167;3B1.2, comment. (n.3). The defendant has the burden of proving that he is both less culpable than most others involved in the offense of conviction and less culpable than most other miscreants convicted of comparable crimes. See United States v. Isienyi, 207 F.3d 390, 392-392 (7th Cir. 2000) Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333; see also USSG &#167;3B1.2, comment. (n.3 &amp; backg'd.). The sentencing court supportably found that the appellant had unloaded a sizable drug shipment and had conducted surveillance as a member of the conspiracy, and that this participation, while peripheral in a sense, was enough to warrant categorizing him as a player rather than as a dabbler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the sentencing court's view, this conclusion was fortified by the fact that the government had not charged the appellant with anything near the full drug quantity attributable to the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A defendant cannot insist on having it both ways: if he receives a reduced offense level because the government agrees to understate the quantity of drugs with which he has been involved, the sentencing court, if it sees fit, may keep the scales of justice balanced by denying him the added benefit of a mitigating role adjustment. See Isienyi, 207 F.3d at 392-393; McCarthy, 97 F.3d at 1574; see also USSG &#167;3B1.2, comment. (n.4). Given this background, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in not finding that the appellant was entitled to a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See Isienyi, 207 F.3d at 392-392; Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d at 234; Graciani, 61 F.3d at 75; Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's third argument is a variation on the foregoing themes. Citing United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 380-81 (1982), and United States v. Marrapese, 826 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir. 1987), he theorizes that the prosecutors were disappointed that he could give them no useful information about the activities of the ring; that this disappointment led them to become vindictive; and that this vindictiveness prompted them to misrepresent key facts and oppose any leniency (such as a downward departure or role-in-the-offense adjustment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suppositious chain of inferences need not detain us. Absent some evidentiary predicate, direct or circumstantial - and we discern none in the appellant's wholly conclusory presentation - merely chanting the mantra of prosecutorial vindictiveness gets a defendant nowhere. See United States v. Lanoue, 137 F.3d 656, 665 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Sutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 772 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the appellant points to one hard fact: he notes that certain other coconspirators pled guilty and then received somewhat shorter sentences than he did. But this circumstance does not advance his cause. Disparity in sentencing amongst coconspirators, without more, is not enough to justify a downward departure. See United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1448 (1st Cir. 1991). By like token, such differentials, in and of themselves, are inadequate to raise a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness. See United States v. Ellis, 975 F.2d 1061, 1066 &amp; n.2 (4th Cir. 1992); cf. United States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 151-52 (1st Cir. 1998) (discussing wide variety of factors that might justify disparate sentences as between coconspirators), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1152 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most salient issue in this appeal implicates the district court's conclusion that the appellant did not qualify for the safety valve. Insofar as such a ruling hinges on differential factfinding, we review it for clear error. See United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 527 (1st Cir. 1996). Here, however, the material facts are not in genuine dispute and the court's ruling rests on a determination of law. Hence, our review is plenary. See United States v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 73 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the safety valve provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), in order to mitigate the harsh effect of mandatory minimum sentences on certain first offenders who played supporting roles in drug-trafficking schemes. See Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 527 &amp; n.22 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103-460, 2d Sess., at 4 (1994)). The Sentencing Commission then incorporated the statutory text verbatim into the Sentencing Guidelines. See USSG &#167;5C1.2. When applicable, these provisions mandate both reduction of the defendant's offense level and judicial disregard of statutes imposing mandatory minimum sentences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The safety valve applies if</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point...;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense... and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise...; and(5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f); USSG &#167;5C1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record strongly suggests - and at oral argument in this court the Assistant United States Attorney pretty much conceded - that the appellant satisfies all these criteria: he has no prior criminal record; he did not carry a firearm, threaten violence, engage in activity that was shown to involve death or serious bodily harm to others, or occupy a leadership role in the criminal enterprise. Moreover, he seems to have been forthcoming in his post-arrest discussions with the authorities. Citing these facts, the appellant's counsel asked the sentencing court to apply the safety valve. The government objected, asserting that the request contravened the Agreement. The court accepted this assertion. We do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language in the Agreement on which the government relied declares that, aside from those adjustments that are expressly delineated in the Agreement, \"no further adjustments to the defendant's total offense level shall be made.\" We do not believe the quoted language can support the gloss that the government places upon it, or that it can be read to bar judicial recourse to the safety valve. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, courts interpret plea agreements more or less as contracts. See United States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 183 (1st Cir. 1999). \"That means, of course, that an inquiring court should construe the written document within its four corners, 'unfestooned with covenants the parties did not see fit to mention.'\" Id. at 185 (quoting United States v. Anderson, 921 F.2d 335, 338 (1st Cir. 1990)). We have been scrupulous in holding defendants to the terms of the plea agreements that they enter knowingly and voluntarily, see, e.g., id.; United States v. Guzman, 85 F.3d 823, 829 (1st Cir. 1996); Anderson, 921 F.2d at 337-38; United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d 386, 388-89 (1st Cir. 1988), and we must be equally steadfast in dealing with the government, cf. United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 393 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that, \"in fairness, what is sauce for the defendant's goose is sauce for the government's gander\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"adjustments,\" when used in the federal sentencing context, simply does not encompass the safety valve provision. Chapter three of the Guidelines Manual, entitled \"adjustments,\" describes a variety of potential increases and decreases that may be made in the course of determining a defendant's adjusted offense level. That chapter does not mention the safety valve - a provision that is located in chapter five, see USSG &#167;5C1.2, along with other provisions that guide the ultimate sentencing determination. Those provisions operate dehors the Sentencing Guidelines proper. See United States v. Joetzki, 952 F.2d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir. 1991). Thus, the items delineated in chapter five, including the safety valve, are not \"adjustments.\" In the case of the safety valve, this distinction is critical: the safety valve is not intended to affect the calculation of the defendant's offense level per se, but, rather, to operate as a limitation on the applicability of mandatory minimum sentences. See United States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1999); H.R. Rep. No. 103-460, supra. The short of it is that the language in the Agreement to which the government alludes cannot be stretched to relate to the safety valve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If any doubt remains - and we have none - this conclusion is bolstered by considering the nature of the safety valve. Even within chapter five, the safety valve is sui generis. While it operates somewhat like a downward departure (i.e., it yields, in the end, a reduced sentence), an important difference exists. Departures are inherently permissive, see, e.g., United States v. Dethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 44-45 (1st Cir. 1997), whereas the safety valve - when it applies -is mandatory. Congress provided in clear language that, if a defendant satisfies the statutory criteria (virtually all of which are objective), the court shall disregard the mandatory minimum and fashion the sentence accordingly. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f); accord USSG &#167;5C1.2; see also Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 528 (noting that if \"a defendant has met the five requirements of the [safety valve], the judge is required to set aside the mandatory minimum\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The obligatory nature of the provision possesses decretory significance for the purposes of this case. In a non-binding plea agreement, the government cannot contract around the safety valve; the most that it can do is attempt to persuade the sentencing court that the provision does not apply. See Fed R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B); see also United States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Sentencing, after all, is a matter for the district court and not for the government.\"). The court then must pass upon the matter, exercising its independent judgment. See United States v. Thompson, 81 F.3d 877, 880 (9th Cir. 1996). In that exercise, the court must bear in mind that the safety valve is a congressional directive. The court cannot reject it on equitable grounds, but must sift through the statutory criteria and, if it determines that those criteria have not been met, must elucidate specific reasons why the provision does not apply. See Scharon, 187 F.3d at 23 (finding \"bare conclusions\" insufficient to disqualify defendant from safety valve); Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 529-30 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the court made no such findings. It simply concluded that the Agreement blocked the application of the safety valve. In reaching this conclusion, it gave to the Agreement more force than it deserved and read into it an understanding that was not conveyed in the text. In these respects, the court erred as a matter of law. Consequently, the appellant's sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have one more bridge to cross. When the probation department produced the appellant's presentence investigation report (PSI Report), difficulties immediately became apparent. The government had for some unexplained reason created two different versions of the facts anent Ortiz's culpability. One version (which had been used during the change-of-plea colloquy and in the Agreement) accurately limited his participation to surveillance and off-loading. The PSI Report, however, contained a different, more sinister version -one which included apparently erroneous statements to the effect that the appellant had distributed cocaine and helped to collect drug-trafficking proceeds. To make a bad situation worse, the PSI Report characterized both surveillance and unloading in the plural, making it appear that the appellant had performed each task more than once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant objected to these rather blatant inaccuracies. The district court indicated its awareness of the true facts and stated that it would ignore the unfounded allegations and correct the PSI. The appellant complains that the district court should have followed through on this pledge. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1) provides that the district court, when faced with a timely challenge, must deal with factual disputes about material contained in a PSI Report in one of two ways: either resolving the conflict or deeming the material irrelevant to the sentencing determination. See United States v. Van, 87 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996) (explicating operation of Rule 32(c)). But the court also must correct the error or otherwise indicate in writing that the challenged material is either wrong or irrelevant. See United States v. Levy, 897 F.2d 596, 599 (1st Cir. 1990). Insistence on this protocol is not mere pettifoggery: corrections to the PSI Report are important because the Report will follow the defendant as he passes through the justice system affecting classification decisions and a wide variety of other determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this occasion, the district court stated that it would see that the necessary corrections were made, but, for aught that appears, did not follow through. The court should have appended an appropriate written statement to the PSI Report or otherwise ensured that the necessary modifications were made. On remand, the court should attend to this detail. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The government had agreed to limit the drug quantity to 50-150 kilograms of cocaine. To place this into perspective, we note that the authorities had seized approximately 1,000 kilograms of cocaine at the time of the December 1996 smuggle alone, not to mention quantities of heroin and marijuana. The November 1996 affair involved additional (not insubstantial) amounts of contraband.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Because this claim falters on the facts, we do not need to consider at any length the possible effect of the Agreement's \"no further adjustments\" clause (discussed in section IV, infra). We note, however, that while the parties' consent to eschew an adjustment, expressed in a non-binding plea agreement, does not deprive the sentencing court of power to make the adjustment, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), it nonetheless may be considered by the court for what evidentiary value it may possess.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  Here, for example, the safety valve, if applicable, would operate to reduce the appellant's base offense level by two levels, yielding a guideline sentencing range of 108-135 months.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Ortiz participated in a successful November 1996 smuggle and an unsuccessful December 1996 smuggle that came to naught when federal authorities seized the drugs. On the first occasion he helped to off-load the contraband and on the second he served as a lookout.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury returned a twenty-one count indictment against more than four dozen defendants. Three counts targeted the appellant: an omnibus count that charged the master conspiracy and specific transaction counts corresponding to the two smuggles in which he had participated. Attorneys for the appellant and the government proceeded to negotiate a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement) under the aegis of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B). The Agreement provided in substance that the appellant would plead guilty to the conspiracy count, and that the government would dismiss the other charges against him. The Agreement further contemplated that the government would (a) seek to hold the appellant responsible for only 50-150 kilograms of cocaine, (b) recommend an optimum three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility, see USSG &#167;3E1.1, and (c) recommend a sentence at the nadir of the applicable guideline sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the appellant requested three other dispensations: a downward departure, a role-in-the-offense adjustment, and recourse to the so-called \"safety valve\" provision. The court rebuffed all three requests. It then premised the appellant's base offense level on the parties' drug quantity stipulation, reduced the offense level by applying the three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, dismissed the \"specific transaction\" counts, computed the guideline sentencing range at 135-168 months, and imposed a 135-month incarcerative sentence. The sentence exceeded the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence applicable to the offense of conviction. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b). This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant launches a multi-pronged attack on his conviction and sentence.

He sought that largesse under the Sentencing Guidelines' general departure provision, which permits a court to sentence outside the applicable guideline range if it discerns significant atypicality due to an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not adequately taken into account by the Sentencing Commission. See USSG &#167;5K2.0; see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). The operation of this provision depends, to a large extent, on the informed discretion of the sentencing judge. See Koon v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 98 (1996); United States v.

The record makes manifest that the trial court knew that it could have departed had it found that the appellant's family situation warranted such a benefice. The court, however, considered and rejected the claimed mitigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot second-guess this implicit conclusion that the appellant's familial responsibilities did not sufficiently distinguish his case from the mine-run. The court of appeals has no authority to review a district court's discretionary decision not to depart, whether upward or downward, unless the putative appellant can show that the district court acted in the mistaken belief that it lacked the ability to depart. See United States v. Pierro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 619 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v.

The appellant has made no such showing. His case thus fits snugly within the general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to entertain his plaint. See United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198682\"><a href=\"/opinion/198682/united-states-v-rivera-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 236 (1st Cir. 1999) (refusing to review a district court's denial of a section 5K2.0 departure request based on family hardship).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next assails the lower court for refusing to make a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment. In mounting this attack, he points out that, whereas the drug-smuggling ring cut quite a wide swath, his participation was limited to infrequent, relatively low-level tasks. Because he acted once as a stevedore and once as a lookout, nothing more, he claims an entitlement to a reduced offense level. See USSG &#167;3B1.2 (describing possible offense-level adjustments for defendants who occupy \"minor\" or \"minimal\" roles).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Role-in-the-offense determinations are notoriously fact-sensitive, and this case is no exception. The party seeking the adjustment bears the burden of persuasion. See United States v. Ocasio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).

The sentencing court supportably found that the appellant had unloaded a sizable drug shipment and had conducted surveillance as a member of the conspiracy, and that this participation, while peripheral in a sense, was enough to warrant categorizing him as a player rather than as a dabbler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the sentencing court's view, this conclusion was fortified by the fact that the government had not charged the appellant with anything near the full drug quantity attributable to the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A defendant cannot insist on having it both ways: if he receives a reduced offense level because the government agrees to understate the quantity of drugs with which he has been involved, the sentencing court, if it sees fit, may keep the scales of justice balanced by denying him the added benefit of a mitigating role adjustment.

Moreover, he seems to have been forthcoming in his post-arrest discussions with the authorities. Citing these facts, the appellant's counsel asked the sentencing court to apply the safety valve. The government objected, asserting that the request contravened the Agreement. The court accepted this assertion. We do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language in the Agreement on which the government relied declares that, aside from those adjustments that are expressly delineated in the Agreement, \"no further adjustments to the defendant's total offense level shall be made.\" We do not believe the quoted language can support the gloss that the government places upon it, or that it can be read to bar judicial recourse to the safety valve.

United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196024\"><a href=\"/opinion/196024/united-states-v-caraballo-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 393 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that, \"in fairness, what is sauce for the defendant's goose is sauce for the government's gander\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"adjustments,\" when used in the federal sentencing context, simply does not encompass the safety valve provision. Chapter three of the Guidelines Manual, entitled \"adjustments,\" describes a variety of potential increases and decreases that may be made in the course of determining a defendant's adjusted offense level. That chapter does not mention the safety valve - a provision that is located in chapter five, see USSG &#167;5C1.2, along with other provisions that guide the ultimate sentencing determination. Those provisions operate dehors the Sentencing Guidelines proper. See United States v. Joetzki, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574965\"><a href=\"/opinion/574965/united-states-v-horst-werner-joetzki-united-states-of-america-v-lawrence/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span>, 1097 (9th Cir. 1991). Thus, the items delineated in chapter five, including the safety valve, are not \"adjustments.\" In the case of the safety valve, this distinction is critical: the safety valve is not intended to affect the calculation of the defendant's offense level per se, but, rather, to operate as a limitation on the applicability of mandatory minimum sentences. See United States v. Scharon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198519\"><a href=\"/opinion/198519/united-states-v-scharon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1999); H.R. Rep. No. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">103-460,</span> supra</span>. The short of it is that the language in the Agreement to which the government alludes cannot be stretched to relate to the safety valve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If any doubt remains - and we have none - this conclusion is bolstered by considering the nature of the safety valve. Even within chapter five, the safety valve is sui generis. While it operates somewhat like a downward departure (i.e., it yields, in the end, a reduced sentence), an important difference exists. Departures are inherently permissive, see, e.g., United States v. Dethlefs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197512\"><a href=\"/opinion/197512/united-states-v-dethlefs/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44-45 (1st Cir. 1997), whereas the safety valve - when it applies -is mandatory. Congress provided in clear language that, if a defendant satisfies the statutory criteria (virtually all of which are objective), the court shall disregard the mandatory minimum and fashion the sentence accordingly. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f); accord USSG &#167;5C1.2; see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Miranda-Santiago,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">528</span> </a></span>(noting that if \"a defendant has met the five requirements of the [safety valve], the judge is required to set aside the mandatory minimum\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The obligatory nature of the provision possesses decretory significance for the purposes of this case. In a non-binding plea agreement, the government cannot contract around the safety valve; the most that it can do is attempt to persuade the sentencing court that the provision does not apply. See Fed R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B); see also United States v. Bradstreet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768063\"><a href=\"/opinion/768063/united-states-v-bernard-f-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Sentencing, after all, is a matter for the district court and not for the government.\"). The court then must pass upon the matter, exercising its independent judgment. See United States v. Thompson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716687\"><a href=\"/opinion/716687/96-cal-daily-op-serv-2680-96-daily-journal-dar-4428-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span>, 880 (9th Cir. 1996). In that exercise, the court must bear in mind that the safety valve is a congressional directive. The court cannot reject it on equitable grounds, but must sift through the statutory criteria and, if it determines that those criteria have not been met, must elucidate specific reasons why the provision does not apply. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198519\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Scharon,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198519/united-states-v-scharon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">23</span> </a></span>(finding \"bare conclusions\" insufficient to disqualify defendant from safety valve); <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Miranda-Santiago,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">529-30</span> </a></span>(similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the court made no such findings. It simply concluded that the Agreement blocked the application of the safety valve. In reaching this conclusion, it gave to the Agreement more force than it deserved and read into it an understanding that was not conveyed in the text. In these respects, the court erred as a matter of law. Consequently, the appellant's sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have one more bridge to cross. When the probation department produced the appellant's presentence investigation report (PSI Report), difficulties immediately became apparent. The government had for some unexplained reason created two different versions of the facts anent Ortiz's culpability. One version (which had been used during the change-of-plea colloquy and in the Agreement) accurately limited his participation to surveillance and off-loading. The PSI Report, however, contained a different, more sinister version -one which included apparently erroneous statements to the effect that the appellant had distributed cocaine and helped to collect drug-trafficking proceeds. To make a bad situation worse, the PSI Report characterized both surveillance and unloading in the plural, making it appear that the appellant had performed each task more than once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant objected to these rather blatant inaccuracies. The district court indicated its awareness of the true facts and stated that it would ignore the unfounded allegations and correct the PSI. The appellant complains that the district court should have followed through on this pledge. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1) provides that the district court, when faced with a timely challenge, must deal with factual disputes about material contained in a PSI Report in one of two ways: either resolving the conflict or deeming the material irrelevant to the sentencing determination. See United States v. Van, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196815\"><a href=\"/opinion/196815/united-states-v-van/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1996) (explicating operation of Rule 32(c)). But the court also must correct the error or otherwise indicate in writing that the challenged material is either wrong or irrelevant. See United States v. Levy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537617\"><a href=\"/opinion/537617/united-states-v-timothy-alexander-levy/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 599 (1st Cir. 1990). Insistence on this protocol is not mere pettifoggery: corrections to the PSI Report are important because the Report will follow the defendant as he passes through the justice system affecting classification decisions and a wide variety of other determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this occasion, the district court stated that it would see that the necessary corrections were made, but, for aught that appears, did not follow through. The court should have appended an appropriate written statement to the PSI Report or otherwise ensured that the necessary modifications were made. On remand, the court should attend to this detail. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

We note, however, that while the parties' consent to eschew an adjustment, expressed in a non-binding plea agreement, does not deprive the sentencing court of power to make the adjustment, see Fed.
