Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\n     Camille Velez-Rive, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal\nDivision, were on brief for the United States.\n\fSeptember 13, 2000\n\f         BOUDIN,   Circuit Judge.    Daniel Gandia-Maysonet was\n\nconvicted upon a plea of guilty to one count of carjacking, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119 (1994), and one count of using a firearm in\n\nconnection with that crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (1994).     On\n\nthis appeal he seeks to set aside his plea.     Because no trial\n\nhas been held, there is no definitive version of the facts of\n\nthe underlying crime.   Based on Gandia's version and that of the\n\ngovernment (to which Gandia did not object), the essential\n\noutline of events is as follows.\n\n         On March 20, 1995, in Vega Baja, in the Commonwealth\n\nof Puerto Rico, Ivan Pizarro-Torres invited Gandia to take a\n\ndrive and then asked him to rob Victor Colon-Ortiz, a lottery\n\nticket seller.   Gandia said he would not do the robbery alone,\n\nso Ivan Pizarro enlisted his cousin, Samuel Pizarro, to join in\n\nthe scheme.   Ivan Pizarro then drove Gandia and Samuel Pizarro\n\nto a point near Colon’s home and departed with his vehicle,\n\nleaving Gandia and Samuel Pizarro with Ivan's pistol.     Gandia\n\nand Samuel Pizarro circled the house, spotted Colon in his\n\ncarport, and approached him.\n\n         Samuel Pizarro announced that this was a hold-up; Colon\n\ntook out a knife and moved toward Samuel, and Samuel then shot\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fColon five times, killing him.1      Colon’s wife was also shot and\n\nsuffered serious injury but survived.        Samuel Pizarro proceeded\n\nto drive Colon’s car through a closed gate, and Gandia then\n\njoined him.   After fleeing with Colon's car, the pair retrieved\n\nmoney from the trunk of the car and shared it with Ivan Pizarro.\n\nSome months later, Gandia and another individual shot and killed\n\nSamuel Pizarro.     Gandia is now serving a 30-year Commonwealth\n\nsentence for that crime.\n\n          In December 1996, the government indicted Gandia and\n\nIvan Pizarro for carjacking and using a firearm in the course of\n\ncarjacking, directly and while aiding and abetting each other as\n\nwell as others not charged.          Samuel Pizarro was no longer\n\navailable as a witness, but Ivan Pizarro agreed to testify\n\nagainst   Gandia,   and   the   government   disclosed   that   it   had\n\nrecovered Gandia's fingerprint from the trunk of Colon’s car.\n\nIn light of this evidence, Gandia and the government reached a\n\nplea agreement, which provided for Gandia to plead guilty to\n\nboth counts in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence of 30 years\n\nfor carjacking and a consecutive 5-year sentence on the firearm\n\ncount.\n\n\n\n    1This version of the shooting was supplied by Gandia himself\nat his change-of-plea hearing.     The government's version of\nevents took no position on whether Gandia or Samuel Pizarro shot\nColon and his wife.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f            On May 12, 1997, the district court conducted a change-\n\nof-plea hearing and accepted Gandia’s guilty plea under Rule 11\n\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.          In the colloquy,\n\nGandia accepted as true the government’s written version of\n\nfacts attached to the plea agreement, and he made a short\n\nstatement    inculpating   himself    in   the   robbery.    After    a\n\npresentence report, the court imposed the agreed-upon sentence\n\non October 7, 1997.    Gandia then filed a notice of appeal.\n\n            Thereafter, Gandia’s counsel filed an Anders brief,\n\npursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967).          In\n\nresponse to this court's direction, Gandia's counsel briefed two\n\nissues for our consideration.        One is whether Gandia's guilty\n\nplea was invalid because the scienter element of the carjacking\n\ncrime was misstated at several points in the hearing, so that\n\nthe plea was not knowing and voluntary.          The other is whether\n\nthe facts to which Gandia admitted provide a sufficient factual\n\nbasis for a plea to the carjacking offense, as required by\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f).\n\n            Appellate review of guilty pleas reflects a fairly\n\nspecialized body of doctrine.         Failures to comply with very\n\nspecific, yet technical, requirements of Rule 11 are often found\n\n\"harmless,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).          E.g., United States v.\n\nMcDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f1062 (1998).       But, because a guilty plea is a shortcut around\n\nthe fact-finding process, reviewing courts have been willing to\n\nintervene when an error in the guilty plea process arguably\n\naffects   a      \"core    concern\"    of    Rule     11.    United      States    v.\n\nHernandez-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).                  This includes\n\nensuring that the defendant understands the elements of the\n\ncharges that the prosecution would have to prove at trial.                       See\n\nUnited States v. Ferguson, 60 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995); United\n\nStates v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4-6 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n516 U.S. 827 (1995).\n\n            We    think    that   this     core    requirement    has    not    been\n\nsatisfied here.          To sum up at the start, everyone involved--the\n\nprosecutor,       the      district      court       and   Gandia’s      counsel--\n\nmisunderstood the scienter element in the offense in a manner\n\nprejudicial to Gandia; and although we think that the facts\n\nproffered at the Rule 11 hearing would have provided an adequate\n\nbasis   for      accepting    the     plea,    the    factual    basis    was    not\n\noverwhelming as to the scienter element.                   In all, we are far\n\nfrom certain that Gandia would have agreed to plead guilty if he\n\nhad fully understood what the government had to prove as to\n\nscienter.     Cf. United States v. Abernathy, 83 F.3d 17, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             The original version of the carjacking statute enacted\n\nin   1992    required,    as   does   the    current     version,   that     the\n\ndefendant take a motor vehicle \"from the person or presence of\n\nanother     by   force   and   violence     or   by   intimidation\";   but    in\n\naddition, it also required that the defendant have possessed a\n\nfirearm.     18 U.S.C. § 2119 & note (1994).             In 1994, aiming to\n\nbroaden the statute,2 Congress struck the firearm requirement and\n\nsubstituted a requirement that the defendant act with \"the\n\nintent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\"                 Violent Crime\n\nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, §\n\n60003(a)(14) (internal quotations omitted).                Thus, the statute\n\nnow provides as follows:\n\n             Whoever, with the intent to cause death or\n             serious bodily harm[,] takes a motor vehicle\n             that has been transported, shipped, or\n             received in interstate or foreign commerce\n             from the person or presence of another by\n             force and violence or by intimidation, or\n             attempts to do so, shall\n\n                     (1) be fined under this title\n                     or imprisoned not more than 15\n                     years, or both,\n\n                     (2) if serious bodily injury\n                     . . . results, be fined under\n\n\n      2\n     See 140 Cong. Rec. E858 (daily ed. May 5, 1994) (extension\nof remarks by Rep. Franks) (\"My legislation is significant\nbecause it includes carjacking murders that do not involve the\nuse of a firearm.\"); 139 Cong. Rec. S15301 (daily ed. Nov. 8,\n1993) (statement of Sen. Lieberman) (\"This amendment will\nbroaden and strengthen [the carjacking] law . . . .\").\n\n                                      -7-\n\f                    this title or imprisoned not\n                    more than 25 years, or both,\n                    and\n\n                    (3)    if death results,     be\n                    fined under this title       or\n                    imprisoned for any number    of\n                    years up to life, or both,   or\n                    sentenced to death.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2119 (1994) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n           Gandia committed the Colon robbery six months after the\n\n1994    amendment   became   effective,   and   the   new   indictment\n\nexplicitly alleged an intent to cause death or serious bodily\n\nharm.    However, at the change-of-plea hearing, the district\n\njudge described count one to Gandia and, separately, told him\n\nwhat the government would have to prove to convict on count one.\n\nIn both instances, the court said that the required intent was\n\nthat Gandia \"knowingly and unlawfully\" have taken the motor\n\nvehicle; nowhere did the court tell Gandia that he would need to\n\nhave intended to kill or cause serious bodily harm.         Nothing in\n\nthe factual scenario described by the government or admitted by\n\nGandia specifically referred to an intent on Gandia’s part to\n\ncause death or serious bodily harm.\n\n           The district court's error may well have been caused\n\nby an earlier mistake by the prosecutor:          in both the plea\n\nagreement and the appended government version of the facts, no\n\nreference appears to any intent to cause death or bodily injury.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fInstead, both documents used the \"knowingly and unlawfully\"\n\nlanguage that reappeared in the judge's colloquy.              Thus, the\n\nindictment aside, Gandia was misadvised four times as to the\n\nscienter requirement and told that the only intent required of\n\nhim was that he have knowingly and unlawfully taken the car.\n\n          The error was less serious than might first appear\n\nbecause of the way in which the Supreme Court construed the new\n\nscienter requirement last year.      See Holloway v. United States,\n\n526 U.S. 1, 3 (1999).         Reading the statute in light of the\n\namendment’s purpose, the Court held that the intent to cause\n\ndeath or serious bodily harm could be satisfied not only by\n\n\"actual\" intent but also by \"conditional\" intent, that is, by a\n\nwillingness to cause death or serious bodily harm if necessary\n\nto hijack the car.      Id. at 11-12.    Thus, if Samuel Pizarro were\n\non trial and were shown to have fired the pistol immediately\n\nbefore fleeing in the car, it would be fairly easy to satisfy\n\nthe requirement as to him.\n\n          Assuming Gandia’s version of events, in which Samuel\n\nPizarro was the shooter, the case against Gandia is much closer.\n\nOf   course,   Gandia   was   involved   in   the   robbery   and,   under\n\nCommonwealth law, may have been responsible for the death.             But\n\nto convict him of carjacking, the government under              Holloway\n\nwould have to show at least a conditional intent to kill or\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fcause serious bodily injury.3          And while Samuel Pizarro showed\n\nhis   actual   intent   to   do   so   by   shooting   two   victims,   no\n\nequivalent evidence (so far as we know) is available against\n\nGandia.\n\n            This brings us to the question whether the misstatement\n\nof the scienter standard at the Rule 11 colloquy was likely\n\nenough to have influenced the plea so that the plea should now\n\nbe set aside.     It is settled law that an understanding of the\n\ncharges by the defendant is a critical element for a guilty\n\nplea.     Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 618-19 (1998);\n\nUnited States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 523 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).    Here, the indictment correctly tracked the statute, and\n\nGandia agreed that his counsel had discussed the indictment with\n\nhim; but whatever force this might have in other situations,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 350\n\n(1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d\n\n1215, 1221-22 (1st Cir. 1995),            cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1115\n\n(1996), the government in the plea agreement and the judge in\n\n\n\n\n      3\n     Although Gandia was also charged with aiding and abetting,\nthe government has assumed throughout that Gandia had to have\nthe intent required of a principal, and it has made no claim\nthat something less would do for an aider and abettor.       See\ngenerally United States v. Rosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 62-63 (1st\nCir. 2000).\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthe   hearing      then     proceeded    affirmatively     to     misstate   the\n\nscienter element.\n\n               This repeated misstatement, if accepted by Gandia,\n\ncould well have encouraged him to plead guilty.                   After all, a\n\ndefendant who honestly did not think that he had intended to\n\nkill or maim might well bridle if told that he had to admit to\n\nthis intent, even with the Holloway gloss.                Of course, if the\n\nevidence of the requisite intent were overwhelming--say, there\n\nwas direct evidence that Gandia himself had shot the victims--it\n\nwould     be    hard   to    think    that     the   misstatement    made    any\n\ndifference.        But here the evidence of conditional intent is\n\nindirect and far from overwhelming.             Thus, the error in the Rule\n\n11 colloquy was not harmless.\n\n               Nonetheless, because Gandia did not object or raise the\n\nscienter issue in the district court by a motion to withdraw the\n\nplea,     the   objection     has    been    forfeited   unless    the   mistake\n\nconstitutes \"plain error.\"            See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b);         United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-32 (1993).                Admittedly, our\n\ncase law is not perfectly uniform on this point, but most of our\n\nRule 11 cases have invoked the plain error standard;4 it accords\n\n\n      4\n     Since Olano, we have referred to the plain error standard\nin at least eight Rule 11 cases, e.g., United States v.\nMcKelvey, 203 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 2000), but, in several other\nrecent decisions, we have found it sufficient that the error was\nharmless and have declined to say what standard governed, e.g.,\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwith Rule 52 and its advisory committee notes; and it has been\n\nadopted by most of the circuits that have addressed the issue in\n\nthe Rule 11 context.          Among the other circuits, the Second,\n\nFourth, Sixth, Seventh and Eleventh have adopted the plain error\n\nstandard in Rule 11 cases, while the harmless error standard has\n\nbeen adopted by the Ninth Circuit and, in a footnote without\n\nanalysis, by the D.C. Circuit.           The case law is set forth in an\n\nappendix to this opinion.\n\n             The main practical difference between the two standards\n\nis   that    plain   error    requires    not    only   an   error    affecting\n\nsubstantial rights but also a finding by the reviewing court\n\nthat   the     error   has    \"seriously        affect[ed]      the   fairness,\n\nintegrity,     or    public   reputation        of   judicial    proceedings.\"\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 732 (quoting United States v. Young, 470 U.S.\n\n1, 15 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n\nUnited States v. Carrington, 96 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996), cert.\n\ndenied, 520 U.S. 1150 (1997).            The \"raise or waive\" principle,\n\nhere as with other kinds of error, serves obvious interests of\n\nfairness and judicial economy.            National Ass’n of Soc. Workers\n\nv. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir. 1995).                In sum, the less\n\ndemanding test of harmless error is used where an objection is\n\n\n\nUnited States v. Noriega-Milan, 110 F.3d 162, 166 & n.4 (1st\nCir. 1997).\n\n                                    -12-\n\fmade in the district court and thus properly preserved for\n\nappeal; but the bar rises--and the stiffer Olano plain-error\n\ntest applies--in the absence of an objection.               See generally\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 52.\n\n           One reason why confusion may have arisen in connection\n\nwith guilty pleas is Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).            This provision,\n\nadded by amendment to the rule governing guilty pleas, says (in\n\nsubstance) that harmless errors should be disregarded but says\n\nnothing about plain error.        However, Rule 11(h) was added by\n\namendment for a narrow purpose: to make clear that a Rule 11\n\nerror can be harmless, \"because some courts have read McCarthy\n\n[v.   United   States,   394   U.S.   459,   471   (1969)   (\"[P]rejudice\n\ninheres in a failure to comply with Rule 11 . . . .\"),] as\n\nmeaning that the general harmless error provisions in Rule 52(a)\n\ncannot be utilized with respect to Rule 11 proceedings.\"             Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(h) advisory committee's notes.\n\n           The \"fairness, integrity or reputation\" plain-error\n\nstandard is a flexible one and depends significantly on the\n\nnature of the error, its context, and the facts of the case.\n\nUnited States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 16 (1984); see Ferguson, 60\n\nF.3d at 2-4.    In the taking of a guilty plea under Rule 11, the\n\ncritical concerns are that the plea be voluntary and that there\n\nbe an admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other basis for\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fthinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty.            United\n\nStates v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 20 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nHere, as we have seen, the force of Gandia’s plea in evidencing\n\narguable guilt was substantially undercut by the misstatement of\n\nthe scienter standard.      Where, in addition, the other evidence\n\nof scienter was thin (although not beyond reasonable inference),\n\nwe think that the error was not merely \"harmful\" but also \"plain\n\nunder Olano,\" because it seriously affected the guilty plea\n\ncolloquy’s fairness and integrity.\n\n           Gandia's remaining claim on this appeal is that, quite\n\napart   from   the   scienter   element,   the   trial    court   erred    in\n\nfinding a factual basis for the plea.       Specifically, Gandia says\n\nthat no evidence exists that he intended to take Colon’s car or\n\nthat he had a conditional intent to kill or cause serious bodily\n\nharm.   Admittedly, nothing on either point is as conclusive as\n\nan admission by Gandia or unequivocal conduct by him (such as\n\npersonally shooting Colon and taking his car).            But in our view\n\nthere was enough to permit the district court to accept a guilty\n\nplea even if we assume, as we do, that Gandia's own statement of\n\nguilt contributed nothing on the intent-to-kill-or-injure issue\n\n(because of the misstatement of the scienter element).                    See\n\ngenerally Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 352;               United States v.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fPiper, 35 F.3d 611, 614 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S.\n\n1158 (1995).\n\n         To begin with the seizure of Colon’s car, it is true\n\nthat, under Gandia's version of the facts, Gandia entered it\n\nonly after Samuel Pizarro had driven it through the gate.   But\n\nGandia stood back only to let Samuel break the gate; and he\n\nadmitted during the colloquy with the district judge that he had\n\n\"knowingly\" taken the motor vehicle.   He now says that seizing\n\nthe car was the impulsive act of his partner, but the claim of\n\nimpulsiveness is at least debatable since, even under Gandia's\n\nversion of the facts, Ivan Pizarro had \"left\" his cousin and\n\nGandia at the scene, with no means of swift escape except to\n\ntake Colon’s car.\n\n         As for the conditional intent to kill or cause serious\n\nbodily harm, the government’s statement of facts, which Gandia\n\nacknowledged to be true, said that, on the day of the robbery,\n\nGandia and Samuel Pizarro obtained the pistol from Ivan Pizarro.\n\nWhether or not the weapon was given directly to Samuel Pizarro,\n\nit is reasonably inferrable that Gandia at least knew Samuel was\n\narmed with a weapon intended to be available in the robbery.\n\nPossibly Gandia thought that it would only be used to frighten.\n\nNevertheless, in context, one might infer that Gandia must have\n\n\n\n\n                             -15-\n\fknown that the pistol would be fired, if necessary, as indeed it\n\nwas.\n\n             On a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) is not whether\n\na jury would, or even would be likely, to convict:                      it is\n\nwhether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational\n\nbasis   in    facts     that   the   defendant      concedes    or   that   the\n\ngovernment proffers as supported by credible evidence.                      See\n\nMarrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 351.             Often what the judge is told\n\nat the hearing is an abbreviated version of the full range of\n\ngovernment evidence, omitting detail and nuance that would be\n\noffered at trial.        We think that Gandia's plea had a rational\n\nbasis in the facts and, if he had been advised of the proper\n\nscienter standard, we would uphold it.\n\n             There is one last wrinkle.           Gandia pled guilty to two\n\noffenses, not one, and the misstatement of the scienter element\n\npertained directly only to the carjacking count and not to the\n\nseparate firearms count.         However, quite apart from the package\n\ncharacter of the plea agreement, the firearms count itself\n\ndepended on use or carriage of the firearm \"during and in\n\nrelation     to   any   [federal]    crime   of    violence,\"   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n924(c)(1) (1994), and the only such federal crime of violence\n\ncharged against Gandia was carjacking.               Thus, without a valid\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fplea to the latter offense, an element of the firearm offense is\n\nlacking.\n\n           Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of conviction and\n\nsentence and remand for further proceedings, consistent with\n\nthis decision.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f                           APPENDIX\n\n\n  Circuits\nEndorsing a                 Supporting Citations\nPlain Error\n  Standard\n   Second     United States v.

On this  appeal he seeks to set aside his plea.  Because no trial has been  held, there is no definitive version of the facts of the underlying  crime.  Based on Gandia's version and that of the government (to  which Gandia did not object), the essential outline of events is as  follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 1995, in Vega Baja, in the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico, Ivan Pizarro-Torres invited Gandia to take a drive and  then asked him to rob Victor Colon-Ortiz, a lottery ticket seller. Gandia said he would not do the robbery alone, so Ivan Pizarro  enlisted his cousin, Samuel Pizarro, to join in the scheme.  Ivan  Pizarro then drove Gandia and Samuel Pizarro to a point near  Colon's home and departed with his vehicle, leaving Gandia and  Samuel Pizarro with Ivan's pistol.  Gandia and Samuel Pizarro  circled the house, spotted Colon in his carport, and approached  him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Samuel Pizarro announced that this was a hold-up; Colon  took out a knife and moved toward Samuel, and Samuel then shot  Colon five times, killing him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Colon's wife was also shot and  suffered serious injury but survived.  Samuel Pizarro proceeded to  drive Colon's car through a closed gate, and Gandia then joined  him.  After fleeing with Colon's car, the pair retrieved money from  the trunk of the car and shared it with Ivan Pizarro.  Some months  later, Gandia and another individual shot and killed Samuel  Pizarro.  Gandia is now serving a 30-year Commonwealth sentence for  that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1996, the government indicted Gandia and Ivan  Pizarro for carjacking and using a firearm in the course of  carjacking, directly and while aiding and abetting each other as  well as others not charged.  Samuel Pizarro was no longer available  as a witness, but Ivan Pizarro agreed to testify against Gandia,  and the government disclosed that it had recovered Gandia's  fingerprint from the trunk of Colon's car.  In light of this  evidence, Gandia and the government reached a plea agreement, which  provided for Gandia to plead guilty to both counts in exchange for  an agreed-upon sentence of 30 years for carjacking and a  consecutive 5-year sentence on the firearm count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 12, 1997, the district court conducted a change-of-plea hearing and accepted Gandia's guilty plea under Rule 11 of  the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  In the colloquy, Gandia  accepted as true the government's written version of facts attached  to the plea agreement, and he made a short statement inculpating  himself in the robbery.  After a presentence report, the court  imposed the agreed-upon sentence on October 7, 1997.  Gandia then  filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Gandia's counsel filed an Anders brief,  pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967).  In  response to this court's direction, Gandia's counsel briefed two  issues for our consideration.  One is whether Gandia's guilty plea  was invalid because the scienter element of the carjacking crime  was misstated at several points in the hearing, so that the plea  was not knowing and voluntary.  The other is whether the facts to  which Gandia admitted provide a sufficient factual basis for a plea  to the carjacking offense, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal  Procedure 11(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of guilty pleas reflects a fairly  specialized body of doctrine.  Failures to comply with very  specific, yet technical, requirements of Rule 11 are often found  \"harmless,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).  E.g., United States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S.  1062 (1998).  But, because a guilty plea is a shortcut around the  fact-finding process, reviewing courts have been willing to  intervene when an error in the guilty plea process arguably affects  a \"core concern\" of Rule 11.  United States v. Hernandez-Wilson,  186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).  This includes ensuring that the  defendant understands the elements of the charges that the  prosecution would have to prove at trial.  See United States v. Ferguson, 60 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4-6 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 827  (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this core requirement has not been  satisfied here.  To sum up at the start, everyone involved--the  prosecutor, the district court and Gandia's counsel--misunderstood  the scienter element in the offense in a manner prejudicial to  Gandia; and although we think that the facts proffered at the Rule  11 hearing would have provided an adequate basis for accepting the  plea, the factual basis was not overwhelming as to the scienter  element.  In all, we are far from certain that Gandia would have  agreed to plead guilty if he had fully understood what the  government had to prove as to scienter.  Cf. United States v. Abernathy, 83 F.3d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original version of the carjacking statute enacted in  1992 required, as does the current version, that the defendant take  a motor vehicle \"from the person or presence of another by force  and violence or by intimidation\"; but in addition, it also required  that the defendant have possessed a firearm.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 &amp;  note (1994).  In 1994, aiming to broaden the statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Congress  struck the firearm requirement and substituted a requirement that  the defendant act with \"the intent to cause death or serious bodily  harm.\"  Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.  L. No. 103-322, &#167; 60003(a)(14) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, the statute now provides as follows:  Whoever, with the intent to cause death or  serious bodily harm[,] takes a motor vehicle  that has been transported, shipped, or  received in interstate or foreign commerce  from the person or presence of another by  force and violence or by intimidation, or  attempts to do so, shall</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1)  be fined under this title  or imprisoned not more than 15  years, or both,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2)  if serious bodily injury .  . . results, be fined under this  title or imprisoned not more  than 25 years, or both, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3)  if death results, be fined  under this title or imprisoned  for any number of years up to  life, or both, or sentenced to  death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 (1994) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gandia committed the Colon robbery six months after the  1994 amendment became effective, and the new indictment explicitly  alleged an intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.  However,  at the change-of-plea hearing, the district judge described count  one to Gandia and, separately, told him what the government would  have to prove to convict on count one.  In both instances, the  court said that the required intent was that Gandia \"knowingly and  unlawfully\" have taken the motor vehicle; nowhere did the court  tell Gandia that he would need to have intended to kill or cause  serious bodily harm.  Nothing in the factual scenario described by  the government or admitted by Gandia specifically referred to an  intent on Gandia's part to cause death or serious bodily harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's error may well have been caused by  an earlier mistake by the prosecutor:  in both the plea agreement  and the appended government version of the facts, no reference  appears to any intent to cause death or bodily injury.  Instead,  both documents used the \"knowingly and unlawfully\" language that  reappeared in the judge's colloquy.  Thus, the indictment aside,  Gandia was misadvised four times as to the scienter requirement and  told that the only intent required of him was that he have  knowingly and unlawfully taken the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The error was less serious than might first appear because of the way in which the Supreme Court construed the new  scienter requirement last year.  See Holloway v. United States, 526  U.S. 1, 3 (1999).  Reading the statute in light of the amendment's  purpose, the Court held that the intent to cause death or serious  bodily harm could be satisfied not only by \"actual\" intent but also  by \"conditional\" intent, that is, by a willingness to cause death  or serious bodily harm if necessary to hijack the car.  Id. at 11-12.  Thus, if Samuel Pizarro were on trial and were shown to have  fired the pistol immediately before fleeing in the car, it would be  fairly easy to satisfy the requirement as to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming Gandia's version of events, in which Samuel  Pizarro was the shooter, the case against Gandia is much closer. Of course, Gandia was involved in the robbery and, under  Commonwealth law, may have been responsible for the death.  But to  convict him of carjacking, the government under Holloway would have  to show at least a conditional intent to kill or cause serious  bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And while Samuel Pizarro showed his actual intent  to do so by shooting two victims, no equivalent evidence (so far as  we know) is available against Gandia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the question whether the misstatement  of the scienter standard at the Rule 11 colloquy was likely enough  to have influenced the plea so that the plea should now be set  aside.  It is settled law that an understanding of the charges by  the defendant is a critical element for a guilty plea.  Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 618-19 (1998); United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 523 (1st Cir. 1996).  Here, the  indictment correctly tracked the statute, and Gandia agreed that  his counsel had discussed the indictment with him; but whatever  force this might have in other situations, see, e.g., United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 350 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1221-22 (1st Cir. 1995), cert.  denied, 517 U.S. 1115 (1996), the government in the plea agreement  and the judge in the hearing then proceeded affirmatively to  misstate the scienter element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This repeated misstatement, if accepted by Gandia, could  well have encouraged him to plead guilty.  After all, a defendant  who honestly did not think that he had intended to kill or maim  might well bridle if told that he had to admit to this intent, even  with the Holloway gloss.  Of course, if the evidence of the  requisite intent were overwhelming--say, there was direct evidence  that Gandia himself had shot the victims--it would be hard to think  that the misstatement made any difference.  But here the evidence  of conditional intent is indirect and far from overwhelming.  Thus,  the error in the Rule 11 colloquy was not harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, because Gandia did not object or raise the  scienter issue in the district court by a motion to withdraw the  plea, the objection has been forfeited unless the mistake  constitutes \"plain error.\"  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b);  United  States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-32 (1993).  Admittedly, our case  law is not perfectly uniform on this point, but most of our Rule 11  cases have invoked the plain error standard;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it accords with Rule  52 and its advisory committee notes; and it has been adopted by  most of the circuits that have addressed the issue in the Rule 11  context.  Among the other circuits, the Second, Fourth, Sixth,  Seventh and Eleventh have adopted the plain error standard in Rule  11 cases, while the harmless error standard has been adopted by the  Ninth Circuit and, in a footnote without analysis, by the D.C.  Circuit.  The case law is set forth in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main practical difference between the two standards  is that plain error requires not only an error affecting  substantial rights but also a finding by the reviewing court that  the error has \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or  public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 732  (quoting United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985)) (internal  quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Carrington, 96  F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1150 (1997).  The  \"raise or waive\" principle, here as with other kinds of error,  serves obvious interests of fairness and judicial economy. National Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st  Cir. 1995).  In sum, the less demanding test of harmless error is  used where an objection is made in the district court and thus  properly preserved for appeal; but the bar rises--and the stiffer Olano plain-error test applies--in the absence of an objection. See generally Fed. R. Crim. P. 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One reason why confusion may have arisen in connection  with guilty pleas is Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).  This provision, added  by amendment to the rule governing guilty pleas, says (in  substance) that harmless errors should be disregarded but says  nothing about plain error.  However, Rule 11(h) was added by  amendment for a narrow purpose: to make clear that a Rule 11 error can be harmless, \"because some courts have read McCarthy [v. United  States, 394 U.S. 459, 471 (1969) (\"[P]rejudice inheres in a failure  to comply with Rule 11 . . . .\"),] as meaning that the general  harmless error provisions in Rule 52(a) cannot be utilized with  respect to Rule 11 proceedings.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h) advisory  committee's notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"fairness, integrity or reputation\" plain-error  standard is a flexible one and depends significantly on the nature  of the error, its context, and the facts of the case.  United  States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 16 (1984); see Ferguson, 60 F.3d at 2-4.  In the taking of a guilty plea under Rule 11, the critical  concerns are that the plea be voluntary and that there be an  admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other basis for thinking that  the defendant is at least arguably guilty.  United States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 20 (1st Cir. 1997).  Here, as we  have seen, the force of Gandia's plea in evidencing arguable guilt  was substantially undercut by the misstatement of the scienter  standard.  Where, in addition, the other evidence of scienter was  thin (although not beyond reasonable inference), we think that the  error was not merely \"harmful\" but also \"plain under Olano,\"  because it seriously affected the guilty plea colloquy's fairness  and integrity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gandia's remaining claim on this appeal is that, quite  apart from the scienter element, the trial court erred in finding  a factual basis for the plea.  Specifically, Gandia says that no  evidence exists that he intended to take Colon's car or that he had  a conditional intent to kill or cause serious bodily harm. Admittedly, nothing on either point is as conclusive as an  admission by Gandia or unequivocal conduct by him (such as  personally shooting Colon and taking his car).  But in our view  there was enough to permit the district court to accept a guilty  plea even if we assume, as we do, that Gandia's own statement of  guilt contributed nothing on the intent-to-kill-or-injure issue  (because of the misstatement of the scienter element).  See  generally Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 352; United States v. Piper,  35 F.3d 611, 614 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1158  (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with the seizure of Colon's car, it is true  that, under Gandia's version of the facts, Gandia entered it only  after Samuel Pizarro had driven it through the gate.  But Gandia  stood back only to let Samuel break the gate; and he admitted  during the colloquy with the district judge that he had \"knowingly\"  taken the motor vehicle.  He now says that seizing the car was the  impulsive act of his partner, but the claim of impulsiveness is at  least debatable since, even under Gandia's version of the facts,  Ivan Pizarro had \"left\" his cousin and Gandia at the scene, with no  means of swift escape except to take Colon's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the conditional intent to kill or cause serious  bodily harm, the government's statement of facts, which Gandia  acknowledged to be true, said that, on the day of the robbery,  Gandia and Samuel Pizarro obtained the pistol from Ivan Pizarro. Whether or not the weapon was given directly to Samuel Pizarro, it  is reasonably inferrable that Gandia at least knew Samuel was armed  with a weapon intended to be available in the robbery.  Possibly  Gandia thought that it would only be used to frighten. Nevertheless, in context, one might infer that Gandia must have  known that the pistol would be fired, if necessary, as indeed it  was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) is not whether  a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict:  it is whether  there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in  facts that the defendant concedes or that the government proffers  as supported by credible evidence.  See Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at  351.  Often what the judge is told at the hearing is an abbreviated  version of the full range of government evidence, omitting detail  and nuance that would be offered at trial.  We think that Gandia's  plea had a rational basis in the facts and, if he had been advised  of the proper scienter standard, we would uphold it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one last wrinkle.  Gandia pled guilty to two  offenses, not one, and the misstatement of the scienter element  pertained directly only to the carjacking count and not to the  separate firearms count.  However, quite apart from the package  character of the plea agreement, the firearms count itself depended  on use or carriage of the firearm \"during and in relation to any  [federal] crime of violence,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) (1994), and the  only such federal crime of violence charged against Gandia was  carjacking.  Thus, without a valid plea to the latter offense, an  element of the firearm offense is lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of conviction and  sentence and remand for further proceedings, consistent with this  decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>      This version of the shooting was supplied by Gandia himself  at his change-of-plea hearing.

On this  appeal he seeks to set aside his plea.  Because no trial has been  held, there is no definitive version of the facts of the underlying  crime.  Based on Gandia's version and that of the government (to  which Gandia did not object), the essential outline of events is as  follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 1995, in Vega Baja, in the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico, Ivan Pizarro-Torres invited Gandia to take a drive and  then asked him to rob Victor Colon-Ortiz, a lottery ticket seller. Gandia said he would not do the robbery alone, so Ivan Pizarro  enlisted his cousin, Samuel Pizarro, to join in the scheme.  Ivan  Pizarro then drove Gandia and Samuel Pizarro to a point near  Colon's home and departed with his vehicle, leaving Gandia and  Samuel Pizarro with Ivan's pistol.  Gandia and Samuel Pizarro  circled the house, spotted Colon in his carport, and approached  him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Samuel Pizarro announced that this was a hold-up; Colon  took out a knife and moved toward Samuel, and Samuel then shot  Colon five times, killing him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Colon's wife was also shot and  suffered serious injury but survived.  Samuel Pizarro proceeded to  drive Colon's car through a closed gate, and Gandia then joined  him.  After fleeing with Colon's car, the pair retrieved money from  the trunk of the car and shared it with Ivan Pizarro.  Some months  later, Gandia and another individual shot and killed Samuel  Pizarro.  Gandia is now serving a 30-year Commonwealth sentence for  that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1996, the government indicted Gandia and Ivan  Pizarro for carjacking and using a firearm in the course of  carjacking, directly and while aiding and abetting each other as  well as others not charged.  Samuel Pizarro was no longer available  as a witness, but Ivan Pizarro agreed to testify against Gandia,  and the government disclosed that it had recovered Gandia's  fingerprint from the trunk of Colon's car.  In light of this  evidence, Gandia and the government reached a plea agreement, which  provided for Gandia to plead guilty to both counts in exchange for  an agreed-upon sentence of 30 years for carjacking and a  consecutive 5-year sentence on the firearm count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 12, 1997, the district court conducted a change-of-plea hearing and accepted Gandia's guilty plea under Rule 11 of  the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  In the colloquy, Gandia  accepted as true the government's written version of facts attached  to the plea agreement, and he made a short statement inculpating  himself in the robbery.  After a presentence report, the court  imposed the agreed-upon sentence on October 7, 1997.  Gandia then  filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Gandia's counsel filed an Anders brief,  pursuant to Anders v.

In  response to this court's direction, Gandia's counsel briefed two  issues for our consideration.  One is whether Gandia's guilty plea  was invalid because the scienter element of the carjacking crime  was misstated at several points in the hearing, so that the plea  was not knowing and voluntary.  The other is whether the facts to  which Gandia admitted provide a sufficient factual basis for a plea  to the carjacking offense, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal  Procedure 11(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of guilty pleas reflects a fairly  specialized body of doctrine.  Failures to comply with very  specific, yet technical, requirements of Rule 11 are often found  \"harmless,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).  E.g., United States v. McDonald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744603\"><a href=\"/opinion/744603/united-states-v-cecilio-f-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">1062</span> </span>(1998).  But, because a guilty plea is a shortcut around the  fact-finding process, reviewing courts have been willing to  intervene when an error in the guilty plea process arguably affects  a \"core concern\" of Rule 11.  United States v. Hernandez-Wilson,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198576\"><a href=\"/opinion/198576/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).  This includes ensuring that the  defendant understands the elements of the charges that the  prosecution would have to prove at trial.  See United States v. Ferguson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196190\"><a href=\"/opinion/196190/united-states-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.

To sum up at the start, everyone involved--the  prosecutor, the district court and Gandia's counsel--misunderstood  the scienter element in the offense in a manner prejudicial to  Gandia; and although we think that the facts proffered at the Rule  11 hearing would have provided an adequate basis for accepting the  plea, the factual basis was not overwhelming as to the scienter  element.  In all, we are far from certain that Gandia would have  agreed to plead guilty if he had fully understood what the  government had to prove as to scienter.  Cf. United States v. Abernathy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196741\"><a href=\"/opinion/196741/united-states-v-abernathy/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original version of the carjacking statute enacted in  1992 required, as does the current version, that the defendant take  a motor vehicle \"from the person or presence of another by force  and violence or by intimidation\"; but in addition, it also required  that the defendant have possessed a firearm.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 &amp;  note (1994).  In 1994, aiming to broaden the statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Congress  struck the firearm requirement and substituted a requirement that  the defendant act with \"the intent to cause death or serious bodily  harm.\"  Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.

Thus, the statute now provides as follows:  Whoever, with the intent to cause death or  serious bodily harm[,] takes a motor vehicle  that has been transported, shipped, or  received in interstate or foreign commerce  from the person or presence of another by  force and violence or by intimidation, or  attempts to do so, shall</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1)  be fined under this title  or imprisoned not more than 15  years, or both,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2)  if serious bodily injury .  . . results, be fined under this  title or imprisoned not more  than 25 years, or both, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3)  if death results, be fined  under this title or imprisoned  for any number of years up to  life, or both, or sentenced to  death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 (1994) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gandia committed the Colon robbery six months after the  1994 amendment became effective, and the new indictment explicitly  alleged an intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.  However,  at the change-of-plea hearing, the district judge described count  one to Gandia and, separately, told him what the government would  have to prove to convict on count one.  In both instances, the  court said that the required intent was that Gandia \"knowingly and  unlawfully\" have taken the motor vehicle; nowhere did the court  tell Gandia that he would need to have intended to kill or cause  serious bodily harm.  Nothing in the factual scenario described by  the government or admitted by Gandia specifically referred to an  intent on Gandia's part to cause death or serious bodily harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's error may well have been caused by  an earlier mistake by the prosecutor:  in both the plea agreement  and the appended government version of the facts, no reference  appears to any intent to cause death or bodily injury.  Instead,  both documents used the \"knowingly and unlawfully\" language that  reappeared in the judge's colloquy.  Thus, the indictment aside,  Gandia was misadvised four times as to the scienter requirement and  told that the only intent required of him was that he have  knowingly and unlawfully taken the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The error was less serious than might first appear because of the way in which the Supreme Court construed the new  scienter requirement last year.  See Holloway v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118265\"><a href=\"/opinion/118265/holloway-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1999).  Reading the statute in light of the amendment's  purpose, the Court held that the intent to cause death or serious  bodily harm could be satisfied not only by \"actual\" intent but also  by \"conditional\" intent, that is, by a willingness to cause death  or serious bodily harm if necessary to hijack the car.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118265\"><a href=\"/opinion/118265/holloway-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 11-12. </a></span> Thus, if Samuel Pizarro were on trial and were shown to have  fired the pistol immediately before fleeing in the car, it would be  fairly easy to satisfy the requirement as to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming Gandia's version of events, in which Samuel  Pizarro was the shooter, the case against Gandia is much closer. Of course, Gandia was involved in the robbery and, under  Commonwealth law, may have been responsible for the death.  But to  convict him of carjacking, the government under Holloway would have  to show at least a conditional intent to kill or cause serious  bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And while Samuel Pizarro showed his actual intent  to do so by shooting two victims, no equivalent evidence (so far as  we know) is available against Gandia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the question whether the misstatement  of the scienter standard at the Rule 11 colloquy was likely enough  to have influenced the plea so that the plea should now be set  aside.  It is settled law that an understanding of the charges by  the defendant is a critical element for a guilty plea.  Bousley v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 618-19 (1998); United States v.

Here, the  indictment correctly tracked the statute, and Gandia agreed that  his counsel had discussed the indictment with him; but whatever  force this might have in other situations, see, e.g., United States v. Marrero-Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197543\"><a href=\"/opinion/197543/united-states-v-marrero-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 350 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v.

After all, a defendant  who honestly did not think that he had intended to kill or maim  might well bridle if told that he had to admit to this intent, even  with the Holloway gloss.  Of course, if the evidence of the  requisite intent were overwhelming--say, there was direct evidence  that Gandia himself had shot the victims--it would be hard to think  that the misstatement made any difference.  But here the evidence  of conditional intent is indirect and far from overwhelming.  Thus,  the error in the Rule 11 colloquy was not harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, because Gandia did not object or raise the  scienter issue in the district court by a motion to withdraw the  plea, the objection has been forfeited unless the mistake  constitutes \"plain error.\"  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b);  United  States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 731-32 (1993).  Admittedly, our case  law is not perfectly uniform on this point, but most of our Rule 11  cases have invoked the plain error standard;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it accords with Rule  52 and its advisory committee notes; and it has been adopted by  most of the circuits that have addressed the issue in the Rule 11  context.

In sum, the less demanding test of harmless error is  used where an objection is made in the district court and thus  properly preserved for appeal; but the bar rises--and the stiffer Olano plain-error test applies--in the absence of an objection. See generally Fed. R. Crim. P. 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One reason why confusion may have arisen in connection  with guilty pleas is Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).  This provision, added  by amendment to the rule governing guilty pleas, says (in  substance) that harmless errors should be disregarded but says  nothing about plain error.  However, Rule 11(h) was added by  amendment for a narrow purpose: to make clear that a Rule 11 error can be harmless, \"because some courts have read McCarthy [v. United  States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107892\"><a href=\"/opinion/107892/mccarthy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span>, 471 (1969) (\"[P]rejudice inheres in a failure  to comply with Rule 11 . . . .\"),] as meaning that the general  harmless error provisions in Rule 52(a) cannot be utilized with  respect to Rule 11 proceedings.\"  Fed.

In the taking of a guilty plea under Rule 11, the critical  concerns are that the plea be voluntary and that there be an  admission, colloquy, proffer, or some other basis for thinking that  the defendant is at least arguably guilty.  United States v. Santiago-Becerril, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197654\"><a href=\"/opinion/197654/united-states-v-santiago-becerril/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1997).  Here, as we  have seen, the force of Gandia's plea in evidencing arguable guilt  was substantially undercut by the misstatement of the scienter  standard.  Where, in addition, the other evidence of scienter was  thin (although not beyond reasonable inference), we think that the  error was not merely \"harmful\" but also \"plain under Olano,\"  because it seriously affected the guilty plea colloquy's fairness  and integrity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gandia's remaining claim on this appeal is that, quite  apart from the scienter element, the trial court erred in finding  a factual basis for the plea.  Specifically, Gandia says that no  evidence exists that he intended to take Colon's car or that he had  a conditional intent to kill or cause serious bodily harm. Admittedly, nothing on either point is as conclusive as an  admission by Gandia or unequivocal conduct by him (such as  personally shooting Colon and taking his car).  But in our view  there was enough to permit the district court to accept a guilty  plea even if we assume, as we do, that Gandia's own statement of  guilt contributed nothing on the intent-to-kill-or-injure issue  (because of the misstatement of the scienter element).

But Gandia  stood back only to let Samuel break the gate; and he admitted  during the colloquy with the district judge that he had \"knowingly\"  taken the motor vehicle.  He now says that seizing the car was the  impulsive act of his partner, but the claim of impulsiveness is at  least debatable since, even under Gandia's version of the facts,  Ivan Pizarro had \"left\" his cousin and Gandia at the scene, with no  means of swift escape except to take Colon's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the conditional intent to kill or cause serious  bodily harm, the government's statement of facts, which Gandia  acknowledged to be true, said that, on the day of the robbery,  Gandia and Samuel Pizarro obtained the pistol from Ivan Pizarro. Whether or not the weapon was given directly to Samuel Pizarro, it  is reasonably inferrable that Gandia at least knew Samuel was armed  with a weapon intended to be available in the robbery.  Possibly  Gandia thought that it would only be used to frighten. Nevertheless, in context, one might infer that Gandia must have  known that the pistol would be fired, if necessary, as indeed it  was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a plea, the question under Rule 11(f) is not whether  a jury would, or even would be likely, to convict:  it is whether  there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in  facts that the defendant concedes or that the government proffers  as supported by credible evidence.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197543\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Marrero-Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197543/united-states-v-marrero-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>.  Often what the judge is told at the hearing is an abbreviated  version of the full range of government evidence, omitting detail  and nuance that would be offered at trial.  We think that Gandia's  plea had a rational basis in the facts and, if he had been advised  of the proper scienter standard, we would uphold it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one last wrinkle.  Gandia pled guilty to two  offenses, not one, and the misstatement of the scienter element  pertained directly only to the carjacking count and not to the  separate firearms count.  However, quite apart from the package  character of the plea agreement, the firearms count itself depended  on use or carriage of the firearm \"during and in relation to any  [federal] crime of violence,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) (1994), and the  only such federal crime of violence charged against Gandia was  carjacking.
