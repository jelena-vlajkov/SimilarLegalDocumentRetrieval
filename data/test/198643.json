Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n          Selya, Boudin, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Daniel M. Shea, with whom Smith, Currie &amp; Hancock, LLP, Harry\r\nT. Daniels, and Hale &amp; Dorr, LLP, were on brief, for appellant.\r\n   Barry Ravech for Eileen M. Ricci.\r\n   Cheryl Pinarchick, with whom James W. Stoll, and Brown,\r\nRudnick, Freed &amp; Gesmer were on brief, for Bomont Graphics\r\nTechnology, Inc.\r\n\nSeptember 15, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant Lanier\r\nProfessional Services, Inc. (\"Lanier\"), brought this action against\r\nits former employee Eileen M. Ricci and her new employer, Bomont\r\nGraphics Technology, Inc. (\"Bomont\").  Lanier requested, inter\r\nalia, a preliminary injunction barring Ricci from working for\r\nBomont in violation of a noncompetition provision in Ricci's\r\nemployment agreement with Lanier.  That provision requires that\r\nRicci not sell \"Facilities Mgmt [Management] Services\" for one year\r\nafter her employment with Lanier, which ended in November 1998. \r\nLanier also sought to enjoin both defendants from using\r\nconfidential information and trade secrets that Ricci had allegedly\r\nmisappropriated from Lanier.  The district court denied the motion\r\nfor a preliminary injunction, concluding that Lanier had not shown\r\na likelihood of success on the merits.  We affirm.\r\n                              I.\r\nRicci was employed by Copytech Printing, Inc.\r\n(\"Copytech\"), from 1991 to 1996.  She sold printing and copying\r\nservices to various clients including members of MASCO, a\r\nconsortium of colleges and hospitals located in Boston's Longwood\r\nMedical Area.  She also supervised a printing and copying center\r\noperated by Copytech at a facility in Boston leased from MASCO.  In\r\nFebruary 1996, Lanier purchased Copytech.  As a condition of\r\ncontinued employment with Lanier, Ricci was required to sign a\r\nstandard-form Lanier Employment Agreement that included the\r\nfollowing provision: \"During the term of employment with the\r\nCompany and for a period of one (1) year after termination of\r\nemployment hereunder . . . Employee will not, directly or\r\nindirectly, on Employee's own behalf or for others, demonstrate,\r\nservice, or sell products or perform services in the Territory[]\r\nthat are competitive with the Products . . . .\"  The \"Products\"\r\nwere defined by checking the appropriate items from a list; on\r\nRicci's agreement, only \"Facilities Mgmt Services\" was checked.\r\nRicci performed the same type of work for Lanier that she\r\nhad for Copytech, selling off-site printing and copying services\r\nand overseeing the copy center. Ricci resigned from Lanier on\r\nNovember 30, 1998, and began working for Bomont in December 1998 as\r\nits sole outside salesperson.  A small printing shop specializing\r\nin large-format, full-color printing, Bomont to some degree\r\ncompetes with Lanier (and many others) in the Boston printing\r\nmarket.  In her new job Ricci has won at least two former Lanier\r\naccounts for Bomont.\r\nLanier filed suit against Ricci and Bomont in the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts in February\r\n1999, seeking damages and a preliminary and permanent injunction. \r\nAfter reviewing the affidavits submitted by the parties and hearing\r\nargument, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. \r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n                             II.\r\nWe review the denial of a request for a preliminary\r\ninjunction for abuse of discretion, see Hiller Cranberry Products,\r\nInc. v. Koplovsky, 165 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1999), but \"rulings on\r\nabstract legal issues remain reviewable de novo, and findings of\r\nfact are assessed for clear error,\" Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.\r\nv. PepsiCo, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 61 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998). \"The\r\nappealing party bears the considerable burden of demonstrating that\r\nthe District Court flouted the four-part test for preliminary\r\ninjunctive relief.\"  Used Tire Int'l, Inc. v. Diaz-Saldana, 155\r\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).  That\r\nfamiliar four-part test requires the plaintiff to show: \"(1) it is\r\nsubstantially likely to succeed on the merits of its claim; (2)\r\nabsent the injunction there is a significant risk of irreparable\r\nharm; (3) the balance of hardships weighs in its favor; and (4) the\r\ninjunction will not harm the public interest.\"  I.P. Lund Trading\r\nApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).  We apply the federal preliminary\r\ninjunction standard in a diversity case, at least where the parties\r\nhave not suggested that state law supplies meaningfully different\r\ncriteria.  See Ocean Spray, 160 F.3d at 61.  We have also noted\r\nthat \"Massachusetts standards for a preliminary injunction do not\r\nseem markedly different\" than ours.  Id. (citing Packaging Indus.\r\nGroup, Inc. v. Cheney, 405 N.E.2d 106, 111-12 (Mass. 1980)).\r\n                             III.\r\nThe primary issue in this appeal involves the\r\ninterpretation of the term \"facilities management services,\" which\r\nthe noncompetition agreement bars Ricci from selling until\r\nNovember 30, 1999.  The district court found that term ambiguous,\r\nconstrued the agreement against the drafter, Lanier, and concluded\r\nthat Lanier had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of\r\nsuccess in proving that Ricci had violated the agreement.\r\nThere appears to be no dispute that facilities management\r\nservices refers primarily to support services that the client\r\nwishes to \"out-source\" to an outside provider who works on-site at\r\na client's place of business.  Facilities management services are\r\nan important and growing part of Lanier's business in Boston.  The\r\ndispute in this case relates to off-site printing services, not\r\nperformed at the client's place of business, which Ricci sold for\r\nCopytech and Lanier, and now sells for Bomont.  Ricci and Bomont\r\ncontend that such off-site services are not facilities management\r\nservices as that term is used in the printing and copying industry,\r\nand as it was used at Lanier while Ricci worked there.  Lanier, on\r\nthe other hand, asserts that facilities management services include\r\noff-site printing.\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, a contract term is ambiguous\r\nwhen its language is \"reasonably prone to different\r\ninterpretations\" or \"susceptible to differing, but nonetheless\r\nplausible, constructions.\"  Alison H. v. Byard, 163 F.3d 2, 6 (1st\r\nCir. 1998); see also Bercume v. Bercume, 704 N.E.2d 177, 182 (Mass.\r\n1999).  Whether a term is ambiguous is a question of law.  See\r\nAlison H., 163 F.3d at 6.\r\nWe agree with the district court that the term\r\n\"facilities management services,\" undefined in the agreement, is\r\ninescapably ambiguous as a matter of law.  When contractual\r\nlanguage is ambiguous, its meaning is a question of fact.  See Den\r\nnorske Bank AS v. First National Bank, 75 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.\r\n1996). The resolution of the ambiguity turns on the parties'\r\nintent, as \"discerned by the factfinder from the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the ambiguity and from such reasonable inferences as\r\nmay be available.\"  Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100 F.3d\r\n203, 211 (1st Cir. 1996).  Extrinsic evidence is admissible to\r\nassist the factfinder in resolving the ambiguity, including\r\nevidence of, in descending order of importance: (1) the parties'\r\nnegotiations concerning the contract at issue; (2) their course of\r\nperformance; and (3) trade usage in the relevant industry.  See\r\nDen norske, 75 F.3d at 52-53; see also Keating v. Stadium\r\nManagement Corp., 508 N.E.2d 121, 123 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987).  In\r\nsupport of their competing definitions of facilities management\r\nservices, the parties offered evidence in each of those three\r\ncategories, the defendants focusing on the first and third and\r\nLanier on the second.\r\nThere were no negotiations.  Ricci was presented with a\r\nstandard-form employment agreement and told she had to sign it to\r\nretain her position.  Ricci, however, stated in her affidavit that\r\nat the time she signed the agreement, she did not believe that her\r\nwork could be characterized as facilities management services, and\r\nthat she shared that view at the time with a fellow employee, Todd\r\nNugent.  Nugent's affidavit corroborates Ricci's.  Ricci also\r\nstated that she thought that she might be asked to sell such\r\nfacilities management services in the future, thus explaining the\r\nseeming oddity of Lanier requiring her to sign a noncompetition\r\nagreement covering a product that she had never sold.\r\nRicci and Bomont also offered significant evidence\r\nconcerning the usage of the term facilities management services in\r\nthe trade.  See Atlantic Track &amp; Turnout Co. v. Perini Corp., 989\r\nF.2d 541, 543 (1st Cir. 1993) (trade usage may be used to help\r\ndiscern meaning of ambiguous contract term).  That evidence\r\nincluded affidavits from Ricci, five other former Lanier employees,\r\nan employee of another copying and facilities management company,\r\nand an owner of Bomont.  They all agreed that off-site printing,\r\nwhich Ricci sold for Lanier and now sells for Bomont, is not\r\nconsidered facilities management in the printing and copying trade\r\nor was not so considered at Lanier when Ricci worked there.  \r\nLanier focused primarily on the undisputed fact that\r\nRicci worked for Lanier for almost three years and that her\r\nemployment agreement prohibited her from competing when she left\r\nthe company in providing facilities management services.  See Lembo\r\nv. Waters, 294 N.E.2d 566, 569 (Mass. App. Ct. 1973) (court may\r\nresort to conduct of parties to determine meaning they put on\r\nambiguous contract term).  That fact, according to Lanier, shows\r\nRicci's acquiescence in its definition of the term.  There is an\r\nintuitive appeal to the notion that Ricci should have understood\r\nthat when the employment agreement barred her from selling\r\nfacilities management services for a year after leaving Lanier, the\r\nintent was to cover the sort of services that she in fact sold for\r\nLanier.  This evidence certainly has some probative value. \r\nHowever, it did not compel a finding by the court that Ricci\r\nacquiesced in Lanier's understanding by performing under the\r\nagreement.\r\nUnable to resolve the ambiguity in the contract language,\r\nthe court properly resorted to the familiar principle that an\r\nambiguous \"post-employment restraint imposed by the employer's\r\nstandardized form contract\" will be construed against the drafter. \r\nSentry Ins. v. Firnstein, 442 N.E.2d 46, 46-47 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1982) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts  188 cmt. g\r\n(1981)).  The court's conclusion that Lanier had not demonstrated\r\na substantial likelihood of success on the merits reflected \r\nfactual findings that are not clearly erroneous and a correct\r\nunderstanding of the law.  The court's denial of a preliminary\r\ninjunction, therefore, was not an abuse of discretion.\r\n                            IV.\r\nLanier also argues that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion by refusing to enter an injunction barring Ricci from\r\ndisclosing, and Bomont from making use of, confidential information\r\nmisappropriated from Lanier.  That argument requires little\r\ndiscussion.  Lanier's scant evidence that Ricci had appropriated\r\ninformation consisted primarily of the affidavit of Ricci's\r\nsuccessor, who stated that he had \"received information which led\r\n[him] to believe Ricci may have removed documents from Lanier's\r\nfiles prior to her resignation.\"  As the district court found, that\r\naffidavit was so devoid of content as to be \"practically\r\nworthless.\"\r\nEven assuming that Lanier had shown that Ricci had\r\nmisappropriated documents, it offered no evidence that those\r\ndocuments contained confidential information or trade secrets. \r\nAlthough Ricci's employment agreement contained a nondisclosure\r\nclause, \"[s]uch an agreement cannot make secret that which is not\r\nsecret . . . .\"  Dynamics Research Corp. v. Analytic Sciences\r\nCorp., 400 N.E.2d 1274, 1288 (Mass. App. Ct. 1980).  The district\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

(\"Lanier\"), brought this action against its former employee Eileen M. Ricci and her new employer, Bomont Graphics Technology, Inc. (\"Bomont\"). Lanier requested, inter alia, a preliminary injunction barring Ricci from working for Bomont in violation of a non-competition provision in Ricci's employment agreement with Lanier. That provision requires that Ricci not sell \"Facilities Mgmt [Management] Services\" for one year after her employment with Lanier, which ended in November 1998. Lanier also sought to enjoin both defendants from using confidential information and trade secrets that Ricci had allegedly misappropriated from Lanier. The district court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that Lanier had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ricci was employed by Copytech Printing, Inc. (\"Copytech\"), from 1991 to 1996. She sold printing and copying services to various clients including members of MASCO, a consortium of colleges and hospitals located in Boston's Longwood Medical Area. She also supervised a printing and copying center operated by Copytech at a facility in Boston leased from MASCO. In February 1996, Lanier purchased Copytech. As a condition of continued employment with Lanier, Ricci was required to sign a standard-form Lanier Employment Agreement that included the following provision: \"During the term of employment with the Company and for a period of one (1) year after termination of employment hereunder... Employee will not, directly or indirectly, on Employee's own behalf or for others, demonstrate, service, or sell products or perform services in the Territory<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that are competitive with the Products....\" The \"Products\" were defined by checking the appropriate items from a list; on Ricci's agreement, only \"Facilities Mgmt Services\" was checked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ricci performed the same type of work for Lanier that she had for Copytech, selling off-site printing and copying services and overseeing the copy center. Ricci resigned from Lanier on November 30, 1998, and began working for Bomont in December 1998 as its sole outside salesperson. A small printing shop specializing in large-format, full-color printing, Bomont to some degree competes with Lanier (and many others) in the Boston printing market. In her new job Ricci has won at least two former Lanier accounts for Bomont.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanier filed suit against Ricci and Bomont in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in February 1999, seeking damages and a preliminary and permanent injunction. After reviewing the affidavits submitted by the parties and hearing argument, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a request for a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, see Hiller Cranberry Products, Inc. v.

The district court found that term ambiguous, construed the agreement against the drafter, Lanier, and concluded that Lanier had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success in proving that Ricci had violated the agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There appears to be no dispute that facilities management services refers primarily to support services that the client wishes to \"out-source\" to an outside provider who works on-site at a client's place of business. Facilities management services are an important and growing part of Lanier's business in Boston. The dispute in this case relates to off-site printing services, not performed at the client's place of business, which Ricci sold for Copytech and Lanier, and now sells for Bomont. Ricci and Bomont contend that such off-site services are not facilities management services as that term is used in the printing and copying industry, and as it was used at Lanier while Ricci worked there. Lanier, on the other hand, asserts that facilities management services include off-site printing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, a contract term is ambiguous when its language is \"reasonably prone to different interpretations\" or \"susceptible to differing, but nonetheless plausible, constructions.\" Alison H. v. Byard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198217\"><a href=\"/opinion/198217/h-v-byard-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Bercume v.

Whether a term is ambiguous is a question of law. See Alison <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198217\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">H.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198217/h-v-byard-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the term \"facilities management services,\" undefined in the agreement, is inescapably ambiguous as a matter of law. When contractual language is ambiguous, its meaning is a question of fact. See Den norske Bank AS v. First National Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196552\"><a href=\"/opinion/196552/den-norske-bank-as-v-first-natl-of-bost/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir. 1996). The resolution of the ambiguity turns on the parties' intent, as \"discerned by the factfinder from the circumstances surrounding the ambiguity and from such reasonable inferences as may be available.\" Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197080\"><a href=\"/opinion/197080/colasanto-v-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 211 (1st Cir. 1996). Extrinsic evidence is admissible to assist the factfinder in resolving the ambiguity, including evidence of, in descending order of importance: (1) the parties' negotiations concerning the contract at issue; (2) their course of performance; and (3) trade usage in the relevant industry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Den <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196552\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">norske,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196552/den-norske-bank-as-v-first-natl-of-bost/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">52-53</span></a></span>; see also Keating v. Stadium Management Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span>, 123 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987). In support of their competing definitions of facilities management services, the parties offered evidence in each of those three categories, the defendants focusing on the first and third and Lanier on the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no negotiations. Ricci was presented with a standard-form employment agreement and told she had to sign it to retain her position. Ricci, however, stated in her affidavit that at the time she signed the agreement, she did not believe that her work could be characterized as facilities management services, and that she shared that view at the time with a fellow employee, Todd Nugent. Nugent's affidavit corroborates Ricci's. Ricci also stated that she thought that she might be asked to sell such facilities management services in the future, thus explaining the seeming oddity of Lanier requiring her to sign a non-competition agreement covering a product that she had never sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ricci and Bomont also offered significant evidence concerning the usage of the term facilities management services in the trade. See Atlantic Track &amp; Turnout Co. v. Perini Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603503\"><a href=\"/opinion/603503/atlantic-track-turnout-company-v-perini-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 543 (1st Cir. 1993) (trade usage may be used to help discern meaning of ambiguous contract term). That evidence included affidavits from Ricci, five other former Lanier employees, an employee of another copying and facilities management company, and an owner of Bomont. They all agreed that off-site printing, which Ricci sold for Lanier and now sells for Bomont, is not considered facilities management in the printing and copying trade or was not so considered at Lanier when Ricci worked there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanier focused primarily on the undisputed fact that Ricci worked for Lanier for almost three years and that her employment agreement prohibited her from competing when she left the company in providing facilities management services. See Lembo v. Waters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2242456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2242456/lembo-v-waters/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 569 (Mass. App. Ct. 1973) (court may resort to conduct of parties to determine meaning they put on ambiguous contract term). That fact, according to Lanier, shows Ricci's acquiescence in its definition of the term. There is an intuitive appeal to the notion that Ricci should have understood that when the employment agreement barred her from selling facilities management services for a year after leaving Lanier, the intent was to cover the sort of services that she in fact sold for Lanier. This evidence certainly has some probative value. However, it did not compel a finding by the court that Ricci acquiesced in Lanier's understanding by performing under the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unable to resolve the ambiguity in the contract language, the court properly resorted to the familiar principle that an ambiguous \"post-employment restraint imposed by the employer's standardized form contract\" will be construed against the drafter. Sentry Ins. v. Firnstein, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2055740\"><a href=\"/opinion/2055740/sentry-ins-v-firnstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 46-47 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 188 cmt. g (1981)). The court's Conclusion that Lanier had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits reflected factual findings that are not clearly erroneous and a correct understanding of the law. The court's denial of a preliminary injunction, therefore, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanier also argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to enter an injunction barring Ricci from disclosing, and Bomont from making use of, confidential information misappropriated from Lanier. That argument requires little Discussion. Lanier's scant evidence that Ricci had appropriated information consisted primarily of the affidavit of Ricci's successor, who stated that he had \"received information which led [him] to believe Ricci may have removed documents from Lanier's files prior to her resignation.\" As the district court found, that affidavit was so devoid of content as to be \"practically worthless.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Lanier had shown that Ricci had misappropriated documents, it offered no evidence that those documents contained confidential information or trade secrets.
