Angueira with whom Edward M. Swartz, Alan L.\nCantor, and Lisa V. Kaprielian were on brief for appellants.\n     Howard B. Myers with whom Bryan K. Gould was on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n    *Of the    Eastern   District    of   Pennsylvania,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f                                October 17, 2000\n\n\n\n    Per    curiam.          Appellants    sought      damages        from     appellee\n\nVolkswagen      for    injuries    arising      out    of    a     car    accident    in\n\nFebruary 1991.        In a previous decision, we resolved a number of\n\nevidentiary questions arising from the trial in this diversity\n\ncase. See Trull v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 187 F.3d 88 (lst\n\nCir. 1999).      Appellants also challenged a jury instruction that\n\nrequired them to prove, in addition to causation, \"`the nature\n\nand extent of the injuries that were enhanced’\" as a result of\n\na defect in the vehicle’s design.                  Id. at 103.              Appellants\n\nargued that once they demonstrated causation, the defendants\n\nbore the burden of apportioning damages because the enhanced\n\ninjuries   at    issue      were   indivisible        from    the    injuries       that\n\nresulted   from       the   underlying     accident.         The    jury    found    for\n\nVolkswagen,     and    we    reasoned    that    assignment          of    the    burden\n\n\"unquestionably may have been determinative\" of the result.                          Id.\n\n    We noted that the question of who bears the burden in a so-\n\ncalled \"crashworthiness\" case involving indivisible injuries had\n\ndivided courts across the country, and that the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court had not yet faced the question. Id.                                at 100.\n\nConcluding that placement of the burden was \"quintessentially a\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fpolicy judgment appropriately made for the state by its own\n\ncourts,\" id. at 103, we retained jurisdiction and certified the\n\nfollowing question to the New Hampshire Supreme Court:\n\n      Under New Hampshire law, in a crashworthiness or\n      enhanced injury case, does the plaintiff bear the\n      burden of demonstrating the specific nature and extent\n      of the injuries attributable to the manufacturer, or\n      does the burden of apportionment fall on the defendant\n      once the plaintiff has proved causation?\n\nId.\n\n      The New Hampshire Supreme Court has concluded that the\n\nburden falls on the defendant:\n\n      In   crashworthiness   cases  involving   indivisible\n      injuries, we conclude that the plaintiffs must prove\n      that \"a design defect was a substantial factor in\n      producing damages over and above those which were\n      probably caused as a result of the original impact or\n      collision. Once the plaintiff[s] make[] that showing,\n      the burden shifts to the defendant[s] to show which\n      injuries were attributable to the initial collision\n      and which to the defect.\" Trull, 187 F.3d at 101-02.\n\nTrull v. Volkswagen, 2000 WL 1425142, *4 (NH Sept. 28, 2000).\n\n      Because the district court’s instruction placed the burden\n\non the plaintiffs,    they are entitled to a new trial.        We\n\ntherefore vacate the judgment of the district court and remand\n\nthe case for new proceedings consistent with both our prior\n\ndecision and the New Hampshire Supreme Court’s response to our\n\ncertified question of law.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is therefore vacated and\n\nremanded.\n\n                               -3-\n\f-4-\n\f",
