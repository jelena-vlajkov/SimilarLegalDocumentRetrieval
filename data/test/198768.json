On May 21, 1993, a\r\ntractor-trailer driven by Jerome Washington and owned by Washington\r\nand Malachi Sabree collided with an automobile driven by Jean C.\r\nGraham in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  In this diversity action in\r\nthe district court, Graham brought negligence claims against (1)\r\nWashington, (2) Sabree, (3) Malone Freight Lines, Inc. (\"Malone\"),\r\nwhich had leased the tractor-trailer from Washington and had\r\nprovided the registration materials necessary to allow Washington\r\nto operate the tractor-trailer interstate, and (4) East Coast\r\nTransport, Inc. (\"ECT\"), the broker that had arranged for\r\nWashington to carry the load of cucumbers he was hauling at the\r\ntime of the accident.  After Washington and Sabree defaulted, the\r\ndistrict court entered judgment against them and, after reviewing\r\ndocumentary evidence of Graham's injuries, awarded Graham $111,300\r\nin damages, of which $40,000 was for pain and suffering.  The\r\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of Malone and ECT\r\non all claims.  Graham appeals from the grant of summary judgment\r\nin favor of Malone and ECT.  She also contends that she was\r\nentitled to a jury trial on the amount of damages to be awarded in\r\nconnection with the default judgments and, further, that the award\r\nfor pain and suffering was unreasonably low.  We affirm the\r\njudgment of the district court.\r\n\n                              I.\r\nThe undisputed facts are well described in the district\r\ncourt's comprehensive opinion and need not be repeated in detail. \r\nSee Graham v. Malone Freight Lines, Inc., et al., 948 F. Supp. 1124\r\n(D. Mass. 1996).  We recite, in the light most favorable to Graham,\r\nonly those facts most pertinent to our discussion of the issues on\r\nappeal.\r\nMalone, based in Birmingham, Alabama, is an interstate\r\nmotor carrier engaged in the business of transporting freight via\r\ntruck under the jurisdiction granted formerly by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.  As a condition of its operating authority,\r\nMalone was required to maintain insurance for its vehicles.  See 49\r\nU.S.C.  10927(a)(1).  On April 1, 1991, the ICC approved Malone's\r\napplication to self-insure for bodily injury and property damage\r\nliability up to $1,000,000.  \r\nWashington, who was based in Florida, owned a trailer,\r\nand was making periodic payments toward the purchase of a tractor\r\nowned by Sabree.  On April 14, 1993, Malone and Washington entered\r\ninto a lease in which Washington promised to lease the tractor-\r\ntrailer to Malone and act as driver, and Malone agreed to lend its\r\nauthorizations for interstate commerce to Washington and provide\r\nhauls for him.  Under the terms of the lease, any breach of the\r\nlease covenants and promises gave either party an immediate right\r\nto cancel the lease.  The lease provided that notice of\r\ncancellation could be by telephone or in writing.  If notice of\r\ncancellation was in writing, the lease provided that written notice\r\nwas \"deemed to have been fully given . . . on the second day after\r\nmailing . . . by first class mail, registered or certified, postage\r\nprepaid, and properly addressed\" to the relevant party.\r\nWashington and Malone had entered into an earlier lease\r\nin October 1992, which was canceled by Malone on December 17, 1992\r\nbecause Washington hauled an unauthorized load of freight.  In\r\nconnection with the execution of this earlier lease, Washington had\r\npresented to Malone a transcript, dated August 5, 1992, of his\r\ndriving record from his home state, Florida.  The transcript did\r\nnot state that there were any restrictions in effect on\r\nWashington's operation of the tractor-trailer.  On August 6, 1992,\r\nthe state of Florida issued a conditional driver's license to\r\nWashington, valid only as to hauls within Florida.  The record is\r\nunclear as to the reason for the limitation and as to whether it\r\nremained in effect on the accident date, May 21, 1993.  The\r\nrestriction was noted on the face of Washington's driver's license\r\nin the form of a code notation -- \"AB2.\"  The driver's license\r\nitself did not explain what \"AB2\" meant.  Explanations for various\r\nsuch codes appear, however, at the bottom of the August 5\r\ntranscript.  These indicated that \"AB2\" meant that a commercial\r\ndriver's license is limited to intrastate hauls.  The Florida\r\ntranscript further stated: \"SOME LICENSES ISSUED BY THE STATE OF\r\nFLORIDA ARE VALID IN FLORIDA ONLY.  THIS RESULTS FROM APPLICANT\r\nRETAINING A VALID LICENSE FROM ANOTHER JURISDICTION.\"  When Malone\r\nand Washington entered the lease on April 14, 1993, Malone relied\r\nupon the August 5, 1992, transcript of Washington's Florida driving\r\nrecord which, as already indicated, did not itself note that\r\nWashington's license was subject to the \"AB2\" or other limitation. \r\nWhen Washington left Malone's offices on April 15, 1993, \r\nhe had with him various vehicle identification materials provided\r\nby Malone, including door placards for the tractor in Malone's\r\nname, decals for the tractor-trailer with Malone's ICC number, a\r\n\"cab card\" that indicated Washington had Malone's permission to\r\noperate under its ICC authority, decals with Malone-assigned\r\nnumbers, and forty-eight state decals indicating that applicable\r\nstate taxes had been paid.  Malone registered the tractor-trailer\r\nin Illinois.  On April 15, 1993, Malone obtained a 45-day temporary\r\npermit for the tractor-trailer, which was valid until May 30, 1993.\r\nMalone also transferred an Illinois license plate, valid for one\r\nyear, to Washington's tractor-trailer.  \r\nMalone never arranged for any hauls for Washington under\r\nthe lease.  Malone asserts that Washington failed to contact a\r\nMalone dispatcher, as he had agreed to do under the lease. \r\nWashington contends that he was in contact with a Malone\r\ndispatcher.  In any event, Malone believed that Washington had\r\nbreached the lease.  Consequently, on April 27, 1993, Malone sent,\r\npostage prepaid, a certified letter addressed to Washington's\r\ncorrect home address canceling the lease and requesting the\r\nimmediate return of all of Malone's vehicle identification\r\nmaterials.  The lease provided that upon cancellation, it would be\r\nWashington's responsibility to return all vehicle identification\r\nmaterials to Malone.  After making two unsuccessful attempts to\r\ndeliver the letter, on May 5 and May 11, the Post Office returned\r\nit to Malone on May 19, 1993.  In the interim, Malone attempted\r\nunsuccessfully to reach Washington by telephone, although it was\r\nable to reach Washington's wife and inform her that the lease had\r\nbeen canceled.  It is undisputed that Washington himself never\r\nreceived the certified letter.   \r\nOn May 21, 1993, the date of the accident, Washington was\r\ntransporting a load of cucumbers from Florida to Massachusetts. \r\nThe haul had been arranged by ETC, a broker with no ICC operating\r\nauthority of its own that acts as an intermediary between shippers\r\nand carriers and uses operators leased to licensed carriers.  The\r\nMay 21, 1993, haul was the fifth Washington had transported for\r\nECT; Washington had begun accepting assignments from ECT on April\r\n20, 1993.\r\nAt the time Washington's tractor-trailer collided with\r\nGraham's automobile, Washington carried the registration for the\r\ntractor-trailer that had been obtained by Malone and the tractor-\r\ntrailer was marked with the Malone vehicle identification insignia\r\nthat had been provided to Washington on April 15, 1993.  On June\r\n17, 1993, Malone reported to the Illinois Secretary of State that\r\nthe license plate transferred to Washington's tractor-trailer had\r\nbeen lost or stolen.  Malone sent a letter to Washington on June\r\n18, 1993, reminding Washington that he was obligated under the\r\nlease to return the Malone vehicle identification materials. \r\nWashington returned the materials on July 17, 1993.\r\nGraham's complaint, originally filed in state court but\r\nsubsequently removed to federal district court in Massachusetts,\r\nalleged that Washington had negligently operated the tractor-\r\ntrailer, and that Sabree, as owner of the tractor, was vicariously\r\nliable for her injuries.  Graham alleged that Malone was also\r\nliable for her injuries because it (1) negligently entrusted the\r\ntractor-trailer to Washington despite the intrastate limitation\r\nthat appeared on the face of his driver's license; (2) failed to\r\ncancel the tractor-trailer's Illinois registration prior to the\r\naccident; and (3) acted as Washington's \"statutory employer\"\r\nbecause Washington's truck bore Malone's ICC vehicle identification\r\ninsignia at the time of the accident and still carried the Illinois\r\nvehicle registration.  Graham alleged that ECT had negligently\r\nretained Washington to haul the load of cucumbers without first\r\ndetermining whether he had a valid license and permits and had\r\nnegligently entrusted the tractor-trailer to Washington.\r\nAs Washington and Sabree did not appear, the district\r\ncourt entered default judgments against them.  The district court\r\ndid not hold a hearing on damages.  Rather, the court reviewed  \r\ndocumentary evidence, including affidavits submitted by Graham and\r\nmembers of her family, concerning Graham's injuries.  The  district\r\ncourt awarded $111,300 in damages on the claims against Washington\r\nand Sabree.  Of that total, $40,000 was awarded for Graham's pain\r\nand suffering.  \r\nIn its Memorandum and Order, the district court, after\r\naddressing several \"thorny choice of law issues,\" granted summary\r\njudgment in favor of Malone.  948 F. Supp. at 1129.  The court\r\nconcluded that the lease between Washington and Malone had been\r\ncanceled, in accordance with its terms, on April 29, 1993, two days\r\nafter Malone had mailed a properly addressed certified letter to\r\nWashington.  See id. at 1132.  As the lease had been terminated\r\nseveral weeks prior to the accident, which occurred on May 21,\r\n1993, the district court ruled that Malone could not be held liable\r\nunder either a negligent entrustment theory or the federal\r\n\"statutory employment\" doctrine.  The court further concluded that\r\nIllinois insurance law provided no basis for holding Malone liable\r\nafter the cancellation of the lease.  See id. at 1137.  \r\nWith regard to ECT, the district court initially denied\r\nits motion for summary judgment.  Upon reconsideration, however,\r\nthe court granted summary judgment in favor of ETC.  See Graham v.\r\nMalone Freight Lines, Inc., et al., 1997 WL 1068661 (D. Mass. June\r\n11, 1997).  The court ruled that ECT could not be held liable under\r\na negligent entrustment theory, as it had no control over the\r\ntractor-trailer.  Id. at *2.  The district court further concluded\r\nthat Washington was an independent contractor, and that ECT could\r\nnot be held liable for Washington's \"financial incompetence.\"  Id. \r\nFinally, the court concluded that any negligence by ECT in failing\r\nto determine whether Washington had ICC authority to transport\r\ngoods interstate was not a proximate cause of Graham's injuries,\r\nsuch authority not being necessary for the transport of\r\nagricultural products.  See id. at *5.  \r\n                            II.\r\nGraham contends on appeal that the district court erred\r\nin granting summary judgement in favor of Malone and ETC.  She\r\nfurther argues that the district court erred in refusing to allow\r\na jury trial with regard to damages against Washington and Sabree,\r\nand that the amount awarded for pain and suffering   $40,000   was\r\nunreasonably low.  We review de novo the district court's summary\r\njudgment determination and its refusal to conduct a jury trial on \r\ndamages.  See Lennon v. Rubin, 166 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1999).  We\r\nwill reverse the district court's damages determination only upon\r\na finding of clear error.  See Soto v. United States, 11 F.3d 15,\r\n18 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\nA.  Claims Against Malone\r\nWe can add little to the district court's thorough\r\nanalysis of Graham's \"negligent entrustment\" and \"statutory\r\nemployment\" claims against Malone.  The district court correctly\r\ndetermined that the lease between Malone and Washington was\r\nterminated according to its terms on April 29, 1993, two days after\r\nMalone had  mailed a certified letter of cancellation to\r\nWashington's home address.  Thus, the lease was terminated several\r\nweeks prior to the accident, which occurred on May 21, 1993.  \r\nAlthough Graham points out that the lease agreement was\r\na standard Malone form, she makes no convincing argument that the\r\nlease's notice of cancellation provision, was unconscionable or was\r\nfor some other reasons invalid.  Graham says that a carrier-lessee\r\nsuch as Malone should make \"reasonable efforts\" to notify a driver\r\nof the cancellation of a lease, but she does not explain why notice\r\ngiven by mailing a certified letter to the driver's designated\r\naddress would be unreasonable.  The written notice cancellation\r\nmethod provided for in the lease seems a practicable and sensible\r\narrangement for parties like Washington and Malone, where\r\nWashington was likely to spend much of his time out on the road\r\ndelivering loads.       \r\nGraham contends that Malone acted negligently in\r\n\"entrusting\" the tractor-trailer to one like Washington whose \r\ndriver's license bore on its face an intrastate restriction\r\nalthough Malone was apparently unaware of the fact when it entered\r\ninto the lease.  Assuming, without deciding, that what Malone did\r\namounted to an \"entrustment\" of the tractor-trailer, which\r\nWashington and Sabree in fact owned, the cancellation of the lease\r\nrelieved Malone of any liability under a \"negligent entrustment\"\r\ntheory.  Once the lease was canceled, Washington ceased to operate\r\nunder Malone's authority, on its behalf, or with its permission. \r\nThe absence of a valid lease precludes imposition of\r\nvicarious liability against Malone under the \"statutory employment\"\r\ndoctrine, which holds carrier-lessees vicariously liable for\r\ninjuries resulting from the use of leased equipment.  See, e.g.,\r\nJackson v. O'Shields, 101 F.3d 1083, 1086-87 (5th Cir. 1996)\r\n(statutory employment doctrine applies only where valid lease of\r\nequipment is in effect).  That Washington's tractor-trailer bore\r\nMalone's vehicle identification placards at the time of the\r\naccident does not constitute grounds for imposing vicarious\r\nliability against Malone.  The lease provided that Washington was\r\nresponsible for returning these materials to Malone upon\r\ncancellation.  The notice of cancellation sent to Washington's\r\nhome on April 27, 1993 stated that any further use of Malone's ICC\r\nplacards would be unlawful.  While Washington himself apparently\r\nnever received notice of cancellation, we conclude, as have other\r\ncourts, that the presence of Malone's ICC placards does not vitiate\r\nthe otherwise valid termination notice.  See id. at 1088 (holding\r\nthat presence of carrier's ICC insignia at time of accident did not\r\nprovide basis for liability); see also Tartaglione v. Shaw's\r\nExpress, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 438, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (same).  \r\nIn her motion for summary judgment, Graham argued that\r\nMalone was an insurer against injuries arising from Washington's\r\noperation of the tractor-trailer under Illinois's mandatory\r\nautomobile insurance law, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-601 et\r\nseq., having failed to cancel the truck's Illinois registration\r\nuntil after the accident.  The district court concluded that\r\ncancellation of the lease precluded holding Malone liable under the\r\nIllinois automobile insurance statute and that, in any event,\r\n\"[d]eeming Malone an insurer due to the failure to terminate the\r\nregistration is not a remedy permitted by Illinois law.\"  948 F.\r\nSupp. at 1137.  In her motion for reconsideration, Graham abandoned\r\nreliance on the Illinois mandatory automobile insurance statute,\r\nasserting instead that Malone was liable under Illinois statutes\r\nrequiring motor carriers operating within Illinois to retain on\r\nfile with the Illinois Commerce Commission a certificate or other\r\nproof of insurance.  See 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18c-4901 (\"No\r\nmotor carrier or property shall operate within this State unless it\r\nhas on file with the Commission or its agent continuous insurance\r\nor surety coverage in accordance with Commission regulations\").  At\r\nthe time of the accident, Malone did in fact have a certificate of\r\ninsurance on file with the Illinois Commerce Commission.  The\r\ndistrict court stated that Graham's shift in statutory focus \"fails\r\nto persuade me that my original ruling was in error.\"  1997 WL\r\n1068661 at *5. \r\nWe agree with the district court that Graham's\r\nargumentative change does not assist her.  The cancellation of the\r\nlease undermines Graham's contention based upon the Illinois proof\r\nof insurance provisions.  Section 4903 of Chapter 18c, upon which\r\nGraham now relies, provides, in part, that  \r\n  [e]ach certificate or other proof of insurance\r\nor surety coverage shall have, as an implied\r\nterm, that the insurance or surety coverage\r\nwill remain in effect continuously until\r\nnotice of cancellation is filed in accordance\r\nwith Commission regulations, and that all\r\nmotor vehicles operated by or under authority\r\nof the carrier will be covered, whether or not\r\nsuch vehicles have been reported to the\r\ninsurance, surety, or other company.\r\n\n625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18c-4903 (emphasis supplied).  Because\r\nthe lease had been canceled before the accident, Washington's truck\r\nwas no longer \"operated by or under authority of\" Malone.  Thus,\r\nthe maintenance by Malone of the Illinois insurance certificate\r\nprovides no basis under Illinois law for holding Malone strictly\r\nliable as Washington's insurer.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district\r\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Malone\r\non all claims against it.  \r\nB.  Claims Against ECT\r\nAt the time of the accident, ECT was an ICC licensed\r\nfreight broker whose business involved matching customers (shippers\r\nof freight) with carriers.  As a broker, ECT was not required to \r\ncarry motor vehicle property damage, or personal injury or cargo\r\nloss insurance.  Rather, ECT relied upon the carrier or operator to\r\nmaintain insurance.  The shipment of cucumbers being hauled by\r\nWashington from Florida to Massachusetts at the time of the\r\naccident had been arranged by ECT.  ECT claims that prior to the\r\nshipment it contacted Malone to ascertain whether Washington was\r\nproperly licensed and insured.  Malone contends that it has no\r\nrecord of any inquiry having been made by ECT prior to the accident\r\nof May 21, 1993 concerning Washington's status.  As we are\r\nreviewing a grant of summary judgment in favor of ECT, we shall\r\nassume that ECT did not contact Malone prior to the May 21, 1993\r\nhaul to inquire as to Washington's status.  \r\nGraham claims that ECT is liable because it negligently\r\nfailed to determine whether Washington was properly licensed and \r\ninsured when it hired him for the Massachusetts cucumber shipment. \r\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of ECT.  The\r\ncourt concluded that Washington was an independent contractor and\r\nthat ECT could not be held liable under New Jersey law for the\r\nnegligence of an independent contractor.  See 1997 WL 1068661 at\r\n** 3-5. \r\nGraham's claim of negligence against ECT is not based\r\nupon principles of vicarious liability.  Graham argues that ECT is\r\nliable for its own negligent hiring of Washington to undertake the\r\ncucumber haul.  She claims that had ECT checked Washington's\r\ndriver's license, which carried an \"intrastate only\" restriction on\r\nits face, ECT would not have hired Washington to take the cucumber\r\nhaul.  \r\nGraham concedes that Washington was hired not as an\r\nemployee of ECT, but rather as its independent contractor. \r\nEmployers are generally not liable for the negligent acts of the\r\nindependent contractors they hire.  But as the district court\r\ncorrectly noted, New Jersey law provides an exception to the rule\r\nprecluding liability where an employer knowingly hires an\r\nincompetent independent contractor.  See 1997 WL 1068661 at *2. \r\nBut the evidence is lacking that ECT hired Washington with the\r\nknowledge, actual or constructive, that Washington was incompetent\r\nor could not safely drive his truck.  See Cassano v. Aschoff, 226\r\nN.J. Super. 110, 114, 543 A.2d 973, 976 (App. Div. 1988) (employee\r\nfailed to establish knowledge by landowner that independent\r\ncontractor lacked skill to perform competently).  That Washington\r\nperformed incompetently after he was hired by ECT does not suffice;\r\nnor does the fact that Graham raises a factual issue regarding\r\nWashington's authority to operate his truck interstate given the\r\nrestriction placed upon his driver's license.  See id.  \r\nGraham argues that ECT's failure to inspect Washington's\r\nlicense constitutes negligence.  But there is no evidence that even\r\nhad ECT done so, it would have gained knowledge that would have\r\nalerted it to any safety issues with regard to Washington's\r\ndriving.  An explanation of the \"AB2\" restriction appears in the\r\nFlorida transcript of Washington's driving record, upon which\r\nMalone had relied when it entered into the lease with Washington. \r\nThat explanation suggests, supra pp. 4-5, that issuance of a\r\nlicense valid only in Florida may result from applicant's retention\r\nof a valid license from another jurisdiction.  This explanation\r\ndoes not link the \"AB2\" in-state restriction to a driver's\r\ncompetence or poor safety record.  Thus, there would have been no\r\nobvious connection between Washington's Florida-limited driver's\r\nlicense and his ability to safely drive the truck.  Further, the\r\nlimitation appears to be tied into the existence of other valid\r\nlicensure elsewhere.  On this record, we are unable to ascertain a\r\nsufficient issue of fact as to whether ECT failed to exercise due\r\ncare in the hiring of Washington as an independent contractor, in\r\nthat it should have concluded that he was incompetent or unsafe. \r\nFinally, Graham contends that ECT is liable because it \r\nhired an independent contractor without liability insurance.  As\r\nthe district court correctly held, New Jersey law does not impose\r\nliability upon employers for the financial instability of\r\nindependent contractors.  See 1997 WL 1068661 at **4-5.\r\nWe conclude that the district court properly granted\r\nsummary judgment in favor of ECT.\r\nC.  Damages    \r\nFinally, Graham contends that the district court erred in\r\ntwo respects in its computation of damages in connection with her\r\nclaims against defaulting defendants Washington and Sabree.  First,\r\nGraham argues that she was entitled to a jury trial with regard to\r\ndamages.  Neither the Seventh Amendment nor the Federal Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure require a jury trial to assess damages after entry\r\nof default in these circumstances.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2)\r\n(stating that court \"shall accord a right of trial by jury to the\r\nparties when and as required by any statute of the United States\");\r\nsee also Eisler v. Stritzler, 535 F.2d 148, 154 (1st Cir. 1976)\r\n(jury trial not required to assess damages after default).  Thus,\r\nGraham was not entitled to a jury trial on damages.  \r\nSecond, Graham argues that the district court's $40,000\r\naward for pain and suffering was \"unreasonable\" because it was\r\nequal only to the amount of lost earnings through the date of\r\njudgment.  The amount of damages awarded falls within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the fact-finder, here the district court.  See Soto\r\nv. United States, 11 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1993).  An award for pain\r\nand suffering that happens to be equal to lost wages is not, as\r\nGraham suggests, per se unreasonable.  Conclusory arguments\r\nattacking the reasonableness of a damages award fall well short of\r\na demonstration of clear error.  See id.  We therefore uphold the\r\ndistrict court's pain and suffering award.\r\n                             III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.   \r\n",

On May 21, 1993, a\r\ntractor-trailer driven by Jerome Washington and owned by Washington\r\nand Malachi Sabree collided with an automobile driven by Jean C.\r\nGraham in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  In this diversity action in\r\nthe district court, Graham brought negligence claims against (1)\r\nWashington, (2) Sabree, (3) Malone Freight Lines, Inc. (\"Malone\"),\r\nwhich had leased the tractor-trailer from Washington and had\r\nprovided the registration materials necessary to allow Washington\r\nto operate the tractor-trailer interstate, and (4) East Coast\r\nTransport, Inc. (\"ECT\"), the broker that had arranged for\r\nWashington to carry the load of cucumbers he was hauling at the\r\ntime of the accident.  After Washington and Sabree defaulted, the\r\ndistrict court entered judgment against them and, after reviewing\r\ndocumentary evidence of Graham's injuries, awarded Graham $111,300\r\nin damages, of which $40,000 was for pain and suffering.  The\r\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of Malone and ECT\r\non all claims.  Graham appeals from the grant of summary judgment\r\nin favor of Malone and ECT.  She also contends that she was\r\nentitled to a jury trial on the amount of damages to be awarded in\r\nconnection with the default judgments and, further, that the award\r\nfor pain and suffering was unreasonably low.  We affirm the\r\njudgment of the district court.\r\n\n                              I.\r\nThe undisputed facts are well described in the district\r\ncourt's comprehensive opinion and need not be repeated in detail. \r\nSee Graham v.

We recite, in the light most favorable to Graham,\r\nonly those facts most pertinent to our discussion of the issues on\r\nappeal.\r\nMalone, based in Birmingham, Alabama, is an interstate\r\nmotor carrier engaged in the business of transporting freight via\r\ntruck under the jurisdiction granted formerly by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.  As a condition of its operating authority,\r\nMalone was required to maintain insurance for its vehicles.  See 49\r\nU.S.C.  10927(a)(1).  On April 1, 1991, the ICC approved Malone's\r\napplication to self-insure for bodily injury and property damage\r\nliability up to $1,000,000.  \r\nWashington, who was based in Florida, owned a trailer,\r\nand was making periodic payments toward the purchase of a tractor\r\nowned by Sabree.  On April 14, 1993, Malone and Washington entered\r\ninto a lease in which Washington promised to lease the tractor-\r\ntrailer to Malone and act as driver, and Malone agreed to lend its\r\nauthorizations for interstate commerce to Washington and provide\r\nhauls for him.  Under the terms of the lease, any breach of the\r\nlease covenants and promises gave either party an immediate right\r\nto cancel the lease.  The lease provided that notice of\r\ncancellation could be by telephone or in writing.  If notice of\r\ncancellation was in writing, the lease provided that written notice\r\nwas \"deemed to have been fully given . . . on the second day after\r\nmailing . . . by first class mail, registered or certified, postage\r\nprepaid, and properly addressed\" to the relevant party.\r\nWashington and Malone had entered into an earlier lease\r\nin October 1992, which was canceled by Malone on December 17, 1992\r\nbecause Washington hauled an unauthorized load of freight.  In\r\nconnection with the execution of this earlier lease, Washington had\r\npresented to Malone a transcript, dated August 5, 1992, of his\r\ndriving record from his home state, Florida.  The transcript did\r\nnot state that there were any restrictions in effect on\r\nWashington's operation of the tractor-trailer.  On August 6, 1992,\r\nthe state of Florida issued a conditional driver's license to\r\nWashington, valid only as to hauls within Florida.  The record is\r\nunclear as to the reason for the limitation and as to whether it\r\nremained in effect on the accident date, May 21, 1993.  The\r\nrestriction was noted on the face of Washington's driver's license\r\nin the form of a code notation -- \"AB2.\"  The driver's license\r\nitself did not explain what \"AB2\" meant.  Explanations for various\r\nsuch codes appear, however, at the bottom of the August 5\r\ntranscript.  These indicated that \"AB2\" meant that a commercial\r\ndriver's license is limited to intrastate hauls.  The Florida\r\ntranscript further stated: \"SOME LICENSES ISSUED BY THE STATE OF\r\nFLORIDA ARE VALID IN FLORIDA ONLY.  THIS RESULTS FROM APPLICANT\r\nRETAINING A VALID LICENSE FROM ANOTHER JURISDICTION.\"  When Malone\r\nand Washington entered the lease on April 14, 1993, Malone relied\r\nupon the August 5, 1992, transcript of Washington's Florida driving\r\nrecord which, as already indicated, did not itself note that\r\nWashington's license was subject to the \"AB2\" or other limitation. \r\nWhen Washington left Malone's offices on April 15, 1993, \r\nhe had with him various vehicle identification materials provided\r\nby Malone, including door placards for the tractor in Malone's\r\nname, decals for the tractor-trailer with Malone's ICC number, a\r\n\"cab card\" that indicated Washington had Malone's permission to\r\noperate under its ICC authority, decals with Malone-assigned\r\nnumbers, and forty-eight state decals indicating that applicable\r\nstate taxes had been paid.  Malone registered the tractor-trailer\r\nin Illinois.  On April 15, 1993, Malone obtained a 45-day temporary\r\npermit for the tractor-trailer, which was valid until May 30, 1993.\r\nMalone also transferred an Illinois license plate, valid for one\r\nyear, to Washington's tractor-trailer.  \r\nMalone never arranged for any hauls for Washington under\r\nthe lease.  Malone asserts that Washington failed to contact a\r\nMalone dispatcher, as he had agreed to do under the lease. \r\nWashington contends that he was in contact with a Malone\r\ndispatcher.  In any event, Malone believed that Washington had\r\nbreached the lease.  Consequently, on April 27, 1993, Malone sent,\r\npostage prepaid, a certified letter addressed to Washington's\r\ncorrect home address canceling the lease and requesting the\r\nimmediate return of all of Malone's vehicle identification\r\nmaterials.  The lease provided that upon cancellation, it would be\r\nWashington's responsibility to return all vehicle identification\r\nmaterials to Malone.  After making two unsuccessful attempts to\r\ndeliver the letter, on May 5 and May 11, the Post Office returned\r\nit to Malone on May 19, 1993.  In the interim, Malone attempted\r\nunsuccessfully to reach Washington by telephone, although it was\r\nable to reach Washington's wife and inform her that the lease had\r\nbeen canceled.  It is undisputed that Washington himself never\r\nreceived the certified letter.   \r\nOn May 21, 1993, the date of the accident, Washington was\r\ntransporting a load of cucumbers from Florida to Massachusetts. \r\nThe haul had been arranged by ETC, a broker with no ICC operating\r\nauthority of its own that acts as an intermediary between shippers\r\nand carriers and uses operators leased to licensed carriers.  The\r\nMay 21, 1993, haul was the fifth Washington had transported for\r\nECT; Washington had begun accepting assignments from ECT on April\r\n20, 1993.\r\nAt the time Washington's tractor-trailer collided with\r\nGraham's automobile, Washington carried the registration for the\r\ntractor-trailer that had been obtained by Malone and the tractor-\r\ntrailer was marked with the Malone vehicle identification insignia\r\nthat had been provided to Washington on April 15, 1993.  On June\r\n17, 1993, Malone reported to the Illinois Secretary of State that\r\nthe license plate transferred to Washington's tractor-trailer had\r\nbeen lost or stolen.  Malone sent a letter to Washington on June\r\n18, 1993, reminding Washington that he was obligated under the\r\nlease to return the Malone vehicle identification materials. \r\nWashington returned the materials on July 17, 1993.\r\nGraham's complaint, originally filed in state court but\r\nsubsequently removed to federal district court in Massachusetts,\r\nalleged that Washington had negligently operated the tractor-\r\ntrailer, and that Sabree, as owner of the tractor, was vicariously\r\nliable for her injuries.  Graham alleged that Malone was also\r\nliable for her injuries because it (1) negligently entrusted the\r\ntractor-trailer to Washington despite the intrastate limitation\r\nthat appeared on the face of his driver's license; (2) failed to\r\ncancel the tractor-trailer's Illinois registration prior to the\r\naccident; and (3) acted as Washington's \"statutory employer\"\r\nbecause Washington's truck bore Malone's ICC vehicle identification\r\ninsignia at the time of the accident and still carried the Illinois\r\nvehicle registration.  Graham alleged that ECT had negligently\r\nretained Washington to haul the load of cucumbers without first\r\ndetermining whether he had a valid license and permits and had\r\nnegligently entrusted the tractor-trailer to Washington.\r\nAs Washington and Sabree did not appear, the district\r\ncourt entered default judgments against them.  The district court\r\ndid not hold a hearing on damages.  Rather, the court reviewed  \r\ndocumentary evidence, including affidavits submitted by Graham and\r\nmembers of her family, concerning Graham's injuries.  The  district\r\ncourt awarded $111,300 in damages on the claims against Washington\r\nand Sabree.  Of that total, $40,000 was awarded for Graham's pain\r\nand suffering.  \r\nIn its Memorandum and Order, the district court, after\r\naddressing several \"thorny choice of law issues,\" granted summary\r\njudgment in favor of </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098590\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Malone.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/2098590/graham-v-malone-freight-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court further concluded that\r\nIllinois insurance law provided no basis for holding Malone liable\r\nafter the cancellation of the lease.

We\r\nwill reverse the district court's damages determination only upon\r\na finding of clear error.  See Soto v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658375\"><a href=\"/opinion/658375/elvin-h-soto-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n18 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\nA.  Claims Against Malone\r\nWe can add little to the district court's thorough\r\nanalysis of Graham's \"negligent entrustment\" and \"statutory\r\nemployment\" claims against Malone.  The district court correctly\r\ndetermined that the lease between Malone and Washington was\r\nterminated according to its terms on April 29, 1993, two days after\r\nMalone had  mailed a certified letter of cancellation to\r\nWashington's home address.  Thus, the lease was terminated several\r\nweeks prior to the accident, which occurred on May 21, 1993.  \r\nAlthough Graham points out that the lease agreement was\r\na standard Malone form, she makes no convincing argument that the\r\nlease's notice of cancellation provision, was unconscionable or was\r\nfor some other reasons invalid.  Graham says that a carrier-lessee\r\nsuch as Malone should make \"reasonable efforts\" to notify a driver\r\nof the cancellation of a lease, but she does not explain why notice\r\ngiven by mailing a certified letter to the driver's designated\r\naddress would be unreasonable.  The written notice cancellation\r\nmethod provided for in the lease seems a practicable and sensible\r\narrangement for parties like Washington and Malone, where\r\nWashington was likely to spend much of his time out on the road\r\ndelivering loads.       \r\nGraham contends that Malone acted negligently in\r\n\"entrusting\" the tractor-trailer to one like Washington whose \r\ndriver's license bore on its face an intrastate restriction\r\nalthough Malone was apparently unaware of the fact when it entered\r\ninto the lease.  Assuming, without deciding, that what Malone did\r\namounted to an \"entrustment\" of the tractor-trailer, which\r\nWashington and Sabree in fact owned, the cancellation of the lease\r\nrelieved Malone of any liability under a \"negligent entrustment\"\r\ntheory.  Once the lease was canceled, Washington ceased to operate\r\nunder Malone's authority, on its behalf, or with its permission. \r\nThe absence of a valid lease precludes imposition of\r\nvicarious liability against Malone under the \"statutory employment\"\r\ndoctrine, which holds carrier-lessees vicariously liable for\r\ninjuries resulting from the use of leased equipment.  See, e.g.,\r\nJackson v. O'Shields, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730858\"><a href=\"/opinion/730858/fed-carr-cas-p-84042-sarah-m-jackson-and-leo-smith-v-timothy-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1086-87 (5th Cir. 1996)\r\n(statutory employment doctrine applies only where valid lease of\r\nequipment is in effect).  That Washington's tractor-trailer bore\r\nMalone's vehicle identification placards at the time of the\r\naccident does not constitute grounds for imposing vicarious\r\nliability against Malone.  The lease provided that Washington was\r\nresponsible for returning these materials to Malone upon\r\ncancellation.  The notice of cancellation sent to Washington's\r\nhome on April 27, 1993 stated that any further use of Malone's ICC\r\nplacards would be unlawful.  While Washington himself apparently\r\nnever received notice of cancellation, we conclude, as have other\r\ncourts, that the presence of Malone's ICC placards does not vitiate\r\nthe otherwise valid termination notice.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730858\"><a href=\"/opinion/730858/fed-carr-cas-p-84042-sarah-m-jackson-and-leo-smith-v-timothy-k/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1088 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(holding\r\nthat presence of carrier's ICC insignia at time of accident did not\r\nprovide basis for liability); see also Tartaglione v. Shaw's\r\nExpress, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1879588\"><a href=\"/opinion/1879588/tartaglione-v-shaws-exp-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (same).  \r\nIn her motion for summary judgment, Graham argued that\r\nMalone was an insurer against injuries arising from Washington's\r\noperation of the tractor-trailer under Illinois's mandatory\r\nautomobile insurance law, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-601 et\r\nseq., having failed to cancel the truck's Illinois registration\r\nuntil after the accident.  The district court concluded that\r\ncancellation of the lease precluded holding Malone liable under the\r\nIllinois automobile insurance statute and that, in any event,\r\n\"[d]eeming Malone an insurer due to the failure to terminate the\r\nregistration is not a remedy permitted by Illinois law.\"  948 F.\r\nSupp. at 1137.  In her motion for reconsideration, Graham abandoned\r\nreliance on the Illinois mandatory automobile insurance statute,\r\nasserting instead that Malone was liable under Illinois statutes\r\nrequiring motor carriers operating within Illinois to retain on\r\nfile with the Illinois Commerce Commission a certificate or other\r\nproof of insurance.  See 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18c-4901 (\"No\r\nmotor carrier or property shall operate within this State unless it\r\nhas on file with the Commission or its agent continuous insurance\r\nor surety coverage in accordance with Commission regulations\").  At\r\nthe time of the accident, Malone did in fact have a certificate of\r\ninsurance on file with the Illinois Commerce Commission.  The\r\ndistrict court stated that Graham's shift in statutory focus \"fails\r\nto persuade me that my original ruling was in error.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1068661</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">at *5. \r\nWe agree with the district court that Graham's\r\nargumentative change does not assist her.  The cancellation of the\r\nlease undermines Graham's contention based upon the Illinois proof\r\nof insurance provisions.  Section 4903 of Chapter 18c, upon which\r\nGraham now relies, provides, in part, that  \r\n  [e]ach certificate or other proof of insurance\r\nor surety coverage shall have, as an implied\r\nterm, that the insurance or surety coverage\r\nwill remain in effect continuously until\r\nnotice of cancellation is filed in accordance\r\nwith Commission regulations, and that all\r\nmotor vehicles operated by or under authority\r\nof the carrier will be covered, whether or not\r\nsuch vehicles have been reported to the\r\ninsurance, surety, or other company.\r\n\n625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/18c-4903 (emphasis supplied).  Because\r\nthe lease had been canceled before the accident, Washington's truck\r\nwas no longer \"operated by or under authority of\" Malone.  Thus,\r\nthe maintenance by Malone of the Illinois insurance certificate\r\nprovides no basis under Illinois law for holding Malone strictly\r\nliable as Washington's insurer.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district\r\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Malone\r\non all claims against it.  \r\nB.  Claims Against ECT\r\nAt the time of the accident, ECT was an ICC licensed\r\nfreight broker whose business involved matching customers (shippers\r\nof freight) with carriers.  As a broker, ECT was not required to \r\ncarry motor vehicle property damage, or personal injury or cargo\r\nloss insurance.  Rather, ECT relied upon the carrier or operator to\r\nmaintain insurance.  The shipment of cucumbers being hauled by\r\nWashington from Florida to Massachusetts at the time of the\r\naccident had been arranged by ECT.  ECT claims that prior to the\r\nshipment it contacted Malone to ascertain whether Washington was\r\nproperly licensed and insured.  Malone contends that it has no\r\nrecord of any inquiry having been made by ECT prior to the accident\r\nof May 21, 1993 concerning Washington's status.  As we are\r\nreviewing a grant of summary judgment in favor of ECT, we shall\r\nassume that ECT did not contact Malone prior to the May 21, 1993\r\nhaul to inquire as to Washington's status.  \r\nGraham claims that ECT is liable because it negligently\r\nfailed to determine whether Washington was properly licensed and \r\ninsured when it hired him for the Massachusetts cucumber shipment. \r\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of ECT.  The\r\ncourt concluded that Washington was an independent contractor and\r\nthat ECT could not be held liable under New Jersey law for the\r\nnegligence of an independent contractor.  See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1068661</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">at\r\n** 3-5. \r\nGraham's claim of negligence against ECT is not based\r\nupon principles of vicarious liability.  Graham argues that ECT is\r\nliable for its own negligent hiring of Washington to undertake the\r\ncucumber haul.  She claims that had ECT checked Washington's\r\ndriver's license, which carried an \"intrastate only\" restriction on\r\nits face, ECT would not have hired Washington to take the cucumber\r\nhaul.  \r\nGraham concedes that Washington was hired not as an\r\nemployee of ECT, but rather as its independent contractor. \r\nEmployers are generally not liable for the negligent acts of the\r\nindependent contractors they hire.  But as the district court\r\ncorrectly noted, New Jersey law provides an exception to the rule\r\nprecluding liability where an employer knowingly hires an\r\nincompetent independent contractor.  See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1068661</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">at *2. \r\nBut the evidence is lacking that ECT hired Washington with the\r\nknowledge, actual or constructive, that Washington was incompetent\r\nor could not safely drive his truck.  See Cassano v. Aschoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1894486\"><a href=\"/opinion/1894486/cassano-v-aschoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.J.

That Washington\r\nperformed incompetently after he was hired by ECT does not suffice;\r\nnor does the fact that Graham raises a factual issue regarding\r\nWashington's authority to operate his truck interstate given the\r\nrestriction placed upon his driver's license.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1894486\"><a href=\"/opinion/1894486/cassano-v-aschoff/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  \r\nGraham argues </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">that ECT's failure to inspect Washington's\r\nlicense constitutes negligence.  But there is no evidence that even\r\nhad ECT done so, it would have gained knowledge that would have\r\nalerted it to any safety issues with regard to Washington's\r\ndriving.  An explanation of the \"AB2\" restriction appears in the\r\nFlorida transcript of Washington's driving record, upon which\r\nMalone had relied when it entered into the lease with Washington. \r\nThat explanation suggests, supra pp. 4-5, that issuance of a\r\nlicense valid only in Florida may result from applicant's retention\r\nof a valid license from another jurisdiction.  This explanation\r\ndoes not link the \"AB2\" in-state restriction to a driver's\r\ncompetence or poor safety record.  Thus, there would have been no\r\nobvious connection between Washington's Florida-limited driver's\r\nlicense and his ability to safely drive the truck.  Further, the\r\nlimitation appears to be tied into the existence of other valid\r\nlicensure elsewhere.  On this record, we are unable to ascertain a\r\nsufficient issue of fact as to whether ECT failed to exercise due\r\ncare in the hiring of Washington as an independent contractor, in\r\nthat it should have concluded that he was incompetent or unsafe. \r\nFinally, Graham contends that ECT is liable because it \r\nhired an independent contractor without liability insurance.  As\r\nthe district court correctly held, New Jersey law does not impose\r\nliability upon employers for the financial instability of\r\nindependent contractors.

Damages    \r\nFinally, Graham contends that the district court erred in\r\ntwo respects in its computation of damages in connection with her\r\nclaims against defaulting defendants Washington and Sabree.  First,\r\nGraham argues that she was entitled to a jury trial with regard to\r\ndamages.  Neither the Seventh Amendment nor the Federal Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure require a jury trial to assess damages after entry\r\nof default in these circumstances.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2)\r\n(stating that court \"shall accord a right of trial by jury to the\r\nparties when and as required by any statute of the United States\");\r\nsee also Eisler v. Stritzler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335265\"><a href=\"/opinion/335265/eugene-eisler-and-elizabeth-eisler-v-nathan-stritzler/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 (1st Cir. 1976)\r\n(jury trial not required to assess damages after default).  Thus,\r\nGraham was not entitled to a jury trial on damages.  \r\nSecond, Graham argues that the district court's $40,000\r\naward for pain and suffering was \"unreasonable\" because it was\r\nequal only to the amount of lost earnings through the date of\r\njudgment.  The amount of damages awarded falls within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the fact-finder, here the district court.  See Soto\r\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658375\"><a href=\"/opinion/658375/elvin-h-soto-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 1993).  An award for pain\r\nand suffering that happens to be equal to lost wages is not, as\r\nGraham suggests, per se unreasonable.  Conclusory arguments\r\nattacking the reasonableness of a damages award fall well short of\r\na demonstration of clear error.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658375\"><a href=\"/opinion/658375/elvin-h-soto-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  We therefore </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">uphold the\r\ndistrict court's pain and suffering award.\r\n                             III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.   \r\n</pre>",
