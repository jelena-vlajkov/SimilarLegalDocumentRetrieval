Overlooked      Opinions,         Inc.    (“OOI”)\n\nappeals from the district court’s denial of its motion\n\npursuant    to     Fed.R.Civ.P.         60(a)    for      correction       of   the\n\njudgment    entered        in    its    favor    to      include    prejudgment\n\ninterest pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 231, § 6C.\n\n            “In diversity cases, state law must be applied in\n\ndetermining       whether       and    how   much     pre-judgment        interest\n\nshould be awarded.” Fratus v. Republic Western Ins. Co., 147\n\nF.3d 25,    30     (1 st   Cir. 1998).          Under Massachusetts law,\n\nprejudgment       interest        “attaches         automatically”        to    all\n\njudgments    for     pecuniary         damages      in   breach     of    contract\n\nactions. O’Malley v. O’Malley, 419 Mass. 377, 381 (1995).\n\nThe statute provides that interest “shall be added by the\n\nclerk of the court to the amount of damages.” Mass.Gen.Laws\n\nch. 231 §6C.      It “commands a ministerial act.” O’Malley, 419\n\nMass. at 381.\n\n            Here, the form of judgment entered was one that had\n\nbeen agreed upon and proposed by the parties.                        It awarded\n\ndamages to OOI on certain claims, including a breach of\n\ncontract claim, “exclusive of interest and costs.”                          At the\n\ntime that judgment entered, some of OOI’s counter claims\n\nagainst Trans National Communications, Inc. (“TNC”) had not\n\nyet been adjudicated.            The proposed form of judgment agreed\n\fto by the parties and adopted by the court included the\n\nfollowing statement:\n\n           All other claims by [OOI] against [TNC],\n           including but not limited to claims for\n           attorney’s fees, are dismissed with\n           prejudice, having been knowingly and\n           intentionally waived by [OOI].\n\n\nJudgment   in   that   form     entered   on    August     4,   1999.   On\n\nNovember   2,   1999,     OOI    filed    its     motion    pursuant    to\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 60(a), for the district court to correct the\n\njudgment   to   include       prejudgment       interest    pursuant    to\n\nMass.Gen.Laws ch. 231, § 6C.\n\n           Rule 60(a) allows for the correction “at any time”\n\nof “clerical mistakes” or “errors arising from oversight or\n\nomission.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a).              It “enables a court to\n\nensure that its orders, judgments, and other parts of its\n\nrecord of proceedings are an accurate reflection of the true\n\nactions and intent of the court and the parties.” 12 James\n\nWm. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice § 60.02[1] (3d ed.).\n\n“Rule 60(a) is not a vehicle . . . to change that which has\n\nbeen deliberately done.” 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §\n\n2854 at 249 (2d ed. 1995).\n\n           In denying OOI’s Rule 60(a) motion, the district\n\ncourt found that the failure of the judgment to include\n\n                                   -3-\n\f prejudgment       interest   did    not   result       from   oversight    or\n\n omission, but instead accurately reflected the agreement of\n\n the parties “through an assented-to judgment in which all\n\n but    post-judgment     interest     was      waived.”    Memorandum     and\n\n Order, 1/25/00, pp. 5-6.           The district court specifically\n\n found, based upon the language of the assented-to judgment\n\n and OOI’s course of conduct after judgment entered, that the\n\n omission    of    prejudgment      interest     from    the   judgment    was\n\n consistent with the parties’ agreement.                   That finding is\n\n supported    by    the   record    and    is   not     clearly    erroneous.\n\n Because    the    district   court       supportably      found    that   the\n\n judgment’s failure to include prejudgment interest was an\n\n accurate reflection of the parties’ intent, it properly\n\n denied OOI relief pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a).1\n\n             The district court’s denial of OOI’s Motion to\n\n Correct a Clerical Mistake is affirmed. See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n    1  OOI argues on appeal that its statutory right to\nprejudgment interest is not waivable.     However, OOI has not\ncited, and we are not aware of, any authority supporting the\nposition that parties may not enter an agreement to waive their\nright to prejudgment interest under Massachusetts law.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
