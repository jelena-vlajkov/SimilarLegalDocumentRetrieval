Coln-Ramrez, with whom Coln, Coln &amp; Martnez \r\nwas on brief, for appellee Martin Marietta Services, Inc.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                February 8,2000 \r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  This case arises from the events\r\nof May 12, 1995 that resulted in the death of Bienvenido Gonzlez. \r\nThe appellants--his widow, Libertad Dvila-Prez, their children,\r\nhis mother, and his sister--brought this personal injury action\r\nagainst appellee Martin Marietta Corporation, Gonzlez's employer,\r\nand Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical Corporation.  Based on the\r\nstatutory employer defense made available under the Puerto Rico\r\nWorkmen's Compensation Act (\"PRWCA\"), 11 L.P.R.A.  2, 21, the\r\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and\r\ndismissed all claims against it.  We affirm on the alternative\r\nground that the appellee was immune from suit under the Longshore\r\nand Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (\"LHWCA\"), 33 U.S.C.  905,\r\npursuant to the Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C.  1651(a)(2).\r\n                   BACKGROUND\r\nFor purposes of this appeal, the Court adopts the\r\nfollowing relevant facts.  Gonzlez was employed by Martin\r\nMarietta, an independent contractor retained by the U.S. Navy.  He\r\nworked as an engine shop supervisor at the Aerial Target System at\r\nRoosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, Puerto Rico.  On May 12,\r\n1995, while Gonzlez was conducting a test on new equipment, an\r\nexplosion occurred.  Gonzlez suffered second and third degree\r\nburns over thirty percent of his body and was hospitalized until\r\nhis death on July 8, 1995.\r\nMartin Marietta had procured workers' compensation and\r\nemployers' liability insurance from CIGNA, pursuant to its contract\r\nrequirements with the Navy.  Benefits were paid to appellants in\r\naccordance with the policy terms.  No policy was obtained from the\r\nState Insurance Fund Corporation of Puerto Rico on behalf of\r\nGonzlez.\r\nThe appellants filed this action pursuant to articles\r\n1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 31 L.P.R.A.  5141,\r\n5142 (1997), alleging that the damages suffered by Gonzlez were\r\nthe result of diverse negligent acts of the U.S. Navy, Martin\r\nMarietta, and Teledyne.  Martin Marietta answered with a Motion for\r\nSummary Judgment asserting that it had insured Gonzlez under the\r\nCIGNA policy and that it had immunity under the LHWCA, as extended\r\nby the Defense Base Act, to cover employees in military\r\ninstallations in U.S. territories and possessions.  The appellants\r\nobjected, arguing that the Defense Base Act no longer applies to\r\nPuerto Rico because it ceased to be a territory following the\r\nenactment of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on\r\nJuly 25, 1952.  Without resolving the applicability of the Defense\r\nBase Act, the district court entered judgment for Martin Marietta\r\nbased on the Puerto Rico statutory employer defense because \"the\r\nobjective of workers' compensation, i.e., provide benefits and\r\nmedical care to employees injured while at work without regard to\r\nfault, was squarely met and that decedent and his family received\r\ncompensation justly due.\"                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine\r\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  We review\r\nsummary judgment de novo, \"viewing 'the entire record in the light\r\nmost hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging\r\nall reasonable inferences in that party's favor.'\"  Euromotion,\r\nInc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(quoting Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990));\r\nsee also Morris v. Government Dev't Bank of P.R., 27 F.3d 746, 748\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  This standard of review permits us to uphold the\r\ndistrict court's summary judgment regardless of whether we reject\r\nor adopt its rationale, so long as an \"independently sufficient\r\nground\" is made manifest by the record.  Mesnick v. General Elec.\r\nCo., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Garside v. Osco\r\nDrug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1990)); see also Houlton\r\nCitizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.\r\n1999); Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nThe issue before this Court is whether Martin Marietta is\r\nentitled to immunity from tort claims because they are precluded by\r\nthe applicable workers' compensation system.  The appellee proposes\r\ntwo sources for statutory immunity: the LHWCA and the PRWCA. \r\nBecause we conclude that the LHWCA applies and provides the\r\nexclusive remedy, that is where we begin our analysis.\r\nIn 1927, Congress passed the LHWCA, ch. 509, 44 Stat.\r\n1424 (codified as amended at 33 U.S.C.  901-950), to establish a\r\nsystem of uniform federal compensation for all injuries to\r\nemployees in \"the maritime field up to the line where local\r\ncompensation would not be excluded by the existence of federal\r\nadmiralty jurisdiction.\"  Royal Indem. Co. v. Puerto Rico Cement\r\nCorp., 142 F.2d 237, 239 (1st Cir. 1944) (citing S. Rep. No. 69-\r\n973; H. Rep. No. 69-1767); see also Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\r\n370 U.S. 114, 121-22, 124 (1962) (concluding that Congress enacted\r\nLHWCA to provide uniform coverage and avoid uncertainty as to\r\nsource of compensation).  In other words, the LHWCA filled a gap\r\nbetween the coverage of maritime law and state law created by the\r\nConstitution and derivative case law.  See Calbeck, 370 U.S. at\r\n115-25.\r\nIn 1941, Congress extended the provisions of the LHWCA to\r\nU.S. military bases outside the United States by enacting the\r\nDefense Base Act, ch. 357, 55 Stat. 622 (codified as amended at 42\r\nU.S.C.  1651-1654).  See Royal Indem., 142 F.2d at 239. \r\nSpecifically, the Act applies to employees working on \"any lands\r\noccupied or used by the United States for military or naval\r\npurposes in any Territory or possession outside the continental\r\nUnited States.\"  42 U.S.C.  1651(a).  In 1944, in Royal Indemnity,\r\nwe held that under the Defense Base Act, the federal compensation\r\nscheme of LHWCA applied to military defense bases in Puerto Rico\r\nwithout regard to local compensation laws.  See 142 F.2d at 239. \r\nAlthough the First Circuit has yet to resolve whether Puerto Rico's\r\nConstitution, enacted in 1952, see Pub. L. 447, 66 Stat. 327 (1952)\r\n(codified as amended at 48 U.S.C.  731(d)), altered Puerto Rico's\r\nstatus under the Defense Base Act, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\r\ndid not consider the issue when it applied the Defense Base Act to\r\nPuerto Rico in 1967, see W.R.A. v. Superior Ct. of P.R., 94 P.R.R.\r\n314, 323-24 (1967) (following Royal Indemnity and finding that\r\nlanguage of statute \"outside the United States\" clearly includes\r\nPuerto Rico).\r\nBased on dicta in Vega-Mena v. United States, 990 F.2d\r\n684, 689-90 (1st Cir. 1993), explicitly questioning the viability\r\nof Royal Indemnity, the appellant requests that we reconsider\r\nwhether for the \"narrow and specialized purposes of the Defense\r\nBase Act, Puerto Rico is [] a 'Territory or possession outside the\r\ncontinental United States' as those terms are there intended to be\r\nunderstood.\"  Of the three grounds which the appellant raises in\r\nsupport of its argument, (1) the relative significance of the\r\nRoosevelt Roads base, (2) the citizenship status of all employees\r\nat the base, and (3) the alleged change in Puerto Rico's status\r\nsubsequent to the passage of the Defense Base Act, only the third\r\nhas merit.  Appellants' argument that the Roosevelt Roads base is\r\nmore like those in states than those in Guantnamo, Cuba or the\r\nPhillippines is unavailing.  We agree with the appellee that if the\r\nDefense Base Act applied to Alaska as an incorporated territory\r\nuntil the point where it officially became a state, see Alaska\r\nOmnibus Act of June 25, 1959  40, Pub. L. 86-70, 73 Stat. 141,\r\n150; Budson Co., Contract 926 v. Oikari, 270 F. Supp. 611, 612-13\r\n(N.D. Ill. 1967), it is untenable that Puerto Rico is close enough\r\nto a state to be excluded from the Defense Base Act.  Likewise, we\r\nagree with the appellee that there is no support for the contention\r\nthat the citizenship of the base employees is a factor under LHWCA\r\nor the Defense Base Act, particularly as the logical presumption is\r\nthat the Act is intended for American citizens serving in the\r\nmilitary abroad.  Therefore, we consider only whether circumstances\r\nhave changed such that Puerto Rico is no longer a territory under\r\nthe Defense Base Act.  Although the appellant argues that the 1952\r\nConstitution alters the status of Puerto Rico under the Act, the\r\ntext of the statute, its legislative history, and subsequent\r\namendments indicate otherwise.\r\nWe begin with the language of the statute, and only if\r\nthe statute is ambiguous or leads to an unreasonable interpretation\r\ndo we turn to the legislative history and other aids.  See Brady v.\r\nCredit Recovery Co., Inc., 160 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nGrunbeck v. Dime Sav. Bank of N.Y., 74 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nTerritory is not defined in the Act or in the case law interpreting\r\nit.  See 42 U.S.C.  1651(b); Vega-Mena, 990 F.2d at 690 n.7.  When\r\na word is not defined within the statute, it is given its ordinary\r\nmeaning, with all due consideration to the context.  See Brady, 160\r\nF.3d at 66; Grunbeck, 74 F.3d at 336; Riva, 61 F.3d at 1007. \r\nHowever, the term \"'territory' does not have a fixed and technical\r\nmeaning\" and \"Puerto Rico may be found to be included within one\r\nact whose coverage extends to territories of the United States and\r\nexcluded from another.\"  Vega-Mena, 990 F.2d at 690 n.7.  Thus,\r\nwhether Puerto Rico comes within the term \"territory\" depends upon\r\nthe character and aim of the Act.  See id.\r\nThe purpose of the Defense Base Act is to provide\r\nuniformity and certainty in availability of compensation for\r\ninjured employees on military bases outside the United States.  See\r\nRoyal Indem., 142 F.2d at 239; see also O'Keefe v. Pan Am. World\r\nAirways, Inc., 338 F.2d 319, 322 (5th Cir. 1964) (observing that\r\nAct was adopted at request of Secretary of War to save on insurance\r\nexpenses).  The only consideration is whether the military base is\r\nin a territory or possession on land \"outside the continental\r\nUnited States.\"  42 U.S.C.  1651(a)(2).  Therefore, by the plain\r\nmeaning of the text, Puerto Rico is still covered by the Defense\r\nBase Act because (1) it is still subject to the plenary powers of\r\nCongress under the territorial clause, see Harris v. Rosario, 446\r\nU.S. 651 (1980); (2) Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\nlands occupied by Roosevelt Roads, see Quiles Viuda de Fonte v.\r\nColsa, Inc., 99 J.T.S. 2 at 461-62 (1999); and (3) \"continental\r\nUnited States\" is defined to include only \"the States and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia,\" 42 U.S.C.  1651(b)(4).\r\nThis interpretation is supported by legislative history\r\nspecifically indicating that Puerto Rico is within the reach of the\r\nAct.  See Royal Indem., 142 F.2d at 239 (citing H. Rep. No. 77-\r\n1070 (1941)).  We are further convinced when we consider that the\r\nDefense Base Act was amended at least four times in the decade\r\nfollowing the enactment of Puerto Rico's Constitution and Puerto\r\nRico's status as a territory was left unchanged.  See 42 U.S.C.A.\r\n1651, 1652 (West 1994).  We must assume that Congress was aware\r\nof our holding in Royal Indemnity that Puerto Rico comes under the\r\nDefense Base Act and chose not to change Puerto Rico's status, see\r\nLorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978); Garca v. Friesecke,\r\n597 F.2d 284, 293 (1st Cir. 1979) (citing cases), for there is no\r\ndoubt that Congress knew the language necessary to include Puerto\r\nRico as a state, cf. 28 U.S.C.  1332(d) (\"The word 'States,' as\r\nused in this section, includes the Territories, the District of\r\nColumbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\").  Most important,\r\nthe definition of \"continental United States\" was added to the\r\nDefense Base Act only seven years after the alleged change in\r\nPuerto Rico's status without any reference to that fact.  See\r\nBudson, 270 F. Supp. at 613.  In sharp contrast, in response to\r\nAlaska's transition from a territory to a state, Congress\r\nimmediately deleted the reference to Alaska in the Defense Base Act\r\nand added the definition of \"continental United States\" to ensure\r\nthat Alaska was excluded from the scope of the Act.  See Alaska\r\nOmnibus Act, Pub. L. 86-70, 73 Stat. 141; Budson, 270 F. Supp. at\r\n612-13.  With nothing before us to suggest that application of the\r\nDefense Base Act to Puerto Rico would contravene the purpose of the\r\nDefense Base Act, we defer to the judgment of Congress to include\r\nPuerto Rico as a territory.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nFor these reasons, we hold that Puerto Rico is still a\r\nterritory for purposes of the Defense Base Act and that Martin\r\nMarietta was entitled to immunity under the LHWCA.  Summary\r\nJudgment is affirmed.\r\n",

Gonzalez was employed by Martin Marietta, an independent contractor retained by the U.S. Navy. He worked as an engine shop supervisor at the Aerial Target System at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, Puerto Rico. On May 12, 1995, while Gonzalez was conducting a test on new equipment, an explosion occurred.

Martin Marietta answered with a Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that it had insured Gonzalez under the CIGNA policy and that it had immunity under the LHWCA, as extended by the Defense Base Act, to cover employees in military installations in U.S. territories and possessions. The appellants objected, arguing that the Defense Base Act no longer applies to Puerto Rico because it ceased to be a territory following the enactment of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on July 25, 1952. Without resolving the applicability of the Defense Base Act, the district court entered judgment for Martin Marietta based on the Puerto Rico statutory employer defense because \"the objective of workers' compensation, i.e., provide benefits and medical care to employees injured while at work without regard to fault, was squarely met and that decedent and his family received compensation justly due.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

In 1944, in Royal Indemnity, we held that under the Defense Base Act, the federal compensation scheme of LHWCA applied to military defense bases in Puerto Rico without regard to local compensation laws. See 142 F.2d at 239. Although the First Circuit has yet to resolve whether Puerto Rico's Constitution, enacted in 1952, see Pub. L. 447, 66 Stat. 327 (1952) (codified as amended at 48 U.S.C. &#167; 731(d)), altered Puerto Rico's status under the Defense Base Act, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court did not consider the issue when it applied the Defense Base Act to Puerto Rico in 1967, see W.R.A. v. Superior Ct. of P.R., 94 P.R.R. 314, 323-24 (1967) (following Royal Indemnity and finding that language of statute \"outside the United States\" clearly includes Puerto Rico).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on dicta in Vega-Mena v. United States, 990 F.2d 684, 689-90 (1st Cir. 1993), explicitly questioning the viability of Royal Indemnity, the appellant requests that we reconsider whether for the \"narrow and specialized purposes of the Defense Base Act, Puerto Rico is [] a 'Territory or possession outside the continental United States' as those terms are there intended to be understood.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Of the three grounds which the appellant raises in support of its argument, (1) the relative significance of the Roosevelt Roads base, (2) the citizenship status of all employees at the base, and (3) the alleged change in Puerto Rico's status subsequent to the passage of the Defense Base Act, only the third has merit. Appellants' argument that the Roosevelt Roads base is more like those in states than those in Guantanamo, Cuba or the Phillippines is unavailing. We agree with the appellee that if the Defense Base Act applied to Alaska as an incorporated territory<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> until the point where it officially became a state, see Alaska Omnibus Act of June 25, 1959 &#167; 40, Pub. L. 86-70, 73 Stat. 141, 150; Budson Co., Contract 926 v. Oikari, 270 F. Supp. 611, 612-13 (N.D. Ill. 1967), it is untenable that Puerto Rico is close enough to a state to be excluded from the Defense Base Act. Likewise, we agree with the appellee that there is no support for the contention that the citizenship of the base employees is a factor under LHWCA or the Defense Base Act, particularly as the logical presumption is that the Act is intended for American citizens serving in the military abroad. Therefore, we consider only whether circumstances have changed such that Puerto Rico is no longer a territory under the Defense Base Act. Although the appellant argues that the 1952 Constitution alters the status of Puerto Rico under the Act, the text of the statute, its legislative history, and subsequent amendments indicate otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the language of the statute, and only if the statute is ambiguous or leads to an unreasonable interpretation do we turn to the legislative history and other aids. See Brady v. Credit Recovery Co., Inc., 160 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 1998); Grunbeck v. Dime Sav. Bank of N.Y., 74 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1996); Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir. 1995). Territory is not defined in the Act or in the case law interpreting it. See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1651(b); Vega-Mena, 990 F.2d at 690 n.7. When a word is not defined within the statute, it is given its ordinary meaning, with all due consideration to the context. See Brady, 160 F.3d at 66; Grunbeck, 74 F.3d at 336; Riva, 61 F.3d at 1007. However, the term \"'territory' does not have a fixed and technical meaning\" and \"Puerto Rico may be found to be included within one act whose coverage extends to territories of the United States and excluded from another.\" Vega-Mena, 990 F.2d at 690 n.7. Thus, whether Puerto Rico comes within the term \"territory\" depends upon the character and aim of the Act. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the Defense Base Act is to provide uniformity and certainty in availability of compensation for injured employees on military bases outside the United States. See Royal Indem., 142 F.2d at 239; see also O'Keefe v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 338 F.2d 319, 322 (5th Cir. 1964) (observing that Act was adopted at request of Secretary of War to save on insurance expenses). The only consideration is whether the military base is in a territory or possession on land \"outside the continental United States.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1651(a)(2). Therefore, by the plain meaning of the text, Puerto Rico is still covered by the Defense Base Act because (1) it is still subject to the plenary powers of Congress under the territorial clause, see Harris v. Rosario, 446 U.S. 651 (1980); (2) Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over the lands occupied by Roosevelt Roads, see Quiles Viuda de Fonte v. Colsa, Inc., 99 J.T.S. 2 at 461-62 (1999); and (3) \"continental United States\" is defined to include only \"the States and the District of Columbia,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1651(b)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation is supported by legislative history specifically indicating that Puerto Rico is within the reach of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Royal Indem., 142 F.2d at 239 (citing H. Rep. No. 77-1070 (1941)). We are further convinced when we consider that the Defense Base Act was amended at least four times in the decade following the enactment of Puerto Rico's Constitution and Puerto Rico's status as a territory was left unchanged. See 42 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 1651, 1652 (West 1994). We must assume that Congress was aware of our holding in Royal Indemnity that Puerto Rico comes under the Defense Base Act and chose not to change Puerto Rico's status, see Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978); Garca v. Friesecke, 597 F.2d 284, 293 (1st Cir. 1979) (citing cases), for there is no doubt that Congress knew the language necessary to include Puerto Rico as a state, cf. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(d) (\"The word 'States,' as used in this section, includes the Territories, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\").Most important, the definition of \"continental United States\" was added to the Defense Base Act only seven years after the alleged change in Puerto Rico's status without any reference to that fact. See Budson, 270 F. Supp. at 613. In sharp contrast, in response to Alaska's transition from a territory to a state, Congress immediately deleted the reference to Alaska in the Defense Base Act and added the definition of \"continental United States\" to ensure that Alaska was excluded from the scope of the Act. See Alaska Omnibus Act, Pub. L. 86-70, 73 Stat. 141; Budson, 270 F. Supp. at 612-13. With nothing before us to suggest that application of the Defense Base Act to Puerto Rico would contravene the purpose of the Defense Base Act, we defer to the judgment of Congress to include Puerto Rico as a territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that Puerto Rico is still a territory for purposes of the Defense Base Act and that Martin Marietta was entitled to immunity under the LHWCA.

See id. at 689-90 &amp; n.7. The amendment eliminated the &#167; 3(a) language that established LWHCA coverage in the gap between federal maritime law and state compensation law. See 33 U.S.C. &#167; 903; Royal Indem., 142 F.2d at 238-39. However, as we recognized in Royal Indemnity, \"the 'Coverage' language in Sec. 3(a) was inapplicable and became inoperative\" for purposes of the Defense Base Act because there is no analogous conflict between federal law and the law in a territory. Id. For the same reasons, the development of Puerto Rico's compensation law is not a factor in whether the Defense Base Act applies. See id.

Gonzalez was employed by Martin Marietta, an independent contractor retained by the U.S. Navy. He worked as an engine shop supervisor at the Aerial Target System at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, Puerto Rico. On May 12, 1995, while Gonzalez was conducting a test on new equipment, an explosion occurred. Gonzalez suffered second and third degree burns over thirty percent of his body and was hospitalized until his death on July 8, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin Marietta had procured workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance from CIGNA, pursuant to its contract requirements with the Navy. Benefits were paid to appellants in accordance with the policy terms. No policy was obtained from the State Insurance Fund Corporation of Puerto Rico on behalf of Gonzalez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants filed this action pursuant to articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 31 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 5141, 5142 (1997), alleging that the damages suffered by Gonzalez were the result of diverse negligent acts of the U.S. Navy, Martin Marietta, and Teledyne. Martin Marietta answered with a Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that it had insured Gonzalez under the CIGNA policy and that it had immunity under the LHWCA, as extended by the Defense Base Act, to cover employees in military installations in U.S. territories and possessions. The appellants objected, arguing that the Defense Base Act no longer applies to Puerto Rico because it ceased to be a territory following the enactment of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on July 25, 1952. Without resolving the applicability of the Defense Base Act, the district court entered judgment for Martin Marietta based on the Puerto Rico statutory employer defense because \"the objective of workers' compensation, i.e., provide benefits and medical care to employees injured while at work without regard to fault, was squarely met and that decedent and his family received compensation justly due.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The only consideration is whether the military base is in a territory or possession on land \"outside the continental United States.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1651(a)(2). Therefore, by the plain meaning of the text, Puerto Rico is still covered by the Defense Base Act because (1) it is still subject to the plenary powers of Congress under the territorial clause, see Harris v. Rosario, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110270\"><a href=\"/opinion/110270/harris-v-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span> </a></span>(1980); (2) Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over the lands occupied by Roosevelt Roads, see Quiles Viuda de Fonte v. Colsa, Inc., 99 J.T.S. 2 at 461-62 (1999); and (3) \"continental United States\" is defined to include only \"the States and the District of Columbia,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1651(b)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation is supported by legislative history specifically indicating that Puerto Rico is within the reach of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Royal <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1551363\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Indem.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1551363/royal-indemnity-co-v-puerto-rico-cement-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">239</span> </a></span>(citing H. Rep. No. 77-1070 (1941)). We are further convinced when we consider that the Defense Base Act was amended at least four times in the decade following the enactment of Puerto Rico's Constitution and Puerto Rico's status as a territory was left unchanged. See 42 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 1651, 1652 (West 1994). We must assume that Congress was aware of our holding in Royal Indemnity that Puerto Rico comes under the Defense Base Act and chose not to change Puerto Rico's status, see Lorillard v. Pons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 580 (1978); Garca v.

In sharp contrast, in response to Alaska's transition from a territory to a state, Congress immediately deleted the reference to Alaska in the Defense Base Act and added the definition of \"continental United States\" to ensure that Alaska was excluded from the scope of the Act. See Alaska Omnibus Act, Pub. L. 86-70, 73 Stat. 141; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Budson,</span> <span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

With nothing before us to suggest that application of the Defense Base Act to Puerto Rico would contravene the purpose of the Defense Base Act, we defer to the judgment of Congress to include Puerto Rico as a territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that Puerto Rico is still a territory for purposes of the Defense Base Act and that Martin Marietta was entitled to immunity under the LHWCA.

See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 689-90 </span>&amp; n.7. The amendment eliminated the &#167; 3(a) language that established LWHCA coverage in the gap between federal maritime law and state compensation law.

However, as we recognized in Royal Indemnity, \"the 'Coverage' language in Sec. 3(a) was inapplicable and became inoperative\" for purposes of the Defense Base Act because there is no analogous conflict between federal law and the law in a territory. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1551363\"><a href=\"/opinion/1551363/royal-indemnity-co-v-puerto-rico-cement-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> For the </a></span>same reasons, the development of Puerto Rico's compensation law is not a factor in whether the Defense Base Act applies.
