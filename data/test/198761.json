SMITH, \r\n  SHARON SKEELS-CONNORS, DIANA HACKNEY, and JOHN LAUGHTON,\r\n\n                   Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n      [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Margaret A. Ishihara, with whom Fleming &amp; Ishihara was on\r\nbrief, for appellant.\r\n   Geoffrey B. McCullough, Associate Counsel, University of\r\nMassachusetts, with whom Terrence P. O'Malley, General Counsel, was\r\non brief, for appellees.\r\n\nJanuary 4, 2000\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Cynthia Kruger, a professor of\r\neducation at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, brought\r\nthis action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 against six University\r\nofficials.  Kruger alleged that her due process and First Amendment\r\nrights were violated when she was removed from her position as\r\nchairperson of the Education Department and suspended, with pay,\r\nfrom teaching for the fall 1999 semester.  The district court\r\ndenied Kruger's motion for a preliminary injunction, and she now\r\nappeals.\r\nKruger requested an injunction to prevent or rescind her\r\nremoval as department chairperson and her suspension for the fall\r\n1999 semester.  Because the fall semester has ended, the issue of\r\nKruger's suspension is moot.  See Newspaper Guild v. Ottoway\r\nNewspapers, Inc., 79 F.3d 1273, 1277 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"An appeal\r\nfrom the denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction is\r\nrendered moot when the act sought to be enjoined has occurred.\"). \r\nWe will therefore dismiss her appeal in part.  See id. at 1285 &amp;\r\nn.15 (dismissing in part appeal from denial of preliminary\r\ninjunction where one of two issues was moot on appeal).  Because\r\nKruger's request to be restored to her position as department\r\nchairperson is not moot, we will address the merits of her appeal\r\non that issue.\r\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, Kruger had to show\r\nthat (1) she was substantially likely to succeed on the merits of\r\nher claim; (2) absent the injunction there was a significant risk\r\nof irreparable harm; (3) the balance of hardships weighed in her\r\nfavor; and (4) the injunction would not harm the public interest. \r\nSee Lanier Prof'l Servs., Inc. v. Ricci, 192 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\r\n1999).  In a carefully-reasoned opinion, the district court\r\nconsidered all four parts of the test.  In our review, which is for\r\nabuse of discretion, see id., we need only reach the first part in\r\ndeciding to affirm the denial of the preliminary injunction.\r\n Kruger claimed that her removal from the chair of the\r\nEducation Department deprived her of a property interest without\r\ndue process.  The district court found that she had no\r\nconstitutionally-protected property interest in her position as\r\ndepartment chairperson.  \"To have a property interest in a benefit,\r\na person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for\r\nit.  He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.  He\r\nmust, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" \r\nBoard of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).  As a general\r\nrule, a public employee has a legitimate claim of entitlement to\r\nher position if she can be discharged only \"for cause,\" and not if\r\nshe holds her position \"at will.\"  See, e.g., King v. Town of\r\nHanover, 116 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1997).  Whether in a given\r\ncase dismissal is allowed solely for cause is a matter of state\r\nlaw.  See Cummings v. South Portland Housing Auth., 985 F.2d 1, 2\r\n(1st Cir. 1993).  \r\nThe collective bargaining agreement, which the parties\r\nagree governs the terms of Kruger's employment, provides that\r\n\"[t]he Chancellor may, after consultation with the appropriate\r\nCollege Dean and the Provost, declare a vacancy to exist [in the\r\nposition of department chairperson].  The Chancellor shall make\r\nknown to the department in writing the reasons for this action.\" \r\nNothing in the agreement suggests that a chairperson can only be\r\nremoved for cause.  The fact that the Chancellor must state a\r\nreason for the removal does not alter that conclusion.  \"Under\r\nMassachusetts law a mere requirement that reasons be stated [for\r\ndischarging a public employee] does not mean that they must be\r\nsufficient to constitute legal cause, or even that they be true. .\r\n. . Manifestly this confers no property interest.\"  Hagopian v.\r\nTrefrey, 639 F.2d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 1981) (citing Fabrizio v. City\r\nof Quincy, 404 N.E.2d 675, 676-77 (Mass. App. Ct. 1980)); see also\r\nLovelace v. Southeastern Mass. Univ., 793 F.2d 419, 422 (1st Cir.\r\n1986) (per curiam) (requirement that university state\r\n\"justification\" for non-renewal of teaching contract does not\r\ncreate property interest under Massachusetts law).  The district\r\ncourt was correct to conclude that Kruger did not have a property\r\ninterest in her position as department chairperson.  It did not\r\nabuse its discretion in finding that she was not substantially\r\nlikely to succeed on her due process claim. \r\nKruger also alleged that her removal from the department\r\nchair was in retaliation for protected speech, namely her\r\nopposition in September 1996 and September 1997 to the proposed\r\nrestructuring or elimination of the Education Department and her\r\nobjection in December 1997 to Chancellor Cressy's request that she\r\nbe less difficult with her students.  To make out a prima facie\r\ncase of a First Amendment violation, Kruger would have to show that\r\n(1) she spoke on a matter of public concern; (2) her interest in\r\nthe speech outweighed any countervailing governmental interest in\r\npromoting the efficient performance of the service provided by its\r\nemployees; and (3) the protected speech was a substantial or\r\nmotivating factor in an adverse employment decision.  See Wytrwal\r\nv. Saco School Bd., 70 F.3d 165, 170 (1st Cir. 1995).  If she made\r\nsuch a showing, the burden would shift to the defendants to show\r\nthat they would have reached the same decision absent the protected\r\nspeech.  See id. (citing Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\r\n429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)).\r\nAssuming arguendo that Kruger satisfied the first two\r\nprongs of the three-part test, we agree with the district court\r\nthat she had \"at best a marginal likelihood of success\" on the\r\nthird.  The significant lapse of time -- at least a year and a half\r\n-- between the protected speech and Kruger's suspension and removal\r\nas chairperson suggests that any connection is attenuated.  More\r\nimportantly, the record is replete with serious and consistent\r\nstudent complaints about Kruger's conduct.  Although Kruger might\r\nconvince a trier of fact that those complaints were not credible\r\nand that the administration used them as a pretext for retaliating\r\nagainst her for her protected speech, the preliminary injunction\r\nrecord certainly does not compel such a conclusion.  The district\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in holding that Kruger did not\r\nshow a substantial likelihood of success on her First Amendment\r\nclaim.\r\nAppeal dismissed in part; judgment affirmed.\n",
