Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Sven D. Wiberg, with whom Wiberg &amp; Wiberg were on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n\n   Jean B. Weld, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Paul\r\nM. Gagnon, United States Attorney, Peter E. Papps, First Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States\r\nAttorney, and Frank Lopez, Assistant United States Attorney, were\r\non brief for appellee.\r\n\nJanuary 14, 2000\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendant Charles Palmer\r\nwas convicted by a jury on three counts of robbery and four counts\r\nof conspiracy to commit robbery under 18 U.S.C.  1951 (1948). \r\nFour issues are before us, which we list in the order presented in\r\ndefendant-appellant's brief:  (1)  Did some of the prosecutor's\r\nremarks made during final argument violate defendant's due process\r\nrights and deprive him of a fair trial?  (2)  Did the district\r\ncourt err in not suppressing defendant's confession to the police? \r\n(3)  Was there sufficient evidence to sustain the conspiracy\r\ncounts?  (4)  Were the district court's instructions to the jury\r\nerroneous in light of the fact that defendant was charged as a\r\nprincipal in the indictment but the evidence showed that he was an\r\naider and abettor?  We affirm the conviction.\r\nThe background facts are as follows.  At the beginning of\r\nFebruary 1998, defendant and a friend, Talbot Curtin, decided to\r\nrob convenience stores to get money to feed their drug habits. \r\nDefendant was addicted to heroin and Curtin was hooked on crack\r\ncocaine.  According to defendant's statement to the police, Curtin\r\nwanted the robberies limited to stores in which a woman was the\r\nsole employee on the premises and there were not many customers.\r\nThe three robbery convictions were of stores in southern\r\nNew Hampshire which fit this requirement.  The conspiracy\r\nconvictions involved other convenience stores in the same area, but\r\nat the time they were \"cased,\" they did not meet the \"woman only\" \r\nstandard and/or had too many customers.  Defendant did not testify.\r\nAdditional facts will be stated in our discussion of the\r\nissues, which follows.\r\n                              I.\r\n                  THE PROSECUTOR'S COMMENTS\r\nPalmer claims that his rights to due process,\r\nconfrontation, and a fair trial by an impartial jury were violated\r\nwhen the prosecutor, during closing argument, made reference to his\r\nown personal beliefs and appealed to those of the jury to explain\r\nthe witness's decision to record Palmer's confession but not the\r\nentire custodial interrogation.  Palmer also claims that the\r\nsubsequent jury instruction was neither sufficiently\r\ncontemporaneous nor strong enough to overcome the prejudice caused.\r\nThe remarks made by the prosecutor and the colloquy\r\ninvolved were as follows:\r\n  MR. HOWARD:  Now, defense made much in his\r\nopening and attempted to make much on his\r\ncross-examination of Detective Sprankle about\r\nthe period of time when the defendant gets to\r\nthe police station and before he's put on\r\ntape.  Couldn't you just have recorded the\r\nwhole darn thing?  We know exactly what went\r\non.  Answer, No, I can't do that.  Why? \r\nBecause if I bring a defendant or a witness or\r\nanybody else into the room, and I sit him down\r\nand say, Okay, we're going to talk about\r\nrobbery, and press the button to the\r\ntaperecorder, the first thing that happens,\r\nthey are going to shut up and not going to\r\ntalk.  You do it. I do it.  The presence of\r\nthe tape \r\n\n  MR. WIBERG:  Objection.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  Overruled.  Sit down.  You can put\r\nit on the record later.\r\n\n  MR. HOWARD:  It's just common sense, that you\r\nare not going to intimidate somebody with a\r\ntaperecorder right up front.  The confession\r\ncomess [sic] out, and Detective Sprankle now\r\nasks.\r\n\n  \"Will you now put it on the tape?\"  And he\r\nvoluntarily chooses to do it.  Incidentally,\r\nthere's no request for a lawyer.  Detective\r\nSprankle said that just never happened, and it\r\ndid not happen.\r\n\nIt is clear that the prosecutor's statement (in support\r\nof a government witness) that he would have acted similarly was\r\nimproper: it was a statement of how the prosecutor himself would\r\nhave acted on a similar occasion and was, at least, indirectly, a\r\nform of vouching for the witness.  But the requisite analysis does\r\nnot end with a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.  There are\r\nother factors in the equation:\r\n  (1) whether the prosecutor's misconduct was\r\nisolated and/or deliberate; (2) whether the\r\ntrial court gave a strong and explicit\r\ncautionary instruction; and (3) whether any\r\nprejudice surviving the court's instruction\r\nlikely could have affected the outcome of the\r\ncase.\r\n\nUnited States v. Auch, 187 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 1999); see also\r\nUnited States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 574 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(adopting similar factors).  We address these factors in the\r\ncontext of this case. \r\nAs a one-time misstatement at the end of a four-day\r\ntrial, the prosecution's comment was neither so egregious nor so\r\npervasive as to poison the well.  Cf. Manning, 23 F.3d at 575\r\n(several episodes of prosecutorial overreaching were impermissibly\r\npervasive); see also United States v. Capone, 683 F.2d 582, 585-86\r\n(1st Cir. 1982) (prosecutor's statement that victim, seated in the\r\naudience, awaits the \"truth\" and the jury verdict, did not call for\r\na new trial).\r\nHere, the comment occurred during the middle of the\r\ngovernment's closing argument, not during rebuttal.  See Auch, 187\r\nF.3d at 132 (improper comments made during close of rebuttal have\r\n\"great potential to cause prejudice\").  As an ill-conceived\r\nillustration to support witness testimony, the remark was\r\nperipheral to the government's case and theme.  See United States\r\nv. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 12 (1985).\r\nPalmer argues that the judge's curative instruction,\r\nsandwiched between the government's and defendant's closing\r\narguments, was insufficient because it did not immediately follow\r\nthe misconduct.  Though delivered several minutes after the\r\nobjection, the judge's thorough comments pointedly addressed the\r\nprosecution's improper remark as well as every other objection\r\nraised by the defense during the sidebar conference.  Defense\r\ncounsel also objected to the prosecution's characterization of the\r\nelements of conspiracy, the judge's demand that the defense counsel\r\nsit down after making the objection, and the prosecution's\r\ncharacterization of the evidence.\r\nThe criticized instruction stated:\r\n  THE COURT:  Members of the jury, I have some\r\ninterim instructions.  Remember, it's my\r\nobligation to rule on objections, and you are\r\nnot to take my ruling on any objection or the\r\nmanner on which I rule on objections as any\r\ncomment about an attorney's conduct or case. \r\nThat's strictly a function for me to perform,\r\nand you are not to concern yourselves with\r\nthat.\r\n\n     During the course of Mr. Howard's final\r\nargument, he made reference to the use of a\r\ntape or a recorder whether it was used or not\r\nused and that he said something to the effect\r\nthat, You or I wouldn't do that.  Remember,\r\nyou decide the case based on evidence in the\r\ncase, not on a prosecutor's opinion, and a\r\nprosecutor can't vouch for any particular\r\nopinion or what have you.  A prosecutor can\r\nargue the case, but to the extent he indicated\r\nhe might have done it the same way, that's not\r\nrelevant to your consideration; and indeed, to\r\nsay that you or I would have done it that way\r\nis irrelevant.\r\n\n     You have to examine all of the facts that\r\nyou heard in this case and determine it based\r\non facts, the law and common sense, how you\r\nare going to come down on an issue.\r\n\n     Also remember that the attorneys make final\r\narguments to you.  They are making an effort\r\nto be accurate about the facts, the evidence\r\nas they recall the facts.  To the extent,\r\nhowever, that you find anything an attorney\r\nsays to you about the facts may differ from\r\nyour own recollection of the facts, then you\r\nshould take your own recollection on facts to\r\nthe extent that anything--occasionally during\r\nthe final arguments, an attorney might make\r\nreference to the law.  To the extent that an\r\nattorney tells you what he thinks the law is\r\nmay be different from what I'm going to tell\r\nyou what the law is, and you take the law from\r\nthe Court and not from the attorney.\r\n\nWe find these instructions curatively sufficient and\r\ntimely given.  The district court has considerable leeway as to the\r\nphrasing and timing of a curative instruction.  See United States\r\nv. Moreno, 991 F.2d 943, 948 (1st Cir. 1993) (oblique, but lengthy,\r\ncurative instruction sufficient to communicate message that jury is\r\nto ignore recent prosecutor comments).  \r\n\"Finally in appraising possible prejudice we do not\r\nignore the fact that the case against Moreno was ample.\"  Id. at\r\n948.  So here, any lingering prejudicial effect from the misconduct\r\npales in comparison to the government's evidence implicating\r\nPalmer's involvement in the crimes: a taped confession, supported\r\nby independent corroborating evidence from an eyewitness and a\r\nvideo surveillance camera.\r\n                             II.\r\n\n                WAS THE DEFENDANT'S CONFESSION\r\n                    ERRONEOUSLY ADMITTED?\r\n\nOn March 20, 1998, the defendant was arrested at his home\r\nby members of the Nashua Police Department, including Detective\r\nRichard Sprankle, pursuant to an arrest warrant for robbery.  En\r\nroute to the police station, Palmer, who had not been given notice\r\nof his Miranda rights, emphatically and loudly denied any\r\ninvolvement in the robberies and accused the detectives of lacking\r\nany evidence to demonstrate otherwise.  In response, Sprankle\r\nrepeatedly told the defendant to shut up, and indicated that the\r\npolice had an incriminating confession from Talbot \"Timmy\" Curtin\r\nimplicating Palmer in the robberies.  The detective also stated, at\r\nsome point and at least once, that Curtin   who resided with\r\nPalmer, Palmer's girlfriend and her daughter   was a child\r\nmolester.  For the duration of the car trip, no questions were\r\nasked of the defendant.\r\nAt the police station, the defendant was booked according\r\nto standard operating procedures.  Though still not informed of his\r\nMiranda rights, he was instructed by Sprankle to answer nothing\r\nbeyond the booking officer's routine questions.  After being taken\r\nto an interrogation room, the defendant was told that he could\r\nremain silent if he wanted but that the government had\r\nincriminating statements from Curtin, which the defendant was told\r\nhe could listen to after receiving his Miranda warnings.\r\nBefore the Miranda discussion, Sprankle asked the\r\ndefendant if he had used any drugs or intoxicants that day.  The\r\ndefendant replied that he had not.  Sprankle then recited the\r\nMiranda rights from a printed waiver form, asked Palmer if he\r\nunderstood them, and to state his understanding of each right. \r\nPalmer did so.  The defendant was then asked to, and did, initial\r\nthe printed version of each right on the waiver form.  After this,\r\nthe detective read the form's waiver portion.  The defendant was\r\ntold to read the form, and then asked if he understood it.  He was\r\nthen asked if he wished to talk and waive his rights, and if he did\r\nto initial the waiver and sign it, which defendant did.  Later, at\r\nthe beginning of the tape recorded segment of the confession, the\r\nprevious waiver process was recounted and Palmer again stated that\r\nhe wanted to voluntarily waive his Miranda rights.\r\nThe applicable standard of review is well established. \r\nIn the context of a motion to suppress, a district court's findings\r\nof facts are reviewed for clear error.  See United States v.\r\nMarenghi, 109 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1997).  Where there are two\r\nplausible competing interpretations of the evidence, the district\r\ncourt's choice of one of them cannot be clearly erroneous.  See\r\nUnited States v. Burns, 15 F.3d 211, 216 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Cruz Jimenez, 894 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1990)). \r\nDistrict court determinations of questions of law, including those\r\ninvolving the Constitution are reviewed de novo.  See Marenghi, 109\r\nF.3d at 31.  The issue of voluntariness is a question of law\r\nsubject to plenary review.  See United States v. Bienvenue, 632\r\nF.2d 910, 913 (1st Cir. 1980) (requiring appellate court to make\r\nindependent determination).\r\nA defendant may waive his Miranda rights if the waiver is\r\nmade voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.  See Miranda v.\r\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).  To determine the voluntariness\r\nof a waiver, it is necessary to look at the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, see Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 285 (1991),\r\nincluding \"the tactics used by the police, the details of the\r\ninterrogation, and any characteristics of the accused that might\r\ncause his will easily to be overborne.\" United States v. Rohrbach,\r\n813 F.2d 142, 144 (8th Cir. 1987); see also United States v.\r\nJackson, 918 F.2d 236, 241 (1st Cir. 1990).  Though courts must\r\npresume that a defendant did not waive his rights, see Jackson, 918\r\nF.2d at 241, the government may prove a waiver by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence.  See Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 168\r\n(1986).\r\nThe defendant claims that the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting his post-arrest statements because his waiver of his\r\nMiranda rights was not made knowingly, voluntarily and\r\nintelligently given the totality of the circumstances.  Palmer\r\npoints to the following circumstances:  he was a heroin addict in\r\nwithdrawal and under the influence of anti-depressants at the time\r\nof his interrogation; he was not read the Miranda rights upon\r\narrest; his request to speak to an attorney was denied; he was a\r\nvictim of child molestation; and the police admittedly and\r\nintentionally lied about Talbot \"Timmy\" Curtin, the defendant's co-\r\nconspirator, being a child molester.\r\nWe begin our analysis by upholding the district court's\r\nfinding that defendant did not request an attorney.  The trial\r\ncourt weighed this allegation against Detective Sprankle's\r\ntestimony, which denied that any such request was ever made, and\r\ndetermined the latter to be more credible.  The court found support\r\nfor its conclusion in the demeanor and candidness of the\r\ndetective's testimony and his actions on the night of the\r\ndefendant's arrest.  See United States v. Palmer, Cr. No. 98-42-01-\r\nJD, slip op. at 9 (D. N.H. July 24, 1998).  Where evaluations of\r\nwitness credibility are concerned, we are especially deferential to\r\nthe district court's judgment.  See United States v. Jones, 187\r\nF.3d 210, 214-16 (1st Cir. 1999) (determination that government\r\ntestimony, though inconsistent, was credible is not clearly\r\nerroneous).  The district court was not required to credit the\r\nappellant's version of the events.  See United States v. Budzyna,\r\n666 F.2d 666, 672 (1st Cir. 1981).\r\nThe defendant's claim that the Miranda warnings were\r\nuntimely is rejected.  In the interim between being arrested and\r\nbeing Mirandized, the defendant was repeatedly advised to keep\r\nquiet and was not asked any questions.  Though the delay of a\r\nMiranda warning may be prejudicial, it was not so here.  The trial\r\ncourt specifically found that the defendant was questioned only\r\nafter waiving such rights.  It is clear that defendant did not make\r\nany incriminating statements until the warning was read to him,\r\nread by him, and initialed by him.\r\nPalmer's claim of a weakened physical and mental state\r\ncaused by heroin withdrawal and use of Trazadone was also resolved\r\nagainst him by the district court.  Defendant was a heroin addict,\r\nand at the time of the interrogation, he claimed he was suffering\r\nfrom withdrawal because he had not consumed the amount of heroin\r\ncommensurate with his seven-bag-a-day habit.  The transcript of the\r\nconfession indicates that he felt discomfort because of the effects\r\nof the withdrawal.  \r\nThe district court held that the defendant's mental state\r\nwas not deficient based upon the suppression hearing testimony and\r\nthe tape recorded confession.  On the night of the arrest,\r\ndefendant stated that his mind was working properly and he\r\nunderstood his Miranda rights and his waiver of them.  The\r\ndetective, who was experienced in identifying substance abusers,\r\ntestified that the defendant appeared clear-headed.  The trial\r\ncourt credited the confession, because the defendant's tone,\r\nclarity, and detailed recall of the robberies as set forth in the\r\nconfession supported a finding of lucidity.  Because he had a\r\nrecord of sixteen prior arrests, the district court found that\r\nPalmer comprehended the significance of a Miranda waiver.  The\r\ncourt's finding that Palmer intelligently and knowingly waived his\r\nrights had a solid evidentiary basis in his confession statements\r\nand Detective Sprankle's testimony and thus was not clearly\r\nerroneous.  See United States v. Crooks, 766 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.\r\n1985) (determination that statement not coerced, given government\r\ndenial of threats, has adequate evidentiary support); see also\r\nUnited States v. Melanson, 691 F.2d 579, 588 (1st Cir. 1981)\r\n(courts should consider the age, experience, education, background,\r\nintelligence, and conduct of the defendant).\r\nEven if Palmer, arguendo, was in a weakened condition\r\nbecause of his withdrawal symptoms, it does not necessarily follow\r\nthat his post-arrest statements were involuntary.  See United\r\nStates v. Byrne, 83 F.3d 984, 989 (8th Cir. 1996) (district court\r\ndid not err in finding that defendant, after taking the drug\r\nmethadone, made voluntary statement).  In the context of the\r\nvoluntariness of a confession, a defendant's mental state by itself\r\nand apart from its relation to official coercion never disposes of\r\nthe inquiry into constitutional voluntariness.  See Connelly, 479\r\nU.S. at 164. \r\nTo establish coercion, Palmer focuses upon Detective\r\nSprankle's intentional lie that Curtin was a child molester, which\r\nhe argues was made because of his own history as a victim of child\r\nsexual abuse.  Defendant asserts that such \"ploys were the\r\nfunctional equivalent of interrogation.\"  We disagree.  Based upon\r\nthe trial court's subsidiary findings of fact, we find the waiver\r\nto have been made free of coercion.\r\nThere is some dispute about when and how often Curtin was\r\ncharacterized as a child molester, as well as when the defendant\r\ninformed the detective that he had been a victim of child\r\nmolestation.  The detective conceded that the characterization was\r\na lie, but, denied any knowledge of the defendant's history of\r\nmolestation.  Detective Sprankle claimed that the lie was intended\r\nto stigmatize Curtin and to break any bond between the\r\nconfederates.  The district court found that the lie, though\r\nadmittedly a ploy, was not done with foreknowledge of the\r\ndefendant's history.  The court therefore concluded that the\r\nstatement was neither coercive nor improperly deceitful.  We cannot\r\nset aside this finding of fact as clearly erroneous.  We have read\r\ndefendant's confession carefully and can find nothing in it to\r\nindicate that the \"lie\" prompted his statement to the police or\r\ninfluenced his recital of the facts in any way.  We note that the\r\nconfessions of both Palmer and Curtin were very similar except that\r\neach of them claimed that he drove the get-away vehicle and the\r\nother one committed the actual robbery.  \r\nThe court also held that the defendant was not threatened\r\nwith consequences of failing to speak, nor did the police tactic\r\ncreate a sense of urgency.  We agree with this finding.  See\r\nConnelly, 479 U.S. at 170 (\"The voluntariness of a waiver of this\r\nprivilege has always depended on the absence of police\r\noverreaching, not on 'free choice' in any broader sense of the\r\nword.\").  We note certain relevant findings of the district court: \r\n\"The officers appeared to be professional and there was no\r\nindication that the officers were rude, abrasive, or forceful. \r\nIndeed, the taped portion of the interview indicates a very\r\ncooperative relation between the interrogating police and the\r\ndefendant.\"  Elsewhere, the court cited the defendant's own taped\r\nadmission that his statement was made free of threats or promises. \r\nFinally, Palmer argues that the trial judge addressed its\r\nconcerns seriatim instead of in combination to determine\r\nvoluntariness.  He also contends, citing Brewer v. Williams, 430\r\nU.S. 387 (1977), that the court must indulge every presumption\r\nagainst waiver.  If the trial judge relied disproportionately or\r\nsolely on a single factor, see Bynzada, 666 F.2d at 672 (signed\r\nwaiver form is not conclusive to determine voluntariness of\r\nstatement), Palmer might have a meritorious argument.  But given\r\nthe trial judge's searching, meticulous analysis, there is no basis\r\nfor setting aside the finding of voluntariness, especially since\r\nthe government clearly met its preponderance burden.  \r\nAfter reviewing all the evidence, we do not have a\r\ndefinite and firm conviction that the district court's\r\ndetermination that the waiver was voluntarily made was clearly\r\nerroneous.  See Jones, 187 F.3d at 214.\r\n                             III.\r\n          THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE CONSPIRACY EVIDENCE\r\nDefendant was charged, under the Hobbs Act, 19 U.S.C.\r\n1951, with four counts of conspiring with Talbot Curtin to rob\r\nthree convenience stores in southern New Hampshire.  Count One\r\ncharged a conspiracy made on February 4, 1998, to rob Sell's Mobil\r\nStation located at 242 Amherst Street, Nashua, New Hampshire. \r\nCount Two charged a conspiracy to rob Zaynab Shell Food Mart\r\nlocated at 160 Broad Street, Nashua, New Hampshire.  Count Four\r\ncharged a conspiracy to rob the same store described in Count One;\r\nthe date for this conspiracy was February 7, 1998.  Count Five\r\ncharged a conspiracy to rob Jeannotte's Market located at 2\r\nCourtland Street, Nashua, New Hampshire.\r\nPalmer's defense is straight forward:  there was no\r\nevidence of any meeting of the minds to rob the stores listed in\r\nthe conspiracy counts.  Curtin insisted that they rob only stores\r\nthat were serviced by a woman and had no customers at the time of\r\nthe robbery.  Defendant argues that if there was any agreement it\r\nwas that the stores named in the conspiracy counts were not to be\r\nrobbed because at the time they were surveilled, they did not meet\r\nCurtin's conditions for committing a robbery.\r\nLogical as this contention may seem, it founders on the\r\nrocks of legal precedent holding that a condition imposed by the\r\nconspirators upon the carrying out of a conspiracy does not negate\r\nthe conspiracy.  We view the evidence as to each conspiracy count\r\nthrough a lens favorable to the verdict.  We recited the well-\r\nestablished standard recently in United States v. Morillo, 158 F.3d\r\n18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998), in which we said:\r\n  We assess the sufficiency of the evidence as a\r\nwhole, including all reasonable inferences, in\r\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, with\r\na view to whether a rational trier of fact\r\ncould have found the defendant guilty beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.  We do not weigh witness\r\ncredibility, but resolve all credibility\r\nissues in favor of the verdict.  The evidence\r\nmay be entirely circumstantial, and need not\r\nexclude every reasonable hypothesis of\r\ninnocence; that is, the factfinder may decide\r\namong reasonable interpretations of the\r\nevidence.\r\n\nThe evidence as to Count One was that on February 4,\r\n1998, defendant drove Curtin to the described Mobil station\r\nconvenience store.  The conspirators had agreed to rob the store if\r\nthere was only a female clerk on the premises.  Curtin was to enter\r\nthe store and take the money if this condition was met.  The store\r\nwas not robbed because the person in charge was a male.\r\nThe same circumstances prevailed as to Count Two.  On\r\nFebruary 4, 1998   the same day   defendant drove Curtin to the\r\nShell station described in the count with the intent that Curtin\r\nwould rob it, if his predetermined conditions were met.  Once\r\nagain, Curtin found a male running the store.  It was, therefore,\r\nnot robbed.\r\nCount Four is a reprise of Count One, the only difference\r\nbeing the date of the alleged conspiracy   February 7, 1998   three\r\ndays later.\r\nThe Count Five conspiracy has a slightly different\r\nfactual twist.  Defendant drove Curtin to Jeannotte's Market, the\r\nstore described in the count.  Curtin decided, based on the number\r\nof cars parked in front of the store, that there were too many\r\npeople present for the robbery to be carried out.\r\nIn answer to a question during his interrogation by the\r\npolice, defendant said that it upset him that Curtin insisted on\r\nrobbing only stores clerked by a woman.  \"Because I feel that if\r\nyou're going to do a robbery that [sic] what's the difference male\r\nor female?  It's to be, end result is the same.  You're stealing\r\nmoney.\"\r\nThe gist of conspiracy is an agreement to disobey or to\r\ndisregard the law.  See United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160,\r\n1165 (1st Cir. 1993).  The government must prove an intent to agree\r\nand an intent to commit the substantive offense.  See id.  Evidence\r\nof an overt act is not required to establish a Hobbs Act\r\nconspiracy.  See United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1115\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).  A conspiracy may be established through\r\ncircumstantial evidence, and the government need only demonstrate\r\na tacit understanding between the conspirators to prove its case. \r\nSee id. at 1118.  Because the essence of a conspiracy is an\r\nagreement, see United States v. Miranda-Ortiz, 926 F.2d 172, 175\r\n(2nd Cir. 1991), a failure to achieve the objective, even if\r\nfactually impossible, is not a defense.  See United States v. Giry,\r\n818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\nIn United States v. Anello, 765 F.2d 253, 262 (1st Cir.\r\n1985), then-Judge Breyer (now Justice Breyer) held that an\r\nagreement to buy marijuana is \"for conspiracy purposes an agreement\r\nto buy, at least as long as the potential buyer believes the\r\ncondition likely to be fulfilled.\"  \r\nJudge Posner in United States v. Podolsky, 798 F.2d 177\r\n(7th Cir. 1986), cited to Anello and then pointed out:\r\n  Every conspiracy is conditional to some\r\nextent, for no one agrees to go through with\r\nan agreement no matter what.  Conditions,\r\nexpress or implied, do not make a contract\r\nunenforceable; they merely define the\r\ncircumstances in which a party can avoid\r\nhaving to perform his contractual obligation;\r\nthey presuppose rather than nullify the\r\nobligation.\r\n\nId. at 178 (citation omitted).\r\n\nThe doctrine that a condition made by the conspirators\r\ncannot nullify the underlying conspiracy is recognized and applied\r\nacross the federal circuits.  And defendant has cited no cases to\r\nthe contrary.  \r\nIn United States v. Dworken, 855 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.\r\n1988), we suggested that the test for conditional conspiratorial\r\nliability should focus on the likelihood that the condition\r\nprecedent will be fulfilled.  See Anello, 765 F.2d at 262. \r\nLiability should attach if the defendant reasonably believed that\r\nthe conditions would obtain.  See Dworken, 855 F.2d at 19.  In this\r\ncase, one factor suggesting such reasonable belief is the fact that\r\nthe conditions were met in two other cases, and when they were met,\r\nthe defendants carried out the robberies.\r\nFirst, defendant himself did not think it should make any\r\ndifference whether the stores to be robbed were serviced by a woman\r\nor a man.  If he were the one committing the robbery instead of his\r\npartner, he might not have followed Curtin's \"woman only\" rule.  In\r\nthis connection it is to be noted that in Curtin's statement to the\r\npolice, he claimed that defendant actually committed the robberies\r\nand that he (Curtin) drove the getaway vehicle.\r\nMoreover, whether or not Curtin's rule was followed could \r\ndepend upon how badly the conspirators needed drugs.  In the\r\nparlance of the streets, the conspirators were a couple of\r\n\"junkies\" hooked on heroin and crack-cocaine.  They conspired to\r\nrob the stores to feed their habits.  They did not follow normal\r\npatterns of behavior.  The conditions were self-imposed and could\r\nbe ignored by either one of the conspirators or both at their whim\r\nor caprice.  The condition was not a bar to the robbers, it was a\r\nself-imposed restraint that could easily be negated.\r\nThe only problem we might have with the conspiracy counts\r\nis charging two conspiracies to rob the same store, Counts One and\r\nFour.  Defendant, however, has not raised any specific objection to\r\nthis, so under our well-established rule we do not consider it.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n             THE INDICTMENT AND JURY INSTRUCTIONS\r\nDefendant argues that the jury instructions on the\r\nsubstantive counts alone or in combination with the language of the\r\nindictment were so confusing as to deprive him of a fair trial.\r\nThe substantive counts in the indictment, Counts Three,\r\nSix, and Seven, charged that the defendant did commit each robbery\r\nand was \"aided and abetted by Talbot Timothy Curtin.\"  The\r\ngovernment proved the opposite: that Curtin committed the\r\nrobberies, aided and abetted by defendant who drove the get-away\r\nvehicle.  There was no evidence that defendant went into any of the\r\nstores that were robbed and took the money.\r\nAt the close of the government's case, defendant moved to\r\ndismiss because of the difference between the government's proof\r\nand the wording of the substantive counts.  During the discussion,\r\nthe prosecutor acknowledged that his evidence showed that defendant\r\nwas an aider and abettor, not the principal as the indictment\r\ncharged.  The prosecution argued that under 18 U.S.C.  2(a) it did\r\nnot make a difference.  The court agreed with the prosecutor and,\r\nrelying on our opinion in United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607\r\n(1st Cir. 1990), denied defendant's motion to dismiss.\r\nWe now examine the jury instructions.  The court read the \r\nsubstantive counts of the indictment verbatim.  He then explained\r\nthe pertinent provisions of 18 U.S.C.  1951.  He then stated: \r\n     Under the law, a person can be held\r\nresponsible for a crime if he directly\r\ncommitted the crime himself, or if he aids,\r\nabets, counsels, commands, induces or procures\r\nanother to commit. \r\n\nThe court read the provisions of 18 U.S.C.  2(a) to the jury.  The\r\ncourt then instructed:\r\n     With respect to Counts 3, 6, and 7, the\r\ngovernment contends that the defendant aided\r\nand abetted Talbot Curtain [sic] in committing\r\nthe robberies alleged in these Counts.  There\r\nare three material elements of the offense of\r\naiding and abetting the commission of a crime,\r\neach of which the government must prove beyond\r\na reasonable doubt with respect to each of \r\nCounts 3, 6 and 7 in order for you to find the\r\ndefendant guilty.\r\n\n     First, that the defendant knew that robbery\r\nwas to be committed or was being committed by\r\nTalbot Curtain [sic]; second, that the\r\ndefendant knowingly did some act for the\r\npurpose of aiding the commission of that\r\ncrime; and third, that the defendant acted\r\nwith the intention of causing the crime\r\ncharged to be committed.\r\n\n     The aiding and abetting statute, it is not\r\nnecessary for the government to show that the\r\ndefendant himself physically committed the\r\ncrime charged.  A person who aids and abets\r\nanother to commit an offense is just as guilty\r\nof the offense as if that person had actually\r\ncommitted it alone.  Accordingly, you may find\r\na defendant guilty of a robbery if you find\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Talbot Curtain\r\n[sic] actually committed the robbery with\r\nwhich the defendant is charged and that the\r\ndefendant aided and abetted Talbot Curtain\r\n[sic] in the commission of that robbery or\r\ncaused the robbery to be committed by Talbot\r\nCurtain [sic].  \r\n\n     In order to aid, abet or cause another to\r\ncommit a crime, it is necessary that the\r\ndefendant knowingly and wilfully associate\r\nhimself in some way with the crime and that\r\nthe defendant knowingly and wilfully seek by\r\nsome act to help to make the crime succeed.\r\n\nThe indictment was sent to the jury.  The jurors were\r\ngiven a copy of the jury instructions prior to the charge.  The\r\njudge advised them that they could read them as he gave the\r\ninstructions.\r\nAfter the jury advised the court that it had reached a\r\nverdict and returned to the courtroom, the clerk asked: \"How does\r\nthe jury find the defendant Charles Palmer, not guilty or guilty as\r\nto\" each count in the indictment?  The jury found defendant guilty\r\non all counts.  \r\nWe agree with the district court that Sanchez, 917 F.2d\r\nat 607, controls.  In Sanchez, the conspiracy count did not charge\r\ndefendant with aiding and abetting.  Nevertheless, the district\r\ncourt charged the jury that defendants could be convicted if they\r\naided and abetted the substantive offense of possessing cocaine\r\nwith intent to distribute.  Defendant Sanchez claimed that the\r\ninstruction \"violated his sixth amendment right to be informed of\r\nthe nature and cause of the accusation against him.\"  Id. at 611\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nAfter a thorough canvass of the pertinent cases from\r\nother circuits, we held:\r\n  The contention falls, especially because\r\n\"aiding and abetting\" is not a separate\r\noffense.  United States v. Thirion, 813 F.2d\r\n146, 151 (8th Cir. 1987); United States v.\r\nMcKnight, 799 F.2d 443, 445 (8th Cir. 1986);\r\nsee also United States v. Moya-Gomez, 860 F.2d\r\n706, 756 (7th Cir. 1988).  Title 18 United\r\nStates Code, section 2, \"simply makes those\r\nwho aid and abet in a crime punishable as\r\nprincipals.\"  Thirion, 813 F.2d at 151\r\n(quoting McKnight, 799 F.2d at 445).  Aiding\r\nand abetting is \"an alternative charge in\r\nevery . . . count, whether explicit or\r\nimplicit.\"  McKnight, 799 F.2d at 445 (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Walker, 621 F.2d 163, 166\r\n(5th Cir. 1980)).  Accord United States v.\r\nBullock, 451 F.2d 884, 888 (5th Cir. 1971);\r\nUnited States v. Lester, 363 F.2d 68, 72 (6th\r\nCir. 1966).  A defendant can be convicted of\r\naiding and abetting the commission of a\r\nsubstantive offense \"upon a proper\r\ndemonstration of proof so long as no unfair\r\nsurprise results.\"  United States v. Galiffa,\r\n734 F.2d 306, 312 (7th Cir. 1984); accord\r\nUnited States v. Tucker, 552 F.2d 202, 204\r\n(7th Cir. 1977).\r\nSanchez, 917 F.2d at 611.\r\nIf a defendant can be convicted of aiding and abetting\r\nwithout being so charged in the indictment, we cannot find that\r\ndefendant here was deprived of a fair trial because he was\r\nconvicted of being an aider and abettor, even though charged as the\r\nprincipal, when the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat he drove the get-away vehicle while his partner-in-crime\r\ncommitted the robberies charged.  There might be cases in which the\r\nlanguage of the indictment so misleads a defendant so as to\r\nprejudice an effective defense, but this is not such a case.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n",

Defendant Charles Palmer\r\nwas convicted by a jury on three counts of robbery and four counts\r\nof conspiracy to commit robbery under 18 U.S.C.  1951 (1948). \r\nFour issues are before us, which we list in the order presented in\r\ndefendant-appellant's brief:  (1)  Did some of the prosecutor's\r\nremarks made during final argument violate defendant's due process\r\nrights and deprive him of a fair trial?  (2)  Did the district\r\ncourt err in not suppressing defendant's confession to the police? \r\n(3)  Was there sufficient evidence to sustain the conspiracy\r\ncounts?  (4)  Were the district court's instructions to the jury\r\nerroneous in light of the fact that defendant was charged as a\r\nprincipal in the indictment but the evidence showed that he was an\r\naider and abettor?  We affirm the conviction.\r\nThe background facts are as follows.  At the beginning of\r\nFebruary 1998, defendant and a friend, Talbot Curtin, decided to\r\nrob convenience stores to get money to feed their drug habits. \r\nDefendant was addicted to heroin and Curtin was hooked on crack\r\ncocaine.  According to defendant's statement to the police, Curtin\r\nwanted the robberies limited to stores in which a woman was the\r\nsole employee on the premises and there were not many customers.\r\nThe three robbery convictions were of stores in southern\r\nNew Hampshire which fit this requirement.  The conspiracy\r\nconvictions involved other convenience stores in the same area, but\r\nat the time they were \"cased,\" they did not meet the \"woman only\" \r\nstandard and/or had too many customers.  Defendant did not testify.\r\nAdditional facts will be stated in our discussion of the\r\nissues, which follows.\r\n                              I.\r\n                  THE PROSECUTOR'S COMMENTS\r\nPalmer claims that his rights to due process,\r\nconfrontation, and a fair trial by an impartial jury were violated\r\nwhen the prosecutor, during closing argument, made reference to his\r\nown personal beliefs and appealed to those of the jury to explain\r\nthe witness's decision to record Palmer's confession but not the\r\nentire custodial interrogation.  Palmer also claims that the\r\nsubsequent jury instruction was neither sufficiently\r\ncontemporaneous nor strong enough to overcome the prejudice caused.\r\nThe remarks made by the prosecutor and the colloquy\r\ninvolved were as follows:\r\n  MR. HOWARD:  Now, defense made much in his\r\nopening and attempted to make much on his\r\ncross-examination of Detective Sprankle about\r\nthe period of time when the defendant gets to\r\nthe police station and before he's put on\r\ntape.  Couldn't you just have recorded the\r\nwhole darn thing?  We know exactly what went\r\non.  Answer, No, I can't do that.  Why? \r\nBecause if I bring a defendant or a witness or\r\nanybody else into the room, and I sit him down\r\nand say, Okay, we're going to talk about\r\nrobbery, and press the button to the\r\ntaperecorder, the first thing that happens,\r\nthey are going to shut up and not going to\r\ntalk.  You do it. I do it.  The presence of\r\nthe tape \r\n\n  MR. WIBERG:  Objection.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  Overruled.  Sit down.  You can put\r\nit on the record later.\r\n\n  MR. HOWARD:  It's just common sense, that you\r\nare not going to intimidate somebody with a\r\ntaperecorder right up front.  The confession\r\ncomess [sic] out, and Detective Sprankle now\r\nasks.\r\n\n  \"Will you now put it on the tape?\"  And he\r\nvoluntarily chooses to do it.  Incidentally,\r\nthere's no request for a lawyer.  Detective\r\nSprankle said that just never happened, and it\r\ndid not happen.\r\n\nIt is clear that the prosecutor's statement (in support\r\nof a government witness) that he would have acted similarly was\r\nimproper: it was a statement of how the prosecutor himself would\r\nhave acted on a similar occasion and was, at least, indirectly, a\r\nform of vouching for the witness.  But the requisite analysis does\r\nnot end with a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.  There are\r\nother factors in the equation:\r\n  (1) whether the prosecutor's misconduct was\r\nisolated and/or deliberate; (2) whether the\r\ntrial court gave a strong and explicit\r\ncautionary instruction; and (3) whether any\r\nprejudice surviving the court's instruction\r\nlikely could have affected the outcome of the\r\ncase.\r\n\nUnited States v.

Though delivered several minutes after the\r\nobjection, the judge's thorough comments pointedly addressed the\r\nprosecution's improper remark as well as every other objection\r\nraised by the defense during the sidebar conference.  Defense\r\ncounsel also objected to the prosecution's characterization of the\r\nelements of conspiracy, the judge's demand that the defense counsel\r\nsit down after making the objection, and the prosecution's\r\ncharacterization of the evidence.\r\nThe criticized instruction stated:\r\n  THE COURT:  Members of the jury, I have some\r\ninterim instructions.  Remember, it's my\r\nobligation to rule on objections, and you are\r\nnot to take my ruling on any objection or the\r\nmanner on which I rule on objections as any\r\ncomment about an attorney's conduct or case. \r\nThat's strictly a function for me to perform,\r\nand you are not to concern yourselves with\r\nthat.\r\n\n     During the course of Mr. Howard's final\r\nargument, he made reference to the use of a\r\ntape or a recorder whether it was used or not\r\nused and that he said something to the effect\r\nthat, You or I wouldn't do that.  Remember,\r\nyou decide the case based on evidence in the\r\ncase, not on a prosecutor's opinion, and a\r\nprosecutor can't vouch for any particular\r\nopinion or what have you.  A prosecutor can\r\nargue the case, but to the extent he indicated\r\nhe might have done it the same way, that's not\r\nrelevant to your consideration; and indeed, to\r\nsay that you or I would have done it that way\r\nis irrelevant.\r\n\n     You have to examine all of the facts that\r\nyou heard in this case and determine it based\r\non facts, the law and common sense, how you\r\nare going to come down on an issue.\r\n\n     Also remember that the attorneys make final\r\narguments to you.  They are making an effort\r\nto be accurate about the facts, the evidence\r\nas they recall the facts.  To the extent,\r\nhowever, that you find anything an attorney\r\nsays to you about the facts may differ from\r\nyour own recollection of the facts, then you\r\nshould take your own recollection on facts to\r\nthe extent that anything--occasionally during\r\nthe final arguments, an attorney might make\r\nreference to the law.  To the extent that an\r\nattorney tells you what he thinks the law is\r\nmay be different from what I'm going to tell\r\nyou what the law is, and you take the law from\r\nthe Court and not from the attorney.\r\n\nWe find these instructions curatively sufficient and\r\ntimely given.

En\r\nroute to the police station, Palmer, who had not been given notice\r\nof his Miranda rights, emphatically and loudly denied any\r\ninvolvement in the robberies and accused the detectives of lacking\r\nany evidence to demonstrate otherwise.  In response, Sprankle\r\nrepeatedly told the defendant to shut up, and indicated that the\r\npolice had an incriminating confession from Talbot \"Timmy\" Curtin\r\nimplicating Palmer in the robberies.  The detective also stated, at\r\nsome point and at least once, that Curtin   who resided with\r\nPalmer, Palmer's girlfriend and her daughter   was a child\r\nmolester.  For the duration of the car trip, no questions were\r\nasked of the defendant.\r\nAt the police station, the defendant was booked according\r\nto standard operating procedures.  Though still not informed of his\r\nMiranda rights, he was instructed by Sprankle to answer nothing\r\nbeyond the booking officer's routine questions.  After being taken\r\nto an interrogation room, the defendant was told that he could\r\nremain silent if he wanted but that the government had\r\nincriminating statements from Curtin, which the defendant was told\r\nhe could listen to after receiving his Miranda warnings.\r\nBefore the Miranda discussion, Sprankle asked the\r\ndefendant if he had used any drugs or intoxicants that day.  The\r\ndefendant replied that he had not.  Sprankle then recited the\r\nMiranda rights from a printed waiver form, asked Palmer if he\r\nunderstood them, and to state his understanding of each right. \r\nPalmer did so.  The defendant was then asked to, and did, initial\r\nthe printed version of each right on the waiver form.  After this,\r\nthe detective read the form's waiver portion.  The defendant was\r\ntold to read the form, and then asked if he understood it.  He was\r\nthen asked if he wished to talk and waive his rights, and if he did\r\nto initial the waiver and sign it, which defendant did.  Later, at\r\nthe beginning of the tape recorded segment of the confession, the\r\nprevious waiver process was recounted and Palmer again stated that\r\nhe wanted to voluntarily waive his Miranda rights.\r\nThe applicable standard of review is well established. \r\nIn the context of a motion to suppress, a district court's findings\r\nof facts are reviewed for clear error.

Palmer\r\npoints to the following circumstances:  he was a heroin addict in\r\nwithdrawal and under the influence of anti-depressants at the time\r\nof his interrogation; he was not read the Miranda rights upon\r\narrest; his request to speak to an attorney was denied; he was a\r\nvictim of child molestation; and the police admittedly and\r\nintentionally lied about Talbot \"Timmy\" Curtin, the defendant's co-\r\nconspirator, being a child molester.\r\nWe begin our analysis by upholding the district court's\r\nfinding that defendant did not request an attorney.  The trial\r\ncourt weighed this allegation against Detective Sprankle's\r\ntestimony, which denied that any such request was ever made, and\r\ndetermined the latter to be more credible.  The court found support\r\nfor its conclusion in the demeanor and candidness of the\r\ndetective's testimony and his actions on the night of the\r\ndefendant's arrest.  See United States v. Palmer, Cr. No. 98-42-01-\r\nJD, slip op. at 9 (D. N.H. July 24, 1998).  Where evaluations of\r\nwitness credibility are concerned, we are especially deferential to\r\nthe district court's judgment.

The district court was not required to credit the\r\nappellant's version of the events.  See United States v. Budzyna,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398009\"><a href=\"/opinion/398009/united-states-v-raymond-s-budzyna/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672 (1st Cir. 1981).\r\nThe defendant's claim that the Miranda warnings were\r\nuntimely is rejected.  In the interim between being arrested and\r\nbeing Mirandized, the defendant was repeatedly advised to keep\r\nquiet and was not asked any questions.  Though the delay of a\r\nMiranda warning may be prejudicial, it was not so here.  The trial\r\ncourt specifically found that the defendant was questioned only\r\nafter waiving such rights.  It is clear that defendant did not make\r\nany incriminating statements until the warning was read to him,\r\nread by him, and initialed by him.\r\nPalmer's claim of a weakened physical and mental state\r\ncaused by heroin withdrawal and use of Trazadone was also resolved\r\nagainst him by the district court.  Defendant was a heroin addict,\r\nand at the time of the interrogation, he claimed he was suffering\r\nfrom withdrawal because he had not consumed the amount of heroin\r\ncommensurate with his seven-bag-a-day habit.  The transcript of the\r\nconfession indicates that he felt discomfort because of the effects\r\nof the withdrawal.  \r\nThe district court held that the defendant's mental state\r\nwas not deficient based upon the suppression hearing testimony and\r\nthe tape recorded confession.  On the night of the arrest,\r\ndefendant stated that his mind was working properly and he\r\nunderstood his Miranda rights and his waiver of them.  The\r\ndetective, who was experienced in identifying substance abusers,\r\ntestified that the defendant appeared clear-headed.  The trial\r\ncourt credited the confession, because the defendant's tone,\r\nclarity, and detailed recall of the robberies as set forth in the\r\nconfession supported a finding of lucidity.  Because he had a\r\nrecord of sixteen prior arrests, the district court found that\r\nPalmer comprehended the significance of a Miranda waiver.  The\r\ncourt's finding that Palmer intelligently and knowingly waived his\r\nrights had a solid evidentiary basis in his confession statements\r\nand Detective Sprankle's testimony and thus was not clearly\r\nerroneous.  See United States v. Crooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454545\"><a href=\"/opinion/454545/united-states-v-william-crooks-aka-billy/\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir.\r\n1985) (determination that statement not coerced, given government\r\ndenial of threats, has adequate evidentiary support); see also\r\nUnited States v.

In the context of the\r\nvoluntariness of a confession, a defendant's mental state by itself\r\nand apart from its relation to official coercion never disposes of\r\nthe inquiry into constitutional voluntariness.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111779\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Connelly,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111779/colorado-v-connelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \r\nTo establish coercion, Palmer focuses upon Detective\r\nSprankle's intentional lie that Curtin was a child molester, which\r\nhe argues was made because of his own history as a victim of child\r\nsexual abuse.  Defendant asserts that such \"ploys were the\r\nfunctional equivalent of interrogation.\"  We disagree.  Based upon\r\nthe trial court's subsidiary findings of fact, we find the waiver\r\nto have been made free of coercion.\r\nThere is some dispute about when and how often Curtin was\r\ncharacterized as a child molester, as well as when the defendant\r\ninformed the detective that he had been a victim of child\r\nmolestation.  The detective conceded that the characterization was\r\na lie, but, denied any knowledge of the defendant's history of\r\nmolestation.  Detective Sprankle claimed that the lie was intended\r\nto stigmatize Curtin and to break any bond between the\r\nconfederates.  The district court found that the lie, though\r\nadmittedly a ploy, was not done with foreknowledge of the\r\ndefendant's history.  The court therefore concluded that the\r\nstatement was neither coercive nor improperly deceitful.  We cannot\r\nset aside this finding of fact as clearly erroneous.  We have read\r\ndefendant's confession carefully and can find nothing in it to\r\nindicate that the \"lie\" prompted his statement to the police or\r\ninfluenced his recital of the facts in any way.  We note that the\r\nconfessions of both Palmer and Curtin were very similar except that\r\neach of them claimed that he drove the get-away vehicle and the\r\nother one committed the actual robbery.  \r\nThe court also held that the defendant was not threatened\r\nwith consequences of failing to speak, nor did the police tactic\r\ncreate a sense of urgency.  We agree with this finding.  See\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111779\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Connelly,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111779/colorado-v-connelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">170</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(\"The voluntariness of a waiver of this\r\nprivilege has always depended on the absence of police\r\noverreaching, not on 'free choice' in any broader sense of the\r\nword.\").

He also contends, citing Brewer v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109624\"><a href=\"/opinion/109624/brewer-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1977), that the court must indulge every presumption\r\nagainst waiver.

Count One\r\ncharged a conspiracy made on February 4, 1998, to rob Sell's Mobil\r\nStation located at 242 Amherst Street, Nashua, New Hampshire. \r\nCount Two charged a conspiracy to rob Zaynab Shell Food Mart\r\nlocated at 160 Broad Street, Nashua, New Hampshire.  Count Four\r\ncharged a conspiracy to rob the same store described in Count One;\r\nthe date for this conspiracy was February 7, 1998.  Count Five\r\ncharged a conspiracy to rob Jeannotte's Market located at 2\r\nCourtland Street, Nashua, New Hampshire.\r\nPalmer's defense is straight forward:  there was no\r\nevidence of any meeting of the minds to rob the stores listed in\r\nthe conspiracy counts.  Curtin insisted that they rob only stores\r\nthat were serviced by a woman and had no customers at the time of\r\nthe robbery.  Defendant argues that if there was any agreement it\r\nwas that the stores named in the conspiracy counts were not to be\r\nrobbed because at the time they were surveilled, they did not meet\r\nCurtin's conditions for committing a robbery.\r\nLogical as this contention may seem, it founders on the\r\nrocks of legal precedent holding that a condition imposed by the\r\nconspirators upon the carrying out of a conspiracy does not negate\r\nthe conspiracy.  We view the evidence as to each conspiracy count\r\nthrough a lens favorable to the verdict.  We recited the well-\r\nestablished standard recently in United States v. Morillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198160\"><a href=\"/opinion/198160/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 1998), in which we said:\r\n  We assess the sufficiency of the evidence as a\r\nwhole, including all reasonable inferences, in\r\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, with\r\na view to whether a rational trier of fact\r\ncould have found the defendant guilty beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.  We do not weigh witness\r\ncredibility, but resolve all credibility\r\nissues in favor of the verdict.  The evidence\r\nmay be entirely circumstantial, and need not\r\nexclude every reasonable hypothesis of\r\ninnocence; that is, the factfinder may decide\r\namong reasonable interpretations of the\r\nevidence.\r\n\nThe evidence as to Count One was that on February 4,\r\n1998, defendant drove Curtin to the described Mobil station\r\nconvenience store.  The conspirators had agreed to rob the store if\r\nthere was only a female clerk on the premises.  Curtin was to enter\r\nthe store and take the money if this condition was met.  The store\r\nwas not robbed because the person in charge was a male.\r\nThe same circumstances prevailed as to Count Two.  On\r\nFebruary 4, 1998   the same day   defendant drove Curtin to the\r\nShell station described in the count with the intent that Curtin\r\nwould rob it, if his predetermined conditions were met.  Once\r\nagain, Curtin found a male running the store.  It was, therefore,\r\nnot robbed.\r\nCount Four is a reprise of Count One, the only difference\r\nbeing the date of the alleged conspiracy   February 7, 1998   three\r\ndays later.\r\nThe Count Five conspiracy has a slightly different\r\nfactual twist.  Defendant drove Curtin to Jeannotte's Market, the\r\nstore described in the count.  Curtin decided, based on the number\r\nof cars parked in front of the store, that there were too many\r\npeople present for the robbery to be carried out.\r\nIn answer to a question during his interrogation by the\r\npolice, defendant said that it upset him that Curtin insisted on\r\nrobbing only stores clerked by a woman.  \"Because I feel that if\r\nyou're going to do a robbery that [sic] what's the difference male\r\nor female?  It's to be, end result is the same.  You're stealing\r\nmoney.\"\r\nThe gist of conspiracy is an agreement to disobey or to\r\ndisregard the law.  See United States v.

In this\r\ncase, one factor suggesting such reasonable belief is the fact that\r\nthe conditions were met in two other cases, and when they were met,\r\nthe defendants carried out the robberies.\r\nFirst, defendant himself did not think it should make any\r\ndifference whether the stores to be robbed were serviced by a woman\r\nor a man.  If he were the one committing the robbery instead of his\r\npartner, he might not have followed Curtin's \"woman only\" rule.  In\r\nthis connection it is to be noted that in Curtin's statement to the\r\npolice, he claimed that defendant actually committed the robberies\r\nand that he (Curtin) drove the getaway vehicle.\r\nMoreover, whether or not Curtin's rule was followed could \r\ndepend upon how badly the conspirators needed drugs.  In the\r\nparlance of the streets, the conspirators were a couple of\r\n\"junkies\" hooked on heroin and crack-cocaine.  They conspired to\r\nrob the stores to feed their habits.  They did not follow normal\r\npatterns of behavior.  The conditions were self-imposed and could\r\nbe ignored by either one of the conspirators or both at their whim\r\nor caprice.  The condition was not a bar to the robbers, it was a\r\nself-imposed restraint that could easily be negated.\r\nThe only problem we might have with the conspiracy counts\r\nis charging two conspiracies to rob the same store, Counts One and\r\nFour.  Defendant, however, has not raised any specific objection to\r\nthis, so under our well-established rule we do not consider it.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n             THE INDICTMENT AND JURY INSTRUCTIONS\r\nDefendant argues that the jury instructions on the\r\nsubstantive counts alone or in combination with the language of the\r\nindictment were so confusing as to deprive him of a fair trial.\r\nThe substantive counts in the indictment, Counts Three,\r\nSix, and Seven, charged that the defendant did commit each robbery\r\nand was \"aided and abetted by Talbot Timothy Curtin.\"  The\r\ngovernment proved the opposite: that Curtin committed the\r\nrobberies, aided and abetted by defendant who drove the get-away\r\nvehicle.  There was no evidence that defendant went into any of the\r\nstores that were robbed and took the money.\r\nAt the close of the government's case, defendant moved to\r\ndismiss because of the difference between the government's proof\r\nand the wording of the substantive counts.  During the discussion,\r\nthe prosecutor acknowledged that his evidence showed that defendant\r\nwas an aider and abettor, not the principal as the indictment\r\ncharged.  The prosecution argued that under 18 U.S.C.  2(a) it did\r\nnot make a difference.  The court agreed with the prosecutor and,\r\nrelying on our opinion in United States v. Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span>\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1st Cir. 1990), denied defendant's motion to dismiss.\r\nWe now examine the jury instructions.  The court read the \r\nsubstantive counts of the indictment verbatim.  He then explained\r\nthe pertinent provisions of 18 U.S.C.  1951.  He then stated: \r\n     Under the law, a person can be held\r\nresponsible for a crime if he directly\r\ncommitted the crime himself, or if he aids,\r\nabets, counsels, commands, induces or procures\r\nanother to commit. \r\n\nThe court read the provisions of 18 U.S.C.  2(a) to the jury.  The\r\ncourt then instructed:\r\n     With respect to Counts 3, 6, and 7, the\r\ngovernment contends that the defendant aided\r\nand abetted Talbot Curtain [sic] in committing\r\nthe robberies alleged in these Counts.  There\r\nare three material elements of the offense of\r\naiding and abetting the commission of a crime,\r\neach of which the government must prove beyond\r\na reasonable doubt with respect to each of \r\nCounts 3, 6 and 7 in order for you to find the\r\ndefendant guilty.\r\n\n     First, that the defendant knew that robbery\r\nwas to be committed or was being committed by\r\nTalbot Curtain [sic]; second, that the\r\ndefendant knowingly did some act for the\r\npurpose of aiding the commission of that\r\ncrime; and third, that the defendant acted\r\nwith the intention of causing the crime\r\ncharged to be committed.\r\n\n     The aiding and abetting statute, it is not\r\nnecessary for the government to show that the\r\ndefendant himself physically committed the\r\ncrime charged.  A person who aids and abets\r\nanother to commit an offense is just as guilty\r\nof the offense as if that person had actually\r\ncommitted it alone.  Accordingly, you may find\r\na defendant guilty of a robbery if you find\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Talbot Curtain\r\n[sic] actually committed the robbery with\r\nwhich the defendant is charged and that the\r\ndefendant aided and abetted Talbot Curtain\r\n[sic] in the commission of that robbery or\r\ncaused the robbery to be committed by Talbot\r\nCurtain [sic].  \r\n\n     In order to aid, abet or cause another to\r\ncommit a crime, it is necessary that the\r\ndefendant knowingly and wilfully associate\r\nhimself in some way with the crime and that\r\nthe defendant knowingly and wilfully seek by\r\nsome act to help to make the crime succeed.\r\n\nThe indictment was sent to the jury.  The jurors were\r\ngiven a copy of the jury instructions prior to the charge.  The\r\njudge advised them that they could read them as he gave the\r\ninstructions.\r\nAfter the jury advised the court that it had reached a\r\nverdict and returned to the courtroom, the clerk asked: \"How does\r\nthe jury find the defendant Charles Palmer, not guilty or guilty as\r\nto\" each count in the indictment?  The jury found defendant guilty\r\non all counts.  \r\nWe agree with the district court that </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sanchez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\nat <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, controls.  In Sanchez, the conspiracy count did not charge\r\ndefendant with aiding and abetting.  Nevertheless, the district\r\ncourt charged the jury that defendants could be convicted if they\r\naided and abetted the substantive offense of possessing cocaine\r\nwith intent to distribute.  Defendant Sanchez claimed that the\r\ninstruction \"violated his sixth amendment right to be informed of\r\nthe nature and cause of the accusation against him.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 611\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nAfter a thorough canvass of the pertinent cases from\r\nother circuits, we held:\r\n  The contention falls, especially because\r\n\"aiding and abetting\" is not a separate\r\noffense.
