Daniel R. Dominguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n          Selya, Boudin, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Edgardo Rodrguez-Quilichini, Assistant Federal Public\r\nDefender, with whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender,\r\nwas on brief for appellant.\r\n   Desire Laborde-Sanfiorenzo, Assistant United States Attorney,\r\nwith whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\r\nPacheco and Camille Vlez-Riv, Assistant United States Attorneys,\r\nwere on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 19, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Jess Bello appeals his conviction\r\nand sentence for assaulting a fellow prisoner in the Metropolitan\r\nDetention Center in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico (\"MDC-Guaynabo\") in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  113(a)(6).  Bello claims that the court\r\nerred in taking judicial notice of the jurisdictional element of\r\nthe offense, namely, that MDC-Guaynabo was within the territorial\r\njurisdiction of the United States.  He also claims that the court\r\nerred in refusing to instruct the jury on his defenses of self-\r\ndefense and duress, and in telling the jurors outside of the\r\npresence of counsel, in response to a jury inquiry, that self-\r\ndefense was not applicable in this case.  In challenging his\r\nsentence, he claims that the court mistakenly believed that it\r\nlacked the legal authority to grant a downward departure on grounds\r\nof coercion or duress, and that the court erred in refusing to\r\ngrant a reduction in offense level for acceptance of\r\nresponsibility.  We affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\nFactual background\r\nAt the time of the events in question, Bello was a\r\nprisoner confined at MDC-Guaynabo where he worked as a food service\r\norderly, serving food to other prisoners.  In this capacity, he was\r\nresponsible for ensuring that food was distributed to all inmates.\r\nThe victim of Bello's assault, Domingo Santana-Rosa, was also a\r\nprisoner in MDC-Guaynabo.  Bello testified that Santana frequently\r\nsneaked into the food service line and requested seconds even when\r\nall other prisoners had not yet eaten.  According to Bello, at\r\naround 5:00 PM on July 23, 1996, he refused to serve Santana a\r\nsecond helping at dinner because five other inmates had yet to eat. \r\nSantana then told Bello that he and another inmate were \"going to\r\ncrack open [Bello's] head.\"  After making the threat, Santana sat\r\ndown with several other inmates, including one \"Porra.\"  Porra\r\nlater advised Bello that Santana planned to attack him while Bello\r\nwas working out in the recreational yard of the prison.  Bello\r\ntestified that he did not report the threat to prison authorities\r\nbecause he feared the repercussions of being labeled a \"snitch\" by\r\nhis peers.\r\nOn July 25, 1996, at around 11:30 AM, Santana was playing\r\ndominoes with other inmates in the recreational yard.  Bello\r\nnoticed Santana's presence, and he became alarmed when he further\r\nnoticed that the table for playing dominoes, which was ordinarily\r\nin the prison's game room, had been moved into the yard where it\r\nnow stood only a few feet away from where Bello intended to\r\nexercise.  Bello grabbed a push broom from the corner of the yard\r\nand hit the wall of the yard with its handle, stating that it was\r\na good stick for playing baseball.  At that point Santana first\r\nnoticed Bello's presence in the yard, but he continued playing\r\ndominoes.  Bello removed the handle from the push broom and kept\r\nthe head.  He walked towards Santana and, once behind him, Bello\r\nhit him in the back of the head with the push broom head.  Santana\r\ncollapsed, unconscious, and was taken to the hospital where he was\r\noperated on to relieve an epidural hematoma (a blood clot under the\r\nskull).  Santana survived and regained consciousness six days\r\nlater.  The entire incident was captured on videotape.\r\nBello was indicted on one count of assault within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States (as defined in 18 U.S.C.  7(3)),\r\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.  113(a)(6).  Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid.\r\n201 (\"Rule 201\"), the government filed a pretrial motion requesting\r\nthat the court take judicial notice that MDC-Guaynabo is located\r\nwithin Fort Buchanan, a military base on lands \"reserved or\r\nacquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive\r\nor concurrent jurisdiction thereof,\" and thus is within the\r\n\"special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates.\"  The pretrial motion was accompanied by documentation\r\ntending to prove the requisite elements.  The court deferred making\r\na ruling on the motion until trial. \r\nAt trial, the government presented before the jury the\r\ntestimony of Alma Lpez, the legal advisor to the warden of MDC-\r\nGuaynabo, who stated that the land on which the prison was located\r\nwas owned by the federal Bureau of Prisons and was formerly part of\r\nFort Buchanan, but was transferred to the Bureau by the Department\r\nof Defense.  After cross-examining Lpez, defense counsel objected\r\nto the court taking judicial notice of the fact that MDC Guaynabo\r\nis under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.  Because\r\nLpez was not in a position to authenticate the documentation\r\nsubmitted with the pretrial motion, the documents were not admitted\r\ninto evidence.  However, the court examined the documents outside\r\nthe presence of the jury and concluded that it could take judicial\r\nnotice (based on both the testimony in evidence and the documents)\r\nthat the MDC-Guaynabo facility was within the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States.  The court announced to the jury that it was taking\r\njudicial notice of this jurisdictional fact, but informed them that\r\nthey were \"not required to accept as conclusive any fact that the\r\nCourt has judicially noticed.\"  The jury was similarly instructed\r\nbefore it retired to deliberate.  \r\nThe court denied Bello's request to instruct the jury on\r\nhis defenses of duress and self-defense, ruling that there were no\r\nfacts which justified such instructions.  During deliberations, the\r\njury requested clarification on the meaning of self-defense.  The\r\ncourt responded by informing the jurors that self-defense was not\r\napplicable to this case.  The jury found Bello guilty of assault. \r\nThe court subsequently denied an oral motion by Bello to\r\nset aside the verdict on the ground that there was insufficient\r\nproof of the jurisdictional element of which the court took\r\njudicial notice.  Bello then filed a motion for a new trial,\r\narguing that the court erred in failing to instruct on self-\r\ndefense. The court denied the motion.\r\nBello was subsequently sentenced to a term of\r\nimprisonment of 120 months, 60 months of which was to be served\r\nconcurrently with the remainder of a previous federal criminal\r\nsentence.  A supervised release term of 3 years and a special\r\nmonetary assessment of $100 were also imposed.  This appeal ensued.\r\n                            II.\r\nJudicial notice\r\nBello argues that the court improperly took judicial\r\nnotice that the assault occurred \"within the special maritime and\r\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"  In so doing, the\r\nCourt took judicial notice of an element of the offense for which\r\nBello was convicted.  That fact lends particular significance to\r\nthe judicial notice issue. \r\nSince the government petitioned, and the trial court\r\nruled, pursuant to Rule 201, we address the conformity of the\r\ncourt's judicial notice determination with that rule.  Rule 201\r\nprovides in relevant part:\r\n  (a) Scope of rule. This rule governs only\r\njudicial notice of adjudicative facts.\r\n  (b) Kinds of facts. A judicially noticed fact\r\nmust be one not subject to reasonable dispute\r\nin that it is either (1) generally known\r\nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the\r\ntrial court or (2) capable of accurate and\r\nready determination by resort to sources whose\r\naccuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\r\n. . . .\r\n  (g) Instructing jury. In a civil action or\r\nproceeding, the court shall instruct the jury\r\nto accept as conclusive any fact judicially\r\nnoticed. In a criminal case, the court shall\r\ninstruct the jury that it may, but is not\r\nrequired to, accept as conclusive any fact\r\njudicially noticed.\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 201.  By its terms, Rule 201 applies only to\r\nadjudicative facts, and the parties and the court assumed that the\r\njurisdictional element at issue here involved an adjudicative\r\nrather than a legislative fact.  They assumed correctly. Whether a\r\nfact is adjudicative or legislative depends not on the nature of\r\nthe fact   e.g., who owns the land   but rather on the use made of\r\nit (i.e., whether it is a fact germane to what happened in the case\r\nor a fact useful in formulating common law policy or interpreting\r\na statute) and the same fact can play either role depending on\r\ncontext.  See Fed.R.Evid. 201, Advisory Committee's note\r\n(\"Adjudicative facts are simply the facts of the particular case. \r\nLegislative facts, on the other hand, are those which have\r\nrelevance to legal reasoning and the lawmaking process . . . .\").\r\nWhere the prison sits is an element of the offense and\r\nunquestionably an adjudicative fact, and we review the trial\r\ncourt's decision to take judicial notice under Rule 201 for abuse\r\nof discretion.  See United States v. Chapel, 41 F.3d 1338, 1342\r\n(9th Cir. 1994); see also Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., 162 F.3d\r\n827, 829 (5th Cir. 1998) (applying abuse of discretion standard to\r\nrefusal to take judicial notice).\r\n\nMDC-Guaynabo's location within the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States is the \"kind of fact\" judicially recognizable under\r\nRule 201(b).  To qualify for judicial notice, a fact \"must be one\r\nnot subject to dispute in that it is either (1) generally known\r\nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2)\r\ncapable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources\r\nwhose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\"  The Advisory\r\nCommittee's note to Rule 201 explains:\r\n  The usual method of establishing adjudicative\r\nfacts is through the introduction of evidence,\r\nordinarily consisting of testimony of the\r\nwitnesses.  If particular facts are outside\r\nthe area of reasonable controversy, this\r\nprocess is dispensed with as unnecessary.  A\r\nhigh degree of indisputability is an essential\r\nprerequisite.\r\n\nRule 201, Advisory Committee's note (emphasis provided).   \r\nThe trial court based judicial notice on both prongs of\r\nRule 201(b), finding that MDC-Guaynabo's presence within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States is of such common knowledge and\r\ncan be so accurately and readily determined that it cannot\r\nreasonably be disputed.  By \"generally known\" Rule 201(b)(1) \"must\r\nrefer to facts which exist in the unaided memory of the populace;\r\nif the fact is one that a reasonable person would not know from\r\nmemory but would know where to find, it falls within subdivision\r\n(2),\" not (1).  21 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure\r\n5105, at 407 (1977).  Although the label \"federal penitentiary\"\r\nmight suggest to the average person that MDC-Guaynabo is under the\r\njurisdiction of the United States, it is unlikely that the\r\n\"reasonable person\" has any familiarity with MDC-Guaynabo at all,\r\nlet alone its jurisdictional status.  Hence, Rule 201(b)(1) cannot\r\nsupply a basis for judicially noticing the jurisdictional fact in\r\nthis case. \r\nHowever, judicial notice was proper pursuant to Rule\r\n201(b)(2), based on \"sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be\r\nquestioned.\"  Indeed, \"[g]eography has long been peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to judicial notice for the obvious reason that\r\ngeographic locations are facts which are not generally\r\ncontroversial and thus it is within the general definition\r\ncontained in Fed.R.Evid. 201(b) . . . .\"  United States v. Piggie,\r\n622 F.2d 468, 488 (10th Cir. 1980); see also United States v.\r\nBlunt, 558 F.2d 1245, 1247 (6th Cir. 1977). Moreover, \"official\r\ngovernment maps have long been held proper subjects of judicial\r\nnotice.\"  Government of Canal Zone v. Burjan, 596 F.2d 690, 694\r\n(5th Cir. 1979).  The government submitted to the court official\r\ngovernment maps, letters from Army officials, and various\r\nlegislative acts of Puerto Rico, all tending to show that MDC-\r\nGuaynabo was within the jurisdiction of the United States. \r\nAlthough the defense cross-examined Lpez, the legal advisor to the\r\nwarden of MDC-Guaynabo, suggesting some \"dispute\" over Lpez's\r\ntestimony, it is clear from the record that the trial court based\r\nits decision to take judicial notice largely on the maps and other\r\ndocuments submitted by the government whose accuracy was not\r\nquestioned by the defense.  To be sure, the trial court's decision\r\nto judicially recognize a fact upon which testimony had already\r\nbeen presented and subjected to cross-examination before the jury\r\nwas unusual.  Nonetheless, the existence of independent and\r\nundisputed documentary evidence in the form of government maps,\r\nofficial letters, and public laws provided a sufficient basis for\r\njudicial notice under Rule 201(b)(2), irrespective of Lpez's\r\ntestimony.  \r\nConcluding that the trial court properly exercised its\r\ndiscretion in taking judicial notice of the jurisdictional fact, we\r\nmust decide next whether the trial court correctly adhered to Rule\r\n201's procedures for instructing the jury.  Rule 201(g) provides\r\nthat: \"In a civil action or proceeding, the court shall instruct\r\nthe jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed. In a\r\ncriminal case, the court shall instruct the jury that it may, but\r\nis not required to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially\r\nnoticed.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(g). \"Congress intended to . . . create\r\none kind of judicial notice for criminal cases and another for\r\ncivil cases.\" 21 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure\r\n5111, at 274 (1999 Supp.). \"In a criminal case, Rule 201(g)\r\ntreats judicial notice like a presumption; it relieves one party of\r\nthe need to produce evidence but does not prevent the other party\r\nfrom contesting\" the noticed fact with evidence and argument to the\r\njury.\" Id. at 534.\r\nThe instruction offered by the court was as follows:\r\n  Even though no evidence has been introduced\r\nabout it in your presence,[] I believe that\r\nthe fact that the Metropolitan Detention\r\nCenter is within a land reserved for the use\r\nof the United States and under its exclusive\r\njurisdiction . . . is of such common knowledge\r\nand can be so accurately and readily\r\ndetermined from the Metropolitan Detention\r\nCenter officials that it cannot reasonably be\r\ndisputed. You may, therefore, reasonably treat\r\nthis fact as proven even though no evidence\r\nhas been presented on this point before you.\r\n    As with any fact presented in the case,\r\nhowever, the final decision whether or not to\r\naccept it is for you to make and you are not\r\nrequired to agree with me.\r\n\nThis instruction was based on a nearly identical instruction from\r\nthe Eighth Circuit, Model Crim. Jury Instr. 8th Cir.  2.04 (1989);\r\nsee also 1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence  201.34[3] (1999) (quoting\r\nFederal Judicial Center Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, no.7\r\n(commentary), which is itself based on one of the few opinions\r\ntreating the application of Rule 201(g), United States v. Deckard,\r\n816 F.2d 426, 428 (8th Cir. 1987)). As in Deckard, \"[h]ere the\r\ntrial court meticulously followed the command of Rule 201(g). After\r\nhaving instructed the jury generally on presumption of innocence\r\nand burden of proof,\" 816 F.2d at 428, the court issued an\r\ninstruction that complied entirely with the dictates of the rule. \r\nOf course, compliance with Rule 201 does not establish\r\nthat application of Rule 201 in this case was constitutional.  The\r\nSixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees to a criminal\r\ndefendant the opportunity for a jury to decide guilt or innocence. \r\nSee Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968).  \"A necessary\r\ncorollary is the right to have one's guilt determined only upon\r\nproof beyond the jury's reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to\r\nconstitute a charged crime.\" United States v. Mentz, 840 F.2d 315,\r\n319 (6th Cir. 1988); see also Moore v. United States, 429 U.S. 20,\r\n22 (1976) (per curiam).  \"[A] judge may not direct a verdict of\r\nguilty no matter how conclusive the evidence.\" United Bhd. of\r\nCarpenters and Joiners v. United States, 330 U.S. 395, 408 (1947);\r\nsee also  United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 788 (1st Cir.\r\n1987). \"A plea of not guilty places all issues in dispute, even the\r\nmost patent truths.\" Mentz, 840 F.2d at 320 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). \r\n  Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that Rule\r\n201(g), which makes judicial notice non-conclusive in criminal\r\ncases, adequately safeguards the criminal defendant's Sixth\r\nAmendment right to a trial by jury.  In rejecting a version of\r\n201(g) that would have made judicial notice conclusive in both\r\ncivil and criminal cases, Congress emphasized that while a\r\n\"mandatory instruction to a jury in a criminal case to accept as\r\nconclusive any fact judicially noticed is inappropriate because\r\ncontrary to the spirit of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial\r\n. . . a discretionary instruction in criminal trials,\" is\r\nconstitutional.  H.R. Rep. 93-650, at 6-7 (1973).  Commenting on\r\nthe original draft of Rule 201 which made the judicial notice non-\r\nconclusive in criminal cases (the version ultimately adopted by\r\nCongress), the Advisory Committee noted:   \r\n  The considerations which underlie the general\r\nrule that a verdict cannot be directed against\r\nthe accused in a criminal case seem to\r\nforeclose the judge's directing the jury on\r\nthe basis of judicial notice to accept as\r\nconclusive any adjudicative facts in the case.\r\nHowever, this view presents no obstacle to the\r\njudge's advising the jury as to a matter\r\njudicially noticed, if he instructs them that\r\nit need not be taken as conclusive.\r\n\n1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence  201App.01[3] (quoting Fed.R.Evid.\r\n201 Advisory Committee's note (March 1969 draft)). \r\nMoreover, the few courts that have considered the\r\nconstitutionality of Rule 201 have reached similar conclusions.  In\r\nMentz, the Sixth Circuit ruled that \"[a] trial court commits\r\nconstitutional error when it takes judicial notice of facts\r\nconstituting an essential element of the crime charged, but fails\r\nto instruct the jury according to rule 201(g).\" 840 F.2d at 322\r\n(emphasis provided).  Similarly, in United States v. Jones 580 F.2d\r\n219, 223-24 (6th Cir. 1978), the court concluded that Rule 201(g)\r\npreserves the jury's \"traditional prerogative.\"  More generally,\r\nnumerous Courts of Appeals have upheld judicial notice that a\r\nlocation is within the jurisdiction of the United States. \r\nHernndez-Fundora, 58 F.3d at 811 (2d Cir.) (federal penitentiary);\r\nBowers, 660 F.2d at 531 (5th Cir.) (federal penitentiary); See\r\nPiggie, 622 F.2d at 487-90 (10th Cir.) (federal penitentiary);\r\nUnited States v. Lavender, 602 F.2d 639, 641 (4th Cir. 1979)\r\n(federal highway); Blunt, 558 F.2d at 1247 (6th Cir.) (federal\r\npenitentiary);  United States v. Hughes, 542 F.2d 246, 248 n. 1\r\n(5th Cir. 1976) (military base); United States v. Anderson, 528\r\nF.2d 590, 591-92 (5th Cir. 1976) (per curiam) (federal\r\npenitentiary); United States v. Benson, 495 F.2d 475, 481 (5th Cir.\r\n1974) (military base);  United States v. Miller, 499 F.2d 736, 739-\r\n40 (10th Cir. 1974) (federal penitentiary); Hayes v. United States,\r\n367 F.2d 216, 218 (10th Cir. 1966) (federal penitentiary). \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err by taking\r\njudicial notice that MDC-Guaynabo was within the \"special maritime\r\nand territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"\r\n                            III.\r\nJury instructions\r\n(a) Self-defense instruction\r\nBello claims that the court erred in refusing to instruct\r\nthe jury on the elements of self-defense.  However, the court\r\ncorrectly found that the facts of this case did not \"conform[] to\r\nthe normal understanding of self-defense: a use of force necessary\r\nto defend against an imminent use of unlawful force.\"  United\r\nStates v. Haynes, 143 F.3d 1089, 1090 (7th Cir.), cert denied 119\r\nS. Ct. 260 (1998) ( 113(a)(6) case) (citing Model Penal Code\r\n3.04(1) (1962)); 1 Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Substantive\r\nCriminal Law  5.7 (1986) (defendant claiming self-defense must\r\nshow \"immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from his adversary\"\r\nand that the force used was reasonable and necessary to avoid the\r\ndanger); First Circuit Pattern Crim. Jury Instr.  5.04 (\"Use of\r\nforce is justified when a person reasonably believes that it is\r\nnecessary for the defense of oneself or another against the\r\nimmediate use of unlawful force.  However, a person must use no\r\nmore force than appears reasonably necessary in the\r\ncircumstances.\").\r\nThere was no evidence Bello was in immediate danger at\r\nthe time he committed the assault in the prison recreational yard. \r\nIndeed, the evidence established that a cooling off period of (at\r\nminimum) eighteen hours had passed between the alleged threat in\r\nthe dining hall and the assault in the recreation yard.  Moreover,\r\n\"absence of lawful alternatives is an element of all lesser-evil\r\ndefenses, of which self-defense is one.\"  Haynes, 143 F.3d at 1090-\r\n91.  Bello could have reported the incident to the guards and\r\nrequested the protection they were required to provide,\r\nnotwithstanding his assertion that he faced greater danger from\r\nother inmates if he were labeled a \"snitch.\"  See Haynes, 143 F.3d\r\nat 1090 (rejecting \"snitch\" defense to sneak attack on dominoes-\r\nplaying fellow inmate under  113(a)(6)).  Although \"a defendant is\r\nentitled to an instruction as to any recognized defense for which\r\nthere exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in\r\nhis favor,\" Mathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 63 (1988), here\r\nthe court correctly found that no reasonable jury could have found\r\nthat Bello acted in self-defense as the law defines it.  The court\r\ndid not err in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense.\r\n(b) Duress instruction\r\n\"A duress defense has three elements: 1) an immediate\r\nthreat of serious bodily injury or death, 2) a well-grounded belief\r\nthat the threat will be carried out, and 3) no reasonable\r\nopportunity to escape or otherwise to frustrate the threat.\" \r\nUnited States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d 444, 448 (1st Cir. 1996).  As we\r\nhave already discussed in rejecting the self-defense claim, there\r\nwas no immediate threat of serious bodily injury or death here, and\r\nBello's claim thus fails at the first step.\r\n                            IV.\r\nThe jury note\r\nBello argues in his brief on appeal that the court erred\r\nin failing to notify and consult counsel before the court responded\r\nto the jury's note requesting \"the legal definition of self-\r\ndefense.\"  Subsequent to oral argument in this case, the parties\r\nstipulated that the court called counsel into chambers in order to\r\ndiscuss the note from the jury requesting clarification on self-\r\ndefense.  This stipulation negates Bello's earlier assertion of\r\nerror. \r\n\"The preferred practice for addressing a question from a\r\ndeliberating jury includes ensuring that the question is reduced to\r\nwriting, marking the note as an exhibit for identification, sharing\r\nit with counsel, and affording the lawyers an opportunity to\r\nsuggest an appropriate rejoinder.  Withal, this practice is not the\r\nproduct of an ironclad rule, and the trial court retains a modicum\r\nof flexibility to adjust to the exigencies of particular\r\nsituations.\"  United States v. Hernndez, 146 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (citations omitted).  The note was entered into the record,\r\nand the stipulation indicates that the court met every other\r\nelement of the ideal procedure described above.  (The parties do\r\ndiffer as to whether a court reporter was present in chambers, and\r\nwe have no record of what was discussed in chambers, but the\r\nstipulation indicates that the note was discussed.)\r\n                             V.\r\nSentencing issues\r\n(a) Downward departure\r\nBello claims that the court erred in not granting his\r\nrequest for a downward departure.  Bello's request was predicated\r\non the victim's conduct (i.e. Santana's threat) and coercion and\r\nduress, factors which the guidelines explicitly allow a court to\r\nconsider in departing from the guideline sentencing range.  See\r\nU.S.S.G.  5K2.10 (victim's conduct), 5K2.12 (coercion and\r\nduress).  \"While affirmative decisions to depart from the\r\nguidelines are reviewable on appeal, we ordinarily lack\r\njurisdiction to review a decision not to depart, unless the\r\nsentencing court erroneously believed it lacked the authority to\r\ndepart.\"  United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 708 (1st Cir.\r\n1999); see also 18 U.S.C.  3742(f); United States v. Gifford, 17\r\nF.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[A]ppellate jurisdiction may attach\r\nif it appears that the failure to depart stemmed from the\r\nsentencing court's mistaken impression that it lacked the legal\r\nauthority to deviate from the guideline range or, relatedly, from\r\nthe court's misapprehension of the rules governing departures.\").\r\nBello claims that the court misunderstood that it could invoke\r\nduress and coercion as mitigating factors justifying a downward\r\ndeparture despite the fact that the court had rejected self-defense\r\nand duress as complete defenses to conviction.  However, nothing in\r\nthe sentencing transcript supports the argument that the court\r\nmisunderstood that the departure Bello requested was legally\r\npermissible.  The sentencing transcript, instead, betrays the\r\nincredulity of the trial judge at the factual claim being made. \r\nThe colloquy between the court and Bello's counsel turned entirely\r\non the facts of the case, and there is no indication that the court\r\nbelieved that a downward departure on these grounds was unavailable\r\nas a matter of law.  We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the\r\ncourt's discretionary decision not to depart from the guideline\r\nsentencing range.\r\n\n(b) Adjustment for acceptance of responsibility\r\nBello asserts that the court erred in refusing to grant\r\nhim a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of\r\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G.  3E1.1(a).  Application Note 2 to\r\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1 states:\r\n  This adjustment is not intended to apply to a\r\ndefendant who puts the government to its\r\nburden of proof at trial by denying the\r\nessential factual elements of guilt, is\r\nconvicted, and only then admits guilt and\r\nexpresses remorse. Conviction by trial,\r\nhowever, does not automatically preclude a\r\ndefendant from consideration for such a\r\nreduction. In rare situations a defendant may\r\nclearly demonstrate an acceptance of\r\nresponsibility for his criminal conduct even\r\nthough he exercises his constitutional right\r\nto a trial. This may occur, for example, where\r\na defendant goes to trial to assert and\r\npreserve issues that do not relate to factual\r\nguilt (e.g., to make a constitutional\r\nchallenge to a statute or a challenge to the\r\napplicability of a statute to his conduct). In\r\neach such instance, however, a determination\r\nthat a defendant has accepted responsibility\r\nwill be based primarily upon pre-trial\r\nstatements and conduct.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1, comment. (n.2) (emphasis added).  An assertion of\r\nself-defense is a denial of an essential factual element of guilt\r\nfor the purposes of this guideline section.  See United States v.\r\nBranch, 91 F.3d 699, 742 (5th Cir. 1996) (rejecting  3E1.1\r\nreduction where defendant claimed self-defense); United States v.\r\nWaloke, 962 F.2d 824, 832 (8th Cir. 1992) (same); see also United\r\nStates v. Bennett, 928 F.2d 1548, 1557 (11th Cir. 1991) (finding\r\nself-defense claim one of several factors supporting\r\ninapplicability of  3E1.1).  Moreover, Bello has failed on appeal\r\nto refer to any statements or conduct tending to establish that he\r\naccepted responsibility prior to trial.  The court did not err in\r\ndenying the adjustment.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Bello claims that the court erred in taking judicial notice of the jurisdictional element of the offense, namely, that MDC-Guaynabo was within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. He also claims that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on his defenses of self-defense and duress, and in telling the jurors outside of the presence of counsel, in response to a jury inquiry, that self-defense was not applicable in this case. In challenging his sentence, he claims that the court mistakenly believed that it lacked the legal authority to grant a downward departure on grounds of coercion or duress, and that the court erred in refusing to grant a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Factual background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the events in question, Bello was a prisoner confined at MDC-Guaynabo where he worked as a food service orderly, serving food to other prisoners. In this capacity, he was responsible for ensuring that food was distributed to all inmates. The victim of Bello's assault, Domingo Santana-Rosa, was also a prisoner in MDC-Guaynabo. Bello testified that Santana frequently sneaked into the food service line and requested seconds even when all other prisoners had not yet eaten. According to Bello, at around 5:00 PM on July 23, 1996, he refused to serve Santana a second helping at dinner because five other inmates had yet to eat. Santana then told Bello that he and another inmate were \"going to crack open [Bello's] head.\" After making the threat, Santana sat down with several other inmates, including one \"Porra.\" Porra later advised Bello that Santana planned to attack him while Bello was working out in the recreational yard of the prison. Bello testified that he did not report the threat to prison authorities because he feared the repercussions of being labeled a \"snitch\" by his peers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 1996, at around 11:30 AM, Santana was playing dominoes with other inmates in the recreational yard. Bello noticed Santana's presence, and he became alarmed when he further noticed that the table for playing dominoes, which was ordinarily in the prison's game room, had been moved into the yard where it now stood only a few feet away from where Bello intended to exercise. Bello grabbed a push broom from the corner of the yard and hit the wall of the yard with its handle, stating that it was a good stick for playing baseball. At that point Santana first noticed Bello's presence in the yard, but he continued playing dominoes. Bello removed the handle from the push broom and kept the head. He walked towards Santana and, once behind him, Bello hit him in the back of the head with the push broom head. Santana collapsed, unconscious, and was taken to the hospital where he was operated on to relieve an epidural hematoma (a blood clot under the skull). Santana survived and regained consciousness six days later. The entire incident was captured on videotape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello was indicted on one count of assault within the jurisdiction of the United States (as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 7(3)), in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(6). Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201 (\"Rule 201\"), the government filed a pretrial motion requesting that the court take judicial notice that MDC-Guaynabo is located within Fort Buchanan, a military base on lands \"reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof,\" and thus is within the \"special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" The pretrial motion was accompanied by documentation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> tending to prove the requisite elements. The court deferred making a ruling on the motion until trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government presented before the jury the testimony of Alma Lopez, the legal advisor to the warden of MDC-Guaynabo, who stated that the land on which the prison was located was owned by the federal Bureau of Prisons and was formerly part of Fort Buchanan, but was transferred to the Bureau by the Department of Defense. After cross-examining Lopez, defense counsel objected to the court taking judicial notice of the fact that MDC Guaynabo is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Because Lopez was not in a position to authenticate the documentation submitted with the pretrial motion, the documents were not admitted into evidence. However, the court examined the documents outside the presence of the jury and concluded that it could take judicial notice (based on both the testimony in evidence and the documents) that the MDC-Guaynabo facility was within the jurisdiction of the United States. The court announced to the jury that it was taking judicial notice of this jurisdictional fact, but informed them that they were \"not required to accept as conclusive any fact that the Court has judicially noticed.\" The jury was similarly instructed before it retired to deliberate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied Bello's request to instruct the jury on his defenses of duress and self-defense, ruling that there were no facts which justified such instructions. During deliberations, the jury requested clarification on the meaning of self-defense. The court responded by informing the jurors that self-defense was not applicable to this case. The jury found Bello guilty of assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court subsequently denied an oral motion by Bello to set aside the verdict on the ground that there was insufficient proof of the jurisdictional element of which the court took judicial notice. Bello then filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the court erred in failing to instruct on self-defense. The court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 120 months, 60 months of which was to be served concurrently with the remainder of a previous federal criminal sentence. A supervised release term of 3 years and a special monetary assessment of $100 were also imposed. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Judicial notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello argues that the court improperly took judicial notice that the assault occurred \"within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In so doing, the Court took judicial notice of an element of the offense for which Bello was convicted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That fact lends particular significance to the judicial notice issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the government petitioned, and the trial court ruled, pursuant to Rule 201, we address the conformity of the court's judicial notice determination with that rule.

R. Evid. 201. By its terms, Rule 201 applies only to adjudicative facts, and the parties and the court assumed that the jurisdictional element at issue here involved an adjudicative rather than a legislative fact. They assumed correctly. Whether a fact is adjudicative or legislative depends not on the nature of the fact - e.g., who owns the land - but rather on the use made of it (i.e., whether it is a fact germane to what happened in the case or a fact useful in formulating common law policy or interpreting a statute) and the same fact can play either role depending on context. See Fed.R.Evid. 201, Advisory Committee's note (\"Adjudicative facts are simply the facts of the particular case. Legislative facts, on the other hand, are those which have relevance to legal reasoning and the lawmaking process . . . .\"). Where the prison sits is an element of the offense and unquestionably an adjudicative fact,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and we review the trial court's decision to take judicial notice under Rule 201 for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Chapel, 41 F.3d 1338, 1342 (9th Cir. 1994); see also Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., 162 F.3d 827, 829 (5th Cir. 1998) (applying abuse of discretion standard to refusal to take judicial notice).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MDC-Guaynabo's location within the jurisdiction of the United States is the \"kind of fact\" judicially recognizable under Rule 201(b). To qualify for judicial notice, a fact \"must be one not subject to dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" The Advisory Committee's note to Rule 201 explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The usual method of establishing adjudicative facts is through the introduction of evidence, ordinarily consisting of testimony of the witnesses. If particular facts are outside the area of reasonable controversy, this process is dispensed with as unnecessary. A high degree of indisputability is an essential prerequisite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 201, Advisory Committee's note (emphasis provided).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court based judicial notice on both prongs of Rule 201(b), finding that MDC-Guaynabo's presence within the jurisdiction of the United States is of such common knowledge and can be so accurately and readily determined that it cannot reasonably be disputed. By \"generally known\" Rule 201(b)(1) \"must refer to facts which exist in the unaided memory of the populace; if the fact is one that a reasonable person would not know from memory but would know where to find, it falls within subdivision (2),\" not (1). 21 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 5105, at 407 (1977). Although the label \"federal penitentiary\" might suggest to the average person that MDC-Guaynabo is under the jurisdiction of the United States, it is unlikely that the \"reasonable person\" has any familiarity with MDC-Guaynabo at all, let alone its jurisdictional status. Hence, Rule 201(b)(1) cannot supply a basis for judicially noticing the jurisdictional fact in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, judicial notice was proper pursuant to Rule 201(b)(2), based on \"sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Indeed, \"[g]eography has long been peculiarly susceptible to judicial notice for the obvious reason that geographic locations are facts which are not generally controversial and thus it is within the general definition contained in Fed.R.Evid. 201(b) . . . .\" United States v. Piggie, 622 F.2d 468, 488 (10th Cir. 1980); see also United States v. Blunt, 558 F.2d 1245, 1247 (6th Cir. 1977). Moreover, \"official government maps have long been held proper subjects of judicial notice.\" Government of Canal Zone v. Burjan, 596 F.2d 690, 694 (5th Cir. 1979). The government submitted to the court official government maps, letters from Army officials, and various legislative acts of Puerto Rico, all tending to show that MDC-Guaynabo was within the jurisdiction of the United States. Although the defense cross-examined Lopez, the legal advisor to the warden of MDC-Guaynabo, suggesting some \"dispute\" over Lopez's testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> it is clear from the record that the trial court based its decision to take judicial notice largely on the maps and other documents submitted by the government whose accuracy was not questioned by the defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> To be sure, the trial court's decision to judicially recognize a fact upon which testimony had already been presented and subjected to cross-examination before the jury was unusual.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Nonetheless, the existence of independent and undisputed documentary evidence in the form of government maps, official letters, and public laws provided a sufficient basis for judicial notice under Rule 201(b)(2), irrespective of Lopez's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in taking judicial notice of the jurisdictional fact, we must decide next whether the trial court correctly adhered to Rule 201's procedures for instructing the jury. Rule 201(g) provides that: \"In a civil action or proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed. In a criminal case, the court shall instruct the jury that it may, but is not required to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(g). \"Congress intended to . . . create one kind of judicial notice for criminal cases and another for civil cases.\" 21 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 5111, at 274 (1999 Supp.). \"In a criminal case, Rule 201(g) treats judicial notice like a presumption; it relieves one party of the need to produce evidence but does not prevent the other party from contesting\" the noticed fact with evidence and argument to the jury.\" Id. at 534.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instruction offered by the court was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though no evidence has been introduced about it in your presence,[<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>] I believe that the fact that the Metropolitan Detention Center is within a land reserved for the use of the United States and under its exclusive jurisdiction . . . is of such common knowledge and can be so accurately and readily determined from the Metropolitan Detention Center officials that it cannot reasonably be disputed. You may, therefore, reasonably treat this fact as proven even though no evidence has been presented on this point before you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with any fact presented in the case, however, the final decision whether or not to accept it is for you to make and you are not required to agree with me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction was based on a nearly identical instruction from the Eighth Circuit, Model Crim. Jury Instr. 8th Cir. &#167; 2.04 (1989); see also 1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 201.34[3] (1999) (quoting Federal Judicial Center Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, no.7 (commentary), which is itself based on one of the few opinions treating the application of Rule 201(g), United States v. Deckard, 816 F.2d 426, 428 (8th Cir. 1987)). As in Deckard, \"[h]ere the trial court meticulously followed the command of Rule 201(g). After having instructed the jury generally on presumption of innocence and burden of proof,\" 816 F.2d at 428, the court issued an instruction that complied entirely with the dictates of the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, compliance with Rule 201 does not establish that application of Rule 201 in this case was constitutional. The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees to a criminal defendant the opportunity for a jury to decide guilt or innocence. See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968). \"A necessary corollary is the right to have one's guilt determined only upon proof beyond the jury's reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute a charged crime.\" United States v. Mentz, 840 F.2d 315, 319 (6th Cir. 1988); see also Moore v. United States, 429 U.S. 20, 22 (1976) (per curiam). \"[A] judge may not direct a verdict of guilty no matter how conclusive the evidence.\" United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners v. United States, 330 U.S. 395, 408 (1947); see also United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 788 (1st Cir. 1987). \"A plea of not guilty places all issues in dispute, even the most patent truths.\" Mentz, 840 F.2d at 320 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that Rule 201(g), which makes judicial notice non-conclusive in criminal cases, adequately safeguards the criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. In rejecting a version of 201(g) that would have made judicial notice conclusive in both civil and criminal cases, Congress emphasized that while a \"mandatory instruction to a jury in a criminal case to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed is inappropriate because contrary to the spirit of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial . . . a discretionary instruction in criminal trials,\" is constitutional. H.R. Rep. 93-650, at 6-7 (1973). Commenting on the original draft of Rule 201 which made the judicial notice non-conclusive in criminal cases (the version ultimately adopted by Congress), the Advisory Committee noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The considerations which underlie the general rule that a verdict cannot be directed against the accused in a criminal case seem to foreclose the judge's directing the jury on the basis of judicial notice to accept as conclusive any adjudicative facts in the case. However, this view presents no obstacle to the judge's advising the jury as to a matter judicially noticed, if he instructs them that it need not be taken as conclusive.1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 201App.01[3] (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 201 Advisory Committee's note (March 1969 draft)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the few courts that have considered the constitutionality of Rule 201 have reached similar conclusions. In Mentz, the Sixth Circuit ruled that \"[a] trial court commits constitutional error when it takes judicial notice of facts constituting an essential element of the crime charged, but fails to instruct the jury according to rule 201(g).\" 840 F.2d at 322 (emphasis provided). Similarly, in United States v. Jones 580 F.2d 219, 223-24 (6th Cir. 1978), the court concluded that Rule 201(g) preserves the jury's \"traditional prerogative.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> More generally, numerous Courts of Appeals have upheld judicial notice that a location is within the jurisdiction of the United States.

Indeed, the evidence established that a cooling off period of (at minimum) eighteen hours had passed between the alleged threat in the dining hall and the assault in the recreation yard.  Moreover, \"absence of lawful alternatives is an element of all lesser-evil defenses, of which self-defense is one.\" Haynes, 143 F.3d at 1090-91. Bello could have reported the incident to the guards and requested the protection they were required to provide, notwithstanding his assertion that he faced greater danger from other inmates if he were labeled a \"snitch.\" See Haynes, 143 F.3d at 1090 (rejecting \"snitch\" defense to sneak attack on dominoes-playing fellow inmate under &#167; 113(a)(6)). Although \"a defendant is entitled to an instruction as to any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in his favor,\" Mathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 63 (1988), here the court correctly found that no reasonable jury could have found that Bello acted in self-defense as the law defines it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Duress instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A duress defense has three elements: 1) an immediate threat of serious bodily injury or death, 2) a well-grounded belief that the threat will be carried out, and 3) no reasonable opportunity to escape or otherwise to frustrate the threat.\" United States v.

As we have already discussed in rejecting the self-defense claim, there was no immediate threat of serious bodily injury or death here, and Bello's claim thus fails at the first step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The jury note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello argues in his brief on appeal that the court erred in failing to notify and consult counsel before the court responded to the jury's note requesting \"the legal definition of self-defense.\" Subsequent to oral argument in this case, the parties stipulated that the court called counsel into chambers in order to discuss the note from the jury requesting clarification on self-defense.

Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). The note was entered into the record, and the stipulation indicates that the court met every other element of the ideal procedure described above.

Bello's request was predicated on the victim's conduct (i.e. Santana's threat) and coercion and duress, factors which the guidelines explicitly allow a court to consider in departing from the guideline sentencing range. See U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5K2.10 (victim's conduct), 5K2.12 (coercion and duress). \"While affirmative decisions to depart from the guidelines are reviewable on appeal, we ordinarily lack jurisdiction to review a decision not to depart, unless the sentencing court erroneously believed it lacked the authority to depart.\" United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 708 (1st Cir. 1999); see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(f); United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[A]ppellate jurisdiction may attach if it appears that the failure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken impression that it lacked the legal authority to deviate from the guideline range or, relatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the rules governing departures.\"). Bello claims that the court misunderstood that it could invoke duress and coercion as mitigating factors justifying a downward departure despite the fact that the court had rejected self-defense and duress as complete defenses to conviction. However, nothing in the sentencing transcript supports the argument that the court misunderstood that the departure Bello requested was legally permissible. The sentencing transcript, instead, betrays the incredulity of the trial judge at the factual claim being made. The colloquy between the court and Bello's counsel turned entirely on the facts of the case, and there is no indication that the court believed that a downward departure on these grounds was unavailable as a matter of law. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the court's discretionary decision not to depart from the guideline sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Adjustment for acceptance of responsibility</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello asserts that the court erred in refusing to grant him a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a).

Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.

Bello claims that the court erred in taking judicial notice of the jurisdictional element of the offense, namely, that MDC-Guaynabo was within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. He also claims that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on his defenses of self-defense and duress, and in telling the jurors outside of the presence of counsel, in response to a jury inquiry, that self-defense was not applicable in this case. In challenging his sentence, he claims that the court mistakenly believed that it lacked the legal authority to grant a downward departure on grounds of coercion or duress, and that the court erred in refusing to grant a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Factual background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the events in question, Bello was a prisoner confined at MDC-Guaynabo where he worked as a food service orderly, serving food to other prisoners. In this capacity, he was responsible for ensuring that food was distributed to all inmates. The victim of Bello's assault, Domingo Santana-Rosa, was also a prisoner in MDC-Guaynabo. Bello testified that Santana frequently sneaked into the food service line and requested seconds even when all other prisoners had not yet eaten. According to Bello, at around 5:00 PM on July 23, 1996, he refused to serve Santana a second helping at dinner because five other inmates had yet to eat. Santana then told Bello that he and another inmate were \"going to crack open [Bello's] head.\" After making the threat, Santana sat down with several other inmates, including one \"Porra.\" Porra later advised Bello that Santana planned to attack him while Bello was working out in the recreational yard of the prison. Bello testified that he did not report the threat to prison authorities because he feared the repercussions of being labeled a \"snitch\" by his peers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 1996, at around 11:30 AM, Santana was playing dominoes with other inmates in the recreational yard. Bello noticed Santana's presence, and he became alarmed when he further noticed that the table for playing dominoes, which was ordinarily in the prison's game room, had been moved into the yard where it now stood only a few feet away from where Bello intended to exercise. Bello grabbed a push broom from the corner of the yard and hit the wall of the yard with its handle, stating that it was a good stick for playing baseball. At that point Santana first noticed Bello's presence in the yard, but he continued playing dominoes. Bello removed the handle from the push broom and kept the head. He walked towards Santana and, once behind him, Bello hit him in the back of the head with the push broom head. Santana collapsed, unconscious, and was taken to the hospital where he was operated on to relieve an epidural hematoma (a blood clot under the skull). Santana survived and regained consciousness six days later. The entire incident was captured on videotape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello was indicted on one count of assault within the jurisdiction of the United States (as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 7(3)), in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(6). Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201 (\"Rule 201\"), the government filed a pretrial motion requesting that the court take judicial notice that MDC-Guaynabo is located within Fort Buchanan, a military base on lands \"reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof,\" and thus is within the \"special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" The pretrial motion was accompanied by documentation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> tending to prove the requisite elements. The court deferred making a ruling on the motion until trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government presented before the jury the testimony of Alma Lopez, the legal advisor to the warden of MDC-Guaynabo, who stated that the land on which the prison was located was owned by the federal Bureau of Prisons and was formerly part of Fort Buchanan, but was transferred to the Bureau by the Department of Defense. After cross-examining Lopez, defense counsel objected to the court taking judicial notice of the fact that MDC Guaynabo is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Because Lopez was not in a position to authenticate the documentation submitted with the pretrial motion, the documents were not admitted into evidence. However, the court examined the documents outside the presence of the jury and concluded that it could take judicial notice (based on both the testimony in evidence and the documents) that the MDC-Guaynabo facility was within the jurisdiction of the United States. The court announced to the jury that it was taking judicial notice of this jurisdictional fact, but informed them that they were \"not required to accept as conclusive any fact that the Court has judicially noticed.\" The jury was similarly instructed before it retired to deliberate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied Bello's request to instruct the jury on his defenses of duress and self-defense, ruling that there were no facts which justified such instructions. During deliberations, the jury requested clarification on the meaning of self-defense. The court responded by informing the jurors that self-defense was not applicable to this case. The jury found Bello guilty of assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court subsequently denied an oral motion by Bello to set aside the verdict on the ground that there was insufficient proof of the jurisdictional element of which the court took judicial notice. Bello then filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the court erred in failing to instruct on self-defense.

By its terms, Rule 201 applies only to adjudicative facts, and the parties and the court assumed that the jurisdictional element at issue here involved an adjudicative rather than a legislative fact. They assumed correctly. Whether a fact is adjudicative or legislative depends not on the nature of the fact - e.g., who owns the land - but rather on the use made of it (i.e., whether it is a fact germane to what happened in the case or a fact useful in formulating common law policy or interpreting a statute) and the same fact can play either role depending on context. See Fed.R.Evid. 201, Advisory Committee's note (\"Adjudicative facts are simply the facts of the particular case.

In rejecting a version of 201(g) that would have made judicial notice conclusive in both civil and criminal cases, Congress emphasized that while a \"mandatory instruction to a jury in a criminal case to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed is inappropriate because contrary to the spirit of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial . . . a discretionary instruction in criminal trials,\" is constitutional. H.R. Rep. 93-650, at 6-7 (1973).

As we have already discussed in rejecting the self-defense claim, there was no immediate threat of serious bodily injury or death here, and Bello's claim thus fails at the first step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The jury note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello argues in his brief on appeal that the court erred in failing to notify and consult counsel before the court responded to the jury's note requesting \"the legal definition of self-defense.\" Subsequent to oral argument in this case, the parties stipulated that the court called counsel into chambers in order to discuss the note from the jury requesting clarification on self-defense.

The note was entered into the record, and the stipulation indicates that the court met every other element of the ideal procedure described above.

Bello's request was predicated on the victim's conduct (i.e. Santana's threat) and coercion and duress, factors which the guidelines explicitly allow a court to consider in departing from the guideline sentencing range. See U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5K2.10 (victim's conduct), 5K2.12 (coercion and duress). \"While affirmative decisions to depart from the guidelines are reviewable on appeal, we ordinarily lack jurisdiction to review a decision not to depart, unless the sentencing court erroneously believed it lacked the authority to depart.\" United States v. Portela, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761694\"><a href=\"/opinion/761694/united-states-v-rafael-portela-united-states-of-america-v-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 708 (1st Cir. 1999); see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(f); United States v.

Bello claims that the court misunderstood that it could invoke duress and coercion as mitigating factors justifying a downward departure despite the fact that the court had rejected self-defense and duress as complete defenses to conviction. However, nothing in the sentencing transcript supports the argument that the court misunderstood that the departure Bello requested was legally permissible. The sentencing transcript, instead, betrays the incredulity of the trial judge at the factual claim being made. The colloquy between the court and Bello's counsel turned entirely on the facts of the case, and there is no indication that the court believed that a downward departure on these grounds was unavailable as a matter of law. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the court's discretionary decision not to depart from the guideline sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Adjustment for acceptance of responsibility</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bello asserts that the court erred in refusing to grant him a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a). Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.

And I also have found documents in the matters of laws which clearly indicate to the Court that the property where the MDC Guaynabo is located was first property of the Government of Puerto Rico then became property of Fort Buchanan, and it is now the property of the United States.

First, by submitting documents to you with the witness, using your discretion we can take judicial notice of under Rule 201. And by bringing this witness to state that in fact she's counsel for the institution and that the institution is staffed with federal employees. That only federal offenders go there to be imprisoned, and that the property in which it is located belongs to the United States. And lastly, that the FBI has to go there to investigate criminal offenses as a matter of due course.</p>\n        <p>The Court took a short recess before ruling that judicial notice was proper under Rule 201(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There is, however, \"one fundamental difference between presuming a fact and taking judicial notice of it.
