Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Peter A. Johnson, Anthony E. Kilbridge, and Lane Altman &amp;\r\nOwens, LLP on brief for appellant.\r\n   Joseph F. Ryan and Lyne, Woodworth &amp; Evarts LLP on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nSeptember 24, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  This appeal arises from a dispute over the\r\nright to revoke acceptance of a custom-tailored software system. \r\nPlaintiff-appellant Novacore Technologies, Inc. (Novacore) designs\r\ncustomized computer software.  In or around November 1994,\r\ndefendant-appellee GST Communications Corporation (GST) asked\r\nNovacore to design and install a complex international voice\r\ncallback telephone switch system to service its international\r\ntelecommunications business.  Following a lengthy negotiation, the\r\nparties entered into a contract in March of 1995.  Novacore then\r\ndesigned the system and delivered it to GST in April.  The district\r\ncourt found that GST accepted it that summer.  See Novacore Tech.,\r\nInc. v. GST Comms. Corp., 20 F. Supp.2d 169, 185 (D. Mass. 1998). \r\nGST knew then that the system was not fully operational, but\r\nnonetheless accepted it, relying (or so the district court\r\nsupportably found) on Novacore's assurances that necessary fine-\r\ntuning would occur within a reasonable time.  See id. at 186.\r\nThe relationship between the parties soured when, after\r\nNovacore tried for months to \"de-bug\" the system, GST notified\r\nNovacore in October 1995 that it was exercising its \"right\" to\r\nrevoke its earlier acceptance.  At the same time, GST demanded the\r\nreturn of all payments theretofore made in connection with its\r\nacquisition of the system.\r\nDispleased by this turn of events, Novacore sued GST in\r\na Massachusetts state court.  Citing diversity of citizenship and\r\nthe existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, GST removed\r\nthe case to the federal district court, see 28 U.S.C.  1332(a),\r\n1441(a), and counterclaimed against Novacore.\r\nThe battle lines were clearly drawn.  Novacore maintained\r\nthat its system fulfilled the conditions of the contract and that\r\nGST had failed to give it either enough time or enough cooperation\r\nto correct relatively innocuous problems.  Further, Novacore\r\naverred that GST had acted in bad faith by prematurely replacing\r\nthe system with another product.  GST denied these allegations and\r\ncounterclaimed on grounds that the Novacore system had never\r\nmeasured up to contract specifications and that Novacore, not GST,\r\nhad acted in bad faith.\r\nAfter a four-day bench trial, the district court rejected\r\nNovacore's claims and found it to be in breach of the agreement. \r\nSee Novacore, 20 F. Supp.2d at 186.  Concomitantly, the court ruled\r\nthat GST had a right to revoke its acceptance in light of the\r\nsystem's failure to perform in accordance with contract\r\nspecifications.  See id.  The court awarded GST damages equivalent\r\nto a refund of the purchase price, together with other relief.  See\r\nid.\r\nIn adjudicating this dispute, Judge Saris wrote a\r\nmeticulously detailed opinion in which she concluded that GST,\r\nrather than Novacore, should prevail.  Having perused the record\r\nand carefully considered the parties' briefs, we find no basis to\r\nsecond-guess her thoughtful decision.  To the contrary, we regard\r\nthis as a near-perfect situation in which to put into practice our\r\nprevious preaching that \"when a lower court produces a\r\ncomprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should\r\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\r\nwords resonate.\"  Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d\r\n218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996); accord Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas, 74\r\nF.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel\r\nFire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).  Consequently, we\r\naffirm the judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in the\r\nopinion below.  We add only two brief comments.\r\nFirst:  Novacore in essence beseeches us to reweigh the\r\nfacts anew.  The appropriate standard of review, however, is\r\nconsiderably more circumscribed.  Following a jury-waived trial, an\r\nappellate court is not warranted in rejecting the trial judge's\r\n\"findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless, on the\r\nwhole of the record, [the court of appeals] form[s] a strong,\r\nunyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco\r\nSantander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).  The record in\r\nthis case, read fair-mindedly, does not yield a conviction that a\r\nmistake has been made, and no error (clear or otherwise) is\r\ndiscernible.  To be sure, depending how the facts are arrayed, two\r\ndifferent versions of the relevant events potentially emerge. \r\nSince the court chose one of these, however, there can be no clear\r\nerror   and we are powerless to disturb the court's findings.  So\r\nviewed, the standard of review dooms Novacore's importunings.\r\nSecond:  The parties agree that Massachusetts law\r\ncontrols here.  In Massachusetts, there are two lawful ways to\r\nrevoke acceptance of a good:\r\n  (1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a\r\nlot or commercial unit whose non-conformity\r\nsubstantially impairs its value to him if he\r\nhas accepted it\r\n      (a) on the reasonable assumption\r\n  that its non-conformity would be\r\n  cured and it has not been\r\n  seasonably cured; or (b) without\r\n  discovery of such non-conformity\r\n  if his acceptance was reasonably\r\n  induced either by the difficulty\r\n  of discovery before acceptance\r\n  or by the seller's assurances.\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 106,  2-608 (1957).  The lower court found\r\nthat GST had revoked rightfully under the first of these\r\nsubsections.  See Novacore, 20 F. Supp.2d at 186.\r\nNovacore responds that GST did not effectively revoke its\r\nacceptance of the system under section 2-608(1)(a) for three\r\nprincipal reasons, viz., (1) it (Novacore) did not give GST any\r\nreason to believe, at the time of acceptance, that the system would\r\nbe materially improved; (2) the so-called \"debit card problem\"\r\ncould not be a basis for revocation because Novacore never told GST\r\nthat it could be corrected; and (3) the fact that GST, prior to its\r\nrevocation, had purchased another product capable of replacing the\r\nNovacore system betrayed its belief that the Novacore system could\r\nnot be perfected.\r\nThe district court dealt effectively with this\r\nasseverational array.  As to Novacore's first two points, it is\r\nundisputed that at the time of acceptance the system did not\r\nconform to the contract specifications.  The district court's\r\nconclusion that GST would not have accepted a customized system\r\nwithout some assurances that it would eventually conform, see id.,\r\nderives ample support both from the record and from a commonsense\r\nappraisal of business realities.  As to the \"debit card\" problem,\r\nthe district court's ruling, at bottom, is a credibility call   and\r\nwe rarely meddle in such matters.  See, e.g.,  Dedham Water Co. v.\r\nCumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(acknowledging that appellate courts ordinarily should defer to\r\n\"the trier's superior ability to gauge credibility\").\r\nThe district court's conclusion that there was no bad\r\nfaith vis--vis GST's acquisition of a replacement system is\r\nequally impervious to attack.  See Novacore, 20 F. Supp.2d at 186-\r\n87.  GST had a history of purchasing multiple systems, for limited\r\npurposes, and it offered a plausible explanation for having\r\npurchased a parallel system in this instance.  This evidence,\r\ncoupled with evidence that despite the Novacore system's patent\r\ninadequacies, GST substantially paid for it and gave Novacore\r\nnearly six months from the time of installation to get its act in\r\norder, adequately grounds the district court's conclusion that GST\r\nexercised good faith.\r\nWe need go no further.  The judgment of the district\r\ncourt is summarily affirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",
