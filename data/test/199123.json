In 1995, the Maine law firm of Smith\n\n& Elliott (S&E) was sued for malpractice. 1    S&E held lawyers'\n\nprofessional liability insurance from both The Home Insurance\n\nCompany and St. Paul Marine & Fire Insurance Company.     The Home\n\ndefended the firm in the 1995 suit and eventually settled.      In\n\nthe meantime, The Home brought this suit, seeking a declaration\n\nthat St. Paul was obligated to share the costs of defending and\n\nindemnifying S&E.   The magistrate judge recommended granting\n\nsummary judgment to St. Paul.    The district court affirmed the\n\nmagistrate's recommended decision.    We reverse and remand with\n\ninstructions.\n\n                                I.\n\n     In 1989, S&E represented a number of investors in the\n\npurchase and rehabilitation of a hotel in Kennebunk, Maine,\n\ncalled the Shawmut Inn.   The project fell through, and in 1995\n\nthe investors sued S&E for malpractice.    Investors Bernard F.\n\nShadrawy, Jr. and Joseph D'Jamoos brought suit in early 1995.\n\nOther investors Ralph Bruno, Port Resort Realty Corporation,\n\nand Harbor Lights Realty Trust brought a separate suit around\n\nNovember of the same year.   The costs of defending and\n\n\n\n     1    At the time when the events underlying this case began,\nS&E was known as Smith, Elliott, Smith & Garmey. For the sake\nof simplicity, we use the firm's current name throughout this\nopinion.\n\n                                -3-\n\fsettling the Bruno suit are the subject of the controversy in\n\nthis case.\n\n    Initially, the Bruno suit was concerned solely with acts\n\nS&E committed in 1989, while representing the plaintiffs in\n\nthe Shawmut Inn project.   The Bruno plaintiffs charged that\n\nS&E failed to obtain a written loan commitment from the Bank\n\nof New England, and that consequently the Bank declined to\n\nhonor its oral agreement to lend the plaintiffs $4 million in\n\nconstruction funds, causing the project's collapse.    However,\n\nin February of 1996, in response to a motion to dismiss based\n\non the statute of limitations, the Bruno plaintiffs amended\n\ntheir complaint, adding charges that in 1995 S&E breached\n\nvarious ethical duties owed to the Bruno plaintiffs.\n\nSpecifically, the amended Bruno complaint alleged that in\n\n1995, while S&E was defending itself in the two malpractice\n\nsuits, S&E (1) disclosed the Bruno plaintiffs' files to\n\nShadrawy and D'Jamoos without proper authorization; (2)\n\nwrongfully obtained a statement from Bruno for use in the\n\nShadrawy suit; (3) contacted other prior counsel of the Bruno\n\nplaintiffs in an effort to obtain confidential information;\n\nand (4) refused to turn over the Bruno plaintiffs' files at\n\ntheir request.\n\n    The Home and St. Paul disagreed from the start over which\n\n\n                              -4-\n\fcompany was responsible for defending and indemnifying S&E in\n\nthe Bruno suit.   Both companies' policies were applicable,\n\nthough for different reasons.    The Home had issued S&E a\n\nlawyers' professional liability policy for the period of April\n\n6, 1991 to April 6, 1992.   St. Paul had issued S&E a similar\n\npolicy for the period of April 6, 1995 to April 6, 1996.         Each\n\npolicy was a \"claims made\" policy as opposed to an\n\n\"occurrence\" policy: that is, each extended coverage to any\n\nclaims made within the policy period, even if the acts on\n\nwhich those claims were based occurred prior to the policy\n\nperiod (though with important conditions, as will be seen).\n\nThus, both policies potentially applied to claims that S&E\n\ncommitted malpractice in 1989, if such claims were made within\n\nthe policies' respective periods.      The Bruno claim clearly was\n\nmade within St. Paul's 1995-1996 policy period: the suit was\n\nbrought in or about November 1995.      However, The Home had to\n\ntreat the Bruno claim as if it had been made during The Home's\n\n1991-1992 policy period as well.      S&E was first threatened\n\nwith a lawsuit in connection with the Shawmut Inn project in\n\nSeptember of 1991, during The Home's policy period.2     S&E\n\nreported the claim to The Home at the time.      Thus, when the\n\n\n    2     The suit was threatened by the Bank of New England.\nFrom the record, it appears that the Bank's threat never\nmaterialized.\n\n                                -5-\n\fBruno claim was brought in 1995, The Home considered the claim\n\nto be related to the 1991 claim and so, under a provision in\n\nThe Home's policy requiring The Home to treat related claims\n\nas the same claim, it had to treat the Bruno claim as if it\n\nhad been made in 1991, during its policy period.3\n\n    The Home agreed to defend the Bruno suit, while fully\n\nreserving its rights.   As for St. Paul, even though the Bruno\n\nsuit was a claim made during its policy period, St. Paul\n\ninitially disclaimed any obligation to defend or indemnify\n\nS&E; eventually, it agreed to provide coverage on an excess\n\nbasis only, in the event that The Home's coverage was\n\nexhausted.   For justification, St. Paul cited the \"prior acts\"\n\nprovision of its policy, which stated that St. Paul would\n\ncover claims based on acts committed prior to the policy\n\nperiod only if \"[a]ny other insurance covering the claim has\n\nbeen used up.\"   In response, The Home pointed St. Paul to the\n\n\"other insurance\" provision in The Home's policy, which stated\n\nthat, in general, if \"other insurance\" was available to pay\n\nfor a claim covered by The Home's policy, The Home would cover\n\n\n\n    3     The relevant clause of The Home's policy reads:\n\"Related acts, errors or omissions shall be treated as a single\nclaim.   All such claims, whenever made, shall be considered\nfirst made during the policy period . . . in which the earliest\nclaim arising out of such act, error or omission was first made\n. . . .\"\n\n                              -6-\n\fthe claim on an excess basis only.   Thus, each insurer\n\nconcluded its policy was excess to the other.    Seeking to\n\nsplit the difference, The Home sought to persuade St. Paul\n\nthat The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior\n\nacts\" clause were mutually repugnant -- that is, the two\n\ncancelled each other out; therefore, under Maine law, the two\n\ninsurers were obligated to split the costs of defending and\n\nindemnifying S&E on a pro rata basis.    St. Paul disagreed and\n\ncontinued to deny concurrent coverage.\n\n    After the Bruno complaint was amended to include the\n\nallegations of ethical misconduct occurring in 1995, a further\n\ndisagreement arose between the two insurers.    The Home argued\n\nthat these new claims and the acts upon which they were based\n\nboth fell within St. Paul's policy period, and hence St. Paul\n\nwas responsible for covering them.   St. Paul disclaimed\n\nresponsibility on the grounds that S&E was no longer\n\nrepresenting the Bruno plaintiffs at the time the acts\n\noccurred, so the acts were not \"committed in the performance\n\nof legal services\" and thus did not fall under the literal\n\nterms of its policy.\n\n    Its attempts to persuade St. Paul through correspondence\n\nhaving failed, The Home filed the instant action on June 22,\n\n1998.   The Home sought a declaration that St. Paul provided\n\n\n                              -7-\n\fcoverage as to the Bruno suit concurrently with The Home and\n\nwas obligated to share costs accordingly.     Six months later,\n\nThe Home settled the Bruno suit.     By this point, it had\n\nexpended nearly $500,000 in defense and settlement of the\n\ncase.4\n\n     After settling, The Home moved to amend its complaint to\n\ninclude the allegation that, because St. Paul breached its\n\nduty to defend S&E, St. Paul now bears the burden of proving\n\nhow the Bruno settlement is to be apportioned as between S&E's\n\n1989 acts and its 1995 acts; in particular, St. Paul must show\n\nthat the settlement was not paid entirely to compensate for\n\nS&E's 1995 acts, for which The Home alleges St. Paul is\n\nexclusively responsible.    Because this is an impossible burden\n\nto meet, the allegation continues, St. Paul must pay for the\n\nentire Bruno settlement.\n\n     The Home and St. Paul both moved for summary judgment.\n\nThe magistrate recommended granting summary judgment to St.\n\nPaul.    The magistrate ruled, first, that the St. Paul policy\n\ndoes not cover the 1995 acts alleged in the amended Bruno\n\ncomplaint because the acts were not \"committed in the\n\n\n\n     4    These expenses did not exceed The Home's $3 million\npolicy limit, so it has never been claimed that St. Paul's\nobligations as an excess insurer were triggered by the Bruno\nsuit.\n\n                               -8-\n\fperformance of legal services.\"     Second, the magistrate ruled\n\nthat The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior\n\nacts\" clause are not mutually repugnant, as contended by The\n\nHome; rather, The Home policy provides primary coverage while\n\nthe St. Paul policy provides excess coverage.     Third, having\n\nfound that St. Paul had no duty to defend S&E, the magistrate\n\ndenied The Home's motion to amend its complaint on the grounds\n\nthat the amendment would be futile.     The district court\n\naffirmed the magistrate's recommended decision in a paragraph\n\norder.   The effect was to leave The Home with all of the costs\n\nof defending and indemnifying S&E in the Bruno suit.     The Home\n\nnow appeals.\n\n                              II.\n\n    We address the issues raised in the case in the following\n\norder: first, whether The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and\n\nSt. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause are mutually repugnant, making\n\nthe two insurers jointly responsible for defending and\n\nindemnifying S&E as to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno\n\ncomplaint; second, whether either insurer had a duty to defend\n\nor indemnify S&E as to the 1995 acts alleged in the Bruno\n\ncomplaint; and third, whether The Home should be granted leave\n\nto amend its complaint to demand that St. Paul pay the entire\n\nBruno settlement.   Our review is de novo.    See Thomas v.\n\n\n                              -9-\n\fEastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 47 (1st Cir. 1999) (review of\n\ndistrict court's decision on summary judgment is de novo),\n\ncert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 120 S.Ct. 1174 (2000).   Maine law\n\ngoverns.\n\nA. Coverage of 1989 Acts\n\n    Although this case presents an apparently rare clash\n\nbetween an \"other insurance\" clause from one policy and a\n\n\"prior acts\" clause from another, it is in the end just a\n\nslight variation on the standard mutual repugnancy case in\n\nwhich two \"other insurance\" clauses conflict with one another.\n\nAccordingly, we begin our analysis by discussing the doctrine\n\nthat applies to the standard case, and then we consider\n\nwhether the variation presented here requires any deviation\n\nfrom this norm.\n\n    \"Other insurance\" clauses limit an insurer's\n\nresponsibility for a claim if \"other insurance\" is available\n\nto cover it.   Originally, the clauses appeared in property\n\ninsurance policies and were intended to eliminate the problem\n\nof fraudulent claims induced by over-insuring.   See Carriers\n\nIns. Co. v. American Policyholders' Ins. Co., 404 A.2d 216,\n\n218 (Me. 1979).   In a context such as the one here, the\n\nclauses function not so much as to deter fraudulent claims as\n\nsimply to limit an insurer's exposure where the insured\n\n\n                              -10-\n\fhappens to hold multiple insurance policies covering the same\n\nloss.     Cf. id.; see also R. J. Robertson, Jr., \"Other\n\nInsurance\" Clauses in Illinois, 20 S. Ill. U. L.J. 403, 405\n\n(1996).\n\n     \"Other insurance\" clauses come in three types.    The\n\nfirst, an \"escape\" clause, is the most basic: it simply denies\n\nany coverage for a claim if other insurance is available.     The\n\nsecond, a \"pro rata\" clause, extends coverage to a portion of\n\nthe total loss claimed, usually based on the limits of the\n\napplicable policies.5    The third, an \"excess\" clause, is the\n\ntype at issue in this case; it extends coverage only to the\n\nextent that other available insurance is insufficient to cover\n\nthe claim.6    See Carriers, 404 A.2d at 218.\n\n     \"Other insurance\" clauses are not necessarily\n\nproblematic.     For example, if a claim is covered by two\n\npolicies each with pro rata clauses, then the insurers each\n\npay a pro rata share of the claim.     Or if one policy contains\n\nno \"other insurance\" clause at all while the second contains\n\n\n     5    For example, if insurer A's policy limit is $1 million\nand insurer B's policy limit is $3 million, a pro rata clause in\nA's policy would require A to pay one-fourth of any claim\ncovered by both A and B (up to $1 million).\n     6    For example, if insurer A and B both cover a claim, and\nB's policy limit is $3 million, an excess clause in A's policy\nwould require A to pay out on the claim only to the extent that\nthe claim exceeded $3 million (up to A's policy limit).\n\n                                -11-\n\fan excess clause, then the first policy covers the claim and,\n\nif the first is insufficient, the second covers the excess.\n\nIn these scenarios, both policies interact harmoniously and\n\nthe claim goes wholly insured.   But frequently, policies\n\ncontain \"other insurance\" clauses that are incompatible in the\n\nsense that, if each is given full effect, claims covered by\n\nboth policies will go under-insured.   In particular, where two\n\npolicies each contain excess \"other insurance\" clauses, giving\n\neffect to both will leave a claim completely uninsured.     For\n\nthe first policy provides coverage only in excess of the\n\nsecond, but the second provides coverage only in excess of the\n\nfirst; the result is a standoff, in which each insurer refuses\n\nto cover the claim before the other.\n\n    In order to break the tie in such situations, courts\n\nearly on experimented with various rules for declaring one\n\ninsurer the \"primary\" insurer and the other the \"excess\"\n\ninsurer.   One such rule was to consider the primary insurer to\n\nbe the one \"first in time\"; a second rule considered the\n\nprimary insurer to be the one whose \"other insurance\" clause\n\nwas more general in scope; a third rule considered the primary\n\ninsurer to be the one whose policy more specifically covered\n\nthe claim at issue.   See Carriers, 404 A.2d at 219 (collecting\n\ncases).\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f    In time, however, most courts came to reject such rules,\n\nfavoring instead the doctrine of mutual repugnancy, under\n\nwhich two insurers' excess clauses are thought to cancel each\n\nother out, and both insurers are made, in Solomonic fashion,\n\nto split the costs of coverage between them pro rata.     See 69\n\nA.L.R. 2d 1122, 1124 (1960).   The Maine Supreme Judicial Court\n\nadopted this approach in Carriers, supra.   Finding the earlier\n\nrules \"arbitrary,\" \"mechanical,\" and tending toward \"semantic\n\nmicroscopy,\" the court chose to \"abandon[] the search for the\n\nmythical 'primary' insurer and insist[] instead that both\n\ninsurers share in the loss.\"   Id. at 219-20.   Such an\n\napproach, the court explained, not only best carries out the\n\nintent of both insurers to limit their exposure, but also\n\ndiscourages insurers from engaging in draftsmanship battles\n\nand wasteful litigation in order to avoid providing primary\n\ncoverage.   See id.\n\n    The essential difference between Carriers and this case\n\nis that here, the clash of clauses is not between two \"other\n\ninsurance\" clauses, but rather is between an \"other insurance\"\n\nclause and a \"prior acts\" clause containing \"other insurance\"\n\nlanguage.   Toward the end of The Home policy, in a section\n\nlabeled \"Conditions,\" which comes after a section labeled\n\n\"Coverage,\" The Home's policy contains an \"other insurance\"\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fclause, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n    II. Other Insurance: . . . [T]his insurance shall be in\n    excess of . . . any other valid and collectible insurance\n    available to the Insured whether such other insurance is\n    stated to be primary, pro rata, contributory, excess,\n    contingent or otherwise, unless such other insurance is\n    written only as a specific excess insurance over the\n    limits of liability provided in the policy.7\n\nIn contrast, near the middle of St. Paul's policy, under a\n\nsection labeled \"When This Agreement Covers,\" is St. Paul's\n\n\"prior acts\" clause, specifying under what conditions St. Paul\n\nwill cover claims based on acts committed prior to the policy\n\nperiod.   It provides as follows:\n\n    Prior acts. We'll cover claims based on wrongful acts\n    that occurred before the effective date of this\n    agreement, but only if all the following conditions are\n    met: . . .\n\n    •     Any other insurance covering the claim has been used\n          up.\n\nThere is no question that if the \"other insurance\" language of\n\nSt. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause had instead appeared in a\n\ncatchall \"other insurance\" clause such as the one in The Home\n\npolicy, the two insurers would be required to share coverage\n\n\n\n    7     By \"specific excess insurance\" is meant insurance\nproviding coverage only in excess of some other specifically\nidentified policy -- which here would be The Home policy. See\nWright v. Newman, 598 F. Supp. 1178, 1196 (W.D. Mo. 1984),\naff'd, 767 F.2d 460 (8th Cir. 1985). St. Paul's policy is not\nof this sort; there is no dispute that, if The Home policy did\nnot exist, St. Paul's policy would provide coverage as to S&E's\n1989 acts.\n\n                              -14-\n\funder Carriers.   The question, then, is whether it makes any\n\ndifference that the language appears in the \"prior acts\"\n\nclause.\n\n    The magistrate judge held that it does, and that Maine's\n\nusual mutual repugnance rule therefore does not apply.     The\n\nmagistrate found only four cases -- none of them from Maine --\n\nbearing precisely on the question, and of these four, three\n\nfound no mutual repugnance.   See Evanston Ins. Co. v.\n\nAffiliated FM Ins. Co., 556 F. Supp. 135, 138 (D. Conn. 1983)\n\n(finding no mutual repugnance); Smith v. Neumann, 682 N.E.2d\n\n1245, 1251-52 (Ill. App. Ct. 1997) (same); Chamberlin v.\n\nSmith, 72 Cal. App. 3d 835, 850-51 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977)\n\n(same); Fremont Indem. Co. v. New England Reinsurance Co., 815\n\nP.2d 403, 407-08 (Ariz. 1991) (finding mutual repugnance).\n\nFollowing the guidance of this \"meagre but distinct majority,\"\n\nthe magistrate judge reasoned as follows: The Home's \"other\n\ninsurance\" clause appears after the coverage section of its\n\npolicy, whereas the \"other insurance\" language in St.Paul's\n\n\"prior acts\" clause appears within the coverage section of its\n\npolicy; consequently, under The Home's policy, coverage for\n\nS&E's 1989 acts is initially triggered in the coverage section\n\nand only rescinded if the \"other insurance\" clause later kicks\n\nin, while under St. Paul's policy, coverage is never triggered\n\n\n                              -15-\n\fin the first place; so, because St. Paul's coverage is never\n\ntriggered, The Home's \"other insurance\" clause never kicks in,\n\nits coverage is never rescinded, and The Home is left as the\n\nprimary insurer.   Put succinctly, the magistrate found that\n\nSt. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause effects \"not a post hac escape\n\nclause, but rather an explicit, initial exclusion from\n\ncoverage,\" Evanston, 556 F. Supp. at 138, and, for that\n\nreason, it trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause.\n\n    We think such reasoning turns too much on the sort of\n\n\"semantic microscopy\" that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\n\ndisfavored in Carriers; to accept it would encourage the very\n\ndraftsmanship battles and wasteful litigation that the\n\nCarriers Court sought to prevent.    Simply because The Home's\n\n\"other insurance\" clause appears outside a section expressly\n\nlabeled \"Coverage\" does not mean that coverage is not limited\n\nby the provision, or that the provision should be given any\n\nless weight than if it appeared inside such a section.      Nor is\n\nit correct to conceive of St. Paul's policy as \"initially\"\n\nexcluding coverage, or The Home's policy as initially\n\nextending it and only later attempting taking it away, as if\n\none section of an insurance policy were metaphysically prior\n\nto another.   Under Maine law the coverage provided by an\n\ninsurance policy is determined by the policy as a whole.      \"All\n\n\n                              -16-\n\fparts and clauses, including exceptions and conditions, must\n\nbe considered together . . . .\"   Baybutt Constr. Corp. v.\n\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 455 A.2d 914, 921 (Me. 1983),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon,\n\n564 A.2d 383 (Me. 1989).   Read as a whole, The Home's policy\n\ncovers claims only on an excess basis if other insurance is\n\navailable; St. Paul's policy does the same where the claims\n\nare based on prior acts.   Thus, each policy purports to\n\nprovide only excess coverage for S&E's 1989 acts if the other\n\npolicy is available.   In such a situation, Carriers demands\n\nproration.   We do not think Carriers countenances different\n\noutcomes depending on whether St. Paul's language was in an\n\n\"other insurance\" clause relating to prior acts or in a \"prior\n\nacts\" clause relating to other insurance.   Such an approach\n\nwould tend to encourage insurers to jockey for best position\n\nin choosing where to locate \"other insurance\" language,\n\nneedlessly complicating the drafting of policies, inducing\n\nwasteful litigation among insurers, and delaying settlements -\n\n- all ultimately to the detriment of the insurance-buying\n\npublic.   See Fremont, 815 P.2d at 407; cf. Carriers, 404 A.2d\n\nat 220.\n\n    The magistrate judge thought that the Maine Supreme\n\nJudicial Court \"would not be so quick to collapse the\n\n\n                              -17-\n\fdistinction between the coverage portions of a policy and a\n\ncatchall 'other insurance' clause.\"   For support, it cited the\n\nMaine Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Royal Globe\n\nInsurance Co. v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 485 A.2d\n\n242 (Me. 1984).   There, the Court found no mutual repugnance\n\nwhere one policy contained a catchall \"other insurance\" clause\n\nand the other contained a clause making coverage for the\n\ninsured's employees (but not for the insured itself) available\n\non an excess basis only.   Royal Globe, 485 A.2d at 243-44.\n\nThe magistrate judge drew an analogy with the instant case:\n\n\"Just as the . . . insurer in Royal Globe extended coverage in\n\na specific instance (involving employees) only upon exhaustion\n\nof other available insurance, St. Paul extends coverage in a\n\nspecific instance (involving prior acts) only upon such\n\nexhaustion.\"\n\n    There are several problems with this analogy.   As an\n\ninitial matter, the analogy does not support the posited\n\nthesis -- that St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause trumps The\n\nHome's \"other insurance\" clause because of its location in the\n\ncoverage portions of St. Paul's policy.   Indeed, Royal Globe\n\ndoes not mention the location of the clauses at issue there.\n\nRather, what the analogy seems to suggest is that St. Paul's\n\n\"prior acts\" clause trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause\n\n\n                              -18-\n\fbecause it applies more specifically to the claim at issue\n\nhere -- i.e., it applies specifically to claims based on prior\n\nacts, whereas The Home's \"other insurance\" clause applies to\n\nclaims generally.\n\n    The difficulty is that such a conclusion is flatly at\n\nodds with Carriers, which explicitly rejected the rule that,\n\nas between two \"other insurance\" clauses, the specific trumps\n\nthe general.   Carriers, 404 A.2d at 219.   There is no reason\n\nto think that Royal Globe revives this rule.    Indeed, Royal\n\nGlobe is distinguishable from both Carriers and this case in\n\nthat it involved a conflict not between two excess \"other\n\ninsurance\" clauses, but rather between an excess clause and a\n\npro rata clause.    Courts treat conflicts between two excess\n\nclauses differently from conflicts between an excess clause\n\nand a pro rata clause: while the majority rule for the former\n\nis to apply the doctrine of mutual repugnance, the majority\n\nrule for the latter is that the excess clause trumps the pro\n\nrata clause.   Compare 69 A.L.R.2d 1122, 1124 (1960)\n\n(describing majority rule for excess vs. excess cases) with 12\n\nA.L.R.4th 993, 997 (1982) (describing majority rule for excess\n\nvs. pro rata cases); see also Robertson, supra, at 414, 418.\n\nThus, the more straightforward reading of Royal Globe -- and\n\nthe reading more compatible with Carriers -- is simply that it\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fadopts the majority rule for conflicts between excess clauses\n\nand pro rata clauses.   See Royal Globe, 485 A.2d at 244-45\n\n(finding pro rata clause not a clear indicator of whether\n\npolicy is primary or excess, so, by default, policy with pro\n\nrata clause is to be considered primary).\n\n    Finally, St. Paul asks us to consider expert testimony\n\nregarding how conflicts between successive insurers, such as\n\nthe conflict in this case, are settled within the industry.\n\nPerhaps in some other setting it might be appropriate to\n\nconsider such evidence, but we do not think it would be\n\nappropriate here.   The relevant policy language is unambiguous\n\nand the dispute presented can be resolved through ordinary\n\njudicial methods of contractual interpretation.   See Hanover\n\nIns. Co. v. Crocker, 688 A.2d 928, 930 (Me. 1997) (\"In cases\n\ninvolving the construction of the language of an insurance\n\ncontract, the meaning of unambiguous language is a question of\n\nlaw.\").   Moreover, the expert testimony presented by St. Paul\n\nis ultimately irrelevant.   The testimony was that within the\n\ninsurance industry, if one insurer was on risk at the time an\n\nact occurred, and the other was on risk at the time a claim\n\nbased on the act was made, the former insurer is expected to\n\ncover the claim on a primary basis.   However, The Home was not\n\non risk at the time the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno\n\n\n                              -20-\n\fcomplaint occurred.     The only reason The Home's policy covers\n\nthe Bruno claim is that The Home was on risk in 1991, when the\n\nfirst claim against S&E based on the 1989 acts was reported;\n\nbecause the Bruno claim relates back to this claim, The Home's\n\npolicy provides coverage.\n\n    In conclusion, seeing no reason to consider St. Paul's\n\n\"prior acts\" clause to trump The Home's \"other insurance\"\n\nclause, we find the two clauses mutually repugnant.\n\nAccordingly, St. Paul is responsible for a pro rata share of\n\nthe costs of defending and indemnifying S&E as to the 1989\n\nacts alleged in the Bruno complaint.\n\nB. Coverage of 1995 Acts\n\n    We next consider whether St. Paul had a duty to defend\n\nand indemnify S&E as to the 1995 acts -- the breaches of\n\nethical duties -- alleged in the amended Bruno complaint.     The\n\nHome contends that these allegations constitute a separate\n\nclaim from the allegations based on S&E's 1989 acts, and that\n\nThe Home is not responsible for this claim because it is based\n\non acts that occurred neither prior to nor during its policy\n\nperiod.     Rather, The Home argues, the 1995 acts occurred and\n\nthe claim based upon them was made during St. Paul's policy\n\nperiod, so St. Paul is exclusively responsible for providing\n\ncoverage.     St. Paul responds, first, that its policy does not\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fcover the 1995 acts because none qualify as \"a negligent act,\n\nerror, or omission committed in the performance of legal . . .\n\nservices,\" and second, that The Home's policy does cover the\n\n1995 acts because they sufficiently relate to the 1989 acts,\n\nfor which The Home concedes coverage.8\n\n    There are two questions to be decided: first, whether\n\neither insurer had a duty to defend as to the 1995 acts, and\n\nsecond, whether either insurer had a duty to indemnify.      See\n\nLewiston Daily Sun v. Hanover Ins. Co., 407 A.2d 288, 291-92\n\n(Me. 1979) (comparing duty to defend with duty to indemnify);\n\nAmerican Policyholders' Ins. Co. v. Cumberland Cold Storage\n\nCo., 373 A.2d 247, 250-51 (Me. 1977) (same).\n\n1. Duty to Defend\n\n    Under Maine law, \"[t]he scope of a duty to defend is\n\ndetermined by 'comparing the provisions of the insurance\n\ncontract with the allegations in the underlying complaint.         If\n\nthere is any legal or factual basis that could be developed at\n\ntrial, which would obligate the insurer to pay under the\n\npolicy, the insured is entitled to a defense.'\"   Burns v.\n\n\n\n    8     The magistrate judge agreed with St. Paul that the 1995\nacts were not \"committed in the performance of legal . . .\nservices.\"   Rather, he found, the acts were committed in the\ncourse of S&E's conduct as a defendant in a malpractice case.\nThe magistrate judge made no finding as to whether The Home's\npolicy covered the 1995 acts.\n\n                              -22-\n\fMiddlesex Ins. Co., 558 A.2d 701, 702 (Me. 1989) (quoting\n\nJ.A.J., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 529 A.2d 806, 808 (Me.\n\n1987)) (emphasis in original); see also United Bank v. Chicago\n\nTitle Ins. Co., 168 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir. 1999).    Maine law\n\nfavors an expansive view of an insurer's duty to defend; any\n\nambiguity in policy language is to be construed in favor of\n\nthe insured.   See Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Inhabitants of\n\nTopsham, 441 A.2d 1012, 1015 (Me. 1982).\n\n     Given that Maine has so placed its thumb on the scales,\n\nwe think that St. Paul most likely had a duty to defend S&E as\n\nto the 1995 acts.   St. Paul's primary argument is that the\n\nacts occurred after S&E had ceased representing the Bruno\n\nplaintiffs, and so the acts cannot be said to have been\n\n\"committed in the performance of . . . legal services,\" as its\n\npolicy requires.9   We think it at least arguable, however,\n\nthat a lawyer's honoring of his continuing ethical duties,\n\narising as they do out of the attorney-client relationship, is\n\nitself a \"legal service\" the lawyer provides to his clients,\n\nsee Regas v. Continental Cas. Co., 487 N.E.2d 105, 109 (Ill.\n\nApp. Ct. 1985) (construing \"services\" in legal malpractice\n\n\n\n     9    The policy states in pertinent part: \"We'll pay amounts\nyou . . . are legally required to pay to compensate others for\nloss that results from a negligent act, error, or omission\ncommitted in the performance of legal or notary services.\"\n\n                              -23-\n\fpolicy to encompass \"any sort of service . . . [that] requires\n\nthe use of any degree of legal knowledge or skill\") (citations\n\nomitted), and that the 1995 acts could, under some legal\n\ntheory or factual showing, each be proven a \"negligent act,\n\nerror, or omission\" committed in the performance of such\n\nservice, see Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell, 414 A.2d 220,\n\n226 (Me. 1980) (\"The correct test is whether a potential for\n\nliability within the coverage appears from whatever\n\nallegations are made.\") (emphasis in original).10\n\n    In the end, though, we need not resolve the question.     We\n\nhave already concluded that St. Paul had a duty to defend S&E\n\nas to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint.   And under\n\nMaine law, if an insurer has a duty to defend against one\n\n\n    10    St. Paul objects that the Bruno plaintiffs could never\nhave proven the 1995 acts to constitute error because Maine Bar\nRule 3.6(h)(3) permits a lawyer to disclose a client's\nconfidential information if necessary to defend himself in a\nmalpractice suit.    We note first that this provision would\nexcuse only one of the 1995 acts -- S&E's disclosure of the\nBruno's files to others. Second, it was possible that the Bruno\nplaintiffs could have proven at trial that this disclosure was\nnot reasonably necessary to S&E's malpractice defense and so was\nwrongful notwithstanding Rule 3.6(h)(3).       St. Paul further\nobjects that the 1995 acts were all intentional in nature, and\nso do not fall under the scope of its coverage, which is for\nloss resulting from a \" negligent act, error, or omission.\" But,\ngiven Maine's policy of resolving ambiguities in favor of the\ninsured, we do not think this language should be read so\nnarrowly.   See USM Corp. v. First State Ins. Co., 652 N.E.2d\n613, 614-15 (Mass. 1995) (collecting cases for reading\n\"negligent\" to modify only the term \"act,\" not \"error\" or\n\"omission\").\n\n                             -24-\n\fcount of a complaint, it has a derivative duty to defend\n\nagainst other counts if they are sufficiently related that\n\napportioning defense costs as between the two is not\n\npracticable.     See Gibson v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., 673\n\nA.2d 1350, 1353 (Me. 1996).     This is the majority rule.   See\n\nTitan Holdings Syndicate, Inc. v. Keene, 898 F.2d 265, 269\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (citing 41 A.L.R.2d 434, 436-38 (1980 Supp.)\n\n(collecting cases)).     In this case, the allegations of the\n\n1995 acts are sufficiently intertwined with the allegations of\n\nthe 1989 acts so that The Home's defense costs cannot readily\n\nbe retrospectively apportioned as between the two.     The 1995\n\nacts arose out of the same attorney-client relationship and\n\nultimately relate back to the same botched real estate\n\ntransaction as the 1989 acts; defending against allegations of\n\nthe former required knowledge of the latter.     Cf. Gibson, 673\n\nA.2d at 1354.     Moreover, as discussed below, S&E's defense as\n\nto the 1995 acts was merely incidental to its defense as to\n\nthe 1989 acts.     The great bulk of the Bruno suit concerned the\n\n1989 acts; the allegations of the 1995 acts were defended\n\nagainst merely in order to prevent the Bruno plaintiffs from\n\nescaping a statute of limitations problem affecting the\n\nallegations of the 1989 acts.     Given these circumstances, St.\n\nPaul had a duty to defend as to the 1995 acts as well as the\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f1989 acts, regardless of whether the 1995 acts independently\n\nfall within its coverage.\n\n    For its part, The Home appears to concede that, under\n\nGibson, supra, it was obliged to defend as to the 1995 acts as\n\nwell as the 1989 acts.   Only with respect to the duty to\n\nindemnify as to the 1995 acts does The Home claim that such\n\nduty was St. Paul's alone.   Thus, given that The Home and St.\n\nPaul were both obliged to defend against the 1989 allegations,\n\nwe hold that both insurers had a derivative duty to defend\n\nagainst the 1995 allegations.    St. Paul therefore must share\n\nwith The Home the costs of defending the entire Bruno suit,\n\nnot merely the costs of defending against the allegations of\n\nthe 1989 acts.\n\n2. Duty to Indemnify\n\n    In contrast to the duty to defend, the duty to indemnify\n\nis narrower: while the duty to defend depends only on the\n\nallegations made against the insured, the duty to indemnify\n\ndepends upon the facts established at trial and the theory\n\nunder which judgment is actually entered in the case.\n\nCumberland Cold Storage, 373 A.2d at 250.    However, the Bruno\n\nsuit was settled prior to trial, so no facts were ever\n\nestablished nor judgment ever entered in the case.    In such a\n\nsituation, this court has held, the duty to indemnify is\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fdetermined by the basis for the settlement.   See Travelers\n\nIns. Co. v. Waltham Indus. Labs. Corp., 883 F.2d 1092, 1099\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).   Accordingly, whether St. Paul or The Home\n\nhad a duty to indemnify S&E as to the 1995 acts turns on\n\nwhether any portion of the settlement was made in compensation\n\nfor the 1995 acts, and, if so, whether the 1995 acts fall\n\nunder either insurer's coverage.\n\n    We again avoid answering the latter question, for we\n\nthink it is clear from the record that the Bruno settlement\n\nwas made entirely in compensation for the 1989 acts; no\n\nsignificant portion was directed to the 1995 acts.   The Bruno\n\ncomplaint, as originally filed, alleged only the 1989 acts;\n\nthose acts were the raison d'etre for the suit.   The complaint\n\nwas amended to include the 1995 allegations only after S&E\n\nmoved to dismiss the original complaint on statute of\n\nlimitations grounds.   In its motion to strike the amended\n\nBruno complaint and its subsequent motion for summary judgment\n\nin the case, S&E made clear that it considered the added\n\nallegations frivolous, in violation of Rule 11, and intended\n\nsolely as an end run around the statute of limitations.      From\n\na correspondence file kept on the case, it appears that the\n\n1995 acts were not even considered by S&E's defense team in\n\nanalyzing the case's settlement value.   Likewise, the Bruno\n\n\n                              -27-\n\fplaintiffs did not consider the allegations of the 1995 acts\n\nto carry any significant value relative to the allegations of\n\nthe 1989 acts.   In assessing their damages in a motion for\n\nattachment filed in the case, the plaintiffs focused entirely\n\non the damages caused by the 1989 acts; they did not so much\n\nas mention the 1995 acts.   The same is true of Ralph Bruno's\n\nenumeration of his losses in an affidavit he submitted in the\n\ncase.   The only evidence in the record that plaintiff Bruno\n\nconsidered the 1995 acts to have caused any damages appears in\n\nhis answers to an interrogatory directly posing the question.\n\nBruno stated vaguely that the files that S&E disclosed to\n\nothers contained embarrassing material and that S&E's failure\n\nto turn the files over to him made it harder for his lawyers\n\nto conduct the Bruno case, increasing his legal fees.   By\n\ncomparison, the Bruno plaintiffs described in comprehensive\n\ndetail various tangible losses they suffered as a result of\n\nthe 1989 acts.   According to the plaintiffs, those losses\n\ntotaled approximately $29 million.   The settlement, plus The\n\nHome's attorney's fees, totaled about $500,000.\n\n    We thus find no genuine issue of material fact concerning\n\nthe apportionment of the Bruno settlement.   Compared to a\n\nfailed real estate transaction in which the Bruno plaintiffs\n\nlost millions, S&E's alleged acts of mischief in the resulting\n\n                              -28-\n\fmalpractice actions -- the improper handling of a file, the\n\nimproper taking of a statement, and the improper contacting of\n\na former attorney -- appear entirely inconsequential.       It\n\nsimply cannot be seriously contended -- especially given the\n\ncircumstances under which the acts were alleged -- that\n\nanything more than a de minimis portion of the Bruno\n\nsettlement could have been intended to compensate for the 1995\n\nacts.   Accordingly, we hold that neither The Home nor St. Paul\n\nhad a duty to indemnify S&E as to the 1995 acts, so St. Paul\n\nowes The Home nothing for indemnifying as to the 1995 acts.\n\nNonetheless, St. Paul still owes The Home for all of its\n\nindemnification costs, because the whole of the Bruno\n\nsettlement, and so all of The Home's indemnification costs,\n\nrelated to the 1989 acts.\n\nC. Motion to Amend\n\n    Finally, we address The Home's motion to amend its\n\ncomplaint.    The Home moved to amend its complaint after\n\nsettling the Bruno action, seeking to raise a new theory of\n\nliability based on St. Paul's refusal to participate in the\n\nsettlement.    The theory is as follows.   Under Maine law -- or\n\nso The Home argues -- if an insurer breaches its duty to\n\ndefend a suit, and the suit settles, then the insurer bears\n\nthe burden of allocating the settlement and proving that at\n\n\n                               -29-\n\fleast some of the settlement was paid for claims that its\n\npolicy does not cover.11   Yet, the argument continues, because\n\nthe settlement agreement in the Bruno case does not specify\n\nhow the settlement was intended to be allocated, St. Paul's\n\nburden of allocating the settlement is impossible to carry.\n\nConsequently, St. Paul cannot prove that the settlement was\n\nnot paid entirely for the 1995 acts, as to which The Home\n\nalleges St. Paul alone had a duty to indemnify.   Therefore,\n\nsupposing The Home is correct that St. Paul alone had a duty\n\nto indemnify as to the 1995 acts, it must be assumed that the\n\nsettlement was paid entirely for those acts, in effect\n\nrendering St. Paul responsible for the whole settlement.\n\n    The magistrate dismissed The Home's motion to amend on\n\nfutility grounds, because it rejected the premise of The\n\nHome's theory that St. Paul had an exclusive duty to indemnify\n\nS&E as to the 1995 acts.   We similarly reject that premise.12\n\nObviously, given our holding in the previous section, we\n\n\n    11    The Home cites Elliott v. Hanover Ins. Co., 711 A.2d\n1310, 1313-1314 (Me. 1998) (citing Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers\nIndem. Co., 610 N.E.2d 912, 922 (Mass. 1993)), as the relevant\nauthority. St. Paul argues that the citation does not support\nThe Home's argument.    Because we do not take up The Home's\nargument, we do not weigh in on this dispute.\n    12    We reject it, however, for different reasons. As noted\nearlier, the magistrate judge held that St. Paul had no duty to\nindemnify as to the 1995 acts because the acts did not fall\nwithin the scope of St. Paul's coverage.\n\n                               -30-\n\fdisagree with The Home that, merely because the Bruno\n\nsettlement agreement does not itself describe how the\n\nsettlement was allocated as between the 1989 acts and 1995\n\nacts, there is no way to prove that the settlement was not\n\npaid entirely for the 1995 acts.      To the contrary, we think\n\nthat evidence extrinsic to the settlement agreement shows\n\nconclusively that the settlement was paid entirely for the\n\n1989 acts.   Accordingly, we reject The Home's proposed theory\n\nand do not disturb the magistrate's dismissal of The Home's\n\nmotion to amend.   See Demars v. General Dynamics Corp., 779\n\nF.2d 95, 99 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n                               III.\n\n    We briefly summarize our holding.      First, we find The\n\nHome's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\"\n\nclause to be mutually repugnant; consequently, both insurers\n\nhad a duty to defend and indemnify S&E as to the 1989 acts.\n\nSecond, we find that both insurers had a derivative duty to\n\ndefend S&E as to the 1995 acts; by contrast, we find that\n\nneither insurer had a duty to indemnify as to the 1995 acts,\n\nbut only because no portion of the Bruno settlement was\n\nallocated to those acts.   The effect is that St. Paul is\n\nobligated to reimburse The Home for a pro rata share of all of\n\nits defense and indemnification costs.      To that extent,\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fsummary judgment should be granted to The Home.   We reverse\n\nand remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                             -32-\n\f",

However, in February of 1996, in response to a motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations, the Bruno plaintiffs amended their complaint, adding charges that in 1995 S&amp;E breached various ethical duties owed to the Bruno plaintiffs. Specifically, the amended Bruno complaint alleged that in 1995, while S&amp;E was defending itself in the two malpractice suits, S&amp;E (1) disclosed the Bruno plaintiffs' files to Shadrawy and D'Jamoos without proper authorization; (2) wrongfully obtained a statement from Bruno for use in the Shadrawy suit; (3) contacted other prior counsel of the Bruno plaintiffs in an effort to obtain confidential information; and (4) refused to turn over the Bruno plaintiffs' files at their request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Home and St. Paul disagreed from the start over which company was responsible for defending and indemnifying S&amp;E in the Bruno suit. Both companies' policies were applicable, though for different reasons. The Home had issued S&amp;E a lawyers' professional liability policy for the period of April 6, 1991 to April 6, 1992. St. Paul had issued S&amp;E a similar policy for the period of April 6, 1995 to April 6, 1996. Each policy was a \"claims made\" policy as opposed to an \"occurrence\" policy: that is, each extended coverage to any claims made within the policy period, even if the acts on which those claims were based occurred prior to the policy period (though with important conditions, as will be seen). Thus, both policies potentially applied to claims that S&amp;E committed malpractice in 1989, if such claims were made within the policies' respective periods. The Bruno claim clearly was made within St. Paul's 1995-1996 policy period: the suit was brought in or about November 1995. However, The Home had to treat the Bruno claim as if it had been made during The Home's 1991-1992 policy period as well. S&amp;E was first threatened with a lawsuit in connection with the Shawmut Inn project in September of 1991, during The Home's policy period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> S&amp;E reported the claim to The Home at the time. Thus, when the Bruno claim was brought in 1995, The Home considered the claim to be related to the 1991 claim and so, under a provision in The Home's policy requiring The Home to treat related claims as the same claim, it had to treat the Bruno claim as if it had been made in 1991, during its policy period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Home agreed to defend the Bruno suit, while fully reserving its rights. As for St. Paul, even though the Bruno suit was a claim made during its policy period, St. Paul initially disclaimed any obligation to defend or indemnify S&amp;E; eventually, it agreed to provide coverage on an excess basis only, in the event that The Home's coverage was exhausted. For justification, St. Paul cited the \"prior acts\" provision of its policy, which stated that St. Paul would cover claims based on acts committed prior to the policy period only if \"[a]ny other insurance covering the claim has been used up.\" In response, The Home pointed St. Paul to the \"other insurance\" provision in The Home's policy, which stated that, in general, if \"other insurance\" was available to pay for a claim covered by The Home's policy, The Home would cover the claim on an excess basis only. Thus, each insurer concluded its policy was excess to the other. Seeking to split the difference, The Home sought to persuade St. Paul that The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause were mutually repugnant -- that is, the two cancelled each other out; therefore, under Maine law, the two insurers were obligated to split the costs of defending and indemnifying S&amp;E on a pro rata basis. St. Paul disagreed and continued to deny concurrent coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Bruno complaint was amended to include the allegations of ethical misconduct occurring in 1995, a further disagreement arose between the two insurers. The Home argued that these new claims and the acts upon which they were based both fell within St. Paul's policy period, and hence St. Paul was responsible for covering them. St. Paul disclaimed responsibility on the grounds that S&amp;E was no longer representing the Bruno plaintiffs at the time the acts occurred, so the acts were not \"committed in the performance of legal services\" and thus did not fall under the literal terms of its policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Its attempts to persuade St. Paul through correspondence having failed, The Home filed the instant action on June 22, 1998. The Home sought a declaration that St. Paul provided coverage as to the Bruno suit concurrently with The Home and was obligated to share costs accordingly. Six months later, The Home settled the Bruno suit. By this point, it had expended nearly $500,000 in defense and settlement of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After settling, The Home moved to amend its complaint to include the allegation that, because St. Paul breached its duty to defend S&amp;E, St. Paul now bears the burden of proving how the Bruno settlement is to be apportioned as between S&amp;E's 1989 acts and its 1995 acts; in particular, St. Paul must show that the settlement was not paid entirely to compensate for S&amp;E's 1995 acts, for which The Home alleges St. Paul is exclusively responsible. Because this is an impossible burden to meet, the allegation continues, St. Paul must pay for the entire Bruno settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Home and St. Paul both moved for summary judgment. The magistrate recommended granting summary judgment to St. Paul. The magistrate ruled, first, that the St. Paul policy does not cover the 1995 acts alleged in the amended Bruno complaint because the acts were not \"committed in the performance of legal services.\" Second, the magistrate ruled that The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause are not mutually repugnant, as contended by The Home; rather, The Home policy provides primary coverage while the St. Paul policy provides excess coverage. Third, having found that St. Paul had no duty to defend S&amp;E, the magistrate denied The Home's motion to amend its complaint on the grounds that the amendment would be futile. The district court affirmed the magistrate's recommended decision in a paragraph order. The effect was to leave The Home with all of the costs of defending and indemnifying S&amp;E in the Bruno suit. The Home now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address the issues raised in the case in the following order: first, whether The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause are mutually repugnant, making the two insurers jointly responsible for defending and indemnifying S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint; second, whether either insurer had a duty to defend or indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint; and third, whether The Home should be granted leave to amend its complaint to demand that St. Paul pay the entire Bruno settlement. Our review is de novo. See Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 47 (1st Cir. 1999) (review of district court's decision on summary judgment is de novo), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 120 S.Ct. 1174 (2000). Maine law governs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Coverage of 1989 Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this case presents an apparently rare clash between an \"other insurance\" clause from one policy and a \"prior acts\" clause from another, it is in the end just a slight variation on the standard mutual repugnancy case in which two \"other insurance\" clauses conflict with one another. Accordingly, we begin our analysis by discussing the doctrine that applies to the standard case, and then we consider whether the variation presented here requires any deviation from this norm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Other insurance\" clauses limit an insurer's responsibility for a claim if \"other insurance\" is available to cover it. Originally, the clauses appeared in property insurance policies and were intended to eliminate the problem of fraudulent claims induced by over-insuring. See Carriers Ins. Co. v. American Policyholders' Ins. Co., 404 A.2d 216, 218 (Me. 1979). In a context such as the one here, the clauses function not so much as to deter fraudulent claims as simply to limit an insurer's exposure where the insured happens to hold multiple insurance policies covering the same loss. Cf. id.; see also R. J. Robertson, Jr., \"Other Insurance\" Clauses in Illinois, 20 S. Ill. U. L.J. 403, 405 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Other insurance\" clauses come in three types. The first, an \"escape\" clause, is the most basic: it simply denies any coverage for a claim if other insurance is available. The second, a \"pro rata\" clause, extends coverage to a portion of the total loss claimed, usually based on the limits of the applicable policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The third, an \"excess\" clause, is the type at issue in this case; it extends coverage only to the extent that other available insurance is insufficient to cover the claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See Carriers, 404 A.2d at 218.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Other insurance\" clauses are not necessarily problematic. For example, if a claim is covered by two policies each with pro rata clauses, then the insurers each pay a pro rata share of the claim. Or if one policy contains no \"other insurance\" clause at all while the second contains an excess clause, then the first policy covers the claim and, if the first is insufficient, the second covers the excess. In these scenarios, both policies interact harmoniously and the claim goes wholly insured. But frequently, policies contain \"other insurance\" clauses that are incompatible in the sense that, if each is given full effect, claims covered by both policies will go under-insured. In particular, where two policies each contain excess \"other insurance\" clauses, giving effect to both will leave a claim completely uninsured. For the first policy provides coverage only in excess of the second, but the second provides coverage only in excess of the first; the result is a standoff, in which each insurer refuses to cover the claim before the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to break the tie in such situations, courts early on experimented with various rules for declaring one insurer the \"primary\" insurer and the other the \"excess\" insurer. One such rule was to consider the primary insurer to be the one \"first in time\"; a second rule considered the primary insurer to be the one whose \"other insurance\" clause was more general in scope; a third rule considered the primary insurer to be the one whose policy more specifically covered the claim at issue. See Carriers, 404 A.2d at 219 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In time, however, most courts came to reject such rules, favoring instead the doctrine of mutual repugnancy, under which two insurers' excess clauses are thought to cancel each other out, and both insurers are made, in Solomonic fashion, to split the costs of coverage between them pro rata. See 69 A.L.R. 2d 1122, 1124 (1960). The Maine Supreme Judicial Court adopted this approach in Carriers, supra. Finding the earlier rules \"arbitrary,\" \"mechanical,\" and tending toward \"semantic microscopy,\" the court chose to \"abandon[] the search for the mythical 'primary' insurer and insist[] instead that both insurers share in the loss.\" Id. at 219-20. Such an approach, the court explained, not only best carries out the intent of both insurers to limit their exposure, but also discourages insurers from engaging in draftsmanship battles and wasteful litigation in order to avoid providing primary coverage. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential difference between Carriers and this case is that here, the clash of clauses is not between two \"other insurance\" clauses, but rather is between an \"other insurance\" clause and a \"prior acts\" clause containing \"other insurance\" language. Toward the end of The Home policy, in a section labeled \"Conditions,\" which comes after a section labeled \"Coverage,\" The Home's policy contains an \"other insurance\" clause, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Other Insurance:... [T]his insurance shall be in excess of... any other valid and collectible insurance available to the Insured whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, pro rata, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, unless such other insurance is written only as a specific excess insurance over the limits of liability provided in the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, near the middle of St. Paul's policy, under a section labeled \"When This Agreement Covers,\" is St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause, specifying under what conditions St. Paul will cover claims based on acts committed prior to the policy period. It provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior acts. We'll cover claims based on wrongful acts that occurred before the effective date of this agreement, but only if all the following conditions are met:...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any other insurance covering the claim has been used up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that if the \"other insurance\" language of St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause had instead appeared in a catchall \"other insurance\" clause such as the one in The Home policy, the two insurers would be required to share coverage under Carriers. The question, then, is whether it makes any difference that the language appears in the \"prior acts\" clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that it does, and that Maine's usual mutual repugnance rule therefore does not apply. The magistrate found only four cases -- none of them from Maine -- bearing precisely on the question, and of these four, three found no mutual repugnance. See Evanston Ins. Co. v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 556 F. Supp. 135, 138 (D. Conn. 1983) (finding no mutual repugnance); Smith v. Neumann, 682 N.E.2d 1245, 1251-52 (Ill. App. Ct. 1997) (same); Chamberlin v. Smith, 72 Cal. App. 3d 835, 850-51 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977) (same); Fremont Indem. Co. v. New England Reinsurance Co., 815 P.2d 403, 407-08 (Ariz. 1991) (finding mutual repugnance). Following the guidance of this \"meagre but distinct majority,\" the magistrate judge reasoned as follows: The Home's \"other insurance\" clause appears after the coverage section of its policy, whereas the \"other insurance\" language in St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause appears within the coverage section of its policy; consequently, under The Home's policy, coverage for S&amp;E's 1989 acts is initially triggered in the coverage section and only rescinded if the \"other insurance\" clause later kicks in, while under St. Paul's policy, coverage is never triggered in the first place; so, because St. Paul's coverage is never triggered, The Home's \"other insurance\" clause never kicks in, its coverage is never rescinded, and The Home is left as the primary insurer. Put succinctly, the magistrate found that St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause effects \"not a post hac escape clause, but rather an explicit, initial exclusion from coverage,\" Evanston, 556 F. Supp. at 138, and, for that reason, it trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think such reasoning turns too much on the sort of \"semantic microscopy\" that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court disfavored in Carriers; to accept it would encourage the very draftsmanship battles and wasteful litigation that the Carriers Court sought to prevent. Simply because The Home's \"other insurance\" clause appears outside a section expressly labeled \"Coverage\" does not mean that coverage is not limited by the provision, or that the provision should be given any less weight than if it appeared inside such a section. Nor is it correct to conceive of St. Paul's policy as \"initially\" excluding coverage, or The Home's policy as initially extending it and only later attempting taking it away, as if one section of an insurance policy were metaphysically prior to another. Under Maine law the coverage provided by an insurance policy is determined by the policy as a whole. \"All parts and clauses, including exceptions and conditions, must be considered together....\" Baybutt Constr. Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 455 A.2d 914, 921 (Me. 1983), overruled on other grounds by Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon, 564 A.2d 383 (Me. 1989). Read as a whole, The Home's policy covers claims only on an excess basis if other insurance is available; St. Paul's policy does the same where the claims are based on prior acts. Thus, each policy purports to provide only excess coverage for S&amp;E's 1989 acts if the other policy is available. In such a situation, Carriers demands proration. We do not think Carriers countenances different outcomes depending on whether St. Paul's language was in an \"other insurance\" clause relating to prior acts or in a \"prior acts\" clause relating to other insurance. Such an approach would tend to encourage insurers to jockey for best position in choosing where to locate \"other insurance\" language, needlessly complicating the drafting of policies, inducing wasteful litigation among insurers, and delaying settlements -- all ultimately to the detriment of the insurance-buying public. See Fremont, 815 P.2d at 407; cf. Carriers, 404 A.2d at 220.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge thought that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court \"would not be so quick to collapse the distinction between the coverage portions of a policy and a catchall 'other insurance' clause.\" For support, it cited the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Royal Globe Insurance Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., 485 A.2d 242 (Me. 1984). There, the Court found no mutual repugnance where one policy contained a catchall \"other insurance\" clause and the other contained a clause making coverage for the insured's employees (but not for the insured itself) available on an excess basis only. Royal Globe, 485 A.2d at 243-44. The magistrate judge drew an analogy with the instant case: \"Just as the... insurer in Royal Globe extended coverage in a specific instance (involving employees) only upon exhaustion of other available insurance, St. Paul extends coverage in a specific instance (involving prior acts) only upon such exhaustion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several problems with this analogy. As an initial matter, the analogy does not support the posited thesis -- that St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause because of its location in the coverage portions of St. Paul's policy. Indeed, Royal Globe does not mention the location of the clauses at issue there. Rather, what the analogy seems to suggest is that St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause because it applies more specifically to the claim at issue here -- i.e., it applies specifically to claims based on prior acts, whereas The Home's \"other insurance\" clause applies to claims generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that such a conclusion is flatly at odds with Carriers, which explicitly rejected the rule that, as between two \"other insurance\" clauses, the specific trumps the general. Carriers, 404 A.2d at 219. There is no reason to think that Royal Globe revives this rule. Indeed, Royal Globe is distinguishable from both Carriers and this case in that it involved a conflict not between two excess \"other insurance\" clauses, but rather between an excess clause and a pro rata clause. Courts treat conflicts between two excess clauses differently from conflicts between an excess clause and a pro rata clause: while the majority rule for the former is to apply the doctrine of mutual repugnance, the majority rule for the latter is that the excess clause trumps the pro rata clause. Compare 69 A.L.R.2d 1122, 1124 (1960) (describing majority rule for excess vs. excess cases) with 12 A.L.R.4th 993, 997 (1982) (describing majority rule for excess vs. pro rata cases); see also Robertson, supra, at 414, 418. Thus, the more straightforward reading of Royal Globe -- and the reading more compatible with Carriers -- is simply that it adopts the majority rule for conflicts between excess clauses and pro rata clauses. See Royal Globe, 485 A.2d at 244-45 (finding pro rata clause not a clear indicator of whether policy is primary or excess, so, by default, policy with pro rata clause is to be considered primary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, St. Paul asks us to consider expert testimony regarding how conflicts between successive insurers, such as the conflict in this case, are settled within the industry. Perhaps in some other setting it might be appropriate to consider such evidence, but we do not think it would be appropriate here. The relevant policy language is unambiguous and the dispute presented can be resolved through ordinary judicial methods of contractual interpretation. See Hanover Ins. Co. v. Crocker, 688 A.2d 928, 930 (Me. 1997) (\"In cases involving the construction of the language of an insurance contract, the meaning of unambiguous language is a question of law.\"). Moreover, the expert testimony presented by St. Paul is ultimately irrelevant. The testimony was that within the insurance industry, if one insurer was on risk at the time an act occurred, and the other was on risk at the time a claim based on the act was made, the former insurer is expected to cover the claim on a primary basis. However, The Home was not on risk at the time the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint occurred. The only reason The Home's policy covers the Bruno claim is that The Home was on risk in 1991, when the first claim against S&amp;E based on the 1989 acts was reported; because the Bruno claim relates back to this claim, The Home's policy provides coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, seeing no reason to consider St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause to trump The Home's \"other insurance\" clause, we find the two clauses mutually repugnant. Accordingly, St. Paul is responsible for a pro rata share of the costs of defending and indemnifying S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Coverage of 1995 Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider whether St. Paul had a duty to defend and indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts -- the breaches of ethical duties --alleged in the amended Bruno complaint. The Home contends that these allegations constitute a separate claim from the allegations based on S&amp;E's 1989 acts, and that The Home is not responsible for this claim because it is based on acts that occurred neither prior to nor during its policy period. Rather, The Home argues, the 1995 acts occurred and the claim based upon them was made during St. Paul's policy period, so St. Paul is exclusively responsible for providing coverage. St. Paul responds, first, that its policy does not cover the 1995 acts because none qualify as \"a negligent act, error, or omission committed in the performance of legal... services,\" and second, that The Home's policy does cover the 1995 acts because they sufficiently relate to the 1989 acts, for which The Home concedes coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two questions to be decided: first, whether either insurer had a duty to defend as to the 1995 acts, and second, whether either insurer had a duty to indemnify. See Lewiston Daily Sun v. Hanover Ins. Co., 407 A.2d 288, 291-92 (Me. 1979) (comparing duty to defend with duty to indemnify); American Policyholders' Ins. Co. v. Cumberland Cold Storage Co., 373 A.2d 247, 250-51 (Me. 1977) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Duty to Defend</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, \"[t]he scope of a duty to defend is determined by 'comparing the provisions of the insurance contract with the allegations in the underlying complaint. If there is any legal or factual basis that could be developed at trial, which would obligate the insurer to pay under the policy, the insured is entitled to a defense.'\" Burns v. Middlesex Ins. Co., 558 A.2d 701, 702 (Me. 1989) (quoting J.A.J., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 529 A.2d 806, 808 (Me. 1987)) (emphasis in original); see also United Bank v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 168 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir. 1999). Maine law favors an expansive view of an insurer's duty to defend; any ambiguity in policy language is to be construed in favor of the insured. See Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Inhabitants of Topsham, 441 A.2d 1012, 1015 (Me. 1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that Maine has so placed its thumb on the scales, we think that St. Paul most likely had a duty to defend S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts. St. Paul's primary argument is that the acts occurred after S&amp;E had ceased representing the Bruno plaintiffs, and so the acts cannot be said to have been \"committed in the performance of... legal services,\" as its policy requires.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We think it at least arguable, however, that a lawyer's honoring of his continuing ethical duties, arising as they do out of the attorney-client relationship, is itself a \"legal service\" the lawyer provides to his clients, see Regas v. Continental Cas. Co., 487 N.E.2d 105, 109 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) (construing \"services\" in legal malpractice policy to encompass \"any sort of service... [that] requires the use of any degree of legal knowledge or skill\") (citations omitted), and that the 1995 acts could, under some legal theory or factual showing, each be proven a \"negligent act, error, or omission\" committed in the performance of such service, see Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell, 414 A.2d 220, 226 (Me. 1980) (\"The correct test is whether a potential for liability within the coverage appears from whatever allegations are made.\") (emphasis in original).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, though, we need not resolve the question. We have already concluded that St. Paul had a duty to defend S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint. And under Maine law, if an insurer has a duty to defend against one count of a complaint, it has a derivative duty to defend against other counts if they are sufficiently related that apportioning defense costs as between the two is not practicable. See Gibson v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., 673 A.2d 1350, 1353 (Me. 1996). This is the majority rule. See Titan Holdings Syndicate, Inc. v. Keene, 898 F.2d 265, 269 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing 41 A.L.R.2d 434, 436-38 (1980 Supp.) (collecting cases)). In this case, the allegations of the 1995 acts are sufficiently intertwined with the allegations of the 1989 acts so that The Home's defense costs cannot readily be retrospectively apportioned as between the two. The 1995 acts arose out of the same attorney-client relationship and ultimately relate back to the same botched real estate transaction as the 1989 acts; defending against allegations of the former required knowledge of the latter. Cf. Gibson, 673 A.2d at 1354. Moreover, as discussed below, S&amp;E's defense as to the 1995 acts was merely incidental to its defense as to the 1989 acts. The great bulk of the Bruno suit concerned the 1989 acts; the allegations of the 1995 acts were defended against merely in order to prevent the Bruno plaintiffs from escaping a statute of limitations problem affecting the allegations of the 1989 acts. Given these circumstances, St. Paul had a duty to defend as to the 1995 acts as well as the 1989 acts, regardless of whether the 1995 acts independently fall within its coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, The Home appears to concede that, under Gibson, supra, it was obliged to defend as to the 1995 acts as well as the 1989 acts. Only with respect to the duty to indemnify as to the 1995 acts does The Home claim that such duty was St. Paul's alone. Thus, given that The Home and St. Paul were both obliged to defend against the 1989 allegations, we hold that both insurers had a derivative duty to defend against the 1995 allegations. St. Paul therefore must share with The Home the costs of defending the entire Bruno suit, not merely the costs of defending against the allegations of the 1989 acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Duty to Indemnify</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the duty to defend, the duty to indemnify is narrower: while the duty to defend depends only on the allegations made against the insured, the duty to indemnify depends upon the facts established at trial and the theory under which judgment is actually entered in the case. Cumberland Cold Storage, 373 A.2d at 250. However, the Bruno suit was settled prior to trial, so no facts were ever established nor judgment ever entered in the case. In such a situation, this court has held, the duty to indemnify is determined by the basis for the settlement. See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Waltham Indus. Labs. Corp., 883 F.2d 1092, 1099 (1st Cir. 1989). Accordingly, whether St. Paul or The Home had a duty to indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts turns on whether any portion of the settlement was made in compensation for the 1995 acts, and, if so, whether the 1995 acts fall under either insurer's coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We again avoid answering the latter question, for we think it is clear from the record that the Bruno settlement was made entirely in compensation for the 1989 acts; no significant portion was directed to the 1995 acts. The Bruno complaint, as originally filed, alleged only the 1989 acts; those acts were the raison d'etre for the suit. The complaint was amended to include the 1995 allegations only after S&amp;E moved to dismiss the original complaint on statute of limitations grounds. In its motion to strike the amended Bruno complaint and its subsequent motion for summary judgment in the case, S&amp;E made clear that it considered the added allegations frivolous, in violation of Rule 11, and intended solely as an end run around the statute of limitations. From a correspondence file kept on the case, it appears that the 1995 acts were not even considered by S&amp;E's defense team in analyzing the case's settlement value. Likewise, the Bruno plaintiffs did not consider the allegations of the 1995 acts to carry any significant value relative to the allegations of the 1989 acts. In assessing their damages in a motion for attachment filed in the case, the plaintiffs focused entirely on the damages caused by the 1989 acts; they did not so much as mention the 1995 acts. The same is true of Ralph Bruno's enumeration of his losses in an affidavit he submitted in the case. The only evidence in the record that plaintiff Bruno considered the 1995 acts to have caused any damages appears in his answers to an interrogatory directly posing the question. Bruno stated vaguely that the files that S&amp;E disclosed to others contained embarrassing material and that S&amp;E's failure to turn the files over to him made it harder for his lawyers to conduct the Bruno case, increasing his legal fees. By comparison, the Bruno plaintiffs described in comprehensive detail various tangible losses they suffered as a result of the 1989 acts. According to the plaintiffs, those losses totaled approximately $29 million. The settlement, plus The Home's attorney's fees, totaled about $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus find no genuine issue of material fact concerning the apportionment of the Bruno settlement. Compared to a failed real estate transaction in which the Bruno plaintiffs lost millions, S&amp;E's alleged acts of mischief in the resulting malpractice actions -- the improper handling of a file, the improper taking of a statement, and the improper contacting of a former attorney -- appear entirely inconsequential. It simply cannot be seriously contended -- especially given the circumstances under which the acts were alleged -- that anything more than a de minimis portion of the Bruno settlement could have been intended to compensate for the 1995 acts. Accordingly, we hold that neither The Home nor St. Paul had a duty to indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts, so St. Paul owes The Home nothing for indemnifying as to the 1995 acts. Nonetheless, St. Paul still owes The Home for all of its indemnification costs, because the whole of the Bruno settlement, and so all of The Home's indemnification costs, related to the 1989 acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion to Amend</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address The Home's motion to amend its complaint. The Home moved to amend its complaint after settling the Bruno action, seeking to raise a new theory of liability based on St. Paul's refusal to participate in the settlement. The theory is as follows. Under Maine law -- or so The Home argues -- if an insurer breaches its duty to defend a suit, and the suit settles, then the insurer bears the burden of allocating the settlement and proving that at least some of the settlement was paid for claims that its policy does not cover.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Yet, the argument continues, because the settlement agreement in the Bruno case does not specify how the settlement was intended to be allocated, St. Paul's burden of allocating the settlement is impossible to carry. Consequently, St. Paul cannot prove that the settlement was not paid entirely for the 1995 acts, as to which The Home alleges St. Paul alone had a duty to indemnify. Therefore, supposing The Home is correct that St. Paul alone had a duty to indemnify as to the 1995 acts, it must be assumed that the settlement was paid entirely for those acts, in effect rendering St. Paul responsible for the whole settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate dismissed The Home's motion to amend on futility grounds, because it rejected the premise of The Home's theory that St. Paul had an exclusive duty to indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts. We similarly reject that premise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Obviously, given our holding in the previous section, we disagree with The Home that, merely because the Bruno settlement agreement does not itself describe how the settlement was allocated as between the 1989 acts and 1995 acts, there is no way to prove that the settlement was not paid entirely for the 1995 acts. To the contrary, we think that evidence extrinsic to the settlement agreement shows conclusively that the settlement was paid entirely for the 1989 acts. Accordingly, we reject The Home's proposed theory and do not disturb the magistrate's dismissal of The Home's motion to amend. See Demars v. General Dynamics Corp., 779 F.2d 95, 99 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly summarize our holding. First, we find The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause to be mutually repugnant; consequently, both insurers had a duty to defend and indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts. Second, we find that both insurers had a derivative duty to defend S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts; by contrast, we find that neither insurer had a duty to indemnify as to the 1995 acts, but only because no portion of the Bruno settlement was allocated to those acts. The effect is that St. Paul is obligated to reimburse The Home for a pro rata share of all of its defense and indemnification costs. To that extent, summary judgment should be granted to The Home. We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  At the time when the events underlying this case began, S&amp;E was known as Smith, Elliott, Smith &amp; Garmey.

St. Paul's policy is not of this sort; there is no dispute that, if The Home policy did not exist, St. Paul's policy would provide coverage as to S&amp;E's 1989 acts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  The magistrate judge agreed with St. Paul that the 1995 acts were not \"committed in the performance of legal... services.\" Rather, he found, the acts were committed in the course of S&amp;E's conduct as a defendant in a malpractice case.

We note first that this provision would excuse only one of the 1995 acts -- S&amp;E's disclosure of the Bruno's files to others. Second, it was possible that the Bruno plaintiffs could have proven at trial that this disclosure was not reasonably necessary to S&amp;E's malpractice defense and so was wrongful notwithstanding Rule 3.6(h)(3). St. Paul further objects that the 1995 acts were all intentional in nature, and so do not fall under the scope of its coverage, which is for loss resulting from a \"negligent act, error, or omission.\" But, given Maine's policy of resolving ambiguities in favor of the insured, we do not think this language should be read so narrowly. See USM Corp. v. First State Ins. Co., 652 N.E.2d 613, 614-15 (Mass. 1995) (collecting cases for reading \"negligent\" to modify only the term \"act,\" not \"error\" or \"omission\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  The Home cites Elliott v.

The Home defended the firm in the 1995 suit and eventually settled. In the meantime, The Home brought this suit, seeking a declaration that St. Paul was obligated to share the costs of defending and indemnifying S&amp;E. The magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment to St. Paul. The district court affirmed the magistrate's recommended decision. We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, S&amp;E represented a number of investors in the purchase and rehabilitation of a hotel in Kennebunk, Maine, called the Shawmut Inn. The project fell through, and in 1995 the investors sued S&amp;E for malpractice. Investors Bernard F. Shadrawy, Jr. and Joseph D'Jamoos brought suit in early 1995. Other investors Ralph Bruno, Port Resort Realty Corporation, and Harbor Lights Realty Trust brought a separate suit around November of the same year. The costs of defending and settling the Bruno suit are the subject of the controversy in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the Bruno suit was concerned solely with acts S&amp;E committed in 1989, while representing the plaintiffs in the Shawmut Inn project. The Bruno plaintiffs charged that S&amp;E failed to obtain a written loan commitment from the Bank of New England, and that consequently the Bank declined to honor its oral agreement to lend the plaintiffs $4 million in construction funds, causing the project's collapse. However, in February of 1996, in response to a motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations, the Bruno plaintiffs amended their complaint, adding charges that in 1995 S&amp;E breached various ethical duties owed to the Bruno plaintiffs. Specifically, the amended Bruno complaint alleged that in 1995, while S&amp;E was defending itself in the two malpractice suits, S&amp;E (1) disclosed the Bruno plaintiffs' files to Shadrawy and D'Jamoos without proper authorization; (2) wrongfully obtained a statement from Bruno for use in the Shadrawy suit; (3) contacted other prior counsel of the Bruno plaintiffs in an effort to obtain confidential information; and (4) refused to turn over the Bruno plaintiffs' files at their request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Home and St. Paul disagreed from the start over which company was responsible for defending and indemnifying S&amp;E in the Bruno suit. Both companies' policies were applicable, though for different reasons. The Home had issued S&amp;E a lawyers' professional liability policy for the period of April 6, 1991 to April 6, 1992. St. Paul had issued S&amp;E a similar policy for the period of April 6, 1995 to April 6, 1996. Each policy was a \"claims made\" policy as opposed to an \"occurrence\" policy: that is, each extended coverage to any claims made within the policy period, even if the acts on which those claims were based occurred prior to the policy period (though with important conditions, as will be seen). Thus, both policies potentially applied to claims that S&amp;E committed malpractice in 1989, if such claims were made within the policies' respective periods. The Bruno claim clearly was made within St. Paul's 1995-1996 policy period: the suit was brought in or about November 1995. However, The Home had to treat the Bruno claim as if it had been made during The Home's 1991-1992 policy period as well. S&amp;E was first threatened with a lawsuit in connection with the Shawmut Inn project in September of 1991, during The Home's policy period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> S&amp;E reported the claim to The Home at the time. Thus, when the Bruno claim was brought in 1995, The Home considered the claim to be related to the 1991 claim and so, under a provision in The Home's policy requiring The Home to treat related claims as the same claim, it had to treat the Bruno claim as if it had been made in 1991, during its policy period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Home agreed to defend the Bruno suit, while fully reserving its rights. As for St. Paul, even though the Bruno suit was a claim made during its policy period, St. Paul initially disclaimed any obligation to defend or indemnify S&amp;E; eventually, it agreed to provide coverage on an excess basis only, in the event that The Home's coverage was exhausted. For justification, St. Paul cited the \"prior acts\" provision of its policy, which stated that St. Paul would cover claims based on acts committed prior to the policy period only if \"[a]ny other insurance covering the claim has been used up.\" In response, The Home pointed St. Paul to the \"other insurance\" provision in The Home's policy, which stated that, in general, if \"other insurance\" was available to pay for a claim covered by The Home's policy, The Home would cover the claim on an excess basis only. Thus, each insurer concluded its policy was excess to the other. Seeking to split the difference, The Home sought to persuade St. Paul that The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause were mutually repugnant -- that is, the two cancelled each other out; therefore, under Maine law, the two insurers were obligated to split the costs of defending and indemnifying S&amp;E on a pro rata basis. St. Paul disagreed and continued to deny concurrent coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Bruno complaint was amended to include the allegations of ethical misconduct occurring in 1995, a further disagreement arose between the two insurers. The Home argued that these new claims and the acts upon which they were based both fell within St. Paul's policy period, and hence St. Paul was responsible for covering them. St. Paul disclaimed responsibility on the grounds that S&amp;E was no longer representing the Bruno plaintiffs at the time the acts occurred, so the acts were not \"committed in the performance of legal services\" and thus did not fall under the literal terms of its policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Its attempts to persuade St. Paul through correspondence having failed, The Home filed the instant action on June 22, 1998. The Home sought a declaration that St. Paul provided coverage as to the Bruno suit concurrently with The Home and was obligated to share costs accordingly. Six months later, The Home settled the Bruno suit. By this point, it had expended nearly $500,000 in defense and settlement of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After settling, The Home moved to amend its complaint to include the allegation that, because St. Paul breached its duty to defend S&amp;E, St. Paul now bears the burden of proving how the Bruno settlement is to be apportioned as between S&amp;E's 1989 acts and its 1995 acts; in particular, St. Paul must show that the settlement was not paid entirely to compensate for S&amp;E's 1995 acts, for which The Home alleges St. Paul is exclusively responsible. Because this is an impossible burden to meet, the allegation continues, St. Paul must pay for the entire Bruno settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Home and St. Paul both moved for summary judgment. The magistrate recommended granting summary judgment to St. Paul. The magistrate ruled, first, that the St. Paul policy does not cover the 1995 acts alleged in the amended Bruno complaint because the acts were not \"committed in the performance of legal services.\" Second, the magistrate ruled that The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause are not mutually repugnant, as contended by The Home; rather, The Home policy provides primary coverage while the St. Paul policy provides excess coverage. Third, having found that St. Paul had no duty to defend S&amp;E, the magistrate denied The Home's motion to amend its complaint on the grounds that the amendment would be futile. The district court affirmed the magistrate's recommended decision in a paragraph order. The effect was to leave The Home with all of the costs of defending and indemnifying S&amp;E in the Bruno suit. The Home now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address the issues raised in the case in the following order: first, whether The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause are mutually repugnant, making the two insurers jointly responsible for defending and indemnifying S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint; second, whether either insurer had a duty to defend or indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint; and third, whether The Home should be granted leave to amend its complaint to demand that St. Paul pay the entire Bruno settlement.

Coverage of 1989 Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this case presents an apparently rare clash between an \"other insurance\" clause from one policy and a \"prior acts\" clause from another, it is in the end just a slight variation on the standard mutual repugnancy case in which two \"other insurance\" clauses conflict with one another. Accordingly, we begin our analysis by discussing the doctrine that applies to the standard case, and then we consider whether the variation presented here requires any deviation from this norm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Other insurance\" clauses limit an insurer's responsibility for a claim if \"other insurance\" is available to cover it. Originally, the clauses appeared in property insurance policies and were intended to eliminate the problem of fraudulent claims induced by over-insuring. See Carriers Ins. Co. v. American Policyholders' Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></span>, 218 (Me. 1979). In a context such as the one here, the clauses function not so much as to deter fraudulent claims as simply to limit an insurer's exposure where the insured happens to hold multiple insurance policies covering the same loss. Cf. id.; see also R. J. Robertson, Jr., \"Other Insurance\" Clauses in Illinois, 20 S. Ill. U. L.J. 403, 405 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Other insurance\" clauses come in three types. The first, an \"escape\" clause, is the most basic: it simply denies any coverage for a claim if other insurance is available. The second, a \"pro rata\" clause, extends coverage to a portion of the total loss claimed, usually based on the limits of the applicable policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The third, an \"excess\" clause, is the type at issue in this case; it extends coverage only to the extent that other available insurance is insufficient to cover the claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Carriers,</span> <span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">218</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Other insurance\" clauses are not necessarily problematic. For example, if a claim is covered by two policies each with pro rata clauses, then the insurers each pay a pro rata share of the claim. Or if one policy contains no \"other insurance\" clause at all while the second contains an excess clause, then the first policy covers the claim and, if the first is insufficient, the second covers the excess. In these scenarios, both policies interact harmoniously and the claim goes wholly insured. But frequently, policies contain \"other insurance\" clauses that are incompatible in the sense that, if each is given full effect, claims covered by both policies will go under-insured. In particular, where two policies each contain excess \"other insurance\" clauses, giving effect to both will leave a claim completely uninsured. For the first policy provides coverage only in excess of the second, but the second provides coverage only in excess of the first; the result is a standoff, in which each insurer refuses to cover the claim before the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to break the tie in such situations, courts early on experimented with various rules for declaring one insurer the \"primary\" insurer and the other the \"excess\" insurer. One such rule was to consider the primary insurer to be the one \"first in time\"; a second rule considered the primary insurer to be the one whose \"other insurance\" clause was more general in scope; a third rule considered the primary insurer to be the one whose policy more specifically covered the claim at issue. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Carriers,</span> <span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">219</span> </span>(collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In time, however, most courts came to reject such rules, favoring instead the doctrine of mutual repugnancy, under which two insurers' excess clauses are thought to cancel each other out, and both insurers are made, in Solomonic fashion, to split the costs of coverage between them pro rata. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></span>, 1124 (1960). The Maine Supreme Judicial Court adopted this approach in <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Carriers,</span> supra</span>. Finding the earlier rules \"arbitrary,\" \"mechanical,\" and tending toward \"semantic microscopy,\" the court chose to \"abandon[] the search for the mythical 'primary' insurer and insist[] instead that both insurers share in the loss.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 219-20. </span>Such an approach, the court explained, not only best carries out the intent of both insurers to limit their exposure, but also discourages insurers from engaging in draftsmanship battles and wasteful litigation in order to avoid providing primary coverage. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential difference between Carriers and this case is that here, the clash of clauses is not between two \"other insurance\" clauses, but rather is between an \"other insurance\" clause and a \"prior acts\" clause containing \"other insurance\" language. Toward the end of The Home policy, in a section labeled \"Conditions,\" which comes after a section labeled \"Coverage,\" The Home's policy contains an \"other insurance\" clause, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Other Insurance:... [T]his insurance shall be in excess of... any other valid and collectible insurance available to the Insured whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, pro rata, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, unless such other insurance is written only as a specific excess insurance over the limits of liability provided in the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, near the middle of St. Paul's policy, under a section labeled \"When This Agreement Covers,\" is St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause, specifying under what conditions St. Paul will cover claims based on acts committed prior to the policy period. It provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior acts. We'll cover claims based on wrongful acts that occurred before the effective date of this agreement, but only if all the following conditions are met:...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any other insurance covering the claim has been used up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that if the \"other insurance\" language of St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause had instead appeared in a catchall \"other insurance\" clause such as the one in The Home policy, the two insurers would be required to share coverage under Carriers. The question, then, is whether it makes any difference that the language appears in the \"prior acts\" clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge held that it does, and that Maine's usual mutual repugnance rule therefore does not apply. The magistrate found only four cases -- none of them from Maine -- bearing precisely on the question, and of these four, three found no mutual repugnance. See Evanston Ins. Co. v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2390787\"><a href=\"/opinion/2390787/evanston-ins-co-v-affiliated-fm-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Following the guidance of this \"meagre but distinct majority,\" the magistrate judge reasoned as follows: The Home's \"other insurance\" clause appears after the coverage section of its policy, whereas the \"other insurance\" language in St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause appears within the coverage section of its policy; consequently, under The Home's policy, coverage for S&amp;E's 1989 acts is initially triggered in the coverage section and only rescinded if the \"other insurance\" clause later kicks in, while under St. Paul's policy, coverage is never triggered in the first place; so, because St. Paul's coverage is never triggered, The Home's \"other insurance\" clause never kicks in, its coverage is never rescinded, and The Home is left as the primary insurer. Put succinctly, the magistrate found that St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause effects \"not a post hac escape clause, but rather an explicit, initial exclusion from coverage,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2390787\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Evanston,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2390787/evanston-ins-co-v-affiliated-fm-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, and, for that reason, it trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think such reasoning turns too much on the sort of \"semantic microscopy\" that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court disfavored in Carriers; to accept it would encourage the very draftsmanship battles and wasteful litigation that the Carriers Court sought to prevent. Simply because The Home's \"other insurance\" clause appears outside a section expressly labeled \"Coverage\" does not mean that coverage is not limited by the provision, or that the provision should be given any less weight than if it appeared inside such a section. Nor is it correct to conceive of St. Paul's policy as \"initially\" excluding coverage, or The Home's policy as initially extending it and only later attempting taking it away, as if one section of an insurance policy were metaphysically prior to another. Under Maine law the coverage provided by an insurance policy is determined by the policy as a whole. \"All parts and clauses, including exceptions and conditions, must be considered together....\" Baybutt Constr. Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></span>, 921 (Me. 1983), overruled on other grounds by Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span> </span>(Me. 1989). Read as a whole, The Home's policy covers claims only on an excess basis if other insurance is available; St. Paul's policy does the same where the claims are based on prior acts. Thus, each policy purports to provide only excess coverage for S&amp;E's 1989 acts if the other policy is available. In such a situation, Carriers demands proration. We do not think Carriers countenances different outcomes depending on whether St. Paul's language was in an \"other insurance\" clause relating to prior acts or in a \"prior acts\" clause relating to other insurance. Such an approach would tend to encourage insurers to jockey for best position in choosing where to locate \"other insurance\" language, needlessly complicating the drafting of policies, inducing wasteful litigation among insurers, and delaying settlements -- all ultimately to the detriment of the insurance-buying public. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1280620\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fremont,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1280620/fremont-indem-v-new-england-reinsurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>; cf. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Carriers,</span> <span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge thought that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court \"would not be so quick to collapse the distinction between the coverage portions of a policy and a catchall 'other insurance' clause.\" For support, it cited the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Royal Globe Insurance Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span> </span>(Me. 1984). There, the Court found no mutual repugnance where one policy contained a catchall \"other insurance\" clause and the other contained a clause making coverage for the insured's employees (but not for the insured itself) available on an excess basis only. Royal <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Globe,</span> <span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">243-44</span></span>. The magistrate judge drew an analogy with the instant case: \"Just as the... insurer in Royal Globe extended coverage in a specific instance (involving employees) only upon exhaustion of other available insurance, St. Paul extends coverage in a specific instance (involving prior acts) only upon such exhaustion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several problems with this analogy. As an initial matter, the analogy does not support the posited thesis -- that St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause because of its location in the coverage portions of St. Paul's policy. Indeed, Royal Globe does not mention the location of the clauses at issue there. Rather, what the analogy seems to suggest is that St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause trumps The Home's \"other insurance\" clause because it applies more specifically to the claim at issue here -- i.e., it applies specifically to claims based on prior acts, whereas The Home's \"other insurance\" clause applies to claims generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that such a conclusion is flatly at odds with Carriers, which explicitly rejected the rule that, as between two \"other insurance\" clauses, the specific trumps the general. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Carriers,</span> <span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">219</span></span>. There is no reason to think that Royal Globe revives this rule. Indeed, Royal Globe is distinguishable from both Carriers and this case in that it involved a conflict not between two excess \"other insurance\" clauses, but rather between an excess clause and a pro rata clause. Courts treat conflicts between two excess clauses differently from conflicts between an excess clause and a pro rata clause: while the majority rule for the former is to apply the doctrine of mutual repugnance, the majority rule for the latter is that the excess clause trumps the pro rata clause. Compare <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></span>, 1124 (1960) (describing majority rule for excess vs. excess cases) with <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></span>, 997 (1982) (describing majority rule for excess vs. pro rata cases); see also <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Robertson,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">414</span></span>, 418. Thus, the more straightforward reading of Royal Globe -- and the reading more compatible with Carriers -- is simply that it adopts the majority rule for conflicts between excess clauses and pro rata clauses. See Royal <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Globe,</span> <span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">244-45</span> </span>(finding pro rata clause not a clear indicator of whether policy is primary or excess, so, by default, policy with pro rata clause is to be considered primary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, St. Paul asks us to consider expert testimony regarding how conflicts between successive insurers, such as the conflict in this case, are settled within the industry. Perhaps in some other setting it might be appropriate to consider such evidence, but we do not think it would be appropriate here. The relevant policy language is unambiguous and the dispute presented can be resolved through ordinary judicial methods of contractual interpretation. See Hanover Ins. Co. v. Crocker, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span>, 930 (Me. 1997) (\"In cases involving the construction of the language of an insurance contract, the meaning of unambiguous language is a question of law.\"). Moreover, the expert testimony presented by St. Paul is ultimately irrelevant. The testimony was that within the insurance industry, if one insurer was on risk at the time an act occurred, and the other was on risk at the time a claim based on the act was made, the former insurer is expected to cover the claim on a primary basis. However, The Home was not on risk at the time the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint occurred. The only reason The Home's policy covers the Bruno claim is that The Home was on risk in 1991, when the first claim against S&amp;E based on the 1989 acts was reported; because the Bruno claim relates back to this claim, The Home's policy provides coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, seeing no reason to consider St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause to trump The Home's \"other insurance\" clause, we find the two clauses mutually repugnant. Accordingly, St. Paul is responsible for a pro rata share of the costs of defending and indemnifying S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Coverage of 1995 Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider whether St. Paul had a duty to defend and indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts -- the breaches of ethical duties --alleged in the amended Bruno complaint. The Home contends that these allegations constitute a separate claim from the allegations based on S&amp;E's 1989 acts, and that The Home is not responsible for this claim because it is based on acts that occurred neither prior to nor during its policy period. Rather, The Home argues, the 1995 acts occurred and the claim based upon them was made during St. Paul's policy period, so St. Paul is exclusively responsible for providing coverage. St. Paul responds, first, that its policy does not cover the 1995 acts because none qualify as \"a negligent act, error, or omission committed in the performance of legal... services,\" and second, that The Home's policy does cover the 1995 acts because they sufficiently relate to the 1989 acts, for which The Home concedes coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two questions to be decided: first, whether either insurer had a duty to defend as to the 1995 acts, and second, whether either insurer had a duty to indemnify.

Maine law favors an expansive view of an insurer's duty to defend; any ambiguity in policy language is to be construed in favor of the insured. See Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v.

St. Paul's primary argument is that the acts occurred after S&amp;E had ceased representing the Bruno plaintiffs, and so the acts cannot be said to have been \"committed in the performance of... legal services,\" as its policy requires.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We think it at least arguable, however, that a lawyer's honoring of his continuing ethical duties, arising as they do out of the attorney-client relationship, is itself a \"legal service\" the lawyer provides to his clients, see Regas v.

We have already concluded that St. Paul had a duty to defend S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts alleged in the Bruno complaint. And under Maine law, if an insurer has a duty to defend against one count of a complaint, it has a derivative duty to defend against other counts if they are sufficiently related that apportioning defense costs as between the two is not practicable. See Gibson v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></span>, 1353 (Me. 1996). This is the majority rule. See Titan Holdings Syndicate, Inc. v. Keene, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538370\"><a href=\"/opinion/538370/titan-holdings-syndicate-inc-v-the-city-of-keene-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 269 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></span>, 436-38 (1980 Supp.) (collecting cases)). In this case, the allegations of the 1995 acts are sufficiently intertwined with the allegations of the 1989 acts so that The Home's defense costs cannot readily be retrospectively apportioned as between the two. The 1995 acts arose out of the same attorney-client relationship and ultimately relate back to the same botched real estate transaction as the 1989 acts; defending against allegations of the former required knowledge of the latter.

Moreover, as discussed below, S&amp;E's defense as to the 1995 acts was merely incidental to its defense as to the 1989 acts. The great bulk of the Bruno suit concerned the 1989 acts; the allegations of the 1995 acts were defended against merely in order to prevent the Bruno plaintiffs from escaping a statute of limitations problem affecting the allegations of the 1989 acts. Given these circumstances, St. Paul had a duty to defend as to the 1995 acts as well as the 1989 acts, regardless of whether the 1995 acts independently fall within its coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, The Home appears to concede that, under <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gibson,</span> supra</span>, it was obliged to defend as to the 1995 acts as well as the 1989 acts. Only with respect to the duty to indemnify as to the 1995 acts does The Home claim that such duty was St. Paul's alone. Thus, given that The Home and St. Paul were both obliged to defend against the 1989 allegations, we hold that both insurers had a derivative duty to defend against the 1995 allegations. St. Paul therefore must share with The Home the costs of defending the entire Bruno suit, not merely the costs of defending against the allegations of the 1989 acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Duty to Indemnify</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the duty to defend, the duty to indemnify is narrower: while the duty to defend depends only on the allegations made against the insured, the duty to indemnify depends upon the facts established at trial and the theory under which judgment is actually entered in the case. Cumberland Cold <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Storage,</span> <span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">250</span></span>. However, the Bruno suit was settled prior to trial, so no facts were ever established nor judgment ever entered in the case. In such a situation, this court has held, the duty to indemnify is determined by the basis for the settlement. See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Waltham Indus. Labs. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528400\"><a href=\"/opinion/528400/travelers-insurance-company-v-waltham-industrial-laboratories-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span>, 1099 (1st Cir. 1989). Accordingly, whether St. Paul or The Home had a duty to indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts turns on whether any portion of the settlement was made in compensation for the 1995 acts, and, if so, whether the 1995 acts fall under either insurer's coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We again avoid answering the latter question, for we think it is clear from the record that the Bruno settlement was made entirely in compensation for the 1989 acts; no significant portion was directed to the 1995 acts. The Bruno complaint, as originally filed, alleged only the 1989 acts; those acts were the raison d'etre for the suit. The complaint was amended to include the 1995 allegations only after S&amp;E moved to dismiss the original complaint on statute of limitations grounds. In its motion to strike the amended Bruno complaint and its subsequent motion for summary judgment in the case, S&amp;E made clear that it considered the added allegations frivolous, in violation of Rule 11, and intended solely as an end run around the statute of limitations. From a correspondence file kept on the case, it appears that the 1995 acts were not even considered by S&amp;E's defense team in analyzing the case's settlement value. Likewise, the Bruno plaintiffs did not consider the allegations of the 1995 acts to carry any significant value relative to the allegations of the 1989 acts. In assessing their damages in a motion for attachment filed in the case, the plaintiffs focused entirely on the damages caused by the 1989 acts; they did not so much as mention the 1995 acts. The same is true of Ralph Bruno's enumeration of his losses in an affidavit he submitted in the case. The only evidence in the record that plaintiff Bruno considered the 1995 acts to have caused any damages appears in his answers to an interrogatory directly posing the question. Bruno stated vaguely that the files that S&amp;E disclosed to others contained embarrassing material and that S&amp;E's failure to turn the files over to him made it harder for his lawyers to conduct the Bruno case, increasing his legal fees. By comparison, the Bruno plaintiffs described in comprehensive detail various tangible losses they suffered as a result of the 1989 acts. According to the plaintiffs, those losses totaled approximately $29 million. The settlement, plus The Home's attorney's fees, totaled about $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus find no genuine issue of material fact concerning the apportionment of the Bruno settlement. Compared to a failed real estate transaction in which the Bruno plaintiffs lost millions, S&amp;E's alleged acts of mischief in the resulting malpractice actions -- the improper handling of a file, the improper taking of a statement, and the improper contacting of a former attorney -- appear entirely inconsequential. It simply cannot be seriously contended -- especially given the circumstances under which the acts were alleged -- that anything more than a de minimis portion of the Bruno settlement could have been intended to compensate for the 1995 acts. Accordingly, we hold that neither The Home nor St. Paul had a duty to indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts, so St. Paul owes The Home nothing for indemnifying as to the 1995 acts. Nonetheless, St. Paul still owes The Home for all of its indemnification costs, because the whole of the Bruno settlement, and so all of The Home's indemnification costs, related to the 1989 acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion to Amend</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address The Home's motion to amend its complaint. The Home moved to amend its complaint after settling the Bruno action, seeking to raise a new theory of liability based on St. Paul's refusal to participate in the settlement. The theory is as follows. Under Maine law -- or so The Home argues -- if an insurer breaches its duty to defend a suit, and the suit settles, then the insurer bears the burden of allocating the settlement and proving that at least some of the settlement was paid for claims that its policy does not cover.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Yet, the argument continues, because the settlement agreement in the Bruno case does not specify how the settlement was intended to be allocated, St. Paul's burden of allocating the settlement is impossible to carry. Consequently, St. Paul cannot prove that the settlement was not paid entirely for the 1995 acts, as to which The Home alleges St. Paul alone had a duty to indemnify. Therefore, supposing The Home is correct that St. Paul alone had a duty to indemnify as to the 1995 acts, it must be assumed that the settlement was paid entirely for those acts, in effect rendering St. Paul responsible for the whole settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate dismissed The Home's motion to amend on futility grounds, because it rejected the premise of The Home's theory that St. Paul had an exclusive duty to indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts. We similarly reject that premise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Obviously, given our holding in the previous section, we disagree with The Home that, merely because the Bruno settlement agreement does not itself describe how the settlement was allocated as between the 1989 acts and 1995 acts, there is no way to prove that the settlement was not paid entirely for the 1995 acts. To the contrary, we think that evidence extrinsic to the settlement agreement shows conclusively that the settlement was paid entirely for the 1989 acts. Accordingly, we reject The Home's proposed theory and do not disturb the magistrate's dismissal of The Home's motion to amend. See Demars v. General Dynamics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462282\"><a href=\"/opinion/462282/john-t-demars-v-general-dynamics-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 99 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly summarize our holding. First, we find The Home's \"other insurance\" clause and St. Paul's \"prior acts\" clause to be mutually repugnant; consequently, both insurers had a duty to defend and indemnify S&amp;E as to the 1989 acts. Second, we find that both insurers had a derivative duty to defend S&amp;E as to the 1995 acts; by contrast, we find that neither insurer had a duty to indemnify as to the 1995 acts, but only because no portion of the Bruno settlement was allocated to those acts. The effect is that St. Paul is obligated to reimburse The Home for a pro rata share of all of its defense and indemnification costs. To that extent, summary judgment should be granted to The Home. We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  At the time when the events underlying this case began, S&amp;E was known as Smith, Elliott, Smith &amp; Garmey.

St. Paul's policy is not of this sort; there is no dispute that, if The Home policy did not exist, St. Paul's policy would provide coverage as to S&amp;E's 1989 acts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  The magistrate judge agreed with St. Paul that the 1995 acts were not \"committed in the performance of legal... services.\" Rather, he found, the acts were committed in the course of S&amp;E's conduct as a defendant in a malpractice case.

We note first that this provision would excuse only one of the 1995 acts -- S&amp;E's disclosure of the Bruno's files to others. Second, it was possible that the Bruno plaintiffs could have proven at trial that this disclosure was not reasonably necessary to S&amp;E's malpractice defense and so was wrongful notwithstanding Rule 3.6(h)(3). St. Paul further objects that the 1995 acts were all intentional in nature, and so do not fall under the scope of its coverage, which is for loss resulting from a \"negligent act, error, or omission.\" But, given Maine's policy of resolving ambiguities in favor of the insured, we do not think this language should be read so narrowly.
