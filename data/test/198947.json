After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm.\n\n              It appears that appellant, John French (“French”),\n\nhas disavowed the main argument he made below: that the\n\nterms    in     the   referenced     consulting       contracts   were\n\nunenforceable against him because they were not attached to\n\nthe written contract he signed.           To the extent French has\n\ndisavowed      that   argument,     he   has    waived   any   further\n\nopportunity to challenge the district court’s ruling on this\n\npoint.   See Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 990 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).   Even if his argument is not waived, it is meritless,\n\nfor the reasons stated in the district court’s opinion dated\n\nFebruary 9, 1999.         French’s fraud claim also is meritless,\n\nfor the reasons stated in the district court’s opinion.\n\nFrench’s remaining arguments are forfeited, as they are\n\nraised for the first time on appeal.           Id.   Appellant may not\n\nexcuse his omissions by blaming them on his former attorney;\n\nparties are bound by the actions of their attorneys, and\n\n“[a]ny other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our\n\nsystem of representative litigation.”           See Scola v. Beaulieu\n\nWielsbeke, 131 F.3d 1073, 1075 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              Affirmed.     1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\f",
