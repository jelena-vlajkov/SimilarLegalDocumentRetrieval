Defendants Edward\n\nKooyomjian and John DiCicco appeal a summary judgment in favor of the\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the receiver of Eastland\n\nSavings Bank (Eastland). The district court had jurisdiction under 12\n\nU.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(B) and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                         FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          In 1987, Kooyomjian took out a construction loan of some $3\n\nmillion from Eastland to develop a condominium complex (the Project) in\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts. Kooyomjian signed a promissory note (the\n\nNote), which DiCicco personally guaranteed (the Guaranty). The Note\n\nwas secured by a first mortgage on the Project. Kooyomjian ultimately\n\ndefaulted on the loan, and Eastland instituted this action in\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court in October 1989 to enforce the Note and\n\nthe Guaranty and to foreclose on the mortgage. Defendants answered and\n\nasserted a counterclaim for damages, alleging: (1) breach of contract\n\n(Counts I and II) based on Eastland's alleged failure to honor oral\n\npromises to offer favorable end-loan financing to prospective buyers of\n\nunits in the Project; (2) negligent misrepresentation (Count III); and\n\n(3) negligence (Count IV) based on Eastland's alleged mismanagement of\n\nthe Project after Kooyomjian defaulted on the loan.\n\n          FDIC was appointed the receiver for Eastland in December\n\n1992. By then, Eastland had obtained on account of the deficiency on\n\nthe Note: (1) a judgment against DiCicco for some $1.3 million on the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fGuaranty; and (2) an allowance of its claim of some $1.1 million in\n\nKooyomjian's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.1 Defendants' counterclaims were\n\nstill pending. On the same day it was appointed receiver, FDIC entered\n\ninto an Insured Deposit Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the P & A\n\nAgreement) with Fleet National Bank (Fleet), assigning to Fleet most of\n\nEastland's assets, including the Loan, while retaining most of\n\nEastland's non-deposit-related liabilities, including defendants'\n\ncounterclaim against Eastland. In March 1993, FDIC removed the action\n\nto the district court.\n\n          In February 1995, FDIC moved for summary judgment on the\n\ncounterclaim. The district court granted defendants leave to amend\n\ntheir counterclaim for the limited purpose of showing that the breach\n\nof contract and negligent misrepresentation claims related to an\n\nagreement separate from the Loan, avoiding the bar of D'Oench, Duhme &\n\nCo., Inc. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942), and 12 U.S.C. § 1823(e).2 The\n\namended counterclaim realleged those claims as Counts I and II and\n\nrenumbered the negligence claim as Count III. It also asserted two new\n\ncounts: infliction of emotional distress (Count IV) and violation of\n\n\n1 For ease of reference, the allowance of the claim against Kooyomjian\nand the judgment against DiCicco are referred to as the Loan.\n2 12 U.S.C. § 1823(e) provides, in pertinent part: \"No agreement which\ntends to diminish or defeat the interest of [FDIC] in any asset\nacquired by it . . . as receiver of any insured depository institution,\nshall be valid against [FDIC] unless such agreement--(1) is in writing\n. . . and (4) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution,\nan official record of the depository institution.\"\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMassachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A (Count V). On August 12, 1996,\n\nthe district court determined that the amended counterclaim did not\n\ncure the § 1823(e) defect and granted partial summary judgment on\n\nCounts I and II. The court struck Counts IV and V as exceeding the\n\nscope of the leave to amend. Thus, only Count III, the negligence\n\nclaim, remained.\n\n          In October 1997, FDIC determined that the claims of\n\nEastland's unsecured creditors could not be satisfied out of Eastland's\n\nreceivership assets and were therefore worthless. See 62 Fed. Reg.\n\n58,732 (1997). Because defendants would be unsecured creditors if they\n\nwere to prevail on the negligence claim, FDIC       moved for summary\n\njudgment on Count III on prudential mootness grounds. In response,\n\ndefendants contended for the first time that Count III sought to reduce\n\ntheir liability on the Loan under the doctrine of recoupment. The\n\ncourt denied FDIC's motion in May 1998.\n\n          FDIC then confirmed to the court that the Loan had been sold\n\nto Fleet pursuant to the P & A Agreement and filed a renewed motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that recoupment was not an available\n\nremedy. On June 16, 1999, the district court granted FDIC's motion,\n\nholding that recoupment was unavailable because FDIC had sold the asset\n\nagainst which recoupment was sought and that in light of FDIC's\n\nworthlessness determination the claim, even if otherwise successful,\n\nwas barred by the doctrine of prudential mootness.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          On appeal, defendants contend that the district court erred\n\nin granting summary judgment on their negligence claim because, under\n\nthe terms of the P & A Agreement, their liability on the Loan was never\n\ntransferred to Fleet. Additionally, they argue that the district court\n\nerred by: (1) denying their Rule 56(f) request to conduct additional\n\ndiscovery; (2) dismissing counts I and II of the amended counterclaim;\n\n(3) striking Counts IV and V of the amended counterclaim; (4) failing\n\nto strike FDIC's fourth successive motion for summary judgment; and (5)\n\ndenying their motion for attorney's fees.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.   THE NEGLIGENCE CLAIM\n\n          A.   Standard of Review\n\n          We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving defendants and resolving all reasonable inferences in their\n\nfavor. See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d\n\n178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          B.   Recoupment\n\n          Defendants' negligence claim alleged that after it took\n\npossession of the property, Eastland negligently managed the Project,\n\nimpeding sales of condominium units and thereby increasing their\n\nliability on the Loan. The district court concluded that recoupment\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fwas not available because FDIC no longer owned the Loan against which\n\nrecoupment was sought.\n\n          Recoupment \"allows a defendant to 'defend' against a claim\n\nby asserting--up to the amount of the claim--the defendant's own claim\n\nagainst the plaintiff growing out of the same transaction.\" Bolduc v.\n\nBeal Bank, SSB, 167 F.3d 667, 672 (1st Cir. 1999). \"[B]oth the primary\n\ndamage claim and the claim in recoupment must arise out of the same\n\ntransaction and involve the same litigants.\" Id. n.4, citing 6 Wright,\n\nMiller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1401 (2d ed. 1990).\n\nThus, if FDIC no longer holds the primary damage claim, i.e., the Loan,\n\ndefendants' recoupment argument fails. See Nashville Lodging Co. v.\n\nResolution Trust Corp., 59 F.3d 236, 247 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (rejecting\n\nrecoupment claim against receiver where receiver had sold asset against\n\nwhich recoupment was sought).\n\n          Defendants do not dispute that the P & A Agreement\n\ntransferred to Fleet FDIC's interest in \"loans\" as defined in the P &\n\nA Agreement. But they contend that the Loan fell within an exception\n\nfor loans that were \"in-substance foreclosure status.\" To qualify\n\nunder that exception, the Loan had to be one \"the proceeds for\n\nrepayment [of which] can be expected to come only from the operation or\n\nsale of the collateral.\" The district judge found, and we agree, that\n\nthe exception did not apply; because the collateral for the Loan (the\n\nProject) had been sold at foreclosure two years before Eastland failed,\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fat the time of the P & A Agreement repayment could not be expected to\n\ncome from the sale of the collateral.\n\n          Defendants argue for the first time on appeal that even if\n\nthe Loan was assigned to Fleet, FDIC retained an interest in it because\n\nthe P & A Agreement provided that FDIC was entitled to a share of the\n\nnet recovery of certain assets assigned to Fleet.       We decline to\n\nconsider this argument. It is a \"bedrock rule of appellate practice\n\nthat . . . matters not raised in the trial court cannot be hawked for\n\nthe first time on appeal.\" Malave v. Carney Hosp., 170 F.3d 217, 222\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Finally, defendants assert that FDIC should be estopped from\n\narguing that the Loan was assigned to Fleet because in its March 1993\n\nnotice of removal of this action FDIC stated:\n\n            The claim asserted herein by Eastland is an\n          asset formerly of Eastland retained by the FDIC\n          as Receiver. The FDIC as Receiver is, therefore,\n          the real party in interest to this civil action,\n          having succeeded thereto by operation of law, and\n          it has filed herewith a motion to be substituted\n          for Eastland in this action.\n\nDefendants do not claim that they were misled by this statement or that\n\nthey somehow relied on it to their detriment. See Law v. Ernst &\n\nYoung, 956 F.2d 364, 368 (1st Cir. 1992). Indeed, throughout this\n\nlitigation defendants contended that FDIC had no interest in the Loan.\n\nAccordingly, we reject this argument as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          We affirm the district court's determination that the Loan\n\nwas assigned to Fleet. Because the primary claim and the recoupment\n\nclaim do not involve the same parties, recoupment was not available.\n\nSee Bolduc, 167 F.3d at 672 n.4; Nashville Lodging, 59 F.3d at 247.\n\n          C.   Mootness\n\n          The district court further held that the doctrine of\n\nprudential mootness bars defendants' claim. Under Article III of the\n\nUnited States Constitution, federal courts have jurisdiction to decide\n\nonly actual cases or controversies. See U.S. Const. art. III. To\n\nsatisfy the case or controversy requirement, the counterclaimants \"must\n\nhave suffered some actual injury that can be redressed by a favorable\n\njudicial decision.\" Iron Arrow Honor Soc'y v. Heckler, 464 U.S. 67, 70\n\n(1983) (emphasis added). The FDIC's worthlessness determination is\n\nunchallenged and, in the absence of a recoupment remedy, precludes any\n\nrelief for defendants even it they were successful on their negligence\n\nclaim and obtained a favorable judgment. The district court therefore\n\nproperly granted summary judgment on the negligence claim. See Adams\n\nv. Resolution Trust Corp., 927 F.2d 348, 354 (8th Cir. 1991); 281-300\n\nJoint Venture v. Onion, 938 F.2d 35, 38 (5th        Cir. 1991).\n\nII.   OTHER ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n          A.   Denial of Defendants' Rule 56(f) Motion\n\n          The district court denied defendants' Rule 56(f) request to\n\nconduct additional discovery into the ownership of the Loan after FDIC\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fproduced the P & A Agreement. We review the district court's denial of\n\na Rule 56(f) request for abuse of discretion. See Morrissey v. Boston\n\nFive Cents Sav. Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          Prior to making their Rule 56(f) request, defendants had\n\nobtained the P & A Agreement, which established that the Loan was\n\nassigned to Fleet. They had received FDIC's written responses to their\n\ninterrogatories about the assignment provisions of the P & A Agreement.\n\nFDIC produced affidavits from responsible officers at FDIC and Fleet\n\nexplaining the assignment of the Loan to Fleet. Defendants have not\n\nshown that additional discovery would have aided their claim. The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying a Rule 56(f)\n\nrequest that would have further delayed a nine year old case on a\n\nmatter that would not have benefitted from additional discovery.\n\n          B.   Dismissal of Counts I and II\n\n          Defendants next argue that the district court erred in\n\nrelying on D'Oench to grant summary judgment on Counts I and II. This\n\nargument is without merit. The court expressly declined to decide\n\nwhether Counts I and II were barred by D'Oench, holding instead that\n\nthey were barred by 12 U.S.C. § 1283(e).\n\n          C.   Striking of Counts IV and IV\n\n          Defendants challenge the district court's striking of Counts\n\nIV and V of their amended counterclaim, in effect denying them leave to\n\nadd those counts. We review a denial of leave to amend for abuse of\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdiscretion. See Cigna Fire Underwriters Co. v. MacDonald & Johnson,\n\nInc., 86 F.3d 1260, 1268 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          After FDIC had answered the original counterclaim, the\n\ndistrict court granted defendants leave to amend for the limited\n\npurpose of showing that Counts I-III were not barred by the D'Oench\n\ndoctrine or 12 U.S.C. § 1823(e). However, in addition to clarifying\n\nCounts I-III, the amended counterclaim added two new theories of\n\nrecovery, Count IV (infliction of emotional distress) and Count V\n\n(violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A). In the absence\n\nof leave of court or FDIC's consent, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), those\n\ncounts were properly struck. The district court invited defendants to\n\nseek leave to assert additional nonfutile claims but they did not avail\n\nthemselves of the opportunity. The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by striking Counts IV and V.\n\n          D.   FDIC's Fourth Summary Judgment Motion\n\n          Defendants contend that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying their motion to strike FDIC's fourth motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the second motion directed at Count III of the\n\namended counterclaim. We review the denial of such a motion for abuse\n\nof discretion. See, e.g., A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v. American Trading\n\nand Prod. Corp., 202 F.3d 469, 472 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000) (trial judge's\n\ncase management decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          The tortuous history of these proceedings helps explain the\n\ncourse of these motions.    FDIC filed its first motion for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction because defendants had not filed the\n\nrequisite claims. The district court allowed defendants to establish\n\njurisdiction by exhausting the claims procedure and denied the motion.\n\nNext, FDIC moved for summary judgment on the basis of 12 U.S.C. §\n\n1823(e). Because Counts I and II were clearly barred, those counts\n\nwere dismissed, leaving only Count III.\n\n          After the FDIC made its worthlessness determination, it moved\n\nfor summary judgment on Count III. In response, defendants first\n\nasserted their recoupment theory. The district court initially denied\n\nthe motion on that ground but after further proceedings and a renewed\n\nmotion for summary judgment changed its ruling and granted the motion.\n\n          Each of FDIC's motions reflected material changes in the\n\nposture of this litigation and was grounded on meritorious contentions.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion when it entertained\n\nFDIC's final motion for summary judgment.\n\n          E.   Denial of Attorney's Fees\n\n          We review the district court's denial of defendants' petition\n\nfor attorney's fees for abuse of discretion. See Maynard v. CIA, 986\n\nF.2d 547, 567 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Defendants claim to be entitled to attorney's fees on the\n\nground that FDIC's \"successive summary judgment motions, asserting new\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fgrounds after prior arguments fail, caused [them] unnecessary burden\n\nand expense.\" As previously shown, however, each motion was properly\n\ngrounded and reflected a material change of circumstances. Moreover,\n\ndefendants have not shown how FDIC's belated disclosure of the\n\nassignment of the Loan increased the burden or expense on defendants.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request\n\nfor fees.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f",

FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942), and  12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The amended counterclaim realleged those claims as Counts I and II and  renumbered the negligence claim as Count III.  It also asserted two new counts:  infliction of  emotional distress (Count IV) and violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A (Count  V).  On August 12, 1996, the district court determined that the amended counterclaim did not cure  the &#167; 1823(e) defect and granted partial summary judgment on Counts I and II.  The court struck  Counts IV and V as exceeding the scope of the leave to amend.  Thus, only Count III, the negligence  claim, remained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1997, FDIC determined that the claims of Eastland's unsecured creditors  could not be satisfied out of Eastland's receivership assets and were therefore worthless.  See 62 Fed.  Reg. 58,732 (1997).  Because defendants would be unsecured creditors if they were to prevail on the  negligence claim, FDIC  moved for summary judgment on Count III on prudential mootness grounds. In response, defendants contended for the first time that Count III sought to reduce their liability on  the Loan under the doctrine of recoupment.  The court denied FDIC's motion in May 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FDIC then confirmed to the court that the Loan had been sold to Fleet pursuant to the  P &amp; A Agreement and filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on the ground that recoupment  was not an available remedy.  On June 16, 1999, the district court granted FDIC's motion, holding  that recoupment was unavailable because FDIC had sold the asset against which recoupment was  sought and that in light of FDIC's worthlessness determination the claim, even if otherwise successful,  was barred by the doctrine of prudential mootness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants contend that the district court erred in granting summary  judgment on their negligence claim because, under the terms of the P &amp; A Agreement, their liability  on the Loan was never transferred to Fleet.  Additionally, they argue that the district court erred by: (1) denying their Rule 56(f) request to conduct additional discovery; (2) dismissing counts I and II  of the amended counterclaim; (3) striking Counts IV and V of the amended counterclaim; (4) failing  to strike FDIC's fourth successive motion for summary judgment; and (5) denying their motion for  attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  THE NEGLIGENCE CLAIM</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the  record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving defendants and resolving all reasonable inferences  in their favor.  See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.  1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Recoupment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' negligence claim alleged that after it took possession of the property,  Eastland negligently managed the Project, impeding sales of condominium units and thereby  increasing their liability on the Loan.  The district court concluded that recoupment was not available  because FDIC no longer owned the Loan against which recoupment was sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recoupment \"allows a defendant to 'defend' against a claim by asserting--up to the  amount of the claim--the defendant's own claim against the plaintiff growing out of the same  transaction.\"  Bolduc v. Beal Bank, SSB, 167 F.3d 667, 672 (1st Cir. 1999).  \"[B]oth the primary  damage claim and the claim in recoupment must arise out of the same transaction and involve the  same litigants.\"  Id. n.4, citing 6 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1401 (2d  ed. 1990).  Thus, if FDIC no longer holds the primary damage claim, i.e., the Loan, defendants'  recoupment argument fails.  See Nashville Lodging Co. v.  Resolution Trust Corp., 59 F.3d 236, 247  (D.C. Cir. 1995) (rejecting recoupment claim against receiver where receiver had sold asset against  which recoupment was sought).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants do not dispute that the P &amp; A Agreement transferred to Fleet FDIC's  interest in \"loans\" as defined in the P &amp; A Agreement.  But they contend that the Loan fell within an  exception for loans that were \"in-substance foreclosure status.\"  To qualify under that exception, the  Loan had to be one \"the proceeds for repayment [of which] can be expected to come only from the  operation or sale of the collateral.\"  The district judge found, and we agree, that the exception did not  apply; because the collateral for the Loan (the Project) had been sold at foreclosure two years before  Eastland failed, at the time of the P &amp; A Agreement repayment could not be expected to come from  the sale of the collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue for the first time on appeal that even if the Loan was assigned to  Fleet, FDIC retained an interest in it because the P &amp; A Agreement provided that FDIC was entitled  to a share of the net recovery of certain assets assigned to Fleet.  We decline to consider this  argument.  It is a \"bedrock rule of appellate practice that . . . matters not raised in the trial court  cannot be hawked for the first time on appeal.\"  Malave v. Carney Hosp., 170 F.3d 217, 222 (1st Cir.  1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendants assert that FDIC should be estopped from arguing that the Loan  was assigned to Fleet because in its March 1993 notice of removal of this action FDIC stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim asserted herein by Eastland is an asset formerly of  Eastland retained by the FDIC as Receiver.  The FDIC as Receiver is,  therefore, the real party in interest to this civil action, having  succeeded thereto by operation of law, and it has filed herewith a  motion to be substituted for Eastland in this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants do not claim that they were misled by this statement or that they somehow relied on it  to their detriment.  See Law v.  Ernst &amp; Young, 956 F.2d 364, 368 (1st Cir. 1992).  Indeed,  throughout this litigation defendants contended that FDIC had no interest in the Loan.  Accordingly,  we reject this argument as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's determination that the Loan was assigned to Fleet. Because the primary claim and the recoupment claim do not involve the same parties, recoupment  was not available.  See Bolduc, 167 F.3d at 672 n.4; Nashville Lodging, 59 F.3d at 247.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further held that the doctrine of prudential mootness bars defendants'  claim.  Under Article III of the United States Constitution, federal courts have jurisdiction to decide  only actual cases or controversies.  See U.S. Const. art. III.  To satisfy the case or controversy  requirement, the counterclaimants \"must have suffered some actual injury that can be redressed by  a favorable judicial decision.\"  Iron Arrow Honor Soc'y v. Heckler, 464 U.S. 67, 70 (1983) (emphasis  added).  The FDIC's worthlessness determination is unchallenged and, in the absence of a recoupment  remedy, precludes any relief for defendants even it they were successful on their negligence claim and  obtained a favorable judgment.  The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment on  the negligence claim.  See Adams v.  Resolution Trust Corp., 927 F.2d 348, 354 (8th Cir. 1991); 281-300 Joint Venture v. Onion, 938 F.2d 35, 38 (5th  Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  OTHER ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Denial of Defendants' Rule 56(f) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied defendants' Rule 56(f) request to conduct additional  discovery into the ownership of the Loan after FDIC produced the P &amp; A Agreement.  We review  the district court's denial of a Rule 56(f) request for abuse of discretion.  See Morrissey v. Boston  Five Cents Sav. Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to making their Rule 56(f) request, defendants had obtained the P &amp; A  Agreement, which established that the Loan was assigned to Fleet.  They had received FDIC's written  responses to their interrogatories about the assignment provisions of the P &amp; A Agreement.  FDIC  produced affidavits from responsible officers at FDIC and Fleet explaining the assignment of the Loan  to Fleet.  Defendants have not shown that additional discovery would have aided their claim.  The  district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a Rule 56(f) request that would have further  delayed a nine year old case on a matter that would not have benefitted from additional discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Dismissal of Counts I and II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next argue that the district court erred in relying on D'Oench to grant  summary judgment on Counts I and II.  This argument is without merit.  The court expressly declined  to decide whether Counts I and II were barred by D'Oench, holding instead that they were barred by  12 U.S.C. &#167; 1283(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Striking of Counts IV and IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge the district court's striking of  Counts IV and V of their amended  counterclaim, in effect denying them leave to add those counts.  We review a denial of leave to amend  for abuse of discretion.  See Cigna Fire Underwriters Co. v.  MacDonald &amp; Johnson, Inc., 86 F.3d  1260, 1268 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After FDIC had answered the original counterclaim, the district court granted  defendants leave to amend for the limited purpose of showing that Counts I-III were not barred by  the D'Oench doctrine or 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).  However, in addition to clarifying Counts I-III, the  amended counterclaim added two new theories of recovery, Count IV (infliction of emotional  distress) and Count V (violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A).  In the absence of  leave of court or FDIC's consent, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), those counts were properly struck.  The  district court invited defendants to seek leave to assert additional nonfutile claims but they did not  avail themselves of the opportunity.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by striking Counts  IV and V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.  FDIC's Fourth Summary Judgment Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion  to strike FDIC's fourth motion for summary judgment, the second motion directed at Count III of the  amended counterclaim.  We review the denial of such a motion for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v.  American Trading and Prod. Corp., 202 F.3d 469, 472 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000)  (trial judge's case management decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tortuous history of these proceedings helps explain the course of these motions. FDIC filed its first motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because defendants had not filed the  requisite claims.  The district court allowed defendants to establish jurisdiction by exhausting the  claims procedure and denied the motion.  Next, FDIC moved for summary judgment on the basis of  12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).  Because Counts I and II were clearly barred, those counts were dismissed,  leaving only Count III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the FDIC made its worthlessness determination, it moved for summary judgment  on Count III.  In response, defendants first asserted their recoupment theory.  The district court  initially denied the motion on that ground but after further proceedings and a renewed motion for  summary judgment changed its ruling and granted the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of FDIC's motions reflected material changes in the posture of this litigation and  was grounded on meritorious contentions.  The district court did not abuse its discretion when it  entertained FDIC's final motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.  Denial of Attorney's Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of defendants' petition for attorney's fees for  abuse of discretion.  See Maynard v. CIA, 986 F.2d 547, 567 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants claim to be entitled to attorney's fees on the ground that FDIC's  \"successive summary judgment motions, asserting new grounds after prior arguments fail, caused  [them] unnecessary burden and expense.\"  As previously shown, however, each motion was properly  grounded and reflected a material change of circumstances.  Moreover, defendants have not shown  how FDIC's belated disclosure of the assignment of the Loan increased the burden or expense on  defendants.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>   Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   For ease of reference, the allowance of the claim against Kooyomjian and the judgment against  DiCicco are referred to as the Loan.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e) provides, in pertinent part:  \"No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat  the interest of [FDIC] in any asset acquired by it . . . as receiver of any insured depository institution,  shall be valid against [FDIC] unless such agreement--(1) is in writing . . . and (4) has been,  continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court had jurisdiction under 12 U.S.C.  &#167; 1819(b)(2)(B) and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Kooyomjian took out a construction loan of some $3 million from Eastland  to develop a condominium complex (the Project) in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Kooyomjian signed  a promissory note (the Note), which DiCicco personally guaranteed (the Guaranty).  The Note was  secured by a first mortgage on the Project.  Kooyomjian ultimately defaulted on the loan, and  Eastland instituted this action in Massachusetts Superior Court in October 1989 to enforce the Note  and the Guaranty and to foreclose on the mortgage.  Defendants answered and asserted a  counterclaim for damages, alleging:  (1) breach of contract (Counts I and II) based on Eastland's  alleged failure to honor oral promises to offer favorable end-loan financing to prospective buyers of  units in the Project; (2) negligent misrepresentation (Count III); and (3) negligence (Count IV) based  on Eastland's alleged mismanagement of the Project after Kooyomjian defaulted on the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FDIC was appointed the receiver for Eastland in December 1992.  By then, Eastland  had obtained on account of the deficiency on the Note:  (1) a judgment against DiCicco for some $1.3  million on the Guaranty; and (2) an allowance of its  claim of some $1.1 million in Kooyomjian's  Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Defendants'counterclaims were still pending.  On the same day it was  appointed receiver, FDIC entered into an Insured Deposit Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the  P &amp; A Agreement) with Fleet National Bank (Fleet), assigning to Fleet most of Eastland's assets,  including the Loan, while retaining most of Eastland's non-deposit-related liabilities, including  defendants' counterclaim against Eastland.  In March 1993, FDIC removed the action to the district  court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1995, FDIC moved for summary judgment on the counterclaim.  The  district court granted defendants leave to amend their counterclaim for the limited purpose of showing  that the breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation claims related to an agreement separate  from the Loan, avoiding the bar of D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co., Inc. v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103624\"><a href=\"/opinion/103624/doench-duhme-co-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span> </a></span>(1942), and  12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The amended counterclaim realleged those claims as Counts I and II and  renumbered the negligence claim as Count III.  It also asserted two new counts:  infliction of  emotional distress (Count IV) and violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A (Count  V).  On August 12, 1996, the district court determined that the amended counterclaim did not cure  the &#167; 1823(e) defect and granted partial summary judgment on Counts I and II.  The court struck  Counts IV and V as exceeding the scope of the leave to amend.  Thus, only Count III, the negligence  claim, remained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1997, FDIC determined that the claims of Eastland's unsecured creditors  could not be satisfied out of Eastland's receivership assets and were therefore worthless.  See 62 Fed.  Reg. 58,732 (1997).  Because defendants would be unsecured creditors if they were to prevail on the  negligence claim, FDIC  moved for summary judgment on Count III on prudential mootness grounds. In response, defendants contended for the first time that Count III sought to reduce their liability on  the Loan under the doctrine of recoupment.  The court denied FDIC's motion in May 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FDIC then confirmed to the court that the Loan had been sold to Fleet pursuant to the  P &amp; A Agreement and filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on the ground that recoupment  was not an available remedy.  On June 16, 1999, the district court granted FDIC's motion, holding  that recoupment was unavailable because FDIC had sold the asset against which recoupment was  sought and that in light of FDIC's worthlessness determination the claim, even if otherwise successful,  was barred by the doctrine of prudential mootness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants contend that the district court erred in granting summary  judgment on their negligence claim because, under the terms of the P &amp; A Agreement, their liability  on the Loan was never transferred to Fleet.  Additionally, they argue that the district court erred by: (1) denying their Rule 56(f) request to conduct additional discovery; (2) dismissing counts I and II  of the amended counterclaim; (3) striking Counts IV and V of the amended counterclaim; (4) failing  to strike FDIC's fourth successive motion for summary judgment; and (5) denying their motion for  attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

The district court concluded that recoupment was not available  because FDIC no longer owned the Loan against which recoupment was sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recoupment \"allows a defendant to 'defend' against a claim by asserting--up to the  amount of the claim--the defendant's own claim against the plaintiff growing out of the same  transaction.\"  Bolduc v.

Thus, if FDIC no longer holds the primary damage claim, i.e., the Loan, defendants'  recoupment argument fails.  See Nashville Lodging Co. v.  Resolution Trust Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699199\"><a href=\"/opinion/699199/nashville-lodging-co-v-resolution-trust-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 247  (D.C. Cir. 1995) (rejecting recoupment claim against receiver where receiver had sold asset against  which recoupment was sought).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants do not dispute that the P &amp; A Agreement transferred to Fleet FDIC's  interest in \"loans\" as defined in the P &amp; A Agreement.  But they contend that the Loan fell within an  exception for loans that were \"in-substance foreclosure status.\"  To qualify under that exception, the  Loan had to be one \"the proceeds for repayment [of which] can be expected to come only from the  operation or sale of the collateral.\"  The district judge found, and we agree, that the exception did not  apply; because the collateral for the Loan (the Project) had been sold at foreclosure two years before  Eastland failed, at the time of the P &amp; A Agreement repayment could not be expected to come from  the sale of the collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue for the first time on appeal that even if the Loan was assigned to  Fleet, FDIC retained an interest in it because the P &amp; A Agreement provided that FDIC was entitled  to a share of the net recovery of certain assets assigned to Fleet.  We decline to consider this  argument.  It is a \"bedrock rule of appellate practice that . . . matters not raised in the trial court  cannot be hawked for the first time on appeal.\"  Malave v. Carney Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198366\"><a href=\"/opinion/198366/malave-v-carney-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.  1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendants assert that FDIC should be estopped from arguing that the Loan  was assigned to Fleet because in its March 1993 notice of removal of this action FDIC stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim asserted herein by Eastland is an asset formerly of  Eastland retained by the FDIC as Receiver.  The FDIC as Receiver is,  therefore, the real party in interest to this civil action, having  succeeded thereto by operation of law, and it has filed herewith a  motion to be substituted for Eastland in this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants do not claim that they were misled by this statement or that they somehow relied on it  to their detriment.  See Law v.

Indeed,  throughout this litigation defendants contended that FDIC had no interest in the Loan.  Accordingly,  we reject this argument as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's determination that the Loan was assigned to Fleet. Because the primary claim and the recoupment claim do not involve the same parties, recoupment  was not available.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198299\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bolduc,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198299/bolduc-v-beal-bank-ssb/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">672</span> </a></span>n.4; Nashville <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699199\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lodging,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/699199/nashville-lodging-co-v-resolution-trust-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further held that the doctrine of prudential mootness bars defendants'  claim.  Under Article III of the United States Constitution, federal courts have jurisdiction to decide  only actual cases or controversies.  See U.S. Const. art. III.  To satisfy the case or controversy  requirement, the counterclaimants \"must have suffered some actual injury that can be redressed by  a favorable judicial decision.\"  Iron Arrow Honor Soc'y v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111047\"><a href=\"/opinion/111047/iron-arrow-honor-soc-v-heckler/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 70 (1983) (emphasis  added).  The FDIC's worthlessness determination is unchallenged and, in the absence of a recoupment  remedy, precludes any relief for defendants even it they were successful on their negligence claim and  obtained a favorable judgment.  The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment on  the negligence claim.  See Adams v.  Resolution Trust Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556704\"><a href=\"/opinion/556704/stephen-adams-v-resolution-trust-corporation-as-receiver-for-midwest/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 354 (8th Cir. 1991); 281-300 Joint Venture v.

OTHER ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Denial of Defendants' Rule 56(f) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied defendants' Rule 56(f) request to conduct additional  discovery into the ownership of the Loan after FDIC produced the P &amp; A Agreement.  We review  the district court's denial of a Rule 56(f) request for abuse of discretion.  See Morrissey v. Boston  Five Cents Sav. Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695511\"><a href=\"/opinion/695511/67-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1338-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43547-19/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to making their Rule 56(f) request, defendants had obtained the P &amp; A  Agreement, which established that the Loan was assigned to Fleet.  They had received FDIC's written  responses to their interrogatories about the assignment provisions of the P &amp; A Agreement.  FDIC  produced affidavits from responsible officers at FDIC and Fleet explaining the assignment of the Loan  to Fleet.  Defendants have not shown that additional discovery would have aided their claim.  The  district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a Rule 56(f) request that would have further  delayed a nine year old case on a matter that would not have benefitted from additional discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Dismissal of Counts I and II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next argue that the district court erred in relying on D'Oench to grant  summary judgment on Counts I and II.  This argument is without merit.  The court expressly declined  to decide whether Counts I and II were barred by D'Oench, holding instead that they were barred by  12 U.S.C. &#167; 1283(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Striking of Counts IV and IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge the district court's striking of  Counts IV and V of their amended  counterclaim, in effect denying them leave to add those counts.  We review a denial of leave to amend  for abuse of discretion.  See Cigna Fire Underwriters Co. v.  MacDonald &amp; Johnson, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196843\"><a href=\"/opinion/196843/cigna-fire-insurance-v-macdonald-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1260</span></a></span>, 1268 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After FDIC had answered the original counterclaim, the district court granted  defendants leave to amend for the limited purpose of showing that Counts I-III were not barred by  the D'Oench doctrine or 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).  However, in addition to clarifying Counts I-III, the  amended counterclaim added two new theories of recovery, Count IV (infliction of emotional  distress) and Count V (violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A).  In the absence of  leave of court or FDIC's consent, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), those counts were properly struck.  The  district court invited defendants to seek leave to assert additional nonfutile claims but they did not  avail themselves of the opportunity.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by striking Counts  IV and V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.  FDIC's Fourth Summary Judgment Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion  to strike FDIC's fourth motion for summary judgment, the second motion directed at Count III of the  amended counterclaim.  We review the denial of such a motion for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v.  American Trading and Prod. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198810\"><a href=\"/opinion/198810/capens-v-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 472 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000)  (trial judge's case management decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tortuous history of these proceedings helps explain the course of these motions. FDIC filed its first motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because defendants had not filed the  requisite claims.  The district court allowed defendants to establish jurisdiction by exhausting the  claims procedure and denied the motion.  Next, FDIC moved for summary judgment on the basis of  12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).  Because Counts I and II were clearly barred, those counts were dismissed,  leaving only Count III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the FDIC made its worthlessness determination, it moved for summary judgment  on Count III.  In response, defendants first asserted their recoupment theory.  The district court  initially denied the motion on that ground but after further proceedings and a renewed motion for  summary judgment changed its ruling and granted the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of FDIC's motions reflected material changes in the posture of this litigation and  was grounded on meritorious contentions.  The district court did not abuse its discretion when it  entertained FDIC's final motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.  Denial of Attorney's Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of defendants' petition for attorney's fees for  abuse of discretion.  See Maynard v. CIA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600729\"><a href=\"/opinion/600729/beatrice-maynard-v-central-intelligence-agency-beatrice-maynard-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 567 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants claim to be entitled to attorney's fees on the ground that FDIC's  \"successive summary judgment motions, asserting new grounds after prior arguments fail, caused  [them] unnecessary burden and expense.\"  As previously shown, however, each motion was properly  grounded and reflected a material change of circumstances.  Moreover, defendants have not shown  how FDIC's belated disclosure of the assignment of the Loan increased the burden or expense on  defendants.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>   Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   For ease of reference, the allowance of the claim against Kooyomjian and the judgment against  DiCicco are referred to as the Loan.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e) provides, in pertinent part:  \"No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat  the interest of [FDIC] in any asset acquired by it . . . as receiver of any insured depository institution,  shall be valid against [FDIC] unless such agreement--(1) is in writing . . . and (4) has been,  continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
