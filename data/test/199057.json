William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n      Barbara A. Bartolomeo and John R. Bartolomeo on brief pro\nse.\n     Joseph E. Kelleher and Kraus & Hummel LLP on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                        August 16, 2000\n\f              Per Curiam.       Between January and December 1998,\n\nJohn     Bartolomeo      was    confined      at     the    Plymouth       County\n\nCorrectional Facility (PCCF) in Massachusetts.                      He received\n\nregular visits there from his parents, Barbara and Charles\n\nBartolomeo, in a first-floor visiting area.                   On one occasion\n\nin June 1998, however, Barbara was unable to visit him\n\nbecause of an unusual set of circumstances: John had been\n\nplaced     in    administrative         segregation         due     to    pending\n\ndisciplinary       charges      and,   by    rule,    could       only    receive\n\nvisitors in a second-floor visiting area; Barbara allegedly\n\nsuffered from a malady that prevented her from using the\n\nelevator; and PCCF officials refused to allow use of a\n\nconnecting stairway because of security concerns.\n\n              Mother and son responded with the instant pro se\n\naction for injunctive relief and damages.                   As here relevant,\n\nBarbara alleged a violation of her rights under Title II of\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n12131-34, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29\n\nU.S.C.    §     794,    while   John    claimed      an     equal    protection\n\nviolation.        The    district      court,      taking    note    of    John's\n\nintervening transfer to another facility, dismissed all\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\frequests for injunctive relief without prejudice on the\n\nground of mootness; that ruling has not been challenged on\n\nappeal.     As to the requests for damages, the court ended up\n\ngranting summary judgment for defendants--rejecting John's\n\nclaim on the merits and jettisoning Barbara's claims on\n\nqualified immunity grounds.              This appeal followed.\n\n             We shall assume arguendo that Barbara's appeal is\n\nproperly before us.         A jurisdictional issue arises because,\n\nin a joint request, both plaintiffs moved under Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 4(a)(5) for an extension of time to appeal, and the\n\ndistrict court allowed John's request only.             The most likely\n\nbasis for treating the two differently appears to be that\n\nJohn had signed the motion while Barbara had not.                    Under\n\nFed.   R.    Civ.   P.    11(a),    \"[a]n    unsigned   paper     shall   be\n\nstricken     unless      omission   of    the   signature    is   corrected\n\npromptly after being called to the attention of the attorney\n\nor party.\"       Here, the omission of Barbara's signature was\n\nnot called to her attention, and she was appearing pro se.\n\nIn these circumstances, we are disinclined to dispose of her\n\nappeal on jurisdictional grounds.\n\n             On the merits, however, the arguments advanced on\n\nappeal      by   both     plaintiffs       prove   clearly    unavailing.\n\nBarbara's principal contention is that the district court\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f erred in rejecting her claims on qualified immunity grounds.\n\n As neither side has disputed the point, we shall assume\n\n without deciding that individuals may be subject to personal\n\n liability under Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation\n\n Act.   But see, e.g., Walker v. Snyder, 213 F.3d 344, 346 (7th\n\n Cir. 2000); Alsbrook v. City of Maumelle, 184 F.3d 999, 1005\n\n n.8 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc), cert. dismissed, 120 S. Ct.\n\n 1265 (2000).1   Even if so, we agree with the district court\n\n that, under the circumstances with which the defendants were\n\n confronted, a reasonable official would not have understood\n\n that the actions taken violated a clearly established right.\n\n See, e.g., Bilida v. McCleod, 211 F.3d 166, 174 (1st Cir.\n\n 2000) (delineating qualified immunity test).2\n\n\n    1      Neither  below,   in   their  untimely  motion   for\nreconsideration, nor on appeal have plaintiffs pursued their\nclaims against the institutional defendants (or against the\npersonal defendants in their official capacities).        Being\nwilling to afford only so much latitude to pro se litigants, we\nconsider the claims abandoned.    We add, without deciding the\npoint, that their prospects of ultimately recovering damages\nappeared unpromising. See, e.g., Powers v. MJB Acquis. Corp.,\n184 F.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1999) (requiring showing of\nintentional   discrimination   in   the  form  of   \"deliberate\nindifference\" in order to obtain damages in this context).\n    2  While various courts have applied qualified immunity in\nthe ADA context, see, e.g., Bartell v. Lohiser, 215 F.3d 550,\n___, 2000 WL 726482, at *10 n.1 (6 th Cir. 2000); Gorman v.\nBartch, 152 F.3d 907, 914-16 (8th Cir. 1998), one has briefly\nmused about the propriety of doing so, see Walker, 213 F.3d at\n346.  As plaintiffs have raised no such objection, we do not\naddress the matter.\n\n                               -4-\n\f           To be sure, just seventeen days before the events\n\nin question here, the Supreme Court concluded that Title II\n\nof the ADA applied in the prison context.              See Pennsylvania\n\nDep't of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998).                Courts\n\nhave    reached    the     same         conclusion     concerning        the\n\nRehabilitation Act.        See, e.g., Stanley v. Litscher, 213\n\nF.3d 340, 343 (7 th Cir. 2000).             And defendants have not\n\ndisputed    that   prison        visitation     policies        constitute\n\n\"services, programs, or activities\" within the meaning of 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12132.    See, e.g., Crawford v. Indiana Dep't of\n\nCorrections, 115 F.3d 481, 483-84 (7 th Cir. 1997) (noting\n\nconcession by state on that point); Niece v. Fitzner, 922 F.\n\nSupp. 1208, 1217 (E.D. Mich. 1996).\n\n           Nonetheless,     the     incident     in    question    was    an\n\nisolated one, arising out of an apparent misunderstanding,\n\nand resulting in just a single failed visit out of many\n\nsuccessful ones.         It does not appear that Barbara was\n\ndeprived of \"meaningful access\" to the visitation program.\n\nTheriault v. Flynn, 162 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting\n\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985)); cf., e.g.,\n\nSpurlock v. Simmons, 88 F. Supp. 2d 1189, 1195-96 (D. Kan.\n\n2000) (holding that restricting hearing-impaired inmate to\n\ntwo    thirty-minute     calls    per    week   on    special   telephone\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f  amounted to meaningful access).           The provision of elevator\n\n  service ordinarily avoids rather than creates problems of\n\n  physical   access.      Barbara,     it   is   true,   had    furnished\n\n  defendants with a physician's note explaining that her\n\n  anxiety    disorder      and   claustrophobia          rendered      her\n\n  \"particularly ... unable to tolerate riding in elevators.\"\n\n  Yet defendants' initial belief--that this meant simply that\n\n  assistance would be required (they offered the use of a\n\n  wheelchair)--was not an indefensible one.               And once that\n\n  misimpression    was    dispelled,    their    refusal       to   make   a\n\n  special, on-the-spot accommodation was not unreasonable--\n\n  especially with a throng of visitors milling about and with\n\n  Barbara    (as    she     concedes)         becoming     increasingly\n\n  obstreperous. For these reasons, we conclude that qualified\n\n  immunity was properly invoked.3\n\n             Plaintiffs'    remaining       arguments    require    little\n\n  comment.   John's equal protection claim can be summarily\n\n  rejected for the reason that he was not similarly situated\n\n  to his fellow inmates (all of whose visitors, it can be\n\n\n\n    3  From a broader standpoint, we also note that, in the wake\nof Yeskey, the manner in which the ADA is to be applied in the\nprison context and the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny\nare matters that remain unsettled.      See, e.g., Onishea v.\nHopper, 171 F.3d 1289, 1299-1301 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc),\ncert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 931 (2000).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f  inferred, were able to use the elevator).           Both plaintiffs\n\n  complain that         the district court acted prematurely in\n\n  entertaining the summary judgment motion without affording\n\n  adequate time for discovery.            Yet they never moved for\n\n  relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) or otherwise voiced any\n\n  such objection below.4       The issue has thus been waived, see,\n\n  e.g., de la Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., 15 F.3d 12, 15\n\n  (1st Cir. 1994), and we find no plain error.          Finally, they\n\n  object that a motion to amend their complaint (so as to add\n\n  an       additional   PCCF   employee   as   defendant)   was   never\n\n  addressed.      Since an allowance of the motion would not have\n\n  affected the disposition of the case, any error in this\n\n  regard was harmless.\n\n                Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       4Their summary judgment opposition contained only the\nsingle closing comment that the case \"must proceed to the\ndiscovery phase,\" while their reconsideration motion made no\nreference to the matter at all.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",
