Defendant-appellant Miguel\r\nCaraballo appeals the sentence imposed following his conviction for\r\nconspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property\r\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  The issue on appeal is the\r\ndistrict court's conclusion that a portion of Caraballo's sentence\r\nshould run consecutively to a state sentence he was already serving\r\nfor conduct related to the federal offense.  Caraballo argues that\r\nthe relationship between the conduct underlying the two offenses\r\nrequires wholly concurrent sentencing under section 5G1.3 of the\r\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines.  We disagree, and therefore\r\naffirm.\r\n                             I.\r\nA.  Legal Context\r\nThe Sentencing Guidelines (the \"Guidelines\") prescribe\r\na range of months appropriate for each federal offender's sentence. \r\nThe recommended range takes into account the \"offense level\" for\r\nthe violation being punished (the \"instant offense\") and the\r\ndefendant's \"criminal history category.\"  U.S.S.G.  5A.  The\r\n\"offense level\" consists of a \"base offense level\" corresponding to\r\nthe crime for which the defendant has been convicted, as modified\r\nby mandatory \"adjustments\" which take account of certain\r\naggravating or mitigating factors.  In determining the applicable\r\noffense level, district courts must consider (and must only\r\nconsider) conduct that is \"relevant\" pursuant to U.S.S.G.  1B1.3. \r\nSection 5G1.3 of the Guidelines addresses cases in which\r\nthe defendant, at sentencing, is already serving a term of\r\nimprisonment.  Subsection 5G1.3(b) requires that when the\r\nundischarged term \"resulted from offense(s) that have been fully\r\ntaken into account in the determination of the offense level for\r\nthe instant offense,\" the new sentence must run concurrently with,\r\nrather than consecutively to, the undischarged term.  U.S.S.G.\r\n5G1.3(b).  Where the prior offenses have not been \"fully taken\r\ninto account in the determination of the offense level for the\r\ninstant offense,\" however,  5G1.3(c) allows the sentence for the\r\ninstant offense to \"be imposed to run concurrently, partially\r\nconcurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term . . .\r\nto achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\"  Id.\r\n5G1.3(c).\r\nAt issue is whether conduct that is \"relevant\" under\r\n1B1.3 must necessarily be deemed to have been \"fully taken into\r\naccount in the determination of the offense level for the instant\r\noffense,\" irrespective of whether or not that conduct in fact\r\naltered the sentencing range for the offense.  We find that it need\r\nnot, and that here, where \"relevant\" conduct has not resulted in\r\nany change in the defendant's offense level -- or even in his\r\ncriminal history category -- the district court appropriately\r\neschewed  5G1.3(b) in favor of  5G1.3(c)'s discretionary\r\napproach.\r\nB.  Factual Background\r\nBetween 1993 and 1996, Caraballo and several confederates\r\ncommitted numerous burglaries throughout New England.  Though not\r\nall of the conspirators participated in each burglary, the group's\r\nmembers assisted one another in various ways, engaging in joint\r\nresearch, planning, and execution of the heists.  \r\nOn November 8, 1995, Caraballo and two partners, Valdir\r\nAlvarenga and Nelson Rivera, attempted to burgle Bernie's Appliance\r\nStore in Manchester, Connecticut (\"Bernie's\").  Connecticut police\r\nofficers had learned of the plan prior to the attack, however, and\r\nwere lying in wait inside and outside of Bernie's.  Upon noticing\r\nthe officers' presence, Rivera fled the store.  During Caraballo's\r\nplea colloquy, the district court described the ensuing events, to\r\nwhich Caraballo admitted, thusly:\r\n  [T]here was a confrontation between officers\r\nand Alvarenga and Caraballo inside the store. \r\nCaraballo, [who] was armed with a pair of\r\nlong-handled cutting shears, . . . moved\r\ntowards one of the officers in . . . an\r\noffensive attack position.  At that point the\r\npolice holstered their weapons.  \r\n    Alvarenga noticed that the officers\r\nwere focused on Caraballo and moved into a\r\nposition to attack one of the officers.  \r\n    The police then observed Alvarenga,\r\narmed with an ax, approaching and instructed\r\nhim to drop the weapon, which he refused to\r\ndo. . . . [T]he officer was forced to shoot,\r\nand . . . Alvarenga . . . was mortally\r\nwounded.\r\n\nCaraballo then fled the premises, entered a vehicle outside and\r\nbegan to drive away.  Before Caraballo could effectuate his escape,\r\na police officer squeezed his torso through the passenger-side\r\nwindow and ordered him to stop.  When Caraballo continued driving,\r\nthe officer shot him in the leg.  Caraballo accelerated, throwing\r\nthe officer to the ground, and then attempted to run over another\r\nofficer.  Shortly thereafter he was involved in an accident, which\r\nled to his apprehension and arrest.  No property was taken from\r\nBernie's.\r\nCaraballo was prosecuted in Connecticut's Superior Court\r\non charges stemming from the Bernie's burglary.  Although the\r\nrecord is not entirely clear, it appears that he pleaded guilty to\r\nburglary and assault on an officer.  In any event, on June 28,\r\n1996, the court sentenced Caraballo to an eight-year prison term\r\nfor the former and a concurrent prison term for the latter.\r\nCaraballo also faced federal charges in the District of\r\nNew Hampshire, where he was indicted for conspiracy to commit\r\ninterstate transportation of stolen property in violation of 18\r\nU.S.C.  371.  Twenty-two burglaries were listed as overt acts in\r\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.  One of the listed acts was his\r\n\"unlawful[] ent[ry into] a business operated as Bernie's Store,\r\nManchester, Connecticut.\"  Caraballo pleaded guilty to the\r\nconspiracy charge.\r\nCaraballo's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended that\r\nhe be held accountable for four burglaries resulting, collectively,\r\nin losses of $265,334.00.  The PSR also recommended that Caraballo\r\nbe held accountable for five other burglaries, resulting in either\r\nindeterminate loss or, as in the attempted Bernie's robbery, no\r\nloss at all.  The PSR proposed a base offense level of sixteen (16)\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  2X1.1 and 2B1.1(b)(1)(K).  This calculation\r\nincluded fourteen (14) levels to reflect the loss of $265,334.00\r\nplus two (2) additional levels because the burglaries involved\r\n\"more than minimal planning.\"  U.S.S.G.  2B1.1(b)(4)(A).  The PSR\r\nthen recommended an additional two (2) levels for reckless\r\nendangerment during flight (stemming from Caraballo's escape from\r\nBernie's), see U.S.S.G.  3C1.2, and two levels for obstruction of\r\njustice (stemming from an aborted plot to kill potential adverse\r\nwitnesses), see U.S.S.G.  3C1.1.  The report subtracted three (3)\r\nlevels for Caraballo's acceptance of responsibility, resulting in\r\nan adjusted offense level of seventeen (17).  See U.S.S.G.  3E1.1. \r\nCaraballo's criminal history category, which did not take into\r\naccount any aspect of the Bernie's incident, was five (5). \r\nCaraballo's adjusted offense level and criminal history category\r\ntogether resulted in a sentencing range of forty-six to fifty-seven\r\nmonths.  See U.S.S.G.  5A.  The PSR concluded that Caraballo's\r\nsentence could be imposed to run concurrently with, partially\r\nconcurrently with, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term\r\nof imprisonment relating to his Connecticut conviction.\r\nCaraballo argued for a wholly concurrent sentence\r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(b).  He contended that because he\r\nreceived a two-level upward adjustment in his total offense level\r\nfor reckless endangerment relating to his escape from Bernie's,\r\nthat burglary -- for which he was then serving his Connecticut\r\nsentence -- had been \"fully taken into account\" for the purpose of\r\nestablishing his offense level.  \r\nThe government requested wholly consecutive sentencing\r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c).  The prosecution observed that no\r\nupward adjustment had been assigned for the Bernie's incident\r\nitself.  Indeed, because no merchandise was stolen from the store,\r\nno upward adjustment could have been assigned.  Moreover, the\r\nBernie's incident had not been relied upon in setting Caraballo's\r\ncriminal history category.  For these reasons, the government\r\nargued that the crimes for which Caraballo was serving time in\r\nConnecticut were not \"fully\" taken into account, as required in\r\norder for  5G1.3(b) to take effect, and that his sentence should\r\nrun consecutively to the undischarged Connecticut term.  \r\nOn November 18, 1998, the district court sentenced\r\nCaraballo.  The court ruled that the Bernie's incident had not been\r\n\"fully taken into account\" in the offense level determination.  The\r\ncourt reasoned as follows:  \"First of all . . . there were a number\r\nof . . . obviously criminal offenses[] that occurred there, all of\r\nwhich were not charged . . . [and for some of which] the defendant\r\ndoes not stand convicted and sentenced.\"  Moreover, \"[t]here was no\r\ndollar loss from the Bernie's burglary, and therefore, [there has]\r\nbeen no adjustment to the defendant's overall offense level under\r\n[U.S.S.G. ] 2B1.1 . . . .  While reckless endangerment has taken\r\nsome of these . . . offenses into account, . . . it certainly\r\nhasn't taken all of what went on that evening . . . into account\r\nfully.\"  Thus, the court determined that the sentence was governed\r\nby U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c), not  5G1.3(b).  Caraballo received a\r\nfifty-seven (57) month sentence, only nine months of which were to\r\nrun concurrently with his undischarged Connecticut sentence. \r\nCaraballo now challenges the district court's decision to\r\nimpose only nine months of the 57-month sentence on a concurrent\r\nbasis.  He does not challenge the district court's particular\r\ndivision of concurrent and consecutive time under  5G1.3(c), but\r\nonly the court's decision to apply that subsection rather than\r\n5G1.3(b).\r\n                            II.\r\nA.  Standard of Review\r\nIn reviewing a district court's application of a\r\nsentencing guideline, we utilize a bifurcated process.  \"First, we\r\nreview the guideline's legal meaning and scope de novo.  Next, we\r\nreview the court's factfinding for clear error, giving due\r\ndeference to the court's application of the guidelines to the\r\nfacts.\"  United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(internal citations omitted); see also United States v. Florence,\r\n143 F.3d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nUnlike many  5G1.3 controversies, this appeal requires\r\na purely legal determination, and thus calls for de novo review. \r\nDisputes involving  5G1.3 have almost invariably turned on whether\r\nor not the prior undischarged term rested on a conviction for\r\nconduct that was \"relevant\" to the instant offense.  Typically, as\r\nin many of the cases cited by the parties, the central issue has\r\nbeen whether the conduct was \"relevant\" by virtue of having\r\nconstituted \"part of a common scheme or plan.\"  That inquiry,\r\ngoverned by U.S.S.G.  1B1.3, requires a factual determination as\r\nto whether the two violations were \"substantially connected\" by\r\ncommon victims, purposes, modus operandi, or accomplices.  See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Joost, 133 F.3d 125, 132 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nUnited States v. Sheahan, 31 F.3d 595, 599 (8th Cir. 1994); United\r\nStates v. McCaskey, 9 F.3d 368, 375-76 (5th Cir. 1993); United\r\nStates v. Shewmaker, 936 F.2d 1124, 1129 (10th Cir. 1991).  Such a\r\nfactual determination merits review only for clear error.\r\nThis appeal, however, is atypical.  Caraballo was\r\nconvicted and sentenced in Connecticut for the burglary at Bernie's\r\nand for his assault upon an officer during his escape from\r\nBernie's.  He does not dispute the district court's factual finding\r\nthat the burglary and the assault constitute  1B1.3 \"relevant\r\nconduct\" for the purposes of sentencing the instant offense. \r\nRather, he raises a purely legal question: Amidst undisputed\r\nfactual findings and conduct that is all admittedly \"relevant,\" how\r\nare courts to interpret U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(b)'s term \"fully taken\r\ninto account\"?  When interpreting a Guideline, \"we cede no\r\ndeference to the district court's legal conclusion.\"  United States\r\nv. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).  Our review,\r\ntherefore, is de novo.\r\nB.  Interpreting  5G1.3\r\nCaraballo contends that, as \"relevant conduct,\" the\r\noffenses underlying his Connecticut sentence were necessarily, as\r\na matter of law, \"fully taken into account in the determination of\r\nthe offense level for the instant offense,\" irrespective of whether\r\nthat conduct influenced the offense level.  We disagree.\r\n1.     \r\nCaraballo's argument rests on the contention that\r\n5G1.3's reference to conduct \"fully taken into account\" denotes\r\nall  1B1.3 \"relevant conduct.\"  Because all relevant conduct is\r\nnecessarily \"taken into account in the determination of the offense\r\nlevel for [an] instant offense,\" Caraballo's construction would\r\nrequire us to treat  5G1.3(b)'s term \"fully\" as surplusage which\r\ndoes not at all modify the phrase \"taken into account.\"  This we\r\nmay not do.\r\nAny conduct that is \"relevant\" to the instant offense\r\nunder  1B1.3 must be \"taken into account in the determination of\r\nthe offense level for the instant offense.\"  Section 1B1.3 uses\r\nmandatory language:  The instant offense's base offense level,\r\nspecific offense characteristics, and adjustments all \"shall be\r\ndetermined on the basis of\" the conduct  1B1.3 defines as\r\nrelevant.  U.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a) (emphasis added).  Under the\r\nGuidelines, then, relevant conduct must be \"taken into account\" by\r\nthe sentencing judge.  Moreover, no other conduct -- no irrelevant\r\nconduct -- may be considered.  See id.  In a case such as\r\nCaraballo's, where the conduct in which the undischarged term is\r\ngrounded is concededly \"relevant\" to the instant offense, that\r\nconduct, and only that conduct, is necessarily \"taken into account\"\r\nfor the purposes of establishing an appropriate sentence. \r\nIf all conduct that is \"taken into account\" is\r\nnecessarily \"relevant\" under  1B1.3, then any interpretation\r\npositing that relevance is all that is demanded by  5G1.3(b)'s use\r\nof the phrase \"fully taken into account\" would render meaningless\r\nthe word \"fully.\"  We are prohibited from adopting any such\r\nconstruction, for it is axiomatic that \r\n  \"[a]ll words and provisions of statutes are\r\nintended to have meaning and are to be given\r\neffect, and no construction should be adopted\r\nwhich would render statutory words or phrases\r\nmeaningless, redundant or superfluous.\"  We\r\nthink that this principle is fully applicable\r\nto the sentencing guidelines, which, although\r\nthey are not statutes, are to be construed in\r\nmuch the same fashion.\r\nUnited States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting\r\nLamore v. Ives, 977 F.2d 713, 716-17 (1st Cir. 1992)) (internal\r\ncitations omitted); see also South Carolina v. Catawba Indian\r\nTribe, Inc., 476 U.S. 498, 510 n.22 (1985) (emphasizing the\r\n\"elementary canon of construction that a statute should be\r\ninterpreted so as not to render one part inoperative\"); Colautti v.\r\nFranklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392 (1979) (same); Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek,\r\n175 F.3d 170, 173 (1st Cir. 1999) (same).  \"Fully\" cannot, then, be\r\nrendered meaningless, and the term \"fully taken into account,\" in\r\nturn, cannot be read to be synonymous with the term \"relevant\r\nconduct\" as defined in  1B1.3. \r\n2.\r\nWhile the Guidelines' structure requires that\r\n5G1.3(b)'s \"fully\" must mean something, and that not all\r\n\"relevant conduct\" is necessarily \"fully taken into account in the\r\ndetermination of the offense level for the instant offense,\"\r\nprecisely what \"fully\" means -- and precisely which subset of\r\n\"relevant conduct\" is specified by that term -- requires\r\nconsideration.  As described below,  5G1.3's central aim is to\r\nensure that no defendant is punished twice for the same crime,\r\nwhile preserving the district courts' discretion where only certain\r\nelements of the crime punished in one proceeding also impact crimes\r\npunished in another.  Where, as here, (1) the $0 loss from the\r\nBernie's burglary resulted in no change in Caraballo's offense\r\nlevel, and could not have so resulted, (2) the Bernie's burglary\r\ndid not impact Caraballo's criminal history category, and (3)\r\nCarballo's federal conspiracy conviction was grounded in eight\r\nother burglaries in addition to the Bernie's heist, the district\r\ncourt properly concluded that the state offense was not \"fully\r\ntaken into account in the determination of the offense level for\r\n[Caraballo's] instant [federal] offense.\"  In these circumstances,\r\na partially consecutive sentence will not result in duplicative\r\npunishment.\r\n\"[S]tatutory construction begins with the actual language\r\nof the provision.\"  United States v. Rivera, 131 F.3d 222, 224 (1st\r\nCir. 1997); see also Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, 471 U.S. 681,\r\n685 (1985); United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  However, where a provision uses terminology with no clear\r\nmeaning, courts must interpret such language with reference to the\r\nmanifest statutory purpose.  \"The chief objective of statutory\r\ninterpretation is to give effect to the legislative will.\" \r\nPassamaquoddy Tribe v. Maine, 75 F.3d 784, 788 (1st Cir. 1996); see\r\nalso Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U.S. 99, 104 (1993) (\"'Our task [in\r\ninterpreting statutes] is to give effect to the will of Congress.'\"\r\n(quoting Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 570\r\n(1982))); Evans v. Commissioner, 933 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(consulting statute's \"basic purpose\" after finding text\r\nsusceptible to multiple interpretations).\r\nSubsection 5G1.3(b)'s phrase \"fully taken into account\"\r\nis left undefined.  We thus strive to interpret it in a manner\r\nconsistent with  1B1.3's definition of \"relevant conduct\" and the\r\nprinciples outlined above.  Conduct \"taken into account\" must\r\ninclude all \"relevant conduct\" under  1B1.3, but neither\r\n5G1.3(b) itself nor the accompanying notes elaborate which\r\nparticular subset of \"relevant conduct\" is signified by the word\r\n\"fully.\"  Thus, in interpreting  5G1.3, we must attempt to\r\nconstrue the provision in the manner that best effects its intended\r\npurpose.  See United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (noting that the tools of statutory construction apply to the\r\nGuidelines).\r\nIn Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389 (1995), the\r\nSupreme Court had occasion to consider the purpose behind  5G1.3. \r\nA majority of the Court found that the section was designed \"to\r\nmitigate the possibility that the fortuity of two separate\r\nprosecutions will grossly increase a defendant's sentence.\"  Id. at\r\n405.  Where a defendant's related crimes \"are not prosecuted in the\r\nsame proceeding . . .  5G1.3 . . . attempts to achieve some\r\ncoordination of sentences . . . with an eye toward having such\r\npunishments approximate the total penalty that would have been\r\nimposed had the sentences . . . been imposed at the same time\r\n(i.e., had all the offenses been prosecuted in a single\r\nproceeding).\"  Id. at 404-05.  We have embraced this interpretation\r\nof the purpose animating  5G1.3, see United States v. Joost, 133\r\nF.3d 125, 132 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating that section's \"core\r\npurpose\" is \"to address the unfairness that would result from\r\nreceiving a second sentence for activities that were considered as\r\nrelevant conduct in a prior proceeding\" (quoting United States v.\r\nKimble, 107 F.3d 712, 714 (9th Cir. 1997))), as have several other\r\ncourts of appeals, see, e.g., United States v. Dorsey, 166 F.3d\r\n558, 562 (3d Cir. 1999); United States v. Fuentes, 107 F.3d 1515,\r\n1523 (11th Cir. 1997); Prewitt v. United States, 83 F.3d 812, 817\r\n(7th Cir. 1996).\r\nIt is thus widely acknowledged that  5G1.3 is directed\r\nat the prevention of duplicative sentencing for any particular\r\nconduct.  Only one interpretation would conform  5G1.3(b)'s \"fully\r\ntaken into account\" language to this purpose:  Whereas all  1B1.3\r\n\"relevant conduct\" must be \"taken into account in the determination\r\nof the offense level for the instant offense,\" only relevant\r\nconduct that has resulted in -- or that could have resulted in --\r\na change in the instant offense's \"offense level\" is \"fully taken\r\ninto account\" under  5G1.3(b).  That is, only when the defendant's\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment \"resulted from offense(s) that\"\r\nnot only were \"relevant conduct\" vs-a-vs the instant offense, but\r\nalso impacted (or could have impacted) the defendant's offense\r\nlevel or criminal history category, is the district judge bound to\r\nchoose concurrent sentencing.  Otherwise, the judge is free to\r\nimpose a concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive sentence\r\nunder  5G1.3(c).  This framework ensures that offenders will not\r\nbe sentenced doubly for any given criminal act.  However, it also\r\npreserves the district court's authority to impose appropriate\r\npunishment when some aspects of the offender's conduct are\r\npunishable in one jurisdiction and other aspects are punishable in\r\nanother. \r\n3.\r\nFinally, where the defendant's \"instant offense\" actually\r\nincorporates multiple offenses, only some (or one) of which, if\r\nsentenced alone, would merit concurrent sentencing under\r\n5G1.3(b), that subsection's purpose is best served by a rule\r\nallowing sentencing of the combined \"instant offense\" pursuant to\r\n5G1.3(c).  We concur with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\r\nCircuit, which has held:\r\n  A rule requiring application of  5G1.3(b)\r\nwhere only some of the offenses for which the\r\ndefendant is serving the undischarged prison\r\nterm were taken into account would require\r\nconcurrent sentences in situations where\r\n 5G1.3(b)'s rationale would not fully apply. \r\nOn the other hand, rejection of  5G1.3(b) in\r\nsuch multiple-offenses situations would leave\r\nthe court free fully to consider, under\r\n 5G1.3(c), all of the potential permutations\r\nand complexities that arise in a multiple-\r\noffenses context.\r\n\nUnited States v. Kimble, 107 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir. 1997).\r\n\nFor example, we see no reason why a defendant already\r\nserving an undischarged term for multiple offenses, only one of\r\nwhich was \"fully taken into account\" in determining the instant\r\noffense's offense level, should merit a wholly concurrent sentence. \r\nSuch an outcome would not serve the purpose animating  5G1.3(b)\r\nbecause the instant offense might well involve violations wholly\r\nunrelated to the conduct underlying the undischarged term.  In such\r\na case, each prison term would include time for offenses that were\r\nnot at all accounted for by the other term; mandatory concurrent\r\nsentencing would be inappropriate.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nMyers, 66 F.3d 1364, 1376 (4th Cir. 1995) (allowing consecutive\r\nsentencing under  5G1.3(c) where defendants were already serving\r\nundischarged term for rape and instant offense level included\r\nadjustments for assault and physical injury to the victim, because\r\n\"there are obvious components of rape that [were] not entirely\r\nencompassed by findings of assault and physical injury\").\r\nIn multiple-offenses cases of this sort, then, district\r\ncourts are free, under  5G1.3(c), to choose wholly concurrent,\r\npartially concurrent, or wholly consecutive sentencing.  The\r\ncourts' discretion is cabined, though, by that subsection's\r\nrequirement that the sentence be designed \"to achieve a reasonable\r\npunishment for the instant offense.\"  U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c).  Thus,\r\nfor example, when some, but not all, of the conduct from which the\r\nunderlying term resulted is \"fully taken into account\" in\r\ndetermining the offense level for the instant offense, it would be\r\nappropriate for the sentencing judge to run that portion of the\r\nsentence corresponding to such conduct concurrently with the\r\nunderlying term.  That decision, though, would be governed by\r\n5G1.3(c), not  5G1.3(b).\r\n  4.\r\nIn summary, when a defendant is serving an undischarged\r\nterm for conduct all of which has influenced the final \"offense\r\nlevel\" applicable to the instant offense, the entire sentence for\r\nthat instant offense must run concurrently with the undischarged\r\nterm, pursuant to  5B1.3(b).  When none of the conduct related to\r\nthe undischarged term influences the instant offense's offense\r\nlevel, the district court is free to impose a wholly concurrent,\r\npartially concurrent, or wholly consecutive sentence, in accordance\r\nwith  5G1.3(c).  When some of the conduct underlying an\r\nundischarged term impacted the offense level, but other aspects of\r\nthat conduct did not, the sentencing judge again enjoys discretion\r\nunder  5G1.3(c), but must remain mindful of that subsection's\r\ndirective that the combined punishment be \"reasonable,\" and of the\r\noverarching purpose of  5G1.3 -- namely, the prevention of\r\nduplicative punishment.\r\n                            III.\r\nIn view of the  5G1.3 mechanism, as we here interpret\r\nit, Caraballo's sentence must be affirmed.  Though Caraballo's\r\nfederal sentence and his Connecticut sentence both punished his\r\nattack upon the police officer outside Bernie's, each also\r\naddressed conduct that was not taken into account by the other\r\nsentence.  Specifically, the federal term (and only the federal\r\nterm) punished the conspiracy with respect to all the burglaries\r\nresulting in losses, as well as Caraballo's aborted plot to murder\r\nadverse witnesses, while the Connecticut term (and only the\r\nConnecticut term) addressed the failed Bernie's heist.  Because the\r\nfederal term was not at all impacted by the Bernie's heist, as the\r\nresult either of a changed offense level or an increased criminal\r\nhistory category, and because that term addressed crimes other than\r\nthose addressed by the Connecticut sentence, we are confident that\r\nthe Bernie's burglary falls into the category of conduct that was\r\nnot \"fully taken into account\" for  5G1.3(b) purposes.  In\r\ncontrast, because Caraballo's assault upon the Connecticut police\r\nofficer, for which he was sentenced in Connecticut, also resulted\r\nin a two-level upward adjustment to his instant offense level, that\r\nconduct likely was \"fully taken into account.\"\r\nIn this case, then, the district court properly applied\r\n5G1.3(c), which allows any combination of concurrent and\r\nconsecutive sentencing.  Connecticut law permitted enhanced\r\npunishment for Caraballo's attempt to rob Bernie's; federal law did\r\nnot.  No duplicative punishment for the burglary was ever\r\nthreatened.  Caraballo was only forced to bear the full brunt of\r\nall conduct deemed illegal by the relevant sovereign.  To permit\r\nconsecutive sentencing in such circumstances is merely to preserve\r\nthe district court's discretion to ensure just punishment for all\r\ncriminal conduct.\r\nThe district court appropriately addressed the risk of\r\npunishing Caraballo doubly for his attack upon the Connecticut\r\npolice officer by exercising its discretion under  5G1.3(c) to run\r\npart -- specifically, nine months -- of Caraballo's federal\r\nsentence concurrently with his Connecticut sentence.  Caraballo\r\ndoes not challenge, and we do not address, the district court's\r\napplication of its discretion under  5G1.3(c).  \r\nIn short, because not all of the conduct from which\r\nCaraballo's Connecticut term resulted influenced his ultimate\r\noffense level, not all of it was \"fully taken into account\" under\r\n5G1.3(b).  The court below thus correctly chose to apply\r\n5G1.3(c) instead.  \r\nAffirmed.\n",

The issue on appeal is the district court's conclusion that a portion of Caraballo's sentence should run consecutively to a state sentence he was already serving for conduct related to the federal offense. Caraballo argues that the relationship between the conduct underlying the two offenses requires wholly concurrent sentencing under section 5G1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We disagree, and therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Legal Context</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines (the \"Guidelines\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> prescribe a range of months appropriate for each federal offender's sentence. The recommended range takes into account the \"offense level\" for the violation being punished (the \"instant offense\") and the defendant's \"criminal history category.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A. The \"offense level\" consists of a \"base offense level\" corresponding to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted, as modified by mandatory \"adjustments\" which take account of certain aggravating or mitigating factors. In determining the applicable offense level, district courts must consider (and must only consider) conduct that is \"relevant\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5G1.3 of the Guidelines addresses cases in which the defendant, at sentencing, is already serving a term of imprisonment. Subsection 5G1.3(b) requires that when the undischarged term \"resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" the new sentence must run concurrently with, rather than consecutively to, the undischarged term. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b). Where the prior offenses have not been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" however, &#167; 5G1.3(c) allows the sentence for the instant offense to \"be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term . . . to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\" Id. &#167; 5G1.3(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue is whether conduct that is \"relevant\" under &#167; 1B1.3 must necessarily be deemed to have been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" irrespective of whether or not that conduct in fact altered the sentencing range for the offense. We find that it need not, and that here, where \"relevant\" conduct has not resulted in any change in the defendant's offense level -- or even in his criminal history category -- the district court appropriately eschewed &#167; 5G1.3(b) in favor of &#167; 5G1.3(c)'s discretionary approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1993 and 1996, Caraballo and several confederates committed numerous burglaries throughout New England. Though not all of the conspirators participated in each burglary, the group's members assisted one another in various ways, engaging in joint research, planning, and execution of the heists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1995, Caraballo and two partners, Valdir Alvarenga and Nelson Rivera, attempted to burgle Bernie's Appliance Store in Manchester, Connecticut (\"Bernie's\"). Connecticut police officers had learned of the plan prior to the attack, however, and were lying in wait inside and outside of Bernie's. Upon noticing the officers' presence, Rivera fled the store. During Caraballo's plea colloquy, the district court described the ensuing events, to which Caraballo admitted, thusly:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here was a confrontation between officers and Alvarenga and Caraballo inside the store. Caraballo, [who] was armed with a pair of long-handled cutting shears, . . . moved towards one of the officers in . . . an offensive attack position. At that point the police holstered their weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarenga noticed that the officers were focused on Caraballo and moved into a position to attack one of the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police then observed Alvarenga, armed with an ax, approaching and instructed him to drop the weapon, which he refused to do. . . . [T]he officer was forced to shoot, and . . . Alvarenga . . . was mortally wounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo then fled the premises, entered a vehicle outside and began to drive away. Before Caraballo could effectuate his escape, a police officer squeezed his torso through the passenger-side window and ordered him to stop. When Caraballo continued driving, the officer shot him in the leg. Caraballo accelerated, throwing the officer to the ground, and then attempted to run over another officer. Shortly thereafter he was involved in an accident, which led to his apprehension and arrest. No property was taken from Bernie's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo was prosecuted in Connecticut's Superior Court on charges stemming from the Bernie's burglary. Although the record is not entirely clear, it appears that he pleaded guilty to burglary and assault on an officer. In any event, on June 28, 1996, the court sentenced Caraballo to an eight-year prison term for the former and a concurrent prison term for the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo also faced federal charges in the District of New Hampshire, where he was indicted for conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371. Twenty-two burglaries were listed as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. One of the listed acts was his \"unlawful[] ent[ry into] a business operated as Bernie's Store, Manchester, Connecticut.\" Caraballo pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended that he be held accountable for four burglaries resulting, collectively, in losses of $265,334.00. The PSR also recommended that Caraballo be held accountable for five other burglaries, resulting in either indeterminate loss or, as in the attempted Bernie's robbery, no loss at all. The PSR proposed a base offense level of sixteen (16) under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2X1.1 and 2B1.1(b)(1)(K). This calculation included fourteen (14) levels to reflect the loss of $265,334.00<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> plus two (2) additional levels because the burglaries involved \"more than minimal planning.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(A). The PSR then recommended an additional two (2) levels for reckless endangerment during flight (stemming from Caraballo's escape from Bernie's), see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.2, and two levels for obstruction of justice (stemming from an aborted plot to kill potential adverse witnesses),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1. The report subtracted three (3) levels for Caraballo's acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an adjusted offense level of seventeen (17). See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. Caraballo's criminal history category, which did not take into account any aspect of the Bernie's incident, was five (5). Caraballo's adjusted offense level and criminal history category together resulted in a sentencing range of forty-six to fifty-seven months. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A. The PSR concluded that Caraballo's sentence could be imposed to run concurrently with, partially concurrently with, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment relating to his Connecticut conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo argued for a wholly concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b). He contended that because he received a two-level upward adjustment in his total offense level for reckless endangerment relating to his escape from Bernie's, that burglary -- for which he was then serving his Connecticut sentence -- had been \"fully taken into account\" for the purpose of establishing his offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government requested wholly consecutive sentencing pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). The prosecution observed that no upward adjustment had been assigned for the Bernie's incident itself. Indeed, because no merchandise was stolen from the store, no upward adjustment could have been assigned. Moreover, the Bernie's incident had not been relied upon in setting Caraballo's criminal history category. For these reasons, the government argued that the crimes for which Caraballo was serving time in Connecticut were not \"fully\" taken into account, as required in order for &#167; 5G1.3(b) to take effect, and that his sentence should run consecutively to the undischarged Connecticut term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 1998, the district court sentenced Caraballo. The court ruled that the Bernie's incident had not been \"fully taken into account\" in the offense level determination. The court reasoned as follows: \"First of all . . . there were a number of . . . obviously criminal offenses[] that occurred there, all of which were not charged . . . [and for some of which] the defendant does not stand convicted and sentenced.\" Moreover, \"[t]here was no dollar loss from the Bernie's burglary, and therefore, [there has] been no adjustment to the defendant's overall offense level under [U.S.S.G. &#167;] 2B1.1 . . . . While reckless endangerment has taken some of these . . . offenses into account, . . . it certainly hasn't taken all of what went on that evening . . . into account fully.\" Thus, the court determined that the sentence was governed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c), not &#167; 5G1.3(b). Caraballo received a fifty-seven (57) month sentence, only nine months of which were to run concurrently with his undischarged Connecticut sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo now challenges the district court's decision to impose only nine months of the 57-month sentence on a concurrent basis. He does not challenge the district court's particular division of concurrent and consecutive time under &#167; 5G1.3(c), but only the court's decision to apply that subsection rather than &#167; 5G1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a district court's application of a sentencing guideline, we utilize a bifurcated process. \"First, we review the guideline's legal meaning and scope de novo. Next, we review the court's factfinding for clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted); see also United States v. Florence, 143 F.3d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike many &#167; 5G1.3 controversies, this appeal requires a purely legal determination, and thus calls for de novo review. Disputes involving &#167; 5G1.3 have almost invariably turned on whether or not the prior undischarged term rested on a conviction for conduct that was \"relevant\" to the instant offense. Typically, as in many of the cases cited by the parties, the central issue has been whether the conduct was \"relevant\" by virtue of having constituted \"part of a common scheme or plan.\" That inquiry, governed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, requires a factual determination as to whether the two violations were \"substantially connected\" by common victims, purposes, modus operandi, or accomplices.  See, e.g., United States v. Joost, 133 F.3d 125, 132 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Sheahan, 31 F.3d 595, 599 (8th Cir. 1994); United States v. McCaskey, 9 F.3d 368, 375-76 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Shewmaker, 936 F.2d 1124, 1129 (10th Cir. 1991). Such a factual determination merits review only for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal, however, is atypical. Caraballo was convicted and sentenced in Connecticut for the burglary at Bernie's and for his assault upon an officer during his escape from Bernie's. He does not dispute the district court's factual finding that the burglary and the assault constitute &#167; 1B1.3 \"relevant conduct\" for the purposes of sentencing the instant offense. Rather, he raises a purely legal question: Amidst undisputed factual findings and conduct that is all admittedly \"relevant,\" how are courts to interpret U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s term \"fully taken into account\"? When interpreting a Guideline, \"we cede no deference to the district court's legal conclusion.\" United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992). Our review, therefore, is de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Interpreting &#167; 5G1.3</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo contends that, as \"relevant conduct,\" the offenses underlying his Connecticut sentence were necessarily, as a matter of law, \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" irrespective of whether that conduct influenced the offense level. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo's argument rests on the contention that &#167; 5G1.3's reference to conduct \"fully taken into account\" denotes all &#167; 1B1.3 \"relevant conduct.\" Because all relevant conduct is necessarily \"taken into account in the determination of the offense level for [an] instant offense,\" Caraballo's construction would require us to treat &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s term \"fully\" as surplusage which does not at all modify the phrase \"taken into account.\" This we may not do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any conduct that is \"relevant\" to the instant offense under &#167; 1B1.3 must be \"taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense.\" Section 1B1.3 uses mandatory language: The instant offense's base offense level, specific offense characteristics, and adjustments all \"shall be determined on the basis of\" the conduct &#167; 1B1.3 defines as relevant. U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a) (emphasis added). Under the Guidelines, then, relevant conduct must be \"taken into account\" by the sentencing judge. Moreover, no other conduct -- no irrelevant conduct -- may be considered. See id. In a case such as Caraballo's, where the conduct in which the undischarged term is grounded is concededly \"relevant\" to the instant offense, that conduct, and only that conduct, is necessarily \"taken into account\" for the purposes of establishing an appropriate sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If all conduct that is \"taken into account\" is necessarily \"relevant\" under &#167; 1B1.3, then any interpretation positing that relevance is all that is demanded by &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s use of the phrase \"fully taken into account\" would render meaningless the word \"fully.\" We are prohibited from adopting any such construction, for it is axiomatic that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[a]ll words and provisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless, redundant or superfluous.\" We think that this principle is fully applicable to the sentencing guidelines, which, although they are not statutes, are to be construed in much the same fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

We thus strive to interpret it in a manner consistent with &#167; 1B1.3's definition of \"relevant conduct\" and the principles outlined above. Conduct \"taken into account\" must include all \"relevant conduct\" under &#167; 1B1.3, but neither &#167; 5G1.3(b) itself nor the accompanying notes elaborate which particular subset of \"relevant conduct\" is signified by the word \"fully.\" Thus, in interpreting &#167; 5G1.3, we must attempt to construe the provision in the manner that best effects its intended purpose. See United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that the tools of statutory construction apply to the Guidelines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389 (1995), the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the purpose behind &#167; 5G1.3. A majority of the Court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> found that the section was designed \"to mitigate the possibility that the fortuity of two separate prosecutions will grossly increase a defendant's sentence.\" Id. at 405. Where a defendant's related crimes \"are not prosecuted in the same proceeding . . . &#167; 5G1.3 . . . attempts to achieve some coordination of sentences . . . with an eye toward having such punishments approximate the total penalty that would have been imposed had the sentences . . . been imposed at the same time (i.e., had all the offenses been prosecuted in a single proceeding).\" Id. at 404-05. We have embraced this interpretation of the purpose animating &#167; 5G1.3, see United States v. Joost, 133 F.3d 125, 132 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating that section's \"core purpose\" is \"to address the unfairness that would result from receiving a second sentence for activities that were considered as relevant conduct in a prior proceeding\" (quoting United States v. Kimble, 107 F.3d 712, 714 (9th Cir. 1997))), as have several other courts of appeals, see, e.g., United States v. Dorsey, 166 F.3d 558, 562 (3d Cir. 1999); United States v. Fuentes, 107 F.3d 1515, 1523 (11th Cir. 1997); Prewitt v. United States, 83 F.3d 812, 817 (7th Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus widely acknowledged that &#167; 5G1.3 is directed at the prevention of duplicative sentencing for any particular conduct. Only one interpretation would conform &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s \"fully taken into account\" language to this purpose: Whereas all &#167; 1B1.3 \"relevant conduct\" must be \"taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" only relevant conduct that has resulted in -- or that could have resulted in<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> -- a change in the instant offense's \"offense level\" is \"fully taken into account\" under &#167; 5G1.3(b). That is, only when the defendant's undischarged term of imprisonment \"resulted from offense(s) that\" not only were \"relevant conduct\" vs-a-vs the instant offense, but also impacted (or could have impacted) the defendant's offense level or criminal history category, is the district judge bound to choose concurrent sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Otherwise, the judge is free to impose a concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive sentence under &#167; 5G1.3(c). This framework ensures that offenders will not be sentenced doubly for any given criminal act. However, it also preserves the district court's authority to impose appropriate punishment when some aspects of the offender's conduct are punishable in one jurisdiction and other aspects are punishable in another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, where the defendant's \"instant offense\" actually incorporates multiple offenses, only some (or one) of which, if sentenced alone, would merit concurrent sentencing under &#167; 5G1.3(b), that subsection's purpose is best served by a rule allowing sentencing of the combined \"instant offense\" pursuant to &#167; 5G1.3(c). We concur with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rule requiring application of &#167; 5G1.3(b) where only some of the offenses for which the defendant is serving the undischarged prison term were taken into account would require concurrent sentences in situations where &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s rationale would not fully apply. On the other hand, rejection of &#167; 5G1.3(b) in such multiple-offenses situations would leave the court free fully to consider, under &#167; 5G1.3(c), all of the potential permutations and complexities that arise in a multiple-offenses context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Kimble, 107 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, we see no reason why a defendant already serving an undischarged term for multiple offenses, only one of which was \"fully taken into account\" in determining the instant offense's offense level, should merit a wholly concurrent sentence. Such an outcome would not serve the purpose animating &#167; 5G1.3(b) because the instant offense might well involve violations wholly unrelated to the conduct underlying the undischarged term. In such a case, each prison term would include time for offenses that were not at all accounted for by the other term; mandatory concurrent sentencing would be inappropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Myers, 66 F.3d 1364, 1376 (4th Cir. 1995) (allowing consecutive sentencing under &#167; 5G1.3(c) where defendants were already serving undischarged term for rape and instant offense level included adjustments for assault and physical injury to the victim, because \"there are obvious components of rape that [were] not entirely encompassed by findings of assault and physical injury\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In multiple-offenses cases of this sort, then, district courts are free, under &#167; 5G1.3(c), to choose wholly concurrent, partially concurrent, or wholly consecutive sentencing. The courts' discretion is cabined, though, by that subsection's requirement that the sentence be designed \"to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). Thus, for example, when some, but not all, of the conduct from which the underlying term resulted is \"fully taken into account\" in determining the offense level for the instant offense, it would be appropriate for the sentencing judge to run that portion of the sentence corresponding to such conduct concurrently with the underlying term. That decision, though, would be governed by &#167; 5G1.3(c), not &#167; 5G1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, when a defendant is serving an undischarged term for conduct all of which has influenced the final \"offense level\" applicable to the instant offense, the entire sentence for that instant offense must run concurrently with the undischarged term, pursuant to &#167; 5B1.3(b). When none of the conduct related to the undischarged term influences the instant offense's offense level, the district court is free to impose a wholly concurrent, partially concurrent, or wholly consecutive sentence, in accordance with &#167; 5G1.3(c). When some of the conduct underlying an undischarged term impacted the offense level, but other aspects of that conduct did not, the sentencing judge again enjoys discretion under &#167; 5G1.3(c), but must remain mindful of that subsection's directive that the combined punishment be \"reasonable,\" and of the overarching purpose of &#167; 5G1.3 -- namely, the prevention of duplicative punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the &#167; 5G1.3 mechanism, as we here interpret it, Caraballo's sentence must be affirmed. Though Caraballo's federal sentence and his Connecticut sentence both punished his attack upon the police officer outside Bernie's, each also addressed conduct that was not taken into account by the other sentence. Specifically, the federal term (and only the federal term) punished the conspiracy with respect to all the burglaries resulting in losses, as well as Caraballo's aborted plot to murder adverse witnesses, while the Connecticut term (and only the Connecticut term) addressed the failed Bernie's heist. Because the federal term was not at all impacted by the Bernie's heist, as the result either of a changed offense level or an increased criminal history category, and because that term addressed crimes other than those addressed by the Connecticut sentence, we are confident that the Bernie's burglary falls into the category of conduct that was not \"fully taken into account\" for &#167; 5G1.3(b) purposes. In contrast, because Caraballo's assault upon the Connecticut police officer, for which he was sentenced in Connecticut, also resulted in a two-level upward adjustment to his instant offense level, that conduct likely was \"fully taken into account.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, then, the district court properly applied &#167; 5G1.3(c), which allows any combination of concurrent and consecutive sentencing. Connecticut law permitted enhanced punishment for Caraballo's attempt to rob Bernie's; federal law did not. No duplicative punishment for the burglary was ever threatened. Caraballo was only forced to bear the full brunt of all conduct deemed illegal by the relevant sovereign. To permit consecutive sentencing in such circumstances is merely to preserve the district court's discretion to ensure just punishment for all criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appropriately addressed the risk of punishing Caraballo doubly for his attack upon the Connecticut police officer by exercising its discretion under &#167; 5G1.3(c) to run part -- specifically, nine months -- of Caraballo's federal sentence concurrently with his Connecticut sentence. Caraballo does not challenge, and we do not address, the district court's application of its discretion under &#167; 5G1.3(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, because not all of the conduct from which Caraballo's Connecticut term resulted influenced his ultimate offense level, not all of it was \"fully taken into account\" under &#167; 5G1.3(b). The court below thus correctly chose to apply &#167; 5G1.3(c) instead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  All discussion herein refers to the Guidelines as they existed in 1998, the year in which Caraballo was sentenced.

Where, as here, \"the defendant or a coconspirator completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense,\" the Guidelines assign punishment for conspiracy to commit a substantive offense equivalent to the punishment for the underlying offense itself.

If the Guidelines' drafters had intended the two as synonyms, we believe they simply would have used the already-defined term \"relevant conduct\" in &#167; 5G1.3(b). The key passage, then, would have forbidden consecutive sentencing when \"the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that constituted 'relevant conduct' in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" rather than when it \"resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account\" in making that determination. The drafters chose not to use the former language, which would clearly and simply have enacted Caraballo's proposed interpretation, and we perceive in that choice a decision to prohibit consecutive sentencing only when the undischarged term is grounded in a behavior constituting a particular subset of \"relevant conduct.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  We are mindful of our decision in United States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1 (1995), a case factually quite distinct from this one. Defendant Gondek was arrested for possession of a firearm while on parole after serving a state prison term. His parole was revoked and he was sentenced to three years for the violation. Gondek was also prosecuted, and sentenced, under the federal felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). The district court set Gondek's sentence to run consecutively to his three-year state term, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). Gondek, 65 F.3d at 2. On appeal, Gondek argued, inter alia, that the court should have applied subsection (b) instead. We rejected his claim, finding that &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s \"fully taken into account\" language required at the least that \"the prior criminal conduct is also offense conduct in the present case.\" Id. at 4. There, it was not. Thus, while we noted that &#167; 5G1.3(b) would apply to \"a federal prosecution that treated the state offense as relevant conduct in determining the federal offense level,\" id., we did not have cause to determine the precise circumstances in which such conduct would be deemed to have been so treated.</p>\n        <p>In this case, however, it is necessary to pursue that inquiry. Gondek's state crime was a parole violation, which was not &#167; 1B1.3 \"relevant conduct\" with respect to his felon-in-possession prosecution. Caraballo's state crime, though, was a burglary that was incorporated into his federal conspiracy prosecution. Thus, here, \"the prior criminal conduct is also offense conduct in the present case,\" and we must proceed to determine whether that conduct was \"fully taken into account.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  Although such a \"change\" will, in most instances, mean an enhanced sentencing range,&#167; 5G1.3(b)'s \"fully taken into account\" language could in some circumstances also encompass conduct that results in a diminished range.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  Section 2B1.1 requires that losses resulting from a string of thefts be considered cumulatively. Thus, discrete losses that would push an offender into a higher sentencing range in some circumstances will not do so in others, because the offender will fall within the same category irrespective of that particular loss. Where the conduct resulting in such a loss underlies a previously undischarged term, that conduct has been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense\" irrespective of whether or not it has actually caused an adjustment to the offense level.</p>\n        <p>For example, if the Bernie's burglary had resulted in a loss of $50,000, it still would not have impacted the offense level calculation under &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1), because the total loss from all the burglaries would have been $315,334.00, still within the $200,000.00 - $350,000.00 range. However, the burglary, in that case, would nonetheless have been \"fully taken into account\" because there are circumstances in which a $50,000 burglary could have made a difference in his sentencing range. The same cannot be said for a $0 loss, which cannot, in any circumstance, impact the sentencing range.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  The Witte Court was fragmented, but five Justices joined in the analysis of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  See note 9, supra.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p>  We note that conduct need not necessarily result in a longer prison term in order to have been \"fully taken into account.\" Because, for consecutive offense levels within any given criminal history category, the Guidelines prescribe overlapping ranges rather than particular sentences, it is always possible -- except in the case of a mandatory \"life\" term -- that an offender sentenced at a given offense level will receive a more severe sentence than an offender sentenced at one level higher. What matters for &#167; 5G1.3 purposes is not the actual sentence but the defendant's offense level.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p>  In light of Caraballo's criminal history category, those nine months correspond roughly to the difference between the sentencing range resulting from an offense level of seventeen (17) (the post-adjustment offense level) and the range resulting from an offense level of fifteen (15) (the offense level that would have applied in the absence of the \"reckless endangerment during flight\" adjustment). See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A. Moreover, this correspondence is by no means fortuitous. At sentencing, the district court observed that it had \"tried to take into consideration to some degree the fact that the sentence that Mr. Caraballo is serving in Connecticut is for offenses that were included in part of the overall conspiracy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Caraballo argues that the relationship between the conduct underlying the two offenses requires wholly concurrent sentencing under section 5G1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We disagree, and therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Legal Context</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines (the \"Guidelines\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> prescribe a range of months appropriate for each federal offender's sentence. The recommended range takes into account the \"offense level\" for the violation being punished (the \"instant offense\") and the defendant's \"criminal history category.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A. The \"offense level\" consists of a \"base offense level\" corresponding to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted, as modified by mandatory \"adjustments\" which take account of certain aggravating or mitigating factors. In determining the applicable offense level, district courts must consider (and must only consider) conduct that is \"relevant\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5G1.3 of the Guidelines addresses cases in which the defendant, at sentencing, is already serving a term of imprisonment. Subsection 5G1.3(b) requires that when the undischarged term \"resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" the new sentence must run concurrently with, rather than consecutively to, the undischarged term. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b). Where the prior offenses have not been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" however, &#167; 5G1.3(c) allows the sentence for the instant offense to \"be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term . . . to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\" Id. &#167; 5G1.3(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue is whether conduct that is \"relevant\" under &#167; 1B1.3 must necessarily be deemed to have been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" irrespective of whether or not that conduct in fact altered the sentencing range for the offense. We find that it need not, and that here, where \"relevant\" conduct has not resulted in any change in the defendant's offense level -- or even in his criminal history category -- the district court appropriately eschewed &#167; 5G1.3(b) in favor of &#167; 5G1.3(c)'s discretionary approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1993 and 1996, Caraballo and several confederates committed numerous burglaries throughout New England. Though not all of the conspirators participated in each burglary, the group's members assisted one another in various ways, engaging in joint research, planning, and execution of the heists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1995, Caraballo and two partners, Valdir Alvarenga and Nelson Rivera, attempted to burgle Bernie's Appliance Store in Manchester, Connecticut (\"Bernie's\"). Connecticut police officers had learned of the plan prior to the attack, however, and were lying in wait inside and outside of Bernie's. Upon noticing the officers' presence, Rivera fled the store. During Caraballo's plea colloquy, the district court described the ensuing events, to which Caraballo admitted, thusly:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here was a confrontation between officers and Alvarenga and Caraballo inside the store. Caraballo, [who] was armed with a pair of long-handled cutting shears, . . . moved towards one of the officers in . . . an offensive attack position. At that point the police holstered their weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarenga noticed that the officers were focused on Caraballo and moved into a position to attack one of the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police then observed Alvarenga, armed with an ax, approaching and instructed him to drop the weapon, which he refused to do. . . . [T]he officer was forced to shoot, and . . . Alvarenga . . . was mortally wounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo then fled the premises, entered a vehicle outside and began to drive away. Before Caraballo could effectuate his escape, a police officer squeezed his torso through the passenger-side window and ordered him to stop. When Caraballo continued driving, the officer shot him in the leg. Caraballo accelerated, throwing the officer to the ground, and then attempted to run over another officer. Shortly thereafter he was involved in an accident, which led to his apprehension and arrest. No property was taken from Bernie's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo was prosecuted in Connecticut's Superior Court on charges stemming from the Bernie's burglary. Although the record is not entirely clear, it appears that he pleaded guilty to burglary and assault on an officer. In any event, on June 28, 1996, the court sentenced Caraballo to an eight-year prison term for the former and a concurrent prison term for the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo also faced federal charges in the District of New Hampshire, where he was indicted for conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371. Twenty-two burglaries were listed as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. One of the listed acts was his \"unlawful[] ent[ry into] a business operated as Bernie's Store, Manchester, Connecticut.\" Caraballo pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended that he be held accountable for four burglaries resulting, collectively, in losses of $265,334.00. The PSR also recommended that Caraballo be held accountable for five other burglaries, resulting in either indeterminate loss or, as in the attempted Bernie's robbery, no loss at all. The PSR proposed a base offense level of sixteen (16) under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2X1.1 and 2B1.1(b)(1)(K). This calculation included fourteen (14) levels to reflect the loss of $265,334.00<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> plus two (2) additional levels because the burglaries involved \"more than minimal planning.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(A). The PSR then recommended an additional two (2) levels for reckless endangerment during flight (stemming from Caraballo's escape from Bernie's), see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.2, and two levels for obstruction of justice (stemming from an aborted plot to kill potential adverse witnesses),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1. The report subtracted three (3) levels for Caraballo's acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an adjusted offense level of seventeen (17). See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. Caraballo's criminal history category, which did not take into account any aspect of the Bernie's incident, was five (5). Caraballo's adjusted offense level and criminal history category together resulted in a sentencing range of forty-six to fifty-seven months. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A. The PSR concluded that Caraballo's sentence could be imposed to run concurrently with, partially concurrently with, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment relating to his Connecticut conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo argued for a wholly concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b). He contended that because he received a two-level upward adjustment in his total offense level for reckless endangerment relating to his escape from Bernie's, that burglary -- for which he was then serving his Connecticut sentence -- had been \"fully taken into account\" for the purpose of establishing his offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government requested wholly consecutive sentencing pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). The prosecution observed that no upward adjustment had been assigned for the Bernie's incident itself. Indeed, because no merchandise was stolen from the store, no upward adjustment could have been assigned. Moreover, the Bernie's incident had not been relied upon in setting Caraballo's criminal history category. For these reasons, the government argued that the crimes for which Caraballo was serving time in Connecticut were not \"fully\" taken into account, as required in order for &#167; 5G1.3(b) to take effect, and that his sentence should run consecutively to the undischarged Connecticut term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 1998, the district court sentenced Caraballo. The court ruled that the Bernie's incident had not been \"fully taken into account\" in the offense level determination. The court reasoned as follows: \"First of all . . . there were a number of . . . obviously criminal offenses[] that occurred there, all of which were not charged . . . [and for some of which] the defendant does not stand convicted and sentenced.\" Moreover, \"[t]here was no dollar loss from the Bernie's burglary, and therefore, [there has] been no adjustment to the defendant's overall offense level under [U.S.S.G. &#167;] 2B1.1 . . . . While reckless endangerment has taken some of these . . . offenses into account, . . . it certainly hasn't taken all of what went on that evening . . . into account fully.\" Thus, the court determined that the sentence was governed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c), not &#167; 5G1.3(b). Caraballo received a fifty-seven (57) month sentence, only nine months of which were to run concurrently with his undischarged Connecticut sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo now challenges the district court's decision to impose only nine months of the 57-month sentence on a concurrent basis. He does not challenge the district court's particular division of concurrent and consecutive time under &#167; 5G1.3(c), but only the court's decision to apply that subsection rather than &#167; 5G1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a district court's application of a sentencing guideline, we utilize a bifurcated process. \"First, we review the guideline's legal meaning and scope de novo.

Disputes involving &#167; 5G1.3 have almost invariably turned on whether or not the prior undischarged term rested on a conviction for conduct that was \"relevant\" to the instant offense. Typically, as in many of the cases cited by the parties, the central issue has been whether the conduct was \"relevant\" by virtue of having constituted \"part of a common scheme or plan.\" That inquiry, governed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, requires a factual determination as to whether the two violations were \"substantially connected\" by common victims, purposes, modus operandi, or accomplices.  See, e.g., United States v. Joost, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750075\"><a href=\"/opinion/750075/united-states-v-robert-m-joost/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.

Caraballo was convicted and sentenced in Connecticut for the burglary at Bernie's and for his assault upon an officer during his escape from Bernie's. He does not dispute the district court's factual finding that the burglary and the assault constitute &#167; 1B1.3 \"relevant conduct\" for the purposes of sentencing the instant offense. Rather, he raises a purely legal question: Amidst undisputed factual findings and conduct that is all admittedly \"relevant,\" how are courts to interpret U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s term \"fully taken into account\"? When interpreting a Guideline, \"we cede no deference to the district court's legal conclusion.\" United States v.

Only one interpretation would conform &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s \"fully taken into account\" language to this purpose: Whereas all &#167; 1B1.3 \"relevant conduct\" must be \"taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" only relevant conduct that has resulted in -- or that could have resulted in<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> -- a change in the instant offense's \"offense level\" is \"fully taken into account\" under &#167; 5G1.3(b). That is, only when the defendant's undischarged term of imprisonment \"resulted from offense(s) that\" not only were \"relevant conduct\" vs-a-vs the instant offense, but also impacted (or could have impacted) the defendant's offense level or criminal history category, is the district judge bound to choose concurrent sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Otherwise, the judge is free to impose a concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive sentence under &#167; 5G1.3(c). This framework ensures that offenders will not be sentenced doubly for any given criminal act. However, it also preserves the district court's authority to impose appropriate punishment when some aspects of the offender's conduct are punishable in one jurisdiction and other aspects are punishable in another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, where the defendant's \"instant offense\" actually incorporates multiple offenses, only some (or one) of which, if sentenced alone, would merit concurrent sentencing under &#167; 5G1.3(b), that subsection's purpose is best served by a rule allowing sentencing of the combined \"instant offense\" pursuant to &#167; 5G1.3(c). We concur with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rule requiring application of &#167; 5G1.3(b) where only some of the offenses for which the defendant is serving the undischarged prison term were taken into account would require concurrent sentences in situations where &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s rationale would not fully apply. On the other hand, rejection of &#167; 5G1.3(b) in such multiple-offenses situations would leave the court free fully to consider, under &#167; 5G1.3(c), all of the potential permutations and complexities that arise in a multiple-offenses context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

Such an outcome would not serve the purpose animating &#167; 5G1.3(b) because the instant offense might well involve violations wholly unrelated to the conduct underlying the undischarged term. In such a case, each prison term would include time for offenses that were not at all accounted for by the other term; mandatory concurrent sentencing would be inappropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Myers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705170\"><a href=\"/opinion/705170/united-states-v-bobby-myers-jr-united-states-of-america-v-jarmal-lamar/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>, 1376 (4th Cir. 1995) (allowing consecutive sentencing under &#167; 5G1.3(c) where defendants were already serving undischarged term for rape and instant offense level included adjustments for assault and physical injury to the victim, because \"there are obvious components of rape that [were] not entirely encompassed by findings of assault and physical injury\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In multiple-offenses cases of this sort, then, district courts are free, under &#167; 5G1.3(c), to choose wholly concurrent, partially concurrent, or wholly consecutive sentencing. The courts' discretion is cabined, though, by that subsection's requirement that the sentence be designed \"to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). Thus, for example, when some, but not all, of the conduct from which the underlying term resulted is \"fully taken into account\" in determining the offense level for the instant offense, it would be appropriate for the sentencing judge to run that portion of the sentence corresponding to such conduct concurrently with the underlying term. That decision, though, would be governed by &#167; 5G1.3(c), not &#167; 5G1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, when a defendant is serving an undischarged term for conduct all of which has influenced the final \"offense level\" applicable to the instant offense, the entire sentence for that instant offense must run concurrently with the undischarged term, pursuant to &#167; 5B1.3(b). When none of the conduct related to the undischarged term influences the instant offense's offense level, the district court is free to impose a wholly concurrent, partially concurrent, or wholly consecutive sentence, in accordance with &#167; 5G1.3(c). When some of the conduct underlying an undischarged term impacted the offense level, but other aspects of that conduct did not, the sentencing judge again enjoys discretion under &#167; 5G1.3(c), but must remain mindful of that subsection's directive that the combined punishment be \"reasonable,\" and of the overarching purpose of &#167; 5G1.3 -- namely, the prevention of duplicative punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the &#167; 5G1.3 mechanism, as we here interpret it, Caraballo's sentence must be affirmed. Though Caraballo's federal sentence and his Connecticut sentence both punished his attack upon the police officer outside Bernie's, each also addressed conduct that was not taken into account by the other sentence. Specifically, the federal term (and only the federal term) punished the conspiracy with respect to all the burglaries resulting in losses, as well as Caraballo's aborted plot to murder adverse witnesses, while the Connecticut term (and only the Connecticut term) addressed the failed Bernie's heist. Because the federal term was not at all impacted by the Bernie's heist, as the result either of a changed offense level or an increased criminal history category, and because that term addressed crimes other than those addressed by the Connecticut sentence, we are confident that the Bernie's burglary falls into the category of conduct that was not \"fully taken into account\" for &#167; 5G1.3(b) purposes. In contrast, because Caraballo's assault upon the Connecticut police officer, for which he was sentenced in Connecticut, also resulted in a two-level upward adjustment to his instant offense level, that conduct likely was \"fully taken into account.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, then, the district court properly applied &#167; 5G1.3(c), which allows any combination of concurrent and consecutive sentencing. Connecticut law permitted enhanced punishment for Caraballo's attempt to rob Bernie's; federal law did not. No duplicative punishment for the burglary was ever threatened. Caraballo was only forced to bear the full brunt of all conduct deemed illegal by the relevant sovereign. To permit consecutive sentencing in such circumstances is merely to preserve the district court's discretion to ensure just punishment for all criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appropriately addressed the risk of punishing Caraballo doubly for his attack upon the Connecticut police officer by exercising its discretion under &#167; 5G1.3(c) to run part -- specifically, nine months -- of Caraballo's federal sentence concurrently with his Connecticut sentence. Caraballo does not challenge, and we do not address, the district court's application of its discretion under &#167; 5G1.3(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, because not all of the conduct from which Caraballo's Connecticut term resulted influenced his ultimate offense level, not all of it was \"fully taken into account\" under &#167; 5G1.3(b). The court below thus correctly chose to apply &#167; 5G1.3(c) instead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  All discussion herein refers to the Guidelines as they existed in 1998, the year in which Caraballo was sentenced.

If the Guidelines' drafters had intended the two as synonyms, we believe they simply would have used the already-defined term \"relevant conduct\" in &#167; 5G1.3(b). The key passage, then, would have forbidden consecutive sentencing when \"the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that constituted 'relevant conduct' in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\" rather than when it \"resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account\" in making that determination. The drafters chose not to use the former language, which would clearly and simply have enacted Caraballo's proposed interpretation, and we perceive in that choice a decision to prohibit consecutive sentencing only when the undischarged term is grounded in a behavior constituting a particular subset of \"relevant conduct.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  We are mindful of our decision in United States v.

Defendant Gondek was arrested for possession of a firearm while on parole after serving a state prison term. His parole was revoked and he was sentenced to three years for the violation. Gondek was also prosecuted, and sentenced, under the federal felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). The district court set Gondek's sentence to run consecutively to his three-year state term, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196276\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gondek,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196276/united-states-v-gondek/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>. On appeal, Gondek argued, inter alia, that the court should have applied subsection (b) instead. We rejected his claim, finding that &#167; 5G1.3(b)'s \"fully taken into account\" language required at the least that \"the prior criminal conduct is also offense conduct in the present case.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 4. </span>There, it was not. Thus, while we noted that &#167; 5G1.3(b) would apply to \"a federal prosecution that treated the state offense as relevant conduct in determining the federal offense level,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> we did </span>not have cause to determine the precise circumstances in which such conduct would be deemed to have been so treated.</p>\n        <p>In this case, however, it is necessary to pursue that inquiry. Gondek's state crime was a parole violation, which was not &#167; 1B1.3 \"relevant conduct\" with respect to his felon-in-possession prosecution. Caraballo's state crime, though, was a burglary that was incorporated into his federal conspiracy prosecution. Thus, here, \"the prior criminal conduct is also offense conduct in the present case,\" and we must proceed to determine whether that conduct was \"fully taken into account.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  Although such a \"change\" will, in most instances, mean an enhanced sentencing range,&#167; 5G1.3(b)'s \"fully taken into account\" language could in some circumstances also encompass conduct that results in a diminished range.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  Section 2B1.1 requires that losses resulting from a string of thefts be considered cumulatively. Thus, discrete losses that would push an offender into a higher sentencing range in some circumstances will not do so in others, because the offender will fall within the same category irrespective of that particular loss. Where the conduct resulting in such a loss underlies a previously undischarged term, that conduct has been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense\" irrespective of whether or not it has actually caused an adjustment to the offense level.</p>\n        <p>For example, if the Bernie's burglary had resulted in a loss of $50,000, it still would not have impacted the offense level calculation under &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1), because the total loss from all the burglaries would have been $315,334.00, still within the $200,000.00 - $350,000.00 range. However, the burglary, in that case, would nonetheless have been \"fully taken into account\" because there are circumstances in which a $50,000 burglary could have made a difference in his sentencing range. The same cannot be said for a $0 loss, which cannot, in any circumstance, impact the sentencing range.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  The Witte Court was fragmented, but five Justices joined in the analysis of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  See note <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">9,</span> supra</span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p>  We note that conduct need not necessarily result in a longer prison term in order to have been \"fully taken into account.\" Because, for consecutive offense levels within any given criminal history category, the Guidelines prescribe overlapping ranges rather than particular sentences, it is always possible -- except in the case of a mandatory \"life\" term -- that an offender sentenced at a given offense level will receive a more severe sentence than an offender sentenced at one level higher. What matters for &#167; 5G1.3 purposes is not the actual sentence but the defendant's offense level.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p>  In light of Caraballo's criminal history category, those nine months correspond roughly to the difference between the sentencing range resulting from an offense level of seventeen (17) (the post-adjustment offense level) and the range resulting from an offense level of fifteen (15) (the offense level that would have applied in the absence of the \"reckless endangerment during flight\" adjustment). See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A. Moreover, this correspondence is by no means fortuitous. At sentencing, the district court observed that it had \"tried to take into consideration to some degree the fact that the sentence that Mr. Caraballo is serving in Connecticut is for offenses that were included in part of the overall conspiracy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
