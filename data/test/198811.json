Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                   Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and O'Toole, District Judge. \r\n\nHarold D. Vicente-Coln, with whom Vicente &amp; Cuebas was on\r\nbrief, for appellants.\r\nGraciela J. Belaval, with whom Martnez, Odell &amp; Calabria was\r\non brief, for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 2, 2000\r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  In this age discrimination suit\r\nbrought by a plant manager whose employment was terminated when he\r\nwas 55 years old, the district court entered summary judgment for\r\nthe defendant, Suttle Caribe, on the recommendation of the\r\nmagistrate judge.  Both judges found that the plaintiff, Alberto\r\nDomnguez-Cruz, made out a prima facie case of age discrimination\r\nunder the familiar McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks framework.  They\r\ndetermined, however, that he had not overcome Suttle Caribe's\r\narticulated non-discriminatory reason for the termination with\r\nevidence sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to conclude\r\nthat the termination was motivated by age discrimination.\r\nThe record shows that the employer has, at different\r\ntimes, articulated to varied audiences different reasons for ending\r\nthe plaintiff's employment.  At times, Suttle Caribe has said that\r\nthe termination was not an issue of performance but was instead the\r\nresult of a business restructuring plan that involved the\r\nelimination of the plant manager position.  At other times, Suttle\r\nCaribe has claimed that the termination was based on the\r\nplaintiff's job performance.  At still other times, Suttle Caribe\r\nhas said that violations of company policy and insubordination were\r\nthe reasons for the termination.  In addition to the potentially\r\ninconsistent reasons the company gave for the termination, notes of\r\na conversation between a member of the personnel department and the\r\nkey decisionmaker in the plaintiff's termination include --\r\nunusually and unfortunately for the company -- the phrases \"age\r\ndescrim. [sic]\" and \"cover up.\"  Finally, the key decisionmaker\r\nreferred to the plaintiff more than once as an \"old fart\" in front\r\nof two younger employees who would eventually assume many of the\r\nplaintiff's job responsibilities.  One of those younger employees\r\nin turn referred to the plaintiff as \"el viejo\" (\"the old one\" or\r\n\"the old man\") and told another employee at least a year before the\r\nplaintiff's termination that he had been offered the plaintiff's\r\njob.  While the termination of the plaintiff's employment may prove\r\nto have been innocent of age discrimination, these facts are surely\r\nenough to raise genuine issues of material fact that should be left\r\nto the jury.  We reverse entry of summary judgment and remand.\r\n                              I\r\nAlberto Domnguez-Cruz began working for Suttle Caribe on\r\nOctober 12, 1978.  He was hired to set up and manage Suttle\r\nCaribe's plant in Humacao, Puerto Rico, and he continued in the\r\nposition of plant manager until his termination on September 22,\r\n1995.  He was 55 years old at the time of his termination. \r\nAlthough his record was not spotless, all parties agree that\r\nDomnguez-Cruz performed his job well.  He successfully launched\r\nand nurtured Suttle Caribe's Puerto Rico operations and received\r\nrecognition for his efforts in the form of positive performance\r\nevaluations, merit pay increases, and commendations.  In fact, his\r\nimmediate supervisor agreed that the plaintiff's 1993 performance\r\nevaluation characterized him as \"an outstanding employee and\r\nmanager[,] in general terms.\"  In addition, Domnguez-Cruz received\r\na merit pay increase for 1995. \r\nIn 1994, upper management at Suttle Caribe's parent\r\ncompany, Suttle Apparatus, began a restructuring initiative,\r\ndesigned to reduce costs and standardize operations by putting the\r\n\"right people in the right place.\"  Domnguez-Cruz directed this\r\ninitiative at Suttle Caribe and, as a result, was responsible for\r\nterminating the employment of a number of employees in 1994.\r\nAlthough the company now claims that the long-term plan had always\r\nbeen to eliminate the  plant manager position, the plaintiff\r\ntestified that he was not aware that the restructuring initiative\r\nmight result in the loss of his job.\r\nIn September 1995, Dean Ovitt, Vice President of\r\nManufacturing for Suttle Apparatus and Domnguez-Cruz's direct\r\nsupervisor as of late 1992, and Jeffrey Berg, President of Suttle\r\nApparatus, traveled to Puerto Rico to meet with Domnguez-Cruz and\r\nto assess Suttle Caribe's operations.  During this time, Domnguez-\r\nCruz had conversations with both Berg and Ovitt pertaining to his\r\nconcerns with some of the proposed changes to the organizational\r\nchart.  In addition, Berg and Ovitt discussed with Domnguez-Cruz\r\nsome of their complaints regarding his handling of certain\r\nsituations, including an accident involving a company vehicle, the\r\nawarding of a contract to an employee, and the filing of\r\nunemployment paperwork associated with an employee's leave of\r\nabsence.  On September 22, 1995, Ovitt, with the consent of Berg\r\nand Curtis Sampson, the Chief Executive Officer and President of\r\nthe Board of Directors, informed Domnguez-Cruz that his employment\r\nwas being terminated.  Ovitt told Domnguez-Cruz that the plant\r\nmanager position was being eliminated as a part of the\r\norganization's restructuring plan.\r\nDomnguez-Cruz and his wife filed suit against Suttle\r\nCaribe in federal district court in May 1996, alleging age\r\ndiscrimination under both federal and Puerto Rican law and claiming\r\nviolations of various other provisions of Puerto Rican law.  They\r\nsought damages and a preliminary injunction reinstating Domnguez-\r\nCruz to his position and enjoining Suttle Caribe from\r\ndiscriminating or taking any retaliatory action against Domnguez-\r\nCruz.  On September 23, 1997, Suttle Caribe filed for summary\r\njudgment, arguing that Domnguez-Cruz had failed to make out a\r\nprima facie case of age discrimination and that he had failed to\r\nrebut its proffered non-discriminatory reasons for the termination.\r\nThe motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended\r\ngranting summary judgment to Suttle Caribe.  The district court\r\nagreed, concluding that although Domnguez-Cruz had put forth a\r\nprima facie case of age discrimination, he had failed to rebut\r\nSuttle Caribe's non-discriminatory reasons for the dismissal. \r\nSummary judgment was entered for Suttle Caribe and supplemental\r\njurisdiction over the Puerto Rican law claims was declined.\r\nDomnguez-Cruz appealed to this court.\r\n                              II\r\nOur review of the entry of summary judgment is de novo. \r\nSee Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 47 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nThe plaintiff offers two approaches to this case. \r\nFirst, he says that the ageist statements allegedly made by Ovitt\r\nand another individual and the notes taken by a personnel manager\r\nin a meeting with Ovitt constitute \"direct evidence\" of age\r\ndiscrimination.  Because he produced direct evidence sufficient to\r\nsustain his burden, Domnguez-Cruz says, summary judgment should\r\nhave been denied without resort to the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-\r\nHicks burden-shifting framework.  The district court rejected this\r\nargument, concluding that this evidence was not \"direct evidence\"\r\nbut instead constituted \"stray remarks\" that failed to \"tie\r\n[Domnguez-Cruz's] dismissal from Suttle to his age or to age\r\ndiscrimination.\"\r\nSecond, the plaintiff says that even under the McDonnell\r\nDouglas-Burdine-Hicks framework, summary judgment was improper\r\nbecause he produced evidence from which a jury could infer that the\r\nemployer's articulated reasons were pretextual and that age\r\ndiscrimination was the real reason for his termination.  See\r\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804-05 (1973);\r\nTexas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256\r\n(1981); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 515\r\n(1993).  The district court rejected this argument, finding that\r\nthe circumstantial evidence presented by the plaintiff was\r\ninsufficient to carry the burden of establishing that \"age-related\r\nanimus motivated [his] dismissal.\"\r\nWhen a plaintiff presents direct evidence of age\r\ndiscrimination, the defendant must then either \"deny the validity\r\nor the sufficiency of the plaintiff's evidence,\" and \"have the jury\r\n. . . decide[] whether plaintiff has proved discrimination by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence,\" see 8 Lex K. Larson, Employment\r\nDiscrimination  136.02, at 136-6 (2d ed. 1999), or \"prove that it\r\nwould have made the same decision even if it had not taken the\r\nprotected characteristic into account,\" see Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol\r\nMyers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95-96 (1st Cir. 1996), or both, if it\r\nchooses.  See also Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228\r\n(1989).  This burden makes it difficult, but not impossible, for\r\ndefendants to obtain summary judgment.  See Cardona Jimenez v.\r\nBancomercio De Puerto Rico, 174 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 1999);\r\nAlvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of Puerto Rico Bottling Co., 152 F.3d\r\n17, 24 (1st Cir. 1998); but see Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96\r\n(referring to the defendant's obligation to \"affirmatively prove\r\nthat it would have made the same decision\" in the summary judgment\r\ncontext).\r\nIt is often quite difficult to draw the line between what\r\nis \"direct evidence\" and what is \"circumstantial evidence.\"  See,\r\ne.g., Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 1999 WL 1252868, at\r\n*7 (1st Cir. Dec. 29, 1999) (noting that the First Circuit has yet\r\nto choose among different approaches to \"direct evidence\" and\r\n\"circumstantial evidence\" cases).  \"In many cases, the line between\r\nMcDonnell Douglas, on the one hand, and Price Waterhouse, on the\r\nother hand, is blurred.\"  F.W. Morse, 76 F.3d at 421.  In fact, one\r\nmight question whether these bright line articulations are so\r\nhelpful in the end.  See, e.g., Deborah C. Malamud, The Last\r\nMinuet: Disparate Treatment after Hicks, 93 Mich. L. Rev. 2229,\r\n2311 (1995) (suggesting that McDonnell Douglas does a poor job of\r\nshaping pre-trial decisionmaking, particularly at the summary\r\njudgment phase).\r\nIn appeals after trial, this and other courts have\r\nrecognized the need for flexibility and have sometimes bypassed\r\nthese approaches and instead looked at whether the totality of the\r\nevidence permits a finding of discrimination.  See F.W. Morse, 76\r\nF.3d at 421 (\"Discretion is sometimes the better part of valor, and\r\ncourts often wisely decide to sidestep difficult theoretical\r\nquestions if answers to them are not essential to the proper\r\nresolution of a given case.\"); see also Carson v. Bethlehem Steel\r\nCorp., 82 F.3d 157, 158 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"The central question in\r\nany employment-discrimination case is whether the employer would\r\nhave taken the same action had the employee been of a\r\ndifferent . . . age . . . and everything else had remained the\r\nsame.\").  In this case, we take this course, examining the totality\r\nof the evidence with the guidance of the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-\r\nHicks framework and reserving judgment on the \"direct evidence\"\r\nissue.\r\nA.  McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks\r\nUnder this framework, the plaintiff must first make a\r\nprima facie showing of age discrimination.  See Burdine, 450 U.S.\r\nat 252-53.  Because it is conceded for purposes of this appeal that\r\nDomnguez-Cruz established a prima facie case, we do not describe\r\nthe required components.\r\nOnce the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, a\r\npresumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the\r\nemployee is created and the burden shifts to the employer to\r\narticulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the dismissal.  See\r\nHicks, 509 U.S. at 506-07.  The defendant's burden at this stage is\r\nonly a burden of production; the burden of proof remains with the\r\nplaintiff at all times.  See id.  If the defendant meets this\r\nburden, the presumption of discrimination created by the prima\r\nfacie case drops away and the burden of production shifts back to\r\nthe plaintiff to show that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory\r\nreason was a pretext for discrimination.  See id. at 507-08.  At\r\nthis final stage of the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks framework,\r\nthis burden \"merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the\r\ncourt that [the plaintiff] has been the victim of intentional\r\ndiscrimination.\"  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; Thomas v. Sears,\r\nRoebuck &amp; Co., 144 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"The plaintiff\r\nbears the 'burden of proving that his years were the determinative\r\nfactor in his discharge, that is, that he would not have been fired\r\nbut for his age.'\" (quoting Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d\r\n1331, 1335 (1st Cir. 1988)).\r\nWhere, as here, the plaintiff has raised a prima facie\r\ncase and the defendant has met the burden of production, the\r\nMcDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks framework becomes less relevant. \r\nSee Hicks, 509 U.S. at 510.  At the summary judgment phase, \"courts\r\nshould not unduly complicate matters . . . by applying legal rules\r\nwhich were devised to govern the basic allocation of burdens and\r\norder of proof.\"  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825\r\n(1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \r\nInstead, the focus should be on the ultimate issue: whether,\r\nviewing the \"aggregate package of proof offered by the plaintiff\"\r\nand taking all inferences in the plaintiff's favor, the plaintiff\r\nhas raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether the termination of\r\nthe plaintiff's employment was motivated by age discrimination. \r\nId. at 824-25; see Pages-Cahue v. Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espaa,\r\n82 F.3d 533, 536 (1st Cir. 1996); Fennell v. First Step Designs,\r\nLtd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir. 1996); Olivera v. Nestle Puerto\r\nRico, Inc., 922 F.2d 43, 50 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\nWe hold that there was evidence presented on summary\r\njudgment from which a jury could (although need not) infer that the\r\nemployer's claimed reasons for terminating Domnguez-Cruz's\r\nemployment were pretextual and that the decision was the result of\r\ndiscriminatory animus.  First, the evidence put forth by the\r\nplaintiff in making his prima facie case clearly established that\r\nDean Ovitt, who was the plaintiff's direct supervisor and twelve\r\nyears younger than him, and Jeffrey Berg, who was two years younger\r\nthan the plaintiff, made the decision to terminate the plaintiff,\r\nwith Sampson's approval.  After his termination, Domnguez-Cruz's\r\njob responsibilities were assumed by Ovitt, Mario Medina, Suttle\r\nCaribe's Operations Manager, Nilda Torres, Suttle Caribe's then\r\nQuality Control Supervisor, and Adalberto Sierra, Suttle Caribe's\r\nPersonnel Manager.  All four individuals are younger than\r\nDomnguez-Cruz (although Sierra only by one year).  In fact, the\r\nevidence showed that Domnguez-Cruz was the oldest Suttle Caribe\r\nemployee.  In addition, while Suttle Caribe claims that Luis\r\n(\"Tony\") Hernndez, the Costa Rica plant manager, did not assume\r\nany of the plaintiff's job responsibilities, there is evidence that\r\nHernndez, who is ten years younger than the plaintiff, oversees\r\nMedina and Sierra and was selected for this position \"rather than\"\r\nthe plaintiff.\r\nSecond, and in addition to the evidence supporting\r\nDomnguez-Cruz's prima facie case, the defendant presented\r\nexplanations for Domnguez-Cruz's termination that could be viewed\r\nas inconsistent.  When Domnguez-Cruz was informed by Ovitt and\r\nJanice Wielke, a Suttle Apparatus personnel manager, that he was\r\nbeing dismissed, he was told that his position was being eliminated\r\nas a result of the restructuring plan.  That same day, a memorandum\r\nfrom Ovitt was distributed to all employees, informing them that\r\nsome \"organizational changes\" would be made as a part of the\r\n\"restructuring of the organization.\"  Ovitt's notes made shortly\r\nbefore the plaintiff was informed of the decision support the\r\nrestructuring explanation:  \"This reorganization is not a\r\nperformance issue.  This was a difficult decision of restructuring\r\nthe company to combine operation resourses [sic] and better utilize\r\nresourses [sic] available.\"  When Domnguez-Cruz contacted Sampson\r\nfor an explanation, he received a letter stating that Hernndez had\r\nbeen selected \"rather than\" himself to sit on the committee that\r\nwould oversee Suttle Caribe operations.  When the plaintiff met\r\nwith Sampson a week or so later, Sampson told him that while there\r\nhad been some complaints about his performance, they were \"not\r\nimportant.\"\r\nHowever, in its answer to Domnguez-Cruz's complaint,\r\nSuttle Caribe changed its reasons for the termination of\r\nplaintiff's employment.  It denied that the plaintiff was\r\ndischarged as a result of restructuring, instead claiming that\r\n\"Plaintiff was terminated for his repeated failure to abide by\r\ncompany policies and to commit to the team efforts as required.\" \r\nAt another point in the answer, Suttle Caribe stated that the\r\nplaintiff's termination \"was determined exclusively because of his\r\nviolations to [sic] company policies\" and referred to his\r\n\"inability to commit to the managerial efforts directed by the\r\nparent corporation, covering up employee misconduct which required\r\ntermination, and his failure to abide by previous commitments to\r\nhis immediate supervisor with respect to team work and\r\nreorg[an]ization.\"\r\nThe depositions betray a similar inability to settle on\r\nan explanation for Domnguez-Cruz's dismissal.  At one point, Ovitt\r\nstated that \"[t]he reason that he was terminated was because of his\r\nperformance, it was performance issues.\"  At another point, Ovitt\r\nacknowledged that he told \"the employees of the corporation, other\r\nthan the executive staff,\" that the dismissal was not related to\r\nperformance.  Later, he indicated that the plaintiff was fired\r\nbecause of \"his refusal to take the direction that the company was\r\ngoing\" and his insubordination.  Finally, Ovitt referred to\r\nDomnguez-Cruz's failure to abide by company policies.  Sampson, in\r\ncontrast, stated in his deposition that Domnguez-Cruz was doing a\r\n\"good job\" and was \"very adequate\" and that \"[t]he primary reason\r\nfor termination was always that they wanted to eliminate the\r\nposition, they didn't think it was necessary any more.\"\r\nA company may have several legitimate reasons to dismiss\r\nan employee.  But when a company, at different times, gives\r\ndifferent and arguably inconsistent explanations, a jury may infer\r\nthat the articulated reasons are pretextual.  See Thurman v. Yellow\r\nFreight Sys., Inc., 90 F.3d 1160, 1167 (6th Cir. 1996) (\"An\r\nemployer's changing rationale for making an adverse employment\r\ndecision can be evidence of pretext.\"),  opinion amended by 97 F.3d\r\n833 (6th Cir. 1996); Kobrin v. University of Minnesota, 34 F.3d\r\n698, 703 (8th Cir. 1994) (\"Substantial changes over time in the\r\nemployer's proffered reason for its employment decision support a\r\nfinding of pretext.\"); Castleman v. Acme Boot Co., 959 F.2d 1417,\r\n1422 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"A jury's conclusion that an employer's\r\nreasons were pretextual can be supported by inconsistencies in or\r\nthe unconvincing nature of the decisionmaker's testimony.\");\r\nAlvarado v. Board of Trustees, 928 F.2d 118, 122-23 (4th Cir.\r\n1991); Schmitz v. St. Regis Paper Co., 811 F.2d 131, 132-33 (2d\r\nCir. 1987).  A jury could, at trial, accept the employer's\r\nexplanation that it initially chose not to discuss the plaintiff's\r\nperformance issues publicly out of a desire to avoid humiliating\r\nhim.  This explanation, however, does not fully explain its failure\r\nto mention these issues to Domnguez-Cruz when he inquired as to\r\nthe reasons for his dismissal.  At the summary judgment stage,\r\nviewing the evidence as a whole and given that the court should not\r\nengage in credibility assessments, see Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys.\r\nCorp., 150 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1998), the evidence in this case\r\ncan support an inference of pretext.\r\nThird, and further supporting a possible inference that\r\nSuttle Caribe's explanations are pretextual, there is evidence\r\nsuggesting that restructuring was not the reason for the\r\ntermination of the plaintiff's employment.  First, there is\r\nevidence that, in 1994 or earlier, Ovitt had offered the plant\r\nmanager position to Medina.  Medina told another employee that he\r\nwas considering taking the offer.  Second, the plaintiff had no\r\nprior notice that the company was considering eliminating the plant\r\nmanager position, even though he was integrally involved in the\r\nrestructuring efforts at Suttle Caribe.  Third, while Suttle Caribe\r\nmaintains that the plan had always been to eliminate the plant\r\nmanager positions in both Puerto Rico and Costa Rica, the position\r\nin Costa Rica had not, as of the time of the depositions, been\r\neliminated.\r\nThe performance explanation also suffers from some\r\ndeficiencies.  At least one of the alleged violations of company\r\npolicy upon which Suttle Caribe relies occurred approximately two\r\nyears before Domnguez-Cruz was dismissed, and his 1993 evaluation,\r\nat roughly the same time, called him an outstanding employee.  And\r\nthere is at least some question whether Domnguez-Cruz was directly\r\nresponsible for two of the alleged violations.  Further, the fact\r\nthat the other employees involved in some of these violations were\r\nnot terminated may cast doubt on the veracity of this explanation. \r\nFinally, Domnguez-Cruz's record at the company may undermine the\r\nperformance explanation.  He had a strong record with the company,\r\nreceived a positive performance evaluation in 1993, was given a\r\nletter of commendation from Berg in August of 1994, and received a\r\nmerit pay increase in 1995.  A jury could conclude that the alleged\r\nperformance problems only arose once the plaintiff came under\r\nOvitt's supervision; Ovitt terminated the plaintiff within three\r\nyears of becoming his supervisor.\r\nFinally, evidence of age-related comments could support\r\nan inference of pretext and discriminatory animus.  The record\r\nreflects that Ovitt -- the plaintiff's direct supervisor and the\r\nkey decisionmaker regarding his termination -- referred to the\r\nplaintiff, more than once, as an \"old fart\" in front of other\r\nemployees, including Medina and Sierra.  Medina, in turn, was heard\r\nby another employee referring to Domnguez-Cruz as \"el viejo\" (\"the\r\nold one\" or \"the old man\") in the course of saying that he had been\r\noffered Domnguez-Cruz's job.  \r\nIn addition, there are the notes made by Wielke, the\r\npersonnel manager.  Wielke, in some way, participated in the\r\ndismissal and flew to Puerto Rico with Ovitt to inform plaintiff\r\nthat his employment was terminated.  Her notes about the decision\r\nto terminate the plaintiff contain his full name and include the\r\nphrases \"cover up so Alberto doesn't,\" \"all over 40,\" \"Tony --\r\nage,\" and \"age descrim. [sic].\"  Perhaps the discussion\r\nmemorialized in these notes was about how to comply with the law,\r\nbut, if so, the \"cover up\" language is an odd choice.  These notes,\r\nas well as the remarks made by the key decisionmaker and another\r\nemployee, could lead a reasonable jury to infer that age\r\ndiscrimination was at work.\r\nThis recitation of the facts has taken the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff.  See Levy v. Federal\r\nDeposit Ins. Corp., 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir. 1993).  It is not\r\na description of what the jury must find, but is rather a\r\ndescription of the permissible inferences that could be drawn from\r\nthe facts and that suffice to defeat summary judgment.  \"The\r\nplaintiff does not have to prove by a preponderance of the\r\nadditional evidence that discrimination was in fact the motive for\r\nthe action taken.  All a plaintiff has to do is raise a genuine\r\nissue of fact as to whether discrimination motivated the adverse\r\nemployment action.\"  Olivera, 922 F.2d at 50.  We find that\r\nDomnguez-Cruz has done so and should be allowed to take his claims\r\nto a jury.  See Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151,\r\n167 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[W]here a plaintiff in a discrimination case\r\nmakes out a prima facie case and the issue becomes whether the\r\nemployer's stated nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for\r\ndiscrimination, courts must be 'particularly cautious' about\r\ngranting the employer's motion for summary judgment.\" (citation\r\nomitted)); Mulero-Rodrguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 677 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (reversing summary judgment and noting that\r\n\"determinations of motive and intent, particularly in\r\ndiscrimination cases, are questions better suited for the jury\"\r\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see also Brennan,\r\n150 F.3d at 30 (reversing directed verdict entered for defendant in\r\nADEA case); Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1092 (1st\r\nCir. 1995) (reversing summary judgment for defendant in ADEA case).\r\nB.  Direct Evidence\r\nWe defer any decision as to whether plaintiff has\r\nproduced direct evidence of discrimination in light of our holding. \r\nShould such a decision prove material it would be better made after\r\nthe development of the evidence.  See, e.g., W. Carl Jordan,\r\nEmployment Discrimination Law 223 (1998 Supp.); see also Fernandes,\r\n1999 WL 1252868, at *5 (noting that a plaintiff \"may elect to\r\nproceed simultaneously on both fronts\" and that \"the trial court,\r\nat an appropriate stage of the litigation, will channel the case\r\ninto one format or the other\").  It is true the alleged comments\r\nwere about the plaintiff -- not other people -- and most were\r\npurportedly made by those involved in the termination.  The\r\ncomments in Wielke's notes have to do with terminating the\r\nplaintiff's employment and are contemporaneous with the termination\r\ndecision.  However, the summary judgment record gives little\r\ncontext to the remarks and comments.  There is, for example, no\r\nexplanation from the personnel manager about what her notes meant. \r\nNor is there any evidence from the plaintiff or the two\r\nsubordinates concerning the context in which Ovitt made his\r\nlamentable comments.  Hence it would be premature for us to\r\ncategorize this evidence now, both because the district court will\r\nbe better able to do so on a more complete record, and because\r\nwhether or not there will be any practical need to do so for\r\npurposes of deciding this case is not yet apparent.\r\nThe decision of the district court is reversed.  We\r\nremand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nSo ordered.\n",

Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                   Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and O'Toole, District Judge. \r\n\nHarold D. Vicente-Coln, with whom Vicente &amp; Cuebas was on\r\nbrief, for appellants.\r\nGraciela J. Belaval, with whom Martnez, Odell &amp; Calabria was\r\non brief, for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 2, 2000\r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  In this age discrimination suit\r\nbrought by a plant manager whose employment was terminated when he\r\nwas 55 years old, the district court entered summary judgment for\r\nthe defendant, Suttle Caribe, on the recommendation of the\r\nmagistrate judge.  Both judges found that the plaintiff, Alberto\r\nDomnguez-Cruz, made out a prima facie case of age discrimination\r\nunder the familiar McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks framework.  They\r\ndetermined, however, that he had not overcome Suttle Caribe's\r\narticulated non-discriminatory reason for the termination with\r\nevidence sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to conclude\r\nthat the termination was motivated by age discrimination.\r\nThe record shows that the employer has, at different\r\ntimes, articulated to varied audiences different reasons for ending\r\nthe plaintiff's employment.  At times, Suttle Caribe has said that\r\nthe termination was not an issue of performance but was instead the\r\nresult of a business restructuring plan that involved the\r\nelimination of the plant manager position.  At other times, Suttle\r\nCaribe has claimed that the termination was based on the\r\nplaintiff's job performance.  At still other times, Suttle Caribe\r\nhas said that violations of company policy and insubordination were\r\nthe reasons for the termination.  In addition to the potentially\r\ninconsistent reasons the company gave for the termination, notes of\r\na conversation between a member of the personnel department and the\r\nkey decisionmaker in the plaintiff's termination include --\r\nunusually and unfortunately for the company -- the phrases \"age\r\ndescrim. [sic]\" and \"cover up.\"  Finally, the key decisionmaker\r\nreferred to the plaintiff more than once as an \"old fart\" in front\r\nof two younger employees who would eventually assume many of the\r\nplaintiff's job responsibilities.  One of those younger employees\r\nin turn referred to the plaintiff as \"el viejo\" (\"the old one\" or\r\n\"the old man\") and told another employee at least a year before the\r\nplaintiff's termination that he had been offered the plaintiff's\r\njob.  While the termination of the plaintiff's employment may prove\r\nto have been innocent of age discrimination, these facts are surely\r\nenough to raise genuine issues of material fact that should be left\r\nto the jury.  We reverse entry of summary judgment and remand.\r\n                              I\r\nAlberto Domnguez-Cruz began working for Suttle Caribe on\r\nOctober 12, 1978.  He was hired to set up and manage Suttle\r\nCaribe's plant in Humacao, Puerto Rico, and he continued in the\r\nposition of plant manager until his termination on September 22,\r\n1995.  He was 55 years old at the time of his termination. \r\nAlthough his record was not spotless, all parties agree that\r\nDomnguez-Cruz performed his job well.  He successfully launched\r\nand nurtured Suttle Caribe's Puerto Rico operations and received\r\nrecognition for his efforts in the form of positive performance\r\nevaluations, merit pay increases, and commendations.  In fact, his\r\nimmediate supervisor agreed that the plaintiff's 1993 performance\r\nevaluation characterized him as \"an outstanding employee and\r\nmanager[,] in general terms.\"  In addition, Domnguez-Cruz received\r\na merit pay increase for 1995. \r\nIn 1994, upper management at Suttle Caribe's parent\r\ncompany, Suttle Apparatus, began a restructuring initiative,\r\ndesigned to reduce costs and standardize operations by putting the\r\n\"right people in the right place.\"  Domnguez-Cruz directed this\r\ninitiative at Suttle Caribe and, as a result, was responsible for\r\nterminating the employment of a number of employees in 1994.\r\nAlthough the company now claims that the long-term plan had always\r\nbeen to eliminate the  plant manager position, the plaintiff\r\ntestified that he was not aware that the restructuring initiative\r\nmight result in the loss of his job.\r\nIn September 1995, Dean Ovitt, Vice President of\r\nManufacturing for Suttle Apparatus and Domnguez-Cruz's direct\r\nsupervisor as of late 1992, and Jeffrey Berg, President of Suttle\r\nApparatus, traveled to Puerto Rico to meet with Domnguez-Cruz and\r\nto assess Suttle Caribe's operations.  During this time, Domnguez-\r\nCruz had conversations with both Berg and Ovitt pertaining to his\r\nconcerns with some of the proposed changes to the organizational\r\nchart.  In addition, Berg and Ovitt discussed with Domnguez-Cruz\r\nsome of their complaints regarding his handling of certain\r\nsituations, including an accident involving a company vehicle, the\r\nawarding of a contract to an employee, and the filing of\r\nunemployment paperwork associated with an employee's leave of\r\nabsence.  On September 22, 1995, Ovitt, with the consent of Berg\r\nand Curtis Sampson, the Chief Executive Officer and President of\r\nthe Board of Directors, informed Domnguez-Cruz that his employment\r\nwas being terminated.  Ovitt told Domnguez-Cruz that the plant\r\nmanager position was being eliminated as a part of the\r\norganization's restructuring plan.\r\nDomnguez-Cruz and his wife filed suit against Suttle\r\nCaribe in federal district court in May 1996, alleging age\r\ndiscrimination under both federal and Puerto Rican law and claiming\r\nviolations of various other provisions of Puerto Rican law.  They\r\nsought damages and a preliminary injunction reinstating Domnguez-\r\nCruz to his position and enjoining Suttle Caribe from\r\ndiscriminating or taking any retaliatory action against Domnguez-\r\nCruz.  On September 23, 1997, Suttle Caribe filed for summary\r\njudgment, arguing that Domnguez-Cruz had failed to make out a\r\nprima facie case of age discrimination and that he had failed to\r\nrebut its proffered non-discriminatory reasons for the termination.\r\nThe motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended\r\ngranting summary judgment to Suttle Caribe.  The district court\r\nagreed, concluding that although Domnguez-Cruz had put forth a\r\nprima facie case of age discrimination, he had failed to rebut\r\nSuttle Caribe's non-discriminatory reasons for the dismissal. \r\nSummary judgment was entered for Suttle Caribe and supplemental\r\njurisdiction over the Puerto Rican law claims was declined.\r\nDomnguez-Cruz appealed to this court.\r\n                              II\r\nOur review of the entry of summary judgment is de novo. \r\nSee Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765085\"><a href=\"/opinion/765085/myrtle-thomas-v-eastman-kodak-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nThe plaintiff offers two approaches to this case. \r\nFirst, he says that the ageist statements allegedly made by Ovitt\r\nand another individual and the notes taken by a personnel manager\r\nin a meeting with Ovitt constitute \"direct evidence\" of age\r\ndiscrimination.  Because he produced direct evidence sufficient to\r\nsustain his burden, Domnguez-Cruz says, summary judgment should\r\nhave been denied without resort to the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-\r\nHicks burden-shifting framework.  The district court rejected this\r\nargument, concluding that this evidence was not \"direct evidence\"\r\nbut instead constituted \"stray remarks\" that failed to \"tie\r\n[Domnguez-Cruz's] dismissal from Suttle to his age or to age\r\ndiscrimination.\"\r\nSecond, the plaintiff says that even under the McDonnell\r\nDouglas-Burdine-Hicks framework, summary judgment was improper\r\nbecause he produced evidence from which a jury could infer that the\r\nemployer's articulated reasons were pretextual and that age\r\ndiscrimination was the real reason for his termination.

The district court rejected this argument, finding that\r\nthe circumstantial evidence presented by the plaintiff was\r\ninsufficient to carry the burden of establishing that \"age-related\r\nanimus motivated [his] dismissal.\"\r\nWhen a plaintiff presents direct evidence of age\r\ndiscrimination, the defendant must then either \"deny the validity\r\nor the sufficiency of the plaintiff's evidence,\" and \"have the jury\r\n. . . decide[] whether plaintiff has proved discrimination by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence,\" see 8 Lex K.

First, the evidence put forth by the\r\nplaintiff in making his prima facie case clearly established that\r\nDean Ovitt, who was the plaintiff's direct supervisor and twelve\r\nyears younger than him, and Jeffrey Berg, who was two years younger\r\nthan the plaintiff, made the decision to terminate the plaintiff,\r\nwith Sampson's approval.  After his termination, Domnguez-Cruz's\r\njob responsibilities were assumed by Ovitt, Mario Medina, Suttle\r\nCaribe's Operations Manager, Nilda Torres, Suttle Caribe's then\r\nQuality Control Supervisor, and Adalberto Sierra, Suttle Caribe's\r\nPersonnel Manager.  All four individuals are younger than\r\nDomnguez-Cruz (although Sierra only by one year).  In fact, the\r\nevidence showed that Domnguez-Cruz was the oldest Suttle Caribe\r\nemployee.  In addition, while Suttle Caribe claims that Luis\r\n(\"Tony\") Hernndez, the Costa Rica plant manager, did not assume\r\nany of the plaintiff's job responsibilities, there is evidence that\r\nHernndez, who is ten years younger than the plaintiff, oversees\r\nMedina and Sierra and was selected for this position \"rather than\"\r\nthe plaintiff.\r\nSecond, and in addition to the evidence supporting\r\nDomnguez-Cruz's prima facie case, the defendant presented\r\nexplanations for Domnguez-Cruz's termination that could be viewed\r\nas inconsistent.  When Domnguez-Cruz was informed by Ovitt and\r\nJanice Wielke, a Suttle Apparatus personnel manager, that he was\r\nbeing dismissed, he was told that his position was being eliminated\r\nas a result of the restructuring plan.  That same day, a memorandum\r\nfrom Ovitt was distributed to all employees, informing them that\r\nsome \"organizational changes\" would be made as a part of the\r\n\"restructuring of the organization.\"  Ovitt's notes made shortly\r\nbefore the plaintiff was informed of the decision support the\r\nrestructuring explanation:  \"This reorganization is not a\r\nperformance issue.  This was a difficult decision of restructuring\r\nthe company to combine operation resourses [sic] and better utilize\r\nresourses [sic] available.\"  When Domnguez-Cruz contacted Sampson\r\nfor an explanation, he received a letter stating that Hernndez had\r\nbeen selected \"rather than\" himself to sit on the committee that\r\nwould oversee Suttle Caribe operations.  When the plaintiff met\r\nwith Sampson a week or so later, Sampson told him that while there\r\nhad been some complaints about his performance, they were \"not\r\nimportant.\"\r\nHowever, in its answer to Domnguez-Cruz's complaint,\r\nSuttle Caribe changed its reasons for the termination of\r\nplaintiff's employment.  It denied that the plaintiff was\r\ndischarged as a result of restructuring, instead claiming that\r\n\"Plaintiff was terminated for his repeated failure to abide by\r\ncompany policies and to commit to the team efforts as required.\" \r\nAt another point in the answer, Suttle Caribe stated that the\r\nplaintiff's termination \"was determined exclusively because of his\r\nviolations to [sic] company policies\" and referred to his\r\n\"inability to commit to the managerial efforts directed by the\r\nparent corporation, covering up employee misconduct which required\r\ntermination, and his failure to abide by previous commitments to\r\nhis immediate supervisor with respect to team work and\r\nreorg[an]ization.\"\r\nThe depositions betray a similar inability to settle on\r\nan explanation for Domnguez-Cruz's dismissal.  At one point, Ovitt\r\nstated that \"[t]he reason that he was terminated was because of his\r\nperformance, it was performance issues.\"  At another point, Ovitt\r\nacknowledged that he told \"the employees of the corporation, other\r\nthan the executive staff,\" that the dismissal was not related to\r\nperformance.  Later, he indicated that the plaintiff was fired\r\nbecause of \"his refusal to take the direction that the company was\r\ngoing\" and his insubordination.  Finally, Ovitt referred to\r\nDomnguez-Cruz's failure to abide by company policies.  Sampson, in\r\ncontrast, stated in his deposition that Domnguez-Cruz was doing a\r\n\"good job\" and was \"very adequate\" and that \"[t]he primary reason\r\nfor termination was always that they wanted to eliminate the\r\nposition, they didn't think it was necessary any more.\"\r\nA company may have several legitimate reasons to dismiss\r\nan employee.  But when a company, at different times, gives\r\ndifferent and arguably inconsistent explanations, a jury may infer\r\nthat the articulated reasons are pretextual.  See Thurman v.

A jury could, at trial, accept the employer's\r\nexplanation that it initially chose not to discuss the plaintiff's\r\nperformance issues publicly out of a desire to avoid humiliating\r\nhim.  This explanation, however, does not fully explain its failure\r\nto mention these issues to Domnguez-Cruz when he inquired as to\r\nthe reasons for his dismissal.  At the summary judgment stage,\r\nviewing the evidence as a whole and given that the court should not\r\nengage in credibility assessments, see Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys.\r\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756418\"><a href=\"/opinion/756418/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-430-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45627-daniel-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (1st Cir. 1998), the evidence in this case\r\ncan support an inference of pretext.\r\nThird, and further supporting a possible inference that\r\nSuttle Caribe's explanations are pretextual, there is evidence\r\nsuggesting that restructuring was not the reason for the\r\ntermination of the plaintiff's employment.  First, there is\r\nevidence that, in 1994 or earlier, Ovitt had offered the plant\r\nmanager position to Medina.  Medina told another employee that he\r\nwas considering taking the offer.  Second, the plaintiff had no\r\nprior notice that the company was considering eliminating the plant\r\nmanager position, even though he was integrally involved in the\r\nrestructuring efforts at Suttle Caribe.  Third, while Suttle Caribe\r\nmaintains that the plan had always been to eliminate the plant\r\nmanager positions in both Puerto Rico and Costa Rica, the position\r\nin Costa Rica had not, as of the time of the depositions, been\r\neliminated.\r\nThe performance explanation also suffers from some\r\ndeficiencies.  At least one of the alleged violations of company\r\npolicy upon which Suttle Caribe relies occurred approximately two\r\nyears before Domnguez-Cruz was dismissed, and his 1993 evaluation,\r\nat roughly the same time, called him an outstanding employee.  And\r\nthere is at least some question whether Domnguez-Cruz was directly\r\nresponsible for two of the alleged violations.  Further, the fact\r\nthat the other employees involved in some of these violations were\r\nnot terminated may cast doubt on the veracity of this explanation. \r\nFinally, Domnguez-Cruz's record at the company may undermine the\r\nperformance explanation.  He had a strong record with the company,\r\nreceived a positive performance evaluation in 1993, was given a\r\nletter of commendation from Berg in August of 1994, and received a\r\nmerit pay increase in 1995.  A jury could conclude that the alleged\r\nperformance problems only arose once the plaintiff came under\r\nOvitt's supervision; Ovitt terminated the plaintiff within three\r\nyears of becoming his supervisor.\r\nFinally, evidence of age-related comments could support\r\nan inference of pretext and discriminatory animus.  The record\r\nreflects that Ovitt -- the plaintiff's direct supervisor and the\r\nkey decisionmaker regarding his termination -- referred to the\r\nplaintiff, more than once, as an \"old fart\" in front of other\r\nemployees, including Medina and Sierra.  Medina, in turn, was heard\r\nby another employee referring to Domnguez-Cruz as \"el viejo\" (\"the\r\nold one\" or \"the old man\") in the course of saying that he had been\r\noffered Domnguez-Cruz's job.  \r\nIn addition, there are the notes made by Wielke, the\r\npersonnel manager.  Wielke, in some way, participated in the\r\ndismissal and flew to Puerto Rico with Ovitt to inform plaintiff\r\nthat his employment was terminated.  Her notes about the decision\r\nto terminate the plaintiff contain his full name and include the\r\nphrases \"cover up so Alberto doesn't,\" \"all over 40,\" \"Tony --\r\nage,\" and \"age descrim. [sic].\"  Perhaps the discussion\r\nmemorialized in these notes was about how to comply with the law,\r\nbut, if so, the \"cover up\" language is an odd choice.  These notes,\r\nas well as the remarks made by the key decisionmaker and another\r\nemployee, could lead a reasonable jury to infer that age\r\ndiscrimination was at work.\r\nThis recitation of the facts has taken the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff.  See Levy v. Federal\r\nDeposit Ins. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194983\"><a href=\"/opinion/194983/levy-v-weinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1056 (1st Cir. 1993).  It is not\r\na description of what the jury must find, but is rather a\r\ndescription of the permissible inferences that could be drawn from\r\nthe facts and that suffice to defeat summary judgment.  \"The\r\nplaintiff does not have to prove by a preponderance of the\r\nadditional evidence that discrimination was in fact the motive for\r\nthe action taken.  All a plaintiff has to do is raise a genuine\r\nissue of fact as to whether discrimination motivated the adverse\r\nemployment action.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Olivera,</span> <span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Direct Evidence\r\nWe defer any decision as to whether plaintiff has\r\nproduced direct evidence of discrimination in light of our holding. \r\nShould such a decision prove material it would be better made after\r\nthe development of the evidence.

It is true the alleged comments\r\nwere about the plaintiff -- not other people -- and most were\r\npurportedly made by those involved in the termination.  The\r\ncomments in Wielke's notes have to do with terminating the\r\nplaintiff's employment and are contemporaneous with the termination\r\ndecision.  However, the summary judgment record gives little\r\ncontext to the remarks and comments.  There is, for example, no\r\nexplanation from the personnel manager about what her notes meant. \r\nNor is there any evidence from the plaintiff or the two\r\nsubordinates concerning the context in which Ovitt made his\r\nlamentable comments.  Hence it would be premature for us to\r\ncategorize this evidence now, both because the district court will\r\nbe better able to do so on a more complete record, and because\r\nwhether or not there will be any practical need to do so for\r\npurposes of deciding this case is not yet apparent.\r\nThe decision of the district court is reversed.  We\r\nremand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nSo ordered.\n</pre>",
