HAWK, BUREAU OF PRISONS DIRECTOR,\r\n\n                         Respondent.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n        [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Sean Murphy on brief pro se.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and James F. Lang,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for respondent.\r\n\nJanuary 18, 2000\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Pro se petitioner Sean Murphy appeals a\r\ndistrict court judgment that denied his 28 U.S.C.  2241\r\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus to compel the Bureau of\r\nPrisons (BOP) to reduce his federal sentence.  This appeal asks\r\nus to determine whether the BOP must consider a prisoner who\r\nserved most of his federal prison term at a state correctional\r\nfacility where he successfully completed a state drug abuse\r\ntreatment program eligible for a sentence reduction under 18\r\nU.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B). \r\n          Applying de novo review, see, e.g., Martinez v.\r\nFlowers, 164 F.3d 1257, 1258 (10th Cir. 1998), we conclude that\r\nthe district court properly denied the petitioner relief on the\r\nground that the BOP has permissibly maintained that the\r\npetitioner is not eligible for early release because he did not\r\ncomplete a \"Bureau of Prisons residential drug abuse treatment\r\nprogram.\"  See 28 C.F.R. 550.58(a)(3)(1997).  Viewing this\r\nregulation in the light of the statute as a whole and its\r\nlegislative history, we think that the BOP's position\r\nconstitutes a reasonable and permissible construction of the\r\nstatute.  We have no occasion to apply the rule of lenity.  We\r\nalso decline to consider the petitioner's equal protection\r\nargument since it was not raised below.  The remaining cases\r\nthat the petitioner cites in support of his claim do not\r\naddress the issue presented here.  Consequently, they have no\r\nbearing on this case.  \r\n          In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court is affirmed.  See Local Rule 27(c).       \n",
