Harold J. Brown, Jr., now nearly 78\r\nyears old, worked at shipbuilding facilities owned by the Bath Iron\r\nWorks (BIW) for 43 years, from 1941 to 1984. Until 1978 he worked\r\nat the BIW shipyard in Bath, Maine, a facility covered by the\r\nLongshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.\r\n901 et seq. From 1978 to 1984, he worked at BIW's Hardings plant,\r\na facility the Benefits Review Board (BRB) determined was not\r\ncovered by the Act. \r\nBrown obtained an award of benefits under the Act for hearing\r\nloss, an occupational disease resulting from years of exposure to\r\nloud noises. He received a lump sum payment in 1986; his present\r\ninterest in this case is in continuing health coverage for his\r\ndisability, and more specifically, that BIW's insurer pay for\r\nhearing aids as needed. BIW has two insurers involved: Commercial\r\nUnion Insurance Companies, which provided coverage from January 1,\r\n1963 to February 28, 1981, and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,\r\nwhich provided coverage from March 1, 1981 to August 31, 1986.\r\nLiberty Mutual paid the lump sum award and looks to Commercial\r\nUnion for reimbursement. Commercial Union, to its credit, has\r\ninformed us that it will reimburse Liberty Mutual if the order\r\nawarding benefits is upheld. This petition for review by BIW and\r\nCommercial Union concerns whether Brown should have received\r\nbenefits under the Act.\r\n\n                             I\r\nThis case has consumed more than 16 years. The original claim\r\nfor compensation was filed on July 22, 1983, and the matter has\r\nbeen before three different Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) and\r\nhas been to the BRB four times. The basic attack mounted by\r\nCommercial Union and BIW is that the second ALJ found, on\r\nsubstantial evidence, that Brown failed to produce credible\r\nevidence of any hearing loss during the covered period at the\r\nshipyard and that the BRB was not free to disturb that ruling.\r\nBrown disagrees with the second ALJ's conclusion. He argues that\r\nthe first ALJ found, on substantial evidence, both exposure to loud\r\nnoise and hearing loss during the covered period and that the BRB's\r\norder should be affirmed. Commercial Union agrees that there was\r\nsuch exposure and says that while there was substantial evidence to\r\nsupport a finding of hearing loss during the covered period, no\r\nsuch finding was in fact made and that therefore the second ALJ's\r\nfinding was the controlling one.\r\nThis court reviews the BRB's decision on legal issues de novo\r\nand determines whether the Board adhered to the \"substantial\r\nevidence\" standard when it reviewed the ALJ's factual findings. See\r\nBarker v. United States Dep't of Labor, 138 F.3d 431, 434 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).\r\nWe decide this case on the grounds argued by Brown: the first\r\nALJ found that Brown had adduced evidence sufficient to make out a\r\nprima facie case as to his hearing loss during his employment at\r\nthe shipyard and, consequently, to invoke the presumption of\r\nliability in 33 U.S.C.  920(a). The employer did not rebut the\r\npresumption, and the BRB correctly determined that substantial\r\nevidence supported the first ALJ's determination. An explanation of\r\nour reasoning benefits from a description, shortened and focused,\r\nof the protracted prior proceedings.\r\n\n                             II\r\nOn July 22, 1983, Brown filed a Claim for Compensation with\r\nthe Office of Workers' Compensation, U.S. Department of Labor.\r\nSince Brown and BIW could not agree on a settlement, the dispute\r\nwent before an ALJ of the Department of Labor. On June 11, 1986,\r\nafter the only evidentiary hearing held in this matter, ALJ Glennon\r\nawarded Brown benefits for a 39.6% binaural hearing loss based on\r\nexpert testimony and audiograms taken in 1955, 1967, and 1983. The\r\nALJ also held that the Hardings facility was a covered situs under\r\nthe Act and that Liberty Mutual, as the carrier at the time of the\r\nlast exposure, was liable for payment of the benefits. Liberty\r\nMutual appealed this decision to the BRB. On July 31, 1989, the BRB\r\nreversed the ALJ. The Board determined that the Hardings facility\r\nwas not a covered situs under the Act and, therefore, the date of\r\nlast covered exposure was April 17, 1978, when Brown last worked at\r\nthe Bath facility. Consequently, the carrier responsible for\r\nBrown's benefits was Commercial Union. The Board also decided that\r\n\"[a]ggravation of a covered injury occurring after termination of\r\ncovered longshore employment is not compensable under the Act,\"\r\nunder Leach v. Thompson's Dairy, Inc., 13 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. (MB)\r\n231 (1981). The BRB \"remand[ed] the case for the ALJ to determine\r\nthe extent of claimant's work-related hearing loss from 1941 until\r\nclaimant transferred to the Hardings facility.\"\r\nOn February 21, 1990, a second ALJ (Shatz) found that the only\r\nreliable audiogram was conducted in 1983 (finding the audiograms\r\ndone in 1955 and 1967 were unreliable), and that the 1983 audiogram\r\ncould not be relied upon as an indicator of Brown's hearing loss in\r\n1978 since Brown was exposed to loud noises at the Hardings plant\r\nafter that date. Therefore, the second ALJ concluded, Brown \"ha[d]\r\nnot sustained his burden of proof by credible evidence that he\r\nsustained a hearing loss prior to being transferred in 1978 from\r\nthe Employer's shipyard to the Hardings facility.\" As a result, the\r\nALJ denied Brown's claim. Brown appealed ALJ Shatz's ruling and, on\r\nJune 16, 1992, the BRB reversed. Relying on cases it had decided\r\nsince the first appeal, and contrary to its earlier holding that\r\naggravation of a covered injury at a later non-covered site is not\r\ncompensable, the Board held that Brown, as a matter of law, was\r\nentitled to compensation for his hearing loss as measured in 1983,\r\nbecause \"the last covered employer is liable for an occupational\r\ndisease regardless of subsequent exposure in non-covered\r\nemployment.\" Brown's claim was re-instated. Upon reconsideration,\r\nthe Board reaffirmed this holding. \r\nThe BRB remanded the case to a third ALJ (Karst) to determine\r\nBrown's average applicable weekly wage. This the ALJ did on July\r\n21, 1997, and BIW and Commercial Union appealed again to the BRB,\r\nwhich, on August 13, 1998, upheld the ALJ in all respects.\r\n\n                            III\r\nThe first ALJ had to decide the initial question of\r\ncompensability and he decided it in Brown's favor. In order for an\r\ninjury to be covered by the Act, the claimant must initially make\r\nout a prima facie case. That is, a claimant \"must at least allege\r\nan injury that arose in the course of employment as well as out of\r\nemployment.\" U.S. Indus./Fed. Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Director, OWCP,\r\n455 U.S. 608, 615 (1982); see also Susoeff v. San Francisco\r\nStevedoring Co., 19 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. (MB) 149, 151 (1986)\r\n(claimant must make a prima facie showing that he or she \"sustained\r\nphysical harm and that conditions existed at work which could have\r\ncaused the harm\"); cf. Ramey v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., 134 F.3d\r\n954, 959 (9th Cir. 1998) (relying on Susoeff).\r\nThere was substantial evidence to support the finding of\r\ncompensability, as Commercial Union concedes. Brown worked at the\r\nshipyard as a shipfitter, surrounded by the din of chipping,\r\nriveting, sirens, and hammering. He testified that he noticed loss\r\nof hearing years earlier, during the period he worked at the\r\nshipyard. That testimony was not rebutted. He had three audiograms\r\ndone, two in 1955 and one in 1967. Each showed that he suffered\r\nsome hearing loss, although, oddly, the later one showed less\r\nhearing loss than the earlier ones. Brown's testimony before Judge\r\nGlennon indicates that an audiogram was done in 1967 or before,\r\nafter Brown noticed hearing loss. Brown testified that, as a result\r\nof a ringing in his ears he went to First Aid at the shipyard and\r\nhad a hearing test done. He was told by the shipyard's medical\r\ndepartment that the hearing loss was a hazard of the job and not\r\nmuch could be done about it. The medical testimony before the first\r\nALJ also supports the conclusion that Brown had work-related\r\nhearing loss as a result of his employment at the Bath shipyard.\r\nThis is sufficient to establish a prima facie case under the Act.\r\nOnce Brown made out his prima facie case, there was a\r\npresumption of liability. See 33 U.S.C.  920(a) (\"In any\r\nproceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under\r\nthis chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial\r\nevidence to the contrary -- (a) That the claimant comes within the\r\nprovisions of this chapter.\").\r\nBIW could have rebutted this presumption in Brown's favor \"by\r\nshowing that exposure to injurious stimuli did not cause the harm\"\r\nor \"that [Brown] was exposed to injurious stimuli while performing\r\nwork covered under the [LHWCA] for a subsequent employer.\" Avondale\r\nIndus. Inc. v. Director, OWCP, 977 F.2d 186, 190 (5th Cir. 1992)\r\n(quoting Susoeff, 19 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. at 151) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted); see also General Ship Serv. v. Director,\r\nOWCP, 938 F.2d 960, 961 (9th Cir. 1991) (applying Susoeff). BIW had\r\nto produce \"substantial evidence\" to support such a showing. See\r\nSprague v. Director, OWCP, 688 F.2d 862, 865 (1st Cir. 1982)\r\n(quoting  920(a)). \"Substantial evidence\" means \"such relevant\r\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\r\na conclusion.\" Id. (citations and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). If the presumption had been rebutted by BIW, it would\r\nhave fallen out of the case, and Brown would have had to establish\r\nhis burden based on the record as a whole. See Del Vecchio v.\r\nBowers, 296 U.S. 280, 286-87 (1935); accord Sprague, 688 F.2d at\r\n865. If, based on the record as a whole, the evidence had been\r\nevenly balanced between Brown and BIW, Brown would have lost. See\r\nDirector, OWCP v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 281 (1994).\r\nHere, however, the presumption was not rebutted, and so Brown\r\nwas properly awarded compensation. See Bath Iron Works Corp. v.\r\nDirector, OWCP, 109 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 1997). The first ALJ\r\nruled (incorrectly, the BRB later said) that both of the BIW\r\nfacilities where Brown worked were covered facilities; thus, his\r\nfocus was not primarily on whether the injury was caused or\r\naggravated at the shipyard or at the Hardings facility or both. But\r\nhis opinion did determine both implicitly and explicitly that there\r\nwas compensability for the period of employment at the shipyard.\r\nThe ALJ viewed both insurers as potentially liable and visited the\r\nliability on Liberty Mutual because it was the last carrier (during\r\nthe Hardings facility employment) and had not shown that there was\r\nno exposure to noise at Hardings.\r\nThe BRB understood the issues of compensability and overall\r\nliability of the shipyard to have already been resolved: \"[I]t is\r\nundisputed that claimant's hearing loss is related to occupational\r\nnoise exposure during claimant's employment . . . from 1941 to\r\n1984.\" Indeed, the issue remanded to the second ALJ was to\r\ndetermine the extent of liability by determining \"the extent of\r\nclaimant's work-related hearing loss from 1941 until claimant\r\ntransferred to the Hardings facility.\" The second ALJ did not have\r\nthe issue of compensability before him and, unsurprisingly, his\r\nopinion does not even refer to  920(a). Thus, the issue of\r\ncompensability was decided in Brown's favor and against the\r\nshipyard by the first ALJ, was affirmed by the BRB, is supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence, and is affirmed here.\r\nThere is one other party to this case and one other argument\r\nraised. The Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,\r\nU.S. Department of Labor, argues that this case should turn on an\r\nextension of the well accepted \"last employer rule.\" This extension\r\nhas been called the \"last covered employer\" or \"last maritime\r\nemployer\" rule. See Junius C. McElveen, Jr. &amp; Lawrence P. Postol,\r\nCompensating Occupational Disease Victims Under the Longshoremen's\r\nand Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 32 Am. U. L. Rev. 717, 761-62\r\n(1983). \r\nThe original \"last employer\" rule stems from the 1955 Second\r\nCircuit decision in Travelers Insurance Co. v. Cardillo, 225 F.2d\r\n137 (2d Cir. 1955), and is concerned with allocation of liability\r\namong employers and not with the question of compensability of the\r\nclaimant. In Cardillo, the court noted that:\r\n  The most difficult question presented by these cases is not\r\nthat of a claimant's right to recover but rather that of\r\ndetermining upon whom shall devolve the burden of paying the\r\ntariff imposed by this socially desirable legislation. The\r\nnature of occupational diseases and the dearth of medical\r\ncertainty with respect to the time that is required for them\r\nto develop and the permanence and extent of the resultant\r\ninjurious effects at different stages of the diseases'\r\nevolution, make it exceedingly difficult, if not practically\r\nimpossible, to correlate the progression of the disease with\r\nspecific points in time or specific industrial experiences.\r\n\nId. at 144. Since the Act does not provide a method for allocating\r\nliability, the court fashioned the last employer rule in order to\r\ndo so. The rule states that: \r\n  the employer during the last employment in which the claimant\r\nwas exposed to injurious stimuli, prior to the date upon which\r\nthe claimant became aware of the fact that he was suffering\r\nfrom an occupational disease arising naturally out of his\r\nemployment, [is] liable for the full amount of the award.\r\n\nId. at 145. \r\nThis rule was both consistent with congressional intent and\r\nprovided for administrative ease. The context in which the rule\r\narises is where it has already been determined that the claimant\r\nhas a right to recover, the issue is one of allocation, and the\r\nlast employer covered by the Act is the last employer. This court\r\nutilized a version of a last employer rule in Liberty Mutual\r\nInsurance Co. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., 978 F.2d 750, 756\r\n(1st Cir. 1992) (holding date of disability rather than date of\r\nawareness of condition is key date for last employer rule). \r\nThe last employer rule fashioned by the Cardillo court is\r\nbased on the assumption that \"all employers will be the last\r\nemployer a proportionate share of the time.\" Cordero v. Triple A\r\nMach. Shop, 580 F.2d 1331, 1336 (9th Cir. 1978). A more basic\r\npremise, unstated in Cardillo, is that, under the last employer\r\nrule, the employer assumes the risk when he hires an employee. This\r\nis similar to the torts rule that a tortfeasor takes its \"victims\"\r\nas it finds them. Consistent with this torts principle, one\r\ncommentary notes that, at least with regard to some types of\r\noccupational injuries, an employer could discover an employee's\r\nexisting work related injury or illness \"and could avoid or reduce\r\nliability by protecting the employee from further exposure.\"\r\nMcElveen &amp; Postol, supra, at 763.\r\nThe Director wants the courts to extend this last employer\r\nrule to impose liability on the last covered maritime employer\r\nwhere there is later exposure at a non-covered employer, as here.\r\nThe \"last maritime employer rule,\" unlike the \"last employer rule,\"\r\nis driven by the fact that there is no jurisdiction over the last\r\nemployer because the last employer is not covered by the Act. See\r\nid. at 762. Critics, however, have pointed out that such an\r\nextension is contrary to the rationale for the last employer rule:\r\na last maritime or covered employer rule \"undercut[s] the basic\r\nrationale of the last employer rule, that each employer will be the\r\nlast employer a proportionate share of the time.\" McElveen &amp;\r\nPostol, supra, at 763. Furthermore, since the last maritime or\r\ncovered employer rule holds covered employers liable for exposures\r\nthat took place after their liability otherwise ended, \"employers\r\nare precluded from limiting their liability by adjusting their\r\nconduct.\" Id. There is a difference between holding employers (and\r\ntheir insurers) liable for injuries that took place before an\r\nemployee was hired and for those that took place after an employee\r\nleft covered employment.\r\nNonetheless, there are policy arguments to be made to support\r\nsuch an extension of an allocation rule in those situations where,\r\nas here, the employee worked for the same employer throughout and\r\nwas simply transferred by the employer from a covered facility,\r\nwhere he was exposed, to a non-covered facility. Otherwise, an\r\nemployer could seek to manipulate the system by transferring an\r\nexposed employee from a covered to a non-covered facility. See\r\nFulks v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 10 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. (MB) 340,\r\n345 (1979), aff'd, 637 F.2d 1008 (5th Cir. 1981); cf. Todd\r\nShipyards Corp. v. Black, 717 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1983).\r\nThis issue does not need to be resolved because we have upheld\r\nthe finding of compensability against BIW arising out of Brown's\r\n1941 to 1978 employment at the shipyard, and Commercial Union\r\nconceded at oral argument that, if Brown was entitled to\r\ncompensation under the Act, the extent of such compensation could\r\nbe based on the 1983 audiogram. Consequently, there is no need to\r\neither decide a last maritime or covered employer issue or to\r\ndecide what deference, if any, we owe to the Director's views in\r\nthis case. Cf. Neely v. Benefits Rev. Bd., 139 F.3d 276, 281 (1st\r\nCir. 1998); Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 978 F.2d at 757.\r\nWe sustain the order of the BRB and deny the petition. Costs\r\nare awarded to Brown.\n",

The employer did not rebut the presumption, and the BRB correctly determined that substantial evidence supported the first ALJ's determination. An explanation of our reasoning benefits from a description, shortened and focused, of the protracted prior proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 22, 1983, Brown filed a Claim for Compensation with the Office of Workers' Compensation, U.S. Department of Labor. Since Brown and BIW could not agree on a settlement, the dispute went before an ALJ of the Department of Labor. On June 11, 1986, after the only evidentiary hearing held in this matter, ALJ Glennon awarded Brown benefits for a 39.6% binaural hearing loss based on expert testimony and audiograms taken in 1955, 1967, and 1983. The ALJ also held that the Hardings facility was a covered situs under the Act and that Liberty Mutual, as the carrier at the time of the last exposure, was liable for payment of the benefits. Liberty Mutual appealed this decision to the BRB. On July 31, 1989, the BRB reversed the ALJ. The Board determined that the Hardings facility was not a covered situs under the Act and, therefore, the date of last covered exposure was April 17, 1978, when Brown last worked at the Bath facility. Consequently, the carrier responsible for Brown's benefits was Commercial Union. The Board also decided that \"[a]ggravation of a covered injury occurring after termination of covered longshore employment is not compensable under the Act,\" under Leach v. Thompson's Dairy, Inc., 13 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. (MB) 231 (1981). The BRB \"remand[ed] the case for the ALJ to determine the extent of claimant's work-related hearing loss from 1941 until claimant transferred to the Hardings facility.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 1990, a second ALJ (Shatz) found that the only reliable audiogram was conducted in 1983 (finding the audiograms done in 1955 and 1967 were unreliable), and that the 1983 audiogram could not be relied upon as an indicator of Brown's hearing loss in 1978 since Brown was exposed to loud noises at the Hardings plant after that date. Therefore, the second ALJ concluded, Brown \"ha[d] not sustained his burden of proof<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> by credible evidence that he sustained a hearing loss prior to being transferred in 1978 from the Employer's shipyard to the Hardings facility.\" As a result, the ALJ denied Brown's claim. Brown appealed ALJ Shatz's ruling and, on June 16, 1992, the BRB reversed. Relying on cases it had decided since the first appeal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and contrary to its earlier holding that aggravation of a covered injury at a later non-covered site is not compensable, the Board held that Brown, as a matter of law, was entitled to compensation for his hearing loss as measured in 1983, because \"the last covered employer is liable for an occupational disease regardless of subsequent exposure in non-covered employment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Brown's claim was re-instated. Upon reconsideration, the Board reaffirmed this holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRB remanded the case to a third ALJ (Karst) to determine Brown's average applicable weekly wage. This the ALJ did on July 21, 1997, and BIW and Commercial Union appealed again to the BRB, which, on August 13, 1998, upheld the ALJ in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first ALJ had to decide the initial question of compensability and he decided it in Brown's favor. In order for an injury to be covered by the Act, the claimant must initially make out a prima facie case. That is, a claimant \"must at least allege an injury that arose in the course of employment as well as out of employment.\" U.S. Indus./Fed. Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, 455 U.S. 608, 615 (1982); see also Susoeff v. San Francisco Stevedoring Co., 19 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. (MB) 149, 151 (1986) (claimant must make a prima facie showing that he or she \"sustained physical harm and that conditions existed at work which could have caused the harm\"); cf. Ramey v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., 134 F.3d 954, 959 (9th Cir. 1998) (relying on Susoeff).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was substantial evidence to support the finding of compensability, as Commercial Union concedes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Brown worked at the shipyard as a shipfitter, surrounded by the din of chipping, riveting, sirens, and hammering. He testified that he noticed loss of hearing years earlier, during the period he worked at the shipyard. That testimony was not rebutted. He had three audiograms done, two in 1955 and one in 1967. Each showed that he suffered some hearing loss, although, oddly, the later one showed less hearing loss than the earlier ones.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Brown's testimony before Judge Glennon indicates that an audiogram was done in 1967 or before, after Brown noticed hearing loss. Brown testified that, as a result of a ringing in his ears he went to First Aid at the shipyard and had a hearing test done. He was told by the shipyard's medical department that the hearing loss was a hazard of the job and not much could be done about it. The medical testimony before the first ALJ also supports the conclusion that Brown had work-related hearing loss as a result of his employment at the Bath shipyard. This is sufficient to establish a prima facie case under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Brown made out his prima facie case, there was a presumption of liability. See 33 U.S.C. &#167; 920(a) (\"In any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary -- (a) That the claimant comes within the provisions of this chapter.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW could have rebutted this presumption in Brown's favor \"by showing that exposure to injurious stimuli did not cause the harm\" or \"that [Brown] was exposed to injurious stimuli while performing work covered under the [LHWCA] for a subsequent employer.\" Avondale Indus. Inc. v. Director, OWCP, 977 F.2d 186, 190 (5th Cir. 1992) (quoting Susoeff, 19 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. at 151) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also General Ship Serv. v. Director, OWCP, 938 F.2d 960, 961 (9th Cir. 1991) (applying Susoeff). BIW had to produce \"substantial evidence\" to support such a showing. See Sprague v. Director, OWCP, 688 F.2d 862, 865 (1st Cir. 1982) (quoting &#167; 920(a)). \"Substantial evidence\" means \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). If the presumption had been rebutted by BIW, it would have fallen out of the case, and Brown would have had to establish his burden based on the record as a whole. See Del Vecchio v. Bowers, 296 U.S. 280, 286-87 (1935); accord Sprague, 688 F.2d at 865. If, based on the record as a whole, the evidence had been evenly balanced between Brown and BIW, Brown would have lost. See Director, OWCP v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 281 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the presumption was not rebutted, and so Brown was properly awarded compensation. See Bath Iron Works Corp. v. Director, OWCP, 109 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 1997). The first ALJ ruled (incorrectly, the BRB later said) that both of the BIW facilities where Brown worked were covered facilities; thus, his focus was not primarily on whether the injury was caused or aggravated at the shipyard or at the Hardings facility or both. But his opinion did determine both implicitly and explicitly that there was compensability for the period of employment at the shipyard. The ALJ viewed both insurers as potentially liable and visited the liability on Liberty Mutual because it was the last carrier (during the Hardings facility employment) and had not shown that there was no exposure to noise at Hardings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRB understood the issues of compensability and overall liability of the shipyard to have already been resolved: \"[I]t is undisputed that claimant's hearing loss is related to occupational noise exposure during claimant's employment . . . from 1941 to 1984.\" Indeed, the issue remanded to the second ALJ was to determine the extent of liability by determining \"the extent of claimant's work-related hearing loss from 1941 until claimant transferred to the Hardings facility.\" The second ALJ did not have the issue of compensability before him and, unsurprisingly, his opinion does not even refer to &#167; 920(a). Thus, the issue of compensability was decided in Brown's favor and against the shipyard by the first ALJ, was affirmed by the BRB, is supported by substantial evidence, and is affirmed here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one other party to this case and one other argument raised. The Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, argues that this case should turn on an extension of the well accepted \"last employer rule.\" This extension has been called the \"last covered employer\" or \"last maritime employer\" rule. See Junius C. McElveen, Jr. &amp; Lawrence P. Postol, Compensating Occupational Disease Victims Under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 32 Am. U. L. Rev. 717, 761-62 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original \"last employer\" rule stems from the 1955 Second Circuit decision in Travelers Insurance Co. v. Cardillo, 225 F.2d 137 (2d Cir. 1955), and is concerned with allocation of liability among employers and not with the question of compensability of the claimant. In Cardillo, the court noted that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most difficult question presented by these cases is not that of a claimant's right to recover but rather that of determining upon whom shall devolve the burden of paying the tariff imposed by this socially desirable legislation. The nature of occupational diseases and the dearth of medical certainty with respect to the time that is required for them to develop and the permanence and extent of the resultant injurious effects at different stages of the diseases' evolution, make it exceedingly difficult, if not practically impossible, to correlate the progression of the disease with specific points in time or specific industrial experiences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 144. Since the Act does not provide a method for allocating liability,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the court fashioned the last employer rule in order to do so. The rule states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the employer during the last employment in which the claimant was exposed to injurious stimuli, prior to the date upon which the claimant became aware of the fact that he was suffering from an occupational disease arising naturally out of his employment, [is] liable for the full amount of the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 145.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule was both consistent with congressional intent and provided for administrative ease. The context in which the rule arises is where it has already been determined that the claimant has a right to recover, the issue is one of allocation, and the last employer covered by the Act is the last employer. This court utilized a version of a last employer rule in Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., 978 F.2d 750, 756 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding date of disability rather than date of awareness of condition is key date for last employer rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last employer rule fashioned by the Cardillo court is based on the assumption that \"all employers will be the last employer a proportionate share of the time.\" Cordero v. Triple A Mach. Shop, 580 F.2d 1331, 1336 (9th Cir. 1978). A more basic premise, unstated in Cardillo, is that, under the last employer rule, the employer assumes the risk when he hires an employee. This is similar to the torts rule that a tortfeasor takes its \"victims\" as it finds them. Consistent with this torts principle, one commentary notes that, at least with regard to some types of occupational injuries, an employer could discover an employee's existing work related injury or illness \"and could avoid or reduce liability by protecting the employee from further exposure.\" McElveen &amp; Postol, supra, at 763.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Director wants the courts to extend this last employer rule to impose liability on the last covered maritime employer where there is later exposure at a non-covered employer, as here. The \"last maritime employer rule,\" unlike the \"last employer rule,\" is driven by the fact that there is no jurisdiction over the last employer because the last employer is not covered by the Act. See id. at 762. Critics, however, have pointed out that such an extension is contrary to the rationale for the last employer rule: a last maritime or covered employer rule \"undercut[s] the basic rationale of the last employer rule, that each employer will be the last employer a proportionate share of the time.\" McElveen &amp; Postol, supra, at 763. Furthermore, since the last maritime or covered employer rule holds covered employers liable for exposures that took place after their liability otherwise ended, \"employers are precluded from limiting their liability by adjusting their conduct.\" Id. There is a difference between holding employers (and their insurers) liable for injuries that took place before an employee was hired and for those that took place after an employee left covered employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, there are policy arguments to be made to support such an extension of an allocation rule in those situations where, as here, the employee worked for the same employer throughout and was simply transferred by the employer from a covered facility, where he was exposed, to a non-covered facility. Otherwise, an employer could seek to manipulate the system by transferring an exposed employee from a covered to a non-covered facility. See Fulks v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 10 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. (MB) 340, 345 (1979), aff'd, 637 F.2d 1008 (5th Cir. 1981); cf. Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Black, 717 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue does not need to be resolved because we have upheld the finding of compensability against BIW arising out of Brown's 1941 to 1978 employment at the shipyard, and Commercial Union conceded at oral argument that, if Brown was entitled to compensation under the Act, the extent of such compensation could be based on the 1983 audiogram. Consequently, there is no need to either decide a last maritime or covered employer issue or to decide what deference, if any, we owe to the Director's views in this case. Cf. Neely v. Benefits Rev. Bd., 139 F.3d 276, 281 (1st Cir. 1998); Liberty Mut. Ins.

Brown, Jr., now nearly 78 years old, worked at shipbuilding facilities owned by the Bath Iron Works (BIW) for 43 years, from 1941 to 1984. Until 1978 he worked at the BIW shipyard in Bath, Maine, a facility covered by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 901 et seq. From 1978 to 1984, he worked at BIW's Hardings plant, a facility the Benefits Review Board (BRB) determined was not covered by the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown obtained an award of benefits under the Act for hearing loss, an occupational disease resulting from years of exposure to loud noises. He received a lump sum payment in 1986; his present interest in this case is in continuing health coverage for his disability, and more specifically, that BIW's insurer pay for hearing aids as needed. BIW has two insurers involved: Commercial Union Insurance Companies, which provided coverage from January 1, 1963 to February 28, 1981, and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, which provided coverage from March 1, 1981 to August 31, 1986. Liberty Mutual paid the lump sum award and looks to Commercial Union for reimbursement. Commercial Union, to its credit, has informed us that it will reimburse Liberty Mutual if the order awarding benefits is upheld. This petition for review by BIW and Commercial Union concerns whether Brown should have received benefits under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* This case has consumed more than 16 years. The original claim for compensation was filed on July 22, 1983, and the matter has been before three different Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) and has been to the BRB four times. The basic attack mounted by Commercial Union and BIW is that the second ALJ found, on substantial evidence, that Brown failed to produce credible evidence of any hearing loss during the covered period at the shipyard and that the BRB was not free to disturb that ruling. Brown disagrees with the second ALJ's conclusion. He argues that the first ALJ found, on substantial evidence, both exposure to loud noise and hearing loss during the covered period and that the BRB's order should be affirmed.

The employer did not rebut the presumption, and the BRB correctly determined that substantial evidence supported the first ALJ's determination. An explanation of our reasoning benefits from a description, shortened and focused, of the protracted prior proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 22, 1983, Brown filed a Claim for Compensation with the Office of Workers' Compensation, U.S. Department of Labor. Since Brown and BIW could not agree on a settlement, the dispute went before an ALJ of the Department of Labor. On June 11, 1986, after the only evidentiary hearing held in this matter, ALJ Glennon awarded Brown benefits for a 39.6% binaural hearing loss based on expert testimony and audiograms taken in 1955, 1967, and 1983. The ALJ also held that the Hardings facility was a covered situs under the Act and that Liberty Mutual, as the carrier at the time of the last exposure, was liable for payment of the benefits. Liberty Mutual appealed this decision to the BRB. On July 31, 1989, the BRB reversed the ALJ. The Board determined that the Hardings facility was not a covered situs under the Act and, therefore, the date of last covered exposure was April 17, 1978, when Brown last worked at the Bath facility. Consequently, the carrier responsible for Brown's benefits was Commercial Union. The Board also decided that \"[a]ggravation of a covered injury occurring after termination of covered longshore employment is not compensable under the Act,\" under Leach v. Thompson's Dairy, Inc., 13 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv. (MB) 231 (1981). The BRB \"remand[ed] the case for the ALJ to determine the extent of claimant's work-related hearing loss from 1941 until claimant transferred to the Hardings facility.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 1990, a second ALJ (Shatz) found that the only reliable audiogram was conducted in 1983 (finding the audiograms done in 1955 and 1967 were unreliable), and that the 1983 audiogram could not be relied upon as an indicator of Brown's hearing loss in 1978 since Brown was exposed to loud noises at the Hardings plant after that date. Therefore, the second ALJ concluded, Brown \"ha[d] not sustained his burden of proof<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> by credible evidence that he sustained a hearing loss prior to being transferred in 1978 from the Employer's shipyard to the Hardings facility.\" As a result, the ALJ denied Brown's claim. Brown appealed ALJ Shatz's ruling and, on June 16, 1992, the BRB reversed. Relying on cases it had decided since the first appeal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and contrary to its earlier holding that aggravation of a covered injury at a later non-covered site is not compensable, the Board held that Brown, as a matter of law, was entitled to compensation for his hearing loss as measured in 1983, because \"the last covered employer is liable for an occupational disease regardless of subsequent exposure in non-covered employment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Brown's claim was re-instated. Upon reconsideration, the Board reaffirmed this holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRB remanded the case to a third ALJ (Karst) to determine Brown's average applicable weekly wage. This the ALJ did on July 21, 1997, and BIW and Commercial Union appealed again to the BRB, which, on August 13, 1998, upheld the ALJ in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first ALJ had to decide the initial question of compensability and he decided it in Brown's favor.

He testified that he noticed loss of hearing years earlier, during the period he worked at the shipyard. That testimony was not rebutted. He had three audiograms done, two in 1955 and one in 1967. Each showed that he suffered some hearing loss, although, oddly, the later one showed less hearing loss than the earlier ones.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Brown's testimony before Judge Glennon indicates that an audiogram was done in 1967 or before, after Brown noticed hearing loss. Brown testified that, as a result of a ringing in his ears he went to First Aid at the shipyard and had a hearing test done. He was told by the shipyard's medical department that the hearing loss was a hazard of the job and not much could be done about it. The medical testimony before the first ALJ also supports the conclusion that Brown had work-related hearing loss as a result of his employment at the Bath shipyard. This is sufficient to establish a prima facie case under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Brown made out his prima facie case, there was a presumption of liability.

If the presumption had been rebutted by BIW, it would have fallen out of the case, and Brown would have had to establish his burden based on the record as a whole. See Del Vecchio v.

If, based on the record as a whole, the evidence had been evenly balanced between Brown and BIW, Brown would have lost. See Director, OWCP v.

The first ALJ ruled (incorrectly, the BRB later said) that both of the BIW facilities where Brown worked were covered facilities; thus, his focus was not primarily on whether the injury was caused or aggravated at the shipyard or at the Hardings facility or both. But his opinion did determine both implicitly and explicitly that there was compensability for the period of employment at the shipyard. The ALJ viewed both insurers as potentially liable and visited the liability on Liberty Mutual because it was the last carrier (during the Hardings facility employment) and had not shown that there was no exposure to noise at Hardings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRB understood the issues of compensability and overall liability of the shipyard to have already been resolved: \"[I]t is undisputed that claimant's hearing loss is related to occupational noise exposure during claimant's employment . . . from 1941 to 1984.\" Indeed, the issue remanded to the second ALJ was to determine the extent of liability by determining \"the extent of claimant's work-related hearing loss from 1941 until claimant transferred to the Hardings facility.\" The second ALJ did not have the issue of compensability before him and, unsurprisingly, his opinion does not even refer to &#167; 920(a). Thus, the issue of compensability was decided in Brown's favor and against the shipyard by the first ALJ, was affirmed by the BRB, is supported by substantial evidence, and is affirmed here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one other party to this case and one other argument raised. The Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, argues that this case should turn on an extension of the well accepted \"last employer rule.\" This extension has been called the \"last covered employer\" or \"last maritime employer\" rule. See Junius C. McElveen, Jr. &amp; Lawrence P. Postol, Compensating Occupational Disease Victims Under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 32 Am. U. L. Rev. 717, 761-62 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original \"last employer\" rule stems from the 1955 Second Circuit decision in Travelers Insurance Co. v. Cardillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"237377\"><a href=\"/opinion/237377/the-travelers-insurance-company-and-todd-shipyards-corporation-v-frank-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span> </a></span>(2d Cir. 1955), and is concerned with allocation of liability among employers and not with the question of compensability of the claimant. In Cardillo, the court noted that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most difficult question presented by these cases is not that of a claimant's right to recover but rather that of determining upon whom shall devolve the burden of paying the tariff imposed by this socially desirable legislation. The nature of occupational diseases and the dearth of medical certainty with respect to the time that is required for them to develop and the permanence and extent of the resultant injurious effects at different stages of the diseases' evolution, make it exceedingly difficult, if not practically impossible, to correlate the progression of the disease with specific points in time or specific industrial experiences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"237377\"><a href=\"/opinion/237377/the-travelers-insurance-company-and-todd-shipyards-corporation-v-frank-a/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 144. </a></span>Since the Act does not provide a method for allocating liability,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the court fashioned the last employer rule in order to do so. The rule states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the employer during the last employment in which the claimant was exposed to injurious stimuli, prior to the date upon which the claimant became aware of the fact that he was suffering from an occupational disease arising naturally out of his employment, [is] liable for the full amount of the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"237377\"><a href=\"/opinion/237377/the-travelers-insurance-company-and-todd-shipyards-corporation-v-frank-a/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 145.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule was both consistent with congressional intent and provided for administrative ease. The context in which the rule arises is where it has already been determined that the claimant has a right to recover, the issue is one of allocation, and the last employer covered by the Act is the last employer. This court utilized a version of a last employer rule in Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593905\"><a href=\"/opinion/593905/liberty-mutual-insurance-company-v-commercial-union-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 756 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding date of disability rather than date of awareness of condition is key date for last employer rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last employer rule fashioned by the Cardillo court is based on the assumption that \"all employers will be the last employer a proportionate share of the time.\" Cordero v. Triple A Mach.

A more basic premise, unstated in Cardillo, is that, under the last employer rule, the employer assumes the risk when he hires an employee. This is similar to the torts rule that a tortfeasor takes its \"victims\" as it finds them. Consistent with this torts principle, one commentary notes that, at least with regard to some types of occupational injuries, an employer could discover an employee's existing work related injury or illness \"and could avoid or reduce liability by protecting the employee from further exposure.\" McElveen &amp; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Postol,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">763</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Director wants the courts to extend this last employer rule to impose liability on the last covered maritime employer where there is later exposure at a non-covered employer, as here. The \"last maritime employer rule,\" unlike the \"last employer rule,\" is driven by the fact that there is no jurisdiction over the last employer because the last employer is not covered by the Act. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 762. </span>Critics, however, have pointed out that such an extension is contrary to the rationale for the last employer rule: a last maritime or covered employer rule \"undercut[s] the basic rationale of the last employer rule, that each employer will be the last employer a proportionate share of the time.\" McElveen &amp; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Postol,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">763</span></span>. Furthermore, since the last maritime or covered employer rule holds covered employers liable for exposures that took place after their liability otherwise ended, \"employers are precluded from limiting their liability by adjusting their conduct.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> There is </span>a difference between holding employers (and their insurers) liable for injuries that took place before an employee was hired and for those that took place after an employee left covered employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, there are policy arguments to be made to support such an extension of an allocation rule in those situations where, as here, the employee worked for the same employer throughout and was simply transferred by the employer from a covered facility, where he was exposed, to a non-covered facility. Otherwise, an employer could seek to manipulate the system by transferring an exposed employee from a covered to a non-covered facility. See Fulks v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 10 Ben. Rev. Bd. Serv.
