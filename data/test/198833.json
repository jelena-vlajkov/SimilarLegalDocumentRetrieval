CUSHMAN,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n               KENNETH S. APFEL, COMMISSIONER,\r\n               SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n      [Hon. Robert W. Lovegreen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Kelly McKenna Cournoyer and Green and Greenberg on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Robin E. Feder,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Richard Fox, Assistant\r\nRegional Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 18, 2000\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Claimant Jacqueline P. Cushman appeals\r\nfrom the judgment of the district court upholding a\r\ndetermination of the Commissioner of Social Security that she\r\nis not entitled to disability insurance benefits or\r\nsupplemental security income benefits.  Before an\r\nAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), Cushman alleged disability\r\ndue to Hepatitis C and \"depressive or emotional conditions.\" \r\nThe ALJ denied disability at step four of the sequential\r\nanalysis, concluding that she is capable of returning to her\r\npast work as a telemarketer or cashier.\r\n          The issues raised on appeal were not raised in the\r\ndistrict court and, thus, are not preserved for our review. \r\nSee Gonzalez-Ayala v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 807 \r\nF.2d 255, 256 (1st Cir. 1986).  In all events, we would not find\r\nthem meritorious.  We briefly explain why.\r\n          First, there was ample evidence based upon which the\r\nALJ could reject claimant's allegation of disabling fatigue. \r\nThe medical expert testified that Hepatitis C sometimes has no\r\nsymptoms or else \"low grade symptomatology.\"  Claimant\r\ncompleted an \"Activities of Daily Living\" form indicating that\r\nshe leads a fairly active lifestyle.  Although there are\r\nvarious references in the medical records to claimant reporting\r\nfatigue, there are also indications that the fatigue is\r\n\"tolerable\" and that claimant \"operates with above average\r\nenergy level each day[].\"\r\n          Second, as for claimant's complaint that the ALJ\r\nfailed to elicit vocational expert testimony concerning the\r\nimpact of her non-exertional limitations on her ability to\r\nperform past work, the short answer is that at step four of the\r\nsequential analysis the claimant is the primary source for\r\nvocational documentation.  Santiago v. Secretary of Health &amp;\r\nHuman Servs., 944 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).  The\r\nclaimant must describe those impairments which she says she has\r\n\"so as to 'raise the point to the [Commissioner]'\" how the\r\nimpairments preclude the performance of her prior jobs.  Id. \r\n(internal citations omitted).\r\n          In the instant case, claimant's explanation as to why\r\nshe couldn't return to her former work was that she was \"always\r\ntired.\"  However, for the reasons already stated, the ALJ was\r\njustified in rejecting this statement.  As for claimant's\r\nmental limitations, the ALJ concluded that claimant retains the\r\nresidual functional capacity to perform work-related activities\r\nexcept for work involving high pressure or highly complex\r\ntasks.  This conclusion was supported by substantial evidence. \r\nNothing raised by claimant indicates that her previous work was\r\nhigh pressure or complex.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
