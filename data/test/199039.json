After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the appellant’s submissions, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow, largely for the reasons set out by the district court\n\nin its memorandum dated September 17, 1999.\n\n          We   only   add   that   to   the   extent    any   of   the\n\nindividual defendants were not absolutely immune from suit\n\nfor money damages, they clearly were protected from suit for\n\nmoney damages under the doctrine of qualified immunity.\n\nOmosefunmi has failed to show that his eligibility for\n\nrelief from deportation pursuant to section 212(c) of the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Act, see 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c),\n\nwas “clearly established” at the time in question.                 When\n\nOmosefunmi was rearrested in 1996, section 440(d) of the\n\nAnti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”),\n\nPub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996) was in\n\nits infancy, and nowhere in its text is there a specific\n\nindication of whether or not section 440(d) was to apply\n\nretroactively.    Over two years passed before an appellate\n\ncourt (this court) first ruled that section 440(d) did not\n\napply to already pending waiver applications.          See Goncalves\n\nv. Reno, 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S.\n\n1004 (1999).     By the time the issue was resolved in the\n\ncircuits, the BIA had remanded Omosefunmi’s case and held\n\fthat he was indeed eligible for consideration of section\n\n212(c) relief.\n\n          The claim against the INS itself is barred by the\n\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity, see Gonsalves v. I.R.S., 975\n\nF.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir. 1992); and the claims for injunctive\n\nand   declaratory   relief   were   properly   dismissed   since\n\nOmosefunmi had not exhausted the normal review procedures\n\navailable within the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nSee Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 269 (1993).\n\n          Affirmed.   1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f",
