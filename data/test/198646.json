D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Michael X. Savasuk on brief for appellant.\r\n   Robert J. Murphy and Holbrook &amp; Murphy on brief for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 21, 1999\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  This appeal arises out of the\r\nsinking of a 65-foot fishing trawler, the F/V MISS PENELOPE, off\r\nthe Maine coast.  The incident spawned a wrongful death claim on\r\nbehalf of a crew member who was lost at sea, a bodily injury claim\r\nby an injured seaman, and a claim by plaintiff-appellant David\r\nGreenly (the owner of the vessel) for property damage.  The\r\ndefendants, Mariner Management Group, Inc. and Clarendon Insurance\r\nCo. (collectively, \"Mariner\" or \"the insurer\"), paid the bulk of\r\nGreenly's claim but withheld $34,370 as a coinsurance penalty\r\napplicable to payments made to settle the seamen's claims under the\r\nprotection and indemnity (P&amp;I) provisions of Greenly's policy.\r\nAsserting admiralty jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. \r\n1333(1), Greenly sued in the federal district court to recover the\r\nwithheld amount.  The case was heard on cross-motions for summary\r\njudgment.  A magistrate judge recommended that judgment enter in\r\nGreenly's favor.  Mariner objected.  The district court disagreed\r\nwith the magistrate's recommendation in relevant part, concluded\r\nthat Mariner's position was well-taken, and granted its motion for\r\nbrevis disposition.  See Greenly v. Mariner Mgmt. Group, Inc., Civ.\r\nNo. 98-130-P-H, slip op. (D.Me. Sept. 23, 1998) (unpublished).  We\r\nreverse.\r\nThe essential facts are not in dispute.  Greenly had\r\nfished the MISS PENELOPE out of Portland for several years prior to\r\nthe mishap.  Although he captained the vessel throughout that\r\nperiod, he decided to take an impromptu sabbatical in the fall of\r\n1997.  He appointed a member of the crew, Brian Morse, to serve as\r\ncaptain   an action that the policy allowed him to take without\r\npermission from, or notification to, the insurer.  Morse's stint as\r\ncaptain was brief, for the vessel sank in heavy weather just a few\r\nmonths later.  Of the four men aboard when she went down, one was\r\nlost and one was injured.\r\nGreenly learned of the sinking on January 28, 1998, and\r\nimmediately reported it to the insurer.  Mariner balked at paying\r\nthe wrongful death and bodily injury claims in full when it learned\r\nthat four men were aboard the ship at the time of the accident.  It\r\ncited the insurance policy's Crew Warranty clause, asserting that\r\nthis clause contemplated a maximum of three crew members; and that,\r\nalthough the insured retained the right to add crew members, he\r\ncould only assure full coverage by notifying the insurer before the\r\nfact and paying a premium surcharge, neither of which Greenly had\r\ndone.  Since the accident occurred with more than three men on\r\nboard, Mariner reduced P&amp;I payments in proportion to the ratio\r\nbetween what it considered to be the stated and actual number of\r\ncrew members.  It accomplished this reduction by withholding the\r\ncalculated amount from the payment due to Greenly under the\r\npolicy's first-party coverage on the vessel's hull and machinery.\r\nCoverage disputes usually depend upon the language of the\r\npolicy, and this case is no different.  The critical provision is\r\nthe Crew Warranty clause, which provides:\r\n    In consideration of the premium\r\ncharged, it is warranted that coverage\r\nhereunder is provided for not more than three\r\n(3) crew members aboard the insured vessel at\r\nany one time.  Also, warranted that in the\r\nevent additional crew are to be covered\r\nhereunder, the Assured shall give prior notice\r\nto this Company and pay such additional\r\npremium as is required.  If the Assured shall\r\nfail to give such prior notice and at the time\r\nof loss with respect to crew there are more\r\ncrew on board, this insurance shall respond\r\nonly in the proportion that the stated number\r\nof crew bears to the number on board at the\r\ntime of the accident.\r\n\nThe key to interpreting this clause lies in the meaning\r\nof the word \"crew.\"  The protagonists read this word quite\r\ndifferently.  On the one hand, Mariner maintains that the word is\r\nunambiguous and that its common meaning includes the entire\r\ncomplement of individuals working aboard a vessel in any capacity\r\n(e.g., ordinary seamen, deck hands, the cook, the engineer, the\r\nmate, the captain).  On this reading, Mariner urged the district\r\ncourt to find that Morse (the captain) necessarily comprised part\r\nof the crew, and that, therefore, his presence, together with that\r\nof three ordinary seamen, breached the warranty.  Greenly, on the\r\nother hand, maintains that the word \"crew\" at the very least\r\nexcludes the ship's captain.  On this reading, he urged the\r\ndistrict court to find that Morse (qua captain) did not comprise a\r\npart of the crew, and that, therefore, the warranty was fulfilled\r\n(i.e., the \"crew\" on board at the time of the sinking numbered\r\nthree).\r\nThe magistrate judge essentially accepted Greenly's\r\nposition.  On de novo review, the district judge agreed with\r\nGreenly in the first instance; he found that the word \"crew,\" in\r\nand of itself, was ambiguous.  But this proved to be a Pyrrhic\r\nvictory, for the judge went on to rule that, \"[r]ead in its\r\ncontext, the crew warranty objectively manifests an intent to cover\r\nthe captain as well as other members of the ship's crew.\"  The\r\ndistrict judge thereupon rejected the magistrate's recommendation,\r\ndenied Greenly's motion for summary judgment, and granted Mariner's\r\ncross-motion.\r\nWe review the district court's entry of summary judgment\r\nde novo.  See Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 960 (1st Cir.\r\n1997); Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\nLike the lower court, we focus on the narrow question of whether\r\nCaptain Morse should be deemed a member of the crew for purposes of\r\nthe Crew Warranty clause.\r\nOur first step is to identify the body of law that guides\r\nour interpretative efforts.  Although a court sitting in admiralty\r\njurisdiction must apply federal maritime rules that directly\r\naddress the issues at hand, it may   and should   resort to state\r\nlaw when no federal rule covers a particular situation.  See\r\nWilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 348 U.S. 310, 320-21\r\n(1955); Acadia Ins. Co. v. McNeil, 116 F.3d 599, 603 (1st Cir.\r\n1997); see also Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws  188\r\n(1971).  This is such a case.  Thus, state law (here, Maine law)\r\nsupplies the substantive rules of decision.\r\nMaine's highest court has observed that the \"paramount\r\nprinciple in the construction of contracts is to give effect to the\r\nintention of the parties as gathered from the language of the\r\nagreement viewed in the light of all the circumstances under which\r\nit was made.\"  Whit Shaw Assocs. v. Wardwell, 494 A.2d 1385, 1387\r\n(Me. 1985) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  As is\r\nthe case with other contracts, unambiguous provisions contained in\r\ninsurance policies are to be interpreted as written, giving force\r\nto their plain meaning.  See Jack v. Tracy, 722 A.2d 869, 871 (Me.\r\n1999).  Nonetheless, some special rules apply to insurance\r\npolicies.  See, e.g., Foundation for Blood Research v. St. Paul\r\nMarine &amp; Fire Ins. Co., 730 A.2d 175, 180 (Me. 1999) (reaffirming\r\ntime-honored tenet that insurance policies are liberally construed\r\nin favor of the insured).\r\nAmbiguous policy provisions present an area in which this\r\nliberality thrives.  Insurance policies are contracts of adhesion,\r\nand amphibolous language is to be construed against the insurer and\r\nin favor of maximizing coverage.  See Foundation for Blood\r\nResearch, 730 A.2d at 180; Geyerhahn v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar.\r\nCo., 724 A.2d 1258, 1261 (Me. 1999); Johnson v. Allstate Ins. Co.,\r\n687 A.2d 642, 645 (Me. 1997).  Of course, an insurance policy is\r\nnot considered ambiguous merely because a dispute arises over the\r\nmeaning of a particular provision.  If, however, an ordinary person\r\nwould not understand, with some degree of assurance, that the\r\nprovision has a single accepted meaning, ambiguity looms.  See\r\nCraig v. Barnes, 710 A.2d 258, 261 (Me. 1998); Peerless Ins. Co. v.\r\nBrennon, 564 A.2d 383, 386 (Me. 1989).  Put another way, if the\r\nlanguage used by the insurer is susceptible to two or more\r\nplausible but not functionally synonymous interpretations, then\r\nthat language can be found ambiguous.  See  Allen v. Adage, Inc.,\r\n967 F.2d 695, 700-01 (1st Cir. 1992); Cambridge Mut. Fire Ins. Co.\r\nv. Vallee, 687 A.2d 956, 957 (Me. 1996).\r\nIn this instance, our review of the relevant policy\r\nlanguage leads us to conclude that the Crew Warranty clause\r\ncontains an ambiguity as to the captain's status.  No less an\r\nauthority than the Supreme Court observed some six decades ago that\r\ncourts historically have been unable to attach \"an absolutely\r\nunvarying legal significance\" to the word \"crew.\"  South Chicago\r\nCoal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U.S. 251, 258 (1940).  Moreover,\r\nthe passage of time has done little to demystify the term.  See,\r\ne.g., Tonnesen v. Yonkers Contracting Co., 82 F.3d 30, 33 (2d Cir.\r\n1996).  Lexicographers have had no better luck at pinning down a\r\nsingle meaning for the word.  See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 334\r\n(5th ed. 1979) (\"'Crew' does not have an absolutely unvarying legal\r\nsignificance or any well-defined factual significance.\"); Funk and\r\nWagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language (1934)\r\n(defining \"crew\" as \"[t]he company of seamen belonging to one ship\r\nor boat:  sometimes including officers\"); Webster's Tenth New\r\nCollegiate Dictionary 274 (10th ed. 1993) (defining \"crew\" as\r\n\"[t]he whole company belonging to a ship sometimes including the\r\nofficers and master\").\r\nThe demonstrated malleability of the word \"crew\" renders\r\nthe precise meaning of the Crew Warranty clause uncertain.  While\r\nit leaves room for the insurer's interpretation   that, by\r\noperation of the clause, the insured warrants that the vessel will\r\nbe manned by a company of three, counting the captain   it makes\r\nequally plausible the insured's interpretation   that, by operation\r\nof the clause, the insured warrants that the vessel will be manned\r\nby a company of three, not counting the captain.\r\nThe district court believed that in this instance context\r\nremoved the latent uncertainty and gave a singular meaning to the\r\notherwise ambiguous term.  In this vein, the court pointed\r\nprincipally to the policy's P&amp;I coverage, noting that the owner\r\nwould have an additional exposure to liability for maintenance and\r\ncure or for Jones Act damages to a non-owner captain, and that this\r\nfact \"would thus be within the parties' contemplation when\r\ncontracting for P&amp;I coverage.\"  The gist of the district court's\r\nconception   with which we agree   is that the insurance company,\r\nfrom a risk and premium standpoint, probably envisioned that it was\r\ninsuring three, not four, persons serving the vessel, and would\r\nhave wanted higher premiums for a fourth such person (whether an\r\nordinary seaman or a non-owner captain).\r\nThere is some further albeit thin support for this view,\r\nurged by the insurer, in the language of the binder that preceded\r\nthe policy's issuance.  Without going into detail, this language\r\ncan be read as juxtaposing the premium to be charged with the\r\nproposition that the coverage is for three crew members, excluding\r\nthe captain (because he is an owner).  However, the policy itself\r\ndid not incorporate that language, and the terms contained in a\r\nbinder only regulate coverage until the actual policy issues (at\r\nwhich time they are supplanted by the terms of the policy).  See 1\r\nCouch on Insurance 3d  13:1 (1997); see also United States Fire\r\nIns. Co. v. Producciones Padosa, Inc., 835 F.2d 950, 956 (1st Cir.\r\n1987).  While the fact that the policy supersedes the binder does\r\nnot necessarily render the binder irrelevant in construing\r\nambiguous policy wording, the binder itself is not crystal clear\r\nand the omission of the language to which Mariner points can easily\r\nbe taken to mean that the parties rejected the notion.\r\nAlthough the question is close, we reject the district\r\ncourt's analysis.  Admittedly, a knowledgeable insurer might\r\nreasonably take the policy as intending to provide coverage for\r\ninjury as to three individuals   and three individuals only  \r\naboard the vessel.  But a lay person would have no reason to share\r\nthis perspective   and the fact remains that the term \"crew,\" both\r\nin general usage and in the context of this particular policy, is\r\npatently ambiguous.  In parsing insurance policies, Maine courts\r\nmust scrutinize policy language \"from the perspective of an average\r\nperson, untrained in the law or the insurance field, in light of\r\nwhat a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to an\r\nordinarily intelligent insured.\"  Peerless Ins. Co. v. Wood, 685\r\nA.2d 1173, 1174 (Me. 1996).  Here, the insured reasonably could\r\nhave thought that a non-owner captain was not considered part of\r\nthe crew, and that he was fully protected despite the introduction\r\nof a new captain.\r\nAccordingly, this case is governed by the well-settled\r\nrule that, in doubtful situations involving genuine ambiguities,\r\npolicy language is to be construed against the insurer (who drafted\r\nthe policy and thus could have avoided the ambiguity) and in favor\r\nof maximizing coverage.  See Foundation for Blood Research, 730\r\nA.2d at 180; Geyerhahn, 724 A.2d at 1261; Wood, 685 A.2d at 1174. \r\nWe believe this canon carries decretory significance in the instant\r\ncase   a case in which a policy term that controls the extent of\r\nthe insured's coverage is both ambiguous and reasonably susceptible\r\nto alternative interpretations.\r\nWe need go no further.  We conclude that the policy\r\ncontains an inherently ambiguous term.  Because we find the\r\ninsured's interpretation of this term as plausible as the\r\ninsurer's, we see no principled basis for departing from the\r\ndefault rule that requires courts to resolve such ambiguities in\r\nfavor of coverage.  Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court.\r\n\nReversed.\n",

Barnes, 710 A.2d 258, 261 (Me. 1998); Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon, 564 A.2d 383, 386 (Me. 1989). Put another way, if the language used by the insurer is susceptible to two or more plausible but not functionally synonymous interpretations, then that language can be found ambiguous. See  Allen v.

In this vein, the court pointed principally to the policy's P&amp;I coverage, noting that the owner would have an additional exposure to liability for maintenance and cure or for Jones Act damages to a non-owner captain, and that this fact \"would thus be within the parties' contemplation when contracting for P&amp;I coverage.\" The gist of the district court's conception -- with which we agree -- is that the insurance company, from a risk and premium standpoint, probably envisioned that it was insuring three, not four, persons serving the vessel, and would have wanted higher premiums for a fourth such person (whether an ordinary seaman or a non-owner captain).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some further albeit thin support for this view, urged by the insurer, in the language of the binder that preceded the policy's issuance.

However, the policy itself did not incorporate that language, and the terms contained in a binder only regulate coverage until the actual policy issues (at which time they are supplanted by the terms of the policy). See 1 Couch on Insurance 3d &#167; 13:1 (1997); see also United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Producciones Padosa, Inc., 835 F.2d 950, 956 (1st Cir. 1987).

Admittedly, a knowledgeable insurer might reasonably take the policy as intending to provide coverage for injury as to three individuals -- and three individuals only -- aboard the vessel. But a lay person would have no reason to share this perspective -- and the fact remains that the term \"crew,\" both in general usage and in the context of this particular policy, is patently ambiguous. In parsing insurance policies, Maine courts must scrutinize policy language \"from the perspective of an average person, untrained in the law or the insurance field, in light of what a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to an ordinarily intelligent insured.\" Peerless Ins. Co. v. Wood, 685 A.2d 1173, 1174 (Me. 1996). Here, the insured reasonably could have thought that a non-owner captain was not considered part of the crew, and that he was fully protected despite the introduction of a new captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, this case is governed by the well-settled rule that, in doubtful situations involving genuine ambiguities, policy language is to be construed against the insurer (who drafted the policy and thus could have avoided the ambiguity) and in favor of maximizing coverage. See Foundation for Blood Research, 730 A.2d at 180; Geyerhahn, 724 A.2d at 1261; Wood, 685 A.2d at 1174. We believe this canon carries decretory significance in the instant case -- a case in which a policy term that controls the extent of the insured's coverage is both ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to alternative interpretations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We conclude that the policy contains an inherently ambiguous term. Because we find the insured's interpretation of this term as plausible as the insurer's, we see no principled basis for departing from the default rule that requires courts to resolve such ambiguities in favor of coverage. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mariner functions as a general agent for Clarendon (the underwriter).

Here, however, the policy itself not only fails to resolve the ambiguity of the word \"crew,\" but the inconclusive extracontractual evidence of the parties' intent also fails to generate a genuine issue of material fact.

The incident spawned a wrongful death claim on behalf of a crew member who was lost at sea, a bodily injury claim by an injured seaman, and a claim by plaintiff-appellant David Greenly (the owner of the vessel) for property damage. The defendants, Mariner Management Group, Inc. and Clarendon Insurance Co. (collectively, \"Mariner\" or \"the insurer\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> paid the bulk of Greenly's claim but withheld $34,370 as a coinsurance penalty applicable to payments made to settle the seamen's claims under the protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) provisions of Greenly's policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asserting admiralty jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(1), Greenly sued in the federal district court to recover the withheld amount. The case was heard on cross-motions for summary judgment. A magistrate judge recommended that judgment enter in Greenly's favor. Mariner objected. The district court disagreed with the magistrate's recommendation in relevant part, concluded that Mariner's position was well-taken, and granted its motion for brevis disposition. See Greenly v. Mariner Mgmt. Group, Inc., Civ. No. 98-130-P-H, slip op. (D.Me. Sept. 23, 1998) (unpublished). We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Greenly had fished the MISS PENELOPE out of Portland for several years prior to the mishap. Although he captained the vessel throughout that period, he decided to take an impromptu sabbatical in the fall of 1997. He appointed a member of the crew, Brian Morse, to serve as captain -- an action that the policy allowed him to take without permission from, or notification to, the insurer. Morse's stint as captain was brief, for the vessel sank in heavy weather just a few months later. Of the four men aboard when she went down, one was lost and one was injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenly learned of the sinking on January 28, 1998, and immediately reported it to the insurer. Mariner balked at paying the wrongful death and bodily injury claims in full when it learned that four men were aboard the ship at the time of the accident. It cited the insurance policy's Crew Warranty clause, asserting that this clause contemplated a maximum of three crew members; and that, although the insured retained the right to add crew members, he could only assure full coverage by notifying the insurer before the fact and paying a premium surcharge, neither of which Greenly had done. Since the accident occurred with more than three men on board, Mariner reduced P&amp;I payments in proportion to the ratio between what it considered to be the stated and actual number of crew members. It accomplished this reduction by withholding the calculated amount from the payment due to Greenly under the policy's first-party coverage on the vessel's hull and machinery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coverage disputes usually depend upon the language of the policy, and this case is no different. The critical provision is the Crew Warranty clause, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In consideration of the premium charged, it is warranted that coverage hereunder is provided for not more than three (3) crew members aboard the insured vessel at any one time. Also, warranted that in the event additional crew are to be covered hereunder, the Assured shall give prior notice to this Company and pay such additional premium as is required. If the Assured shall fail to give such prior notice and at the time of loss with respect to crew there are more crew on board, this insurance shall respond only in the proportion that the stated number of crew bears to the number on board at the time of the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key to interpreting this clause lies in the meaning of the word \"crew.\" The protagonists read this word quite differently. On the one hand, Mariner maintains that the word is unambiguous and that its common meaning includes the entire complement of individuals working aboard a vessel in any capacity (e.g., ordinary seamen, deck hands, the cook, the engineer, the mate, the captain). On this reading, Mariner urged the district court to find that Morse (the captain) necessarily comprised part of the crew, and that, therefore, his presence, together with that of three ordinary seamen, breached the warranty. Greenly, on the other hand, maintains that the word \"crew\" at the very least excludes the ship's captain. On this reading, he urged the district court to find that Morse (qua captain) did not comprise a part of the crew, and that, therefore, the warranty was fulfilled (i.e., the \"crew\" on board at the time of the sinking numbered three).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge essentially accepted Greenly's position. On de novo review, the district judge agreed with Greenly in the first instance; he found that the word \"crew,\" in and of itself, was ambiguous. But this proved to be a Pyrrhic victory, for the judge went on to rule that, \"[r]ead in its context, the crew warranty objectively manifests an intent to cover the captain as well as other members of the ship's crew.\" The district judge thereupon rejected the magistrate's recommendation, denied Greenly's motion for summary judgment, and granted Mariner's cross-motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Cadle Co. v.

Here, the insured reasonably could have thought that a non-owner captain was not considered part of the crew, and that he was fully protected despite the introduction of a new captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, this case is governed by the well-settled rule that, in doubtful situations involving genuine ambiguities, policy language is to be construed against the insurer (who drafted the policy and thus could have avoided the ambiguity) and in favor of maximizing coverage. See Foundation for Blood <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Research,</span> <span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">180</span></span>; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Geyerhahn,</span> <span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1261</span></span>; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wood,</span> <span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1174</span></span>. We believe this canon carries decretory significance in the instant case -- a case in which a policy term that controls the extent of the insured's coverage is both ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to alternative interpretations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We conclude that the policy contains an inherently ambiguous term. Because we find the insured's interpretation of this term as plausible as the insurer's, we see no principled basis for departing from the default rule that requires courts to resolve such ambiguities in favor of coverage. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mariner functions as a general agent for Clarendon (the underwriter). For present purposes, it is unnecessary to distinguish between them.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The parties are in apparent agreement that, if Greenly breached the Crew Warranty clause, the insurer properly calculated the coinsurance penalty and justifiably implemented the setoff.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Once a court has determined that a material term in a contract is ambiguous, resolution of that ambiguity in some instances may require an assessment of extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent and thus become a question for the factfinder, precluding summary judgment. See, e.g., Fowler v. Boise Cascade Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571256\"><a href=\"/opinion/571256/mark-a-fowler-and-famah-fowler-v-boise-cascade-corporation-and-third/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir. 1991). Here, however, the policy itself not only fails to resolve the ambiguity of the word \"crew,\" but the inconclusive extracontractual evidence of the parties' intent also fails to generate a genuine issue of material fact. Therefore, we treat the dispositive issue as a question of law, engendering de novo review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Of course, the policy documents could have defined the term \"crew,\" but the insurer eschewed that simple expedient.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
