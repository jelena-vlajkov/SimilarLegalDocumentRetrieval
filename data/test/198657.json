Smith Barney, Inc. (\"Smith\r\nBarney\") challenges a district court order which rejected its\r\nintermediate appeal from a bankruptcy court order which dismissed\r\nits adversary proceeding contesting the dischargeability of a\r\n$272,596 state court judgment obtained by Smith Barney against\r\nchapter 7 debtor Josephine Strangie.  We affirm.\r\n                      I\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\nAnthony Strangie incorporated Mystic Valley Financial\r\nCorporation (\"Mystic Valley\") in 1989, designating himself and\r\nJosephine Strangie, his wife, as its only officers and directors. \r\nJosephine played no significant role in the operation of Mystic\r\nValley, other than as corporate clerk and a designated signatory on\r\nthe corporate checking account.  Although there is no evidence that\r\nJosephine ever signed corporate checks, she acknowledged filling in\r\ndates, payee names, and amounts on some corporate checks, always in\r\nstrict accordance with her husband's explicit directions.  She had\r\nno personal knowledge regarding Mystic Valley's assets or account\r\nbalances; and all corporate checks, including those filled in by\r\nJosephine pursuant to her husband's direction, were signed by\r\nAnthony Strangie alone.\r\nIn June 1991, Anthony Strangie directed Smith Barney to\r\npurchase securities on the Mystic Valley securities account at a\r\ncost of $89,376.  After considerable procrastination, Anthony sent\r\nSmith Barney a Mystic Valley check, drawn and signed by him.  Not\r\nonly was the check issued without sufficient funds, but Anthony\r\nimmediately stopped payment on it as well.\r\nThe following year, Smith Barney obtained a Florida state\r\ncourt judgment for $272,596 against Mystic Valley.  Thereafter, it\r\nbrought suit against Mystic Valley and the Strangies in a\r\nMassachusetts state court for the purpose of enforcing its Florida\r\njudgment.  While the Massachusetts action remained pending, Anthony\r\nStrangie died.  Shortly thereafter the Massachusetts court\r\nconditionally allowed Josephine Strangie's counsel to withdraw from\r\nthe case.\r\nFive months later, Smith Barney moved for summary\r\njudgment on the ground that the Mystic Valley corporate veil should\r\nbe pierced so as to allow the Florida judgment to be enforced\r\nagainst Josephine.  Smith Barney maintained that Josephine had\r\ndisregarded corporate formalities, commingled corporate and\r\npersonal assets, diverted Mystic Valley assets to personal\r\npurposes, and fraudulently misused the corporate form to induce\r\nSmith Barney to transact business with Mystic Valley.  Absent\r\nopposition to the motion, the Massachusetts state court directed\r\nsummary judgment for Smith Barney by endorsement on August 26,\r\n1996.\r\nAfter Josephine Strangie filed her chapter 7 petition,\r\nSmith Barney initiated an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy\r\ncourt, claiming that her fraudulent misuse of the corporate form\r\nhad rendered the $272,596 judgment nondischargeable.  See\r\nBankruptcy Code  523(a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6); 11 U.S.C. \r\n523(a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6).  Shortly after trial began before the\r\nbankruptcy court, Smith Barney filed a motion in limine contending\r\nthat the default judgment obtained in Massachusetts state court on\r\nAugust 26, 1996, collaterally estopped Josephine from relitigating\r\nwhether the Mystic Valley corporate form should be disregarded,\r\nthereby necessitating a determination that the default judgment\r\nobtained by Smith Barney was nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code\r\n523.\r\nAlthough the bankruptcy court denied the motion in\r\nlimine, it invited Smith Barney to adduce evidence as to (i)\r\nwhether Josephine had been sufficiently active in Mystic Valley to\r\nwarrant piercing the corporate veil, and (ii) whether her conduct\r\nconstituted sufficient grounds for determining that the Smith\r\nBarney debt was nondischargeable.  At that point, Smith Barney\r\nbriefly called Josephine to the stand, then rested its case.  In\r\ndue course, the bankruptcy court entered judgment for Josephine. \r\nFollowing an unsuccessful intermediate appeal to the district\r\ncourt, Smith Barney brought the instant appeal.\r\n                      II\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nA.   The Motion in Limine\r\nFirst, Smith Barney contends that the bankruptcy court\r\nabused its discretion by denying the motion in limine.  Under\r\nMassachusetts law, \"collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of\r\nissues determined in prior actions between the parties or those in\r\nprivity with the parties, [provided the issues were] actually\r\nlitigated in the first action, and determined by a 'final judgment\r\non the merits.'\"  Sena v. Commonwealth, 629 N.E.2d 986, 992 (Mass.\r\n1994) (citations omitted).  The bankruptcy court determined that\r\nthe apparent withdrawal of Josephine Strangie's counsel   five\r\nmonths before the 1996 default judgment was entered   had\r\nconfounded any \"actual litigation\" of the corporate-veil-piercing\r\nissue, and alternatively that the order allowing Smith Barney's\r\nmotion for summary judgment did not qualify as a \"final judgment.\" \r\nAs we agree with the latter ruling, we do not address the former.\r\nAlthough the state court allowed the motion for summary\r\njudgment by margin endorsement in August 1996, there has been no\r\nshowing that its endorsement was ever reduced to judgment. \r\nFurthermore, the motion for summary judgment named only Josephine\r\nStrangie, who was but one of three defendants in the case.  Smith\r\nBarney neither contends, nor has it demonstrated, that its claims\r\nagainst Mystic Valley and the Estate of Anthony Strangie were no\r\nlonger pending, nor that Smith Barney ever sought to certify the\r\ninterlocutory partial summary judgment against Josephine Strangie\r\nas \"final,\" pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  Thus, the state-\r\ncourt default judgment against Josephine Strangie presently remains\r\nnonappealable.\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, collateral estoppel normally is\r\nnot triggered by a nonappealable judgment.  See Sena, 629 N.E.2d at\r\n992; Tausevich v. Board of Appeals of Stoughton, 521 N.E.2d 385,\r\n387 (Mass. 1988) (holding that partial summary judgment \"[not]\r\nentered under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(b)\" has no res judicata effect). \r\nSince the state court judgment against Josephine was interlocutory,\r\nsee Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (\"[T]he order or other form of decision\r\nis subject to revision at any time . . . .\"), the bankruptcy court\r\ncorrectly rejected Smith Barney's motion in limine.\r\nB.   Piercing the Corporate Veil\r\n\nNext, Smith Barney argues that it was clear error for the\r\nbankruptcy court to reject its evidence of Josephine's fraudulent\r\nintent and to refuse either to pierce the corporate veil or declare\r\nthe judgment debt nondischargeable.  We do not agree.\r\nFirst, Smith Barney acknowledged before the bankruptcy\r\ncourt that it filed its adversary proceeding based solely on its\r\nassumption that its pretrial motion in limine would prevail, and\r\nthat the collateral estoppel doctrine would obviate the need to\r\npresent evidence before the bankruptcy court that the Mystic Valley\r\ncorporate veil should be pierced at Josephine's expense.  In other\r\nwords, Smith Barney sought to capitalize on the partial summary\r\njudgment allowed by endorsement in the state court proceeding, even\r\nthough the endorsement resulted solely from Josephine's  procedural\r\ndefault, rather than from any ruling on the merits.  Smith Barney\r\nthereby would be spared the difficult task of establishing that in\r\nthese circumstances Josephine should be found personally liable for\r\nthe Mystic Valley judgment debt.  Thus, it is not surprising that\r\nafter the court denied the in limine motion, Smith Barney managed\r\nonly a lame attempt to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court that\r\nJosephine should be held personally liable.\r\nSecond, Smith Barney appears to assume that any evidence\r\nthat Josephine Strangie fraudulently misused the corporate form\r\nwould serve not only to subject her to personal liability for\r\nMystic Valley's debts, but also render nondischargeable any debt\r\nshe owed Smith Barney pursuant to Bankruptcy Code  523(a)(2)\r\n(obtaining property by materially false statement in writing);\r\n(a)(4) (fraud); (a)(6) (willful or malicious injury).  Since we\r\naffirm the bankruptcy court's finding that Smith Barney failed to\r\nestablish that it may pierce the corporate veil, there is no need\r\nto address its section 523(a) claims inasmuch as Josephine\r\nobviously has no need for a bankruptcy discharge in relation to\r\nobligations for which she was never liable.\r\nFinally, Smith Barney expressly endorsed the \"corporate\r\nveil piercing\" standards set out in My Bread Baking Co. v.\r\nCumberland Farms, Inc., 233 N.E.2d 748 (Mass. 1968): \"A . . .\r\nperson controlling a corporation and directing, or participating\r\nactively in its operations may become subject to civil or criminal\r\nliability on principles of agency or of causation, . . . where\r\n[the] corporation[] [was] formed, or availed of, to carry out the\r\nobjectives and purposes of the . . . persons controlling them.\" \r\nId. at 751 (emphasis added.)  Essentially, Smith Barney's theory\r\nwas that the close relationship between Anthony and Josephine, and\r\ntheir persistent disregard of Mystic Valley's corporate form,\r\nestablished that they jointly  \"use[d] . . . the corporation in\r\npromoting fraud.\"  Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling Co. v. Checkers, Inc.,\r\n754 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nSmith Barney sought to show that Anthony Strangie used\r\nMystic Valley funds for personal purposes.  Thus, as Anthony's\r\nspouse, Josephine may well have derived coincidental personal\r\nbenefit from some of those diversions.  What Smith Barney failed to\r\ndemonstrate, however, is that Josephine directly and knowingly\r\nparticipated in any alleged diversion.  Rather, the only evidence\r\nSmith Barney adduced was that Josephine performed minor ministerial\r\ntasks, by occasionally driving her husband to the bank to make\r\ndeposits in corporate accounts, and by filling out the date, payee\r\nname, and amount spaces on some corporate checks at Anthony's\r\nspecific direction. Moreover, she testified unequivocally and\r\nwithout evidentiary contradiction that she was never involved in or\r\nprivy to the corporate business, which was handled by her husband\r\non his own.  Thus, Smith Barney's citation to Pepsi-Cola Metro.\r\nBottling Co., 754 F.2d 10, is unavailing.  There the wife did more\r\nthan passively receive joint benefit from the diversions effected\r\nby the husband.  She signed corporate checks.  So it fairly could\r\nbe said that she actively diverted corporate funds to her personal\r\nuse.  See id. at 16.  Josephine testified, in this case, without\r\ncontradiction, that she signed no corporate checks.\r\n                     III\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, viewed in light of the entire record on\r\nappeal, we conclude that Smith Barney has not demonstrated \"clear\r\nerror\" in the bankruptcy court's determination that the corporate\r\nform should be respected.  See Crane v. Green &amp; Freedman Baking\r\nCo., 134 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that whether to pierce\r\ncorporate veil is a factual issue, which turns on an examination of\r\nthe totality of the circumstances).   As the factfinder, the\r\nbankruptcy court was entitled to make reasonable credibility\r\ndeterminations, see Brandt v. Repco Printers &amp; Lithographics, Inc.\r\n(In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 132 F.3d 104, 108 (1st Cir. 1997),\r\nand \"[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\r\nfactfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous,\" \r\nPalmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 790 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation\r\nomitted).\r\nAffirmed; costs to appellee.\n",

(\"Smith Barney\") challenges a district court order which rejected its intermediate appeal from a bankruptcy court order which dismissed its adversary proceeding contesting the dischargeability of a $272,596 state court judgment obtained by Smith Barney against chapter 7 debtor Josephine Strangie. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anthony Strangie incorporated Mystic Valley Financial Corporation (\"Mystic Valley\") in 1989, designating himself and Josephine Strangie, his wife, as its only officers and directors. Josephine played no significant role in the operation of Mystic Valley, other than as corporate clerk and a designated signatory on the corporate checking account. Although there is no evidence that Josephine ever signed corporate checks, she acknowledged filling in dates, payee names, and amounts on some corporate checks, always in strict accordance with her husband's explicit directions. She had no personal knowledge regarding Mystic Valley's assets or account balances; and all corporate checks, including those filled in by Josephine pursuant to her husband's direction, were signed by Anthony Strangie alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1991, Anthony Strangie directed Smith Barney to purchase securities on the Mystic Valley securities account at a cost of $89,376. After considerable procrastination, Anthony sent Smith Barney a Mystic Valley check, drawn and signed by him. Not only was the check issued without sufficient funds, but Anthony immediately stopped payment on it as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following year, Smith Barney obtained a Florida state court judgment for $272,596 against Mystic Valley. Thereafter, it brought suit against Mystic Valley and the Strangies in a Massachusetts state court for the purpose of enforcing its Florida judgment. While the Massachusetts action remained pending, Anthony Strangie died. Shortly thereafter the Massachusetts court conditionally allowed Josephine Strangie's counsel to withdraw from the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five months later, Smith Barney moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Mystic Valley corporate veil should be pierced so as to allow the Florida judgment to be enforced against Josephine. Smith Barney maintained that Josephine had disregarded corporate formalities, commingled corporate and personal assets, diverted Mystic Valley assets to personal purposes, and fraudulently misused the corporate form to induce Smith Barney to transact business with Mystic Valley. Absent opposition to the motion, the Massachusetts state court directed summary judgment for Smith Barney by endorsement on August 26, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Josephine Strangie filed her chapter 7 petition, Smith Barney initiated an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court, claiming that her fraudulent misuse of the corporate form had rendered the $272,596 judgment nondischargeable. See Bankruptcy Code &#167;&#167; 523(a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6); 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 523(a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6). Shortly after trial began before the bankruptcy court, Smith Barney filed a motion in limine contending that the default judgment obtained in Massachusetts state court on August 26, 1996, collaterally estopped Josephine from relitigating whether the Mystic Valley corporate form should be disregarded, thereby necessitating a determination that the default judgment obtained by Smith Barney was nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bankruptcy court denied the motion in limine, it invited Smith Barney to adduce evidence as to (i) whether Josephine had been sufficiently active in Mystic Valley to warrant piercing the corporate veil, and (ii) whether her conduct constituted sufficient grounds for determining that the Smith Barney debt was nondischargeable. At that point, Smith Barney briefly called Josephine to the stand, then rested its case. In due course, the bankruptcy court entered judgment for Josephine. Following an unsuccessful intermediate appeal to the district court, Smith Barney brought the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Motion in Limine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Smith Barney contends that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by denying the motion in limine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Under Massachusetts law, \"collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues determined in prior actions between the parties or those in privity with the parties, [provided the issues were] actually litigated in the first action, and determined by a 'final judgment on the merits.'\" Sena v. Commonwealth, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span>, 992 (Mass. 1994) (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The bankruptcy court determined that the apparent withdrawal of Josephine Strangie's counsel -- five months before the 1996 default judgment was entered -- had confounded any \"actual litigation\" of the corporate-veil-piercing issue, and alternatively that the order allowing Smith Barney's motion for summary judgment did not qualify as a \"final judgment.\" As we agree with the latter ruling, we do not address the former.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the state court allowed the motion for summary judgment by margin endorsement in August 1996, there has been no showing that its endorsement was ever reduced to judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Furthermore, the motion for summary judgment named only Josephine Strangie, who was but one of three defendants in the case. Smith Barney neither contends, nor has it demonstrated, that its claims against Mystic Valley and the Estate of Anthony Strangie were no longer pending, nor that Smith Barney ever sought to certify the interlocutory partial summary judgment against Josephine Strangie as \"final,\" pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, the state-court default judgment against Josephine Strangie presently remains nonappealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, collateral estoppel normally is not triggered by a nonappealable judgment. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sena,</span> <span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">992</span></span>; Tausevich v. Board of Appeals of Stoughton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></span>, 387 (Mass. 1988) (holding that partial summary judgment \"[not] entered under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(b)\" has no res judicata effect).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Since the state court judgment against Josephine was interlocutory, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (\"[T]he order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time . . . .\"), the bankruptcy court correctly rejected Smith Barney's motion in limine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Piercing the Corporate Veil</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Smith Barney argues that it was clear error for the bankruptcy court to reject its evidence of Josephine's fraudulent intent and to refuse either to pierce the corporate veil or declare the judgment debt nondischargeable. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Smith Barney acknowledged before the bankruptcy court that it filed its adversary proceeding based solely on its assumption that its pretrial motion in limine would prevail, and that the collateral estoppel doctrine would obviate the need to present evidence before the bankruptcy court that the Mystic Valley corporate veil should be pierced at Josephine's expense. In other words, Smith Barney sought to capitalize on the partial summary judgment allowed by endorsement in the state court proceeding, even though the endorsement resulted solely from Josephine's procedural default, rather than from any ruling on the merits. Smith Barney thereby would be spared the difficult task of establishing that in these circumstances Josephine should be found personally liable for the Mystic Valley judgment debt. Thus, it is not surprising that after the court denied the in limine motion, Smith Barney managed only a lame attempt to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court that Josephine should be held personally liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Smith Barney appears to assume that any evidence that Josephine Strangie fraudulently misused the corporate form would serve not only to subject her to personal liability for Mystic Valley's debts, but also render nondischargeable any debt she owed Smith Barney pursuant to Bankruptcy Code &#167;&#167; 523(a)(2) (obtaining property by materially false statement in writing); (a)(4) (fraud); (a)(6) (willful or malicious injury). Since we affirm the bankruptcy court's finding that Smith Barney failed to establish that it may pierce the corporate veil, there is no need to address its section 523(a) claims inasmuch as Josephine obviously has no need for a bankruptcy discharge in relation to obligations for which she was never liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Smith Barney expressly endorsed the \"corporate veil piercing\" standards set out in My Bread Baking Co. v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span> </span>(Mass. 1968): \"A . . . person controlling a corporation and directing, or participating actively in its operations may become subject to civil or criminal liability on principles of agency or of causation, . . . where [the] corporation[] [was] formed, or availed of, to carry out the objectives and purposes of the . . . persons controlling them.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 751 </span>(emphasis added.) Essentially, Smith Barney's theory was that the close relationship between Anthony and Josephine, and their persistent disregard of Mystic Valley's corporate form, established that they jointly \"use[d] . . . the corporation in promoting fraud.\" Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling Co. v. Checkers, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"447586\"><a href=\"/opinion/447586/pepsi-cola-metropolitan-bottling-company-inc-v-checkers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith Barney sought to show that Anthony Strangie used Mystic Valley funds for personal purposes. Thus, as Anthony's spouse, Josephine may well have derived coincidental personal benefit from some of those diversions. What Smith Barney failed to demonstrate, however, is that Josephine directly and knowingly participated in any alleged diversion. Rather, the only evidence Smith Barney adduced was that Josephine performed minor ministerial tasks, by occasionally driving her husband to the bank to make deposits in corporate accounts, and by filling out the date, payee name, and amount spaces on some corporate checks at Anthony's specific direction. Moreover, she testified unequivocally and without evidentiary contradiction that she was never involved in or privy to the corporate business, which was handled by her husband on his own. Thus, Smith Barney's citation to Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"447586\"><a href=\"/opinion/447586/pepsi-cola-metropolitan-bottling-company-inc-v-checkers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, is unavailing. There the wife did more than passively receive joint benefit from the diversions effected by the husband. She signed corporate checks. So it fairly could be said that she actively diverted corporate funds to her personal use.
