Robinowitz for petitioner.\n     Brenda M. O'Malley, Office of Immigration Litigation, Civil\nDivision, Department of Justice, with whom David W. Ogden,\nActing Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Terri J.\nScadron, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, were on consolidated brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                         JUNE 5, 2000\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.    On this appeal, Miguel Noel\n\nFierro seeks review of a final order of removal, and a denial of\n\nreconsideration, from the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"the\n\nBoard\").   The removal order is based on a statutory provision\n\nproviding for the removal from the United States of \"[a]ny alien\n\nwho is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after\n\nadmission.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (Supp. II 1996).\n\nFierro concedes that he has been convicted of such a crime but\n\nsays that he is not an alien but rather a citizen of the United\n\nStates.\n\n           The critical background facts are not in dispute.\n\nFierro was born in Cuba on October 25, 1962.   He and both of his\n\nparents were admitted to the United States as refugees in 1970.\n\nOn October 19, 1973, Fierro's parents were divorced pursuant to\n\na decree from a Massachusetts probate court, and the decree\n\nawarded Fierro's mother custody of both Fierro and his sister.\n\nOn March 25, 1976, Fierro's immigration status was changed to\n\nthat of lawful permanent resident.\n\n           On March 21, 1978, when Fierro was 15 years old, his\n\nfather became a naturalized citizen.     Had Fierro then been in\n\nthe \"legal custody\" of his father, he would automatically have\n\nbecome an American citizen under 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a) (1994),\n\nwhich in defined circumstances provides automatic citizenship\n\n\n                              -3-\n\ffor alien children whose parents are naturalized.                     Pertinent\n\nlanguage in the statute, reprinted in full in an appendix to\n\nthis decision, grants such citizenship to a child born outside\n\nthe United States upon \"[t]he naturalization of the parent\n\nhaving legal custody of the child when there has been a legal\n\nseparation of the parents,\" assuming that this occurs while the\n\nchild is under age 18 and that the child is a lawful permanent\n\nresident.    Id.    The last two conditions are satisfied here, and\n\nthe case thus turns on whether the first condition (\"legal\n\ncustody\") can also be met.\n\n            On    February     15,   1996,    Fierro    was       convicted   in\n\nMassachusetts of larceny and sentenced to a term of four years\n\nin prison.       It is undisputed that this conviction makes him an\n\naggravated       felon   subject      to     removal.         8     U.S.C.    §§\n\n1101(a)(43)(G), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (Supp. II 1996).                    Fierro's\n\ncriminal record is fairly long and it includes drug offenses,\n\nbreaking and entering with intent to commit a felony, assault\n\nand battery, larceny, uttering and forgery.             However, it was the\n\n1996 larceny conviction that triggered an INS proceeding to\n\nremove Fierro from the country.\n\n            In the removal proceeding, Fierro argued inter alia\n\nthat he became a United States citizen when his father was\n\nnaturalized in 1978.         On January 5, 1998, the immigration judge\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\frejected Fierro's citizenship claim because his mother had been\n\nawarded legal custody of him in 1973 and had never become a\n\nnaturalized citizen.   The judge ordered Fierro removed to Cuba.\n\nFierro then appealed to the Board and on appeal he submitted an\n\namended custody judgment secured from the Massachusetts probate\n\ncourt dated May 18, 1998, four months after the immigration\n\njudge's removal order.   Although Fierro was now 35 years old,\n\nthis decree purported to award custody to Fierro's father \"nunc\n\npro tunc to September 1, 1977.\"\n\n          On March 29, 1999, the Board issued a decision holding\n\nthat Fierro should be given an opportunity to pursue a different\n\navenue to avoid removal but it dismissed Fierro's claim of\n\ncitizenship, concluding that the state court's 1998 modification\n\nof the custody decree had no effect on Fierro's citizenship\n\nstatus.   After correcting a factual error on reconsideration,\n\nthe Board adhered to its ultimate conclusion.       Fierro then\n\nabandoned his alternative avenue for seeking to avoid removal\n\nand sought review of the Board's rejection of his citizenship\n\nclaim.\n\n          The procedural path by which Fierro arrived in this\n\ncourt is complicated, see Fierro v. INS, 81 F. Supp. 2d 167 (D.\n\nMass. 1999); Fierro v. INS, 66 F. Supp.2d 229 (D. Mass. 1999),\n\nbut the intricacies are of no importance on this appeal, which\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fthe government concedes is properly before this court.                      This\n\ncourt's authority to review removal orders based on an alien's\n\ncommission of an aggravated felony has recently been restricted,\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C) (Supp. II 1996), but this does not bar\n\nFierro's claim on review that he is a citizen rather than an\n\nalien, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(5); Maghsoudi v. INS, 181 F.3d 8, 13\n\nn.12 (1st Cir. 1999); Hall v. INS, 167 F.3d 852, 855-56 (4th\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n           It is common ground that Fierro was not subject to\n\nremoval as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony if he is\n\npresently an American citizen.             Whether Fierro is an American\n\ncitizen    turns,     in   this   case,    entirely    on    issues    of   law,\n\nincluding the meaning of the automatic citizenship statute in\n\nquestion, 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a) (1994), and the legal effect to be\n\naccorded   to   the    nunc   pro   tunc   ruling     of   the   Massachusetts\n\nprobate court.      Accordingly, our review is de novo and there is\n\nno occasion to transfer the case to a district court to resolve\n\nfactual disputes pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(5)(B) (Supp. II\n\n1996).\n\n           Citizenship for one not born in the United States may\n\nbe acquired \"only as provided by Acts of Congress.\"                   Miller v.\n\nAlbright, 523 U.S. 420, 423 (1998).             Here, Fierro's claim of\n\ncitizenship requires that there have occurred, while he was\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\funder 18 and a permanent resident, \"the naturalization of the\n\nparent having legal custody of the child.\"                   8 U.S.C. § 1432(a)\n\n(1994).    What is meant by the phrase \"having legal custody of\n\nthe    child\"    is,   of   course,    a   question     of   federal   statutory\n\ninterpretation.         But the Immigration and Naturalization Act\n\nprovides    no    definition     nor       does   the    legislative    history\n\nilluminate the concept.               See H.R. Rep. No. 82-1365 (1952),\n\nreprinted in 1952 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1653, 1740.\n\n            Legal relationships between parents and children are\n\ntypically governed by state law, there being \"no federal law of\n\ndomestic relations.\"         De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. 570, 580\n\n(1956); see also Ex parte Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593-94 (1890).\n\nAccordingly, subject to possible limitations, we think that the\n\nrequirement of \"legal custody\" in section 1432 should be taken\n\npresumptively to mean legal custody under the law of the state\n\nin question.      Although there is no decision directly on point,\n\nthis view is consistent with the approach taken in other cases\n\nin which a federal statute depends upon relations that are\n\nprimarily governed by state law.              E.g., De Sylva, 351 U.S. at\n\n580.\n\n            On the premise that state law presumptively governs\n\nsuch relationships, Fierro reasons that the matter is controlled\n\nby the state probate court judgment entered in May 1998.                      In\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat   judgment,    the    court   purported   to    decree   that   \"as   of\n\nSeptember 1, 1977 custody of the minor child [Fierro] . . . is\n\nto be awarded\" to the father and that \"said order granting\n\ncustody [of Fierro to his father] . . . be entered nunc pro tunc\n\nto September 1, 1977.\"          There is authority under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, as in other jurisdictions, that a \"judgment entered nunc\n\npro tunc is respected and enforced as if it had been entered at\n\nthe proper time.\"         43 Flanagan, Massachusetts Practice § 406\n\n(1993 & Supp. 1999).\n\n            Fierro's argument is not without a certain surface\n\nplausibility, but we do not accept it.              It is, as will become\n\napparent, quite doubtful whether the nunc pro tunc decree is\n\ncorrect even as a matter of Massachusetts law; but while the\n\nreasons for suspecting a possible infirmity are pertinent to our\n\nultimate holding, we do not rely upon this ground.            Rather, even\n\nassuming arguendo that the nunc pro tunc order accords with\n\nMassachusetts law, it reflects an approach to defining legal\n\ncustody that is not consistent with section 1432.\n\n            It is useful to begin by explaining in somewhat more\n\ndetail (there is not a lot of detail available) the origin and\n\nsubstance    of   the   state    decree-modification     proceeding.       In\n\nDecember 1997, after the removal proceedings against Fierro had\n\nbegun but before the immigration judge rejected Fierro's claim\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fof citizenship, his parents filed a \"complaint for modification\"\n\nin the probate court which asserted that on or about September\n\n1, 1977, Fierro had moved to Florida to live with his father.\n\nAccompanying affidavits from Fierro's parents indicated that\n\nFierro had at that date moved to Florida to live with his father\n\nin order to enroll in a school in Miami, Florida, and that\n\nFierro was thus living with his father when in early 1978 his\n\nfather became an American citizen.\n\n              The complaint for modification expressed the joint\n\nrequest of the parents that the order be entered \"nunc pro tunc\n\nto   .   .    .   September   1,   1977,\"   explaining     that    \"[t]his\n\nmodification is necessary for Miguel Noel Fierro to derive\n\ncitizenship through his father and avoid being deported to\n\nCuba.\"       There is no indication of what proceedings, if any,\n\nfollowed, but by order dated May 18, 1998, the probate court\n\ngranted the judgment modifying the earlier divorce and custody\n\ndecree   in    terms   already   described--awarding     custody   to   the\n\nfather and providing that the custody order be entered nunc pro\n\ntunc to September 1, 1977.\n\n              Whether this is a proper nunc pro tunc order under\n\nstate law is open to question.        Like many other concepts in the\n\nlaw wrongly assumed to have a fixed meaning, nunc pro tunc is a\n\nsomewhat loose concept, like \"jurisdiction\" or \"waiver,\" used\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fsomewhat differently by different courts in different contexts.\n\nLiterally meaning \"now for then\" (in Latin)         see Black's Law\n\nDictionary 1097 (7th ed. 1999), it is a phrase typically used by\n\ncourts to specify that an order entered at a later date should\n\nbe given effect retroactive to an earlier date--that is, that it\n\nshould be treated for legal purposes as if entered on the\n\nearlier date.      Id.   The critical question here is not the\n\nintended effect of the phrase but in what circumstances a court\n\nmay properly order that a new judgment be given effect nunc pro\n\ntunc.\n\n         The core notion, in Massachusetts as in many other\n\njurisdictions, is that a nunc pro tunc order is appropriate\n\nprimarily to correct the record at a later date to make the\n\nrecord reflect what the court or other body actually intended to\n\ndo at an earlier date but did not sufficiently express or did\n\nnot get around to doing through some error or inadvertence.\n\nThus, a clerical mistake in a judgment might be corrected nunc\n\npro tunc when discovered later or a franchise sought as of\n\nOctober 1 might be backdated to that date where the application\n\nwas timely made.\n\n         These     concepts   are   embodied   in   a   widely   cited\n\nMassachusetts case explaining the scope of a court's nunc pro\n\ntunc authority as follows:\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f            The function of a nunc pro tunc order in\n         general is to put upon the record and to\n         render efficacious some finding, direction\n         or adjudication of the court made actually\n         or inferentially at an earlier time, which\n         by accident, mistake or oversight was not\n         made [a] matter of record, or to validate\n         some proceeding actually taken but by\n         oversight or mistake not authorized, or to\n         prevent a failure of justice resulting,\n         directly or indirectly from delay in court\n         proceedings subsequent to a time when a\n         judgment, order or decree ought to and would\n         have been entered, save that the cause was\n         pending under advisement.\n\nPerkins v. Perkins, 114 N.E. 713, 713-14 (Mass. 1917).   However,\n\nit is clear that there are limits on the court's authority to\n\nmake retroactive revisions to prior orders.   In Perkins itself,\n\nthe court said that \"a defect in a judgment, order or decree\n\nwhich expressed exactly the intention of the court at the time\n\nwhen it was made cannot be remedied by a nunc pro tunc entry.\"\n\nId. at 714.1\n\n         Under the then-prevailing decree, Fierro on September\n\n1, 1977, was--and was intended by the probate court to be--in\n\nthe \"legal custody\" of his mother.   Fierro had moved in with his\n\nfather and perhaps the probate court might, if requested at the\n\ntime, have ordered a transfer of legal custody.      But nothing\n\n\n\n    1Many other jurisdictions have said much the same thing.\nE.g., Murry v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 725 S.W.2d 571,\n572 (Ark. 1987); Jones v. Jones, 442 P.2d 319, 322-23 (Okla.\n1968); 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments § 157 (1994).\n\n                             -11-\n\fprevented his mother from retaining legal custody while Fierro\n\nwas living (apparently for about a year) with his father in\n\nFlorida.     There is no indication of error, inadvertence or any\n\nof the conventional preconditions under Massachusetts law for a\n\nrevision of the original decree nunc pro tunc.\n\n            The Supreme Court has held that where federal law\n\nincorporates a state characterization, a state trial court's\n\nconstruction of state law is not binding on a federal court.\n\nSee Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, 457 (1967)\n\n(federal estate tax liability turning on character of property\n\ninterest).     Several circuit courts have applied the Bosch rule\n\nin the context of probate court nunc pro tunc orders, holding\n\nthat these orders are controlling for purposes of federal tax\n\nliability only when the federal court determines that they are\n\nproper     under   state   law.       E.g.,   Estate     of   Goldstein   v.\n\nCommissioner, 479 F.2d 813, 816-20 (10th Cir. 1973).             Seemingly,\n\nwe could choose to disregard the probate court's modification\n\norder here as a misapplication of Massachusetts law.\n\n            Instead, we are more comfortable leaving the state law\n\nissue    undecided   and   resting    instead   on   a   strictly   federal\n\nground.    We do not think that Congress can be taken as intending\n\nto give effect, for purposes of section 1432, to the kind of ex\n\npost modification of a custody decree reflected in this record--\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\feven if we assume that for purposes of Massachusetts law (e.g.,\n\ninheritance, taxation), the probate court's modification decree\n\ncould properly reclassify Fierro's status nunc pro tunc as of\n\nSeptember 1977.         This is so for two different reasons.\n\n              First, both the language of the automatic citizenship\n\nprovision and its apparent underlying rationale suggest that\n\nCongress was concerned with the legal custody status of the\n\nchild at the time that the parent was naturalized and during the\n\nminority of the child.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a)(4)-(5) (1994).\n\nCongress clearly intended that the child's citizenship should\n\nfollow that of the parent who then had legal custody and it is\n\nrather easy to imagine the reasons for this choice:                   presumably\n\nCongress wanted the child to be protected against separation\n\nfrom    the    parent    having    legal     custody    during    the   child's\n\nminority.\n\n              Here, viewing matters at the time that Fierro's father\n\nbecame naturalized (and indeed through the time that Fierro\n\nturned 18), Fierro was under Massachusetts law in the legal\n\ncustody of his mother, and any Massachusetts court asked in 1978\n\nwould   certainly       have   identified      his     mother    as   the   legal\n\ncustodian under the 1973 decree.             It is thus hard to see how it\n\ncould be said that in 1978 there occurred the \"naturalization of\n\nthe parent having legal custody of the child,\" as section 1432\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\frequires.     Similarly, the apparent rationale of the statute\n\nwould hardly be served by conferring citizenship on Fierro for\n\nthe first time at age 35.\n\n            Second, recognizing the nunc pro tunc order in the\n\npresent case would in substance allow the state court to create\n\nloopholes in the immigration laws on grounds of perceived equity\n\nor fairness.    There is no suggestion that the original custody\n\ndecree was entered by mistake, was contrary to law, or otherwise\n\ndid not reflect the true legal relationship between Fierro and\n\nhis parents at any time during his minority.         Congress' rules\n\nfor naturalization must be applied as they are written, and a\n\nstate court has no more power to modify them on equitable\n\ngrounds than does a federal court or agency.       See generally INS\n\nv. Pangilinan, 486 U.S. 875, 883-85 (1988); Examining Bd. of\n\nEngineers, Architects & Surveyors v. de Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 605\n\n(1976).\n\n            Obviously   there   are   equitable   arguments   against\n\nseparating Fierro even as an adult from his parents, one of whom\n\nis a naturalized citizen and the other a permanent resident.\n\nBut Congress did not view these as compelling enough to provide\n\nfor automatic citizenship for a \"child\" who is over 18 at the\n\ntime one or more of his parents becomes naturalized.              And\n\nCongress' fierce intention to deport aggravated felons, despite\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\ftheir   entry    into   this   country    as     children     and    their    long-\n\nstanding   residence      in    the     United      States,    has    only     been\n\nstrengthened by recent legislation.              E.g., Illegal Immigration\n\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No.\n\n104-208, Div. C., tit. III, 110 Stat. 3009-575.\n\n           The     closest     precedent       on    point     is     Miller     v.\n\nChristopher, 96 F.3d 1467 (D.C. Cir. 1996), aff'd sub nom.\n\nMiller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420 (1998).               There, an alien born\n\nout of wedlock sought to gain citizenship through his father\n\nunder an immigration-law provision providing for citizenship if\n\nthe child was legitimated prior to reaching age 21.                     The D.C.\n\nCircuit rejected an effort to achieve this result through a\n\nstate-court      paternity     decree    obtained     after    the    alien     had\n\nreached age 21, holding that to give retroactive effect to the\n\nstate court decree would undercut Congress' intent.                          Id. at\n\n1472-73.   The approach of Miller is not dissimilar to our own.\n\n           Conversely, we think Fierro gets little help from a\n\nBoard doctrine, which he urges us to follow, that \"[i]n the\n\nabsence of judicial determination or judicial or statutory grant\n\nof custody in the case of legal separation . . . the parent\n\nhaving actual uncontested custody is to be regarded as having\n\n'legal custody.'\"       In re M-----, 3 I & N Dec. 850, 856 (BIA\n\n1950); see also In re Yoon, A-39-764-548 (BIA, Dec. 30, 1999)\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f(same).       In our case there was a judicial decree granting\n\ncustody to, and only to, Fierro's mother.            Neither the letter\n\nnor the policy of the default rule expressed in In re M----- has\n\nany application to the present case.\n\n          However, In re M----- does illustrate how careful one\n\nmust be about categorical pronouncements in this area.                There\n\nare too many possible variations to say in the abstract, as the\n\ngovernment urges, that a later state court decree must always be\n\ndisregarded in applying section 1432.          Suppose the original 1973\n\ndecree in Fierro's case had through a clerical error named his\n\nmother as legal custodian when the judge had ruled orally, and\n\nthe parties had understood at the time, that custody had been\n\nawarded to his father.           Our own decision is limited to the\n\ncircumstances before us.\n\n          There is one loose end.             In a pro se motion for\n\nbail/bond or in the alternative for supervised release, Fierro\n\nsays   that    Cuba   is   not   accepting   deportees   and   that   he   is\n\npotentially subject to indefinite detention by the INS, which he\n\nclaims would be unlawful.         Compare Ma v. Reno, 208 F.3d 815 (9th\n\nCir. 2000), with Ho v. Greene, 204 F.3d 1045 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\nAt this point there is nothing in the record to indicate whether\n\nCuba refuses all deportees or has refused or will refuse to\n\naccept Fierro, nor do we know whether in that event the INS\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fwould release Fierro under some form of supervision.       See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1231(a)(3), -(6) (Supp. II 1996); 8 C.F.R. § 241.4,\n\n241.5 (2000).   Our affirmance is without prejudice to any future\n\nassertion of such claims by Fierro if and when they become ripe.\n\n         The petitions for review of the order of removal and\n\ndenial of reconsideration are denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f                            APPENDIX\n\n\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1432 (1994) provides as follows:\n\n   (a)   A child born outside of the United States of alien\nparents, or of an alien parent and a citizen parent who has\nsubsequently lost citizenship of the United States, becomes a\ncitizen of the United States upon fulfillment of the following\nconditions:\n\n    (1)   The naturalization of both parents; or\n\n    (2)   The naturalization of the surviving parent if one of\n          the parents is deceased; or\n\n    (3)   The naturalization of the parent having legal custody\n          of the child when there has been a legal separation of\n          the parents or the naturalization of the mother if the\n          child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the\n          child has not been established by legitimation; and if\n\n    (4)   Such naturalization takes place while such child is\n          under the age of eighteen years; and\n\n    (5)   Such child is residing in the United States pursuant\n          to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the\n          time of the naturalization of the parent last\n          naturalized under clause (1) of this subsection, or\n          the parent naturalized under clause (2) or (3) of this\n          subsection, or thereafter begins to reside permanently\n          in the United States while under the age of eighteen\n          years.\n\n  (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall apply to an adopted\nchild only if the child is residing in the United States at the\ntime of naturalization of such adoptive parent or parents, in\nthe custody of his adoptive parent or parents, pursuant to a\nlawful admission for permanent residence.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

On this appeal, Miguel Noel\n\nFierro seeks review of a final order of removal, and a denial of\n\nreconsideration, from the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"the\n\nBoard\").   The removal order is based on a statutory provision\n\nproviding for the removal from the United States of \"[a]ny alien\n\nwho is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after\n\nadmission.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (Supp. II 1996).\n\nFierro concedes that he has been convicted of such a crime but\n\nsays that he is not an alien but rather a citizen of the United\n\nStates.\n\n           The critical background facts are not in dispute.\n\nFierro was born in Cuba on October 25, 1962.   He and both of his\n\nparents were admitted to the United States as refugees in 1970.\n\nOn October 19, 1973, Fierro's parents were divorced pursuant to\n\na decree from a Massachusetts probate court, and the decree\n\nawarded Fierro's mother custody of both Fierro and his sister.\n\nOn March 25, 1976, Fierro's immigration status was changed to\n\nthat of lawful permanent resident.\n\n           On March 21, 1978, when Fierro was 15 years old, his\n\nfather became a naturalized citizen.     Had Fierro then been in\n\nthe \"legal custody\" of his father, he would automatically have\n\nbecome an American citizen under 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a) (1994),\n\nwhich in defined circumstances provides automatic citizenship\n\n\n                              -3-\n\ffor alien children whose parents are naturalized.                     Pertinent\n\nlanguage in the statute, reprinted in full in an appendix to\n\nthis decision, grants such citizenship to a child born outside\n\nthe United States upon \"[t]he naturalization of the parent\n\nhaving legal custody of the child when there has been a legal\n\nseparation of the parents,\" assuming that this occurs while the\n\nchild is under age 18 and that the child is a lawful permanent\n\nresident.    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>    The last </span><pre class=\"inline\">two conditions are satisfied here, and\n\nthe case thus turns on whether the first condition (\"legal\n\ncustody\") can also be met.\n\n            On    February     15,   1996,    Fierro    was       convicted   in\n\nMassachusetts of larceny and sentenced to a term of four years\n\nin prison.       It is undisputed that this conviction makes him an\n\naggravated       felon   subject      to     removal.         8     U.S.C.    §§\n\n1101(a)(43)(G), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (Supp. II 1996).                    Fierro's\n\ncriminal record is fairly long and it includes drug offenses,\n\nbreaking and entering with intent to commit a felony, assault\n\nand battery, larceny, uttering and forgery.             However, it was the\n\n1996 larceny conviction that triggered an INS proceeding to\n\nremove Fierro from the country.\n\n            In the removal proceeding, Fierro argued inter alia\n\nthat he became a United States citizen when his father was\n\nnaturalized in 1978.         On January 5, 1998, the immigration judge\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\frejected Fierro's citizenship claim because his mother had been\n\nawarded legal custody of him in 1973 and had never become a\n\nnaturalized citizen.   The judge ordered Fierro removed to Cuba.\n\nFierro then appealed to the Board and on appeal he submitted an\n\namended custody judgment secured from the Massachusetts probate\n\ncourt dated May 18, 1998, four months after the immigration\n\njudge's removal order.   Although Fierro was now 35 years old,\n\nthis decree purported to award custody to Fierro's father \"nunc\n\npro tunc to September 1, 1977.\"\n\n          On March 29, 1999, the Board issued a decision holding\n\nthat Fierro should be given an opportunity to pursue a different\n\navenue to avoid removal but it dismissed Fierro's claim of\n\ncitizenship, concluding that the state court's 1998 modification\n\nof the custody decree had no effect on Fierro's citizenship\n\nstatus.   After correcting a factual error on reconsideration,\n\nthe Board adhered to its ultimate conclusion.       Fierro then\n\nabandoned his alternative avenue for seeking to avoid removal\n\nand sought review of the Board's rejection of his citizenship\n\nclaim.\n\n          The procedural path by which Fierro arrived in this\n\ncourt is complicated, see Fierro v.

This\n\ncourt's authority to review removal orders based on an alien's\n\ncommission of an aggravated felony has recently been restricted,\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C) (Supp. II 1996), but this does not bar\n\nFierro's claim on review that he is a citizen rather than an\n\nalien, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(5); Maghsoudi v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198511\"><a href=\"/opinion/198511/maghsoudi-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13\n\nn.12 (1st Cir. 1999); Hall v.

Whether Fierro is an American\n\ncitizen    turns,     in   this   case,    entirely    on    issues    of   law,\n\nincluding the meaning of the automatic citizenship statute in\n\nquestion, 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a) (1994), and the legal effect to be\n\naccorded   to   the    nunc   pro   tunc   ruling     of   the   Massachusetts\n\nprobate court.      Accordingly, our review is de novo and there is\n\nno occasion to transfer the case to a district court to resolve\n\nfactual disputes pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(5)(B) (Supp. II\n\n1996).\n\n           Citizenship for one not born in the United States may\n\nbe acquired \"only as provided by Acts of Congress.\"                   Miller v.\n\nAlbright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118198\"><a href=\"/opinion/118198/miller-v-albright/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423 (1998).             Here, Fierro's claim of\n\ncitizenship requires that there have occurred, while he was\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\funder 18 and a permanent resident, \"the naturalization of the\n\nparent having legal custody of the child.\"                   8 U.S.C. § 1432(a)\n\n(1994).    What is meant by the phrase \"having legal custody of\n\nthe    child\"    is,   of   course,    a   question     of   federal   statutory\n\ninterpretation.         But the Immigration and Naturalization Act\n\nprovides    no    definition     nor       does   the    legislative    history\n\nilluminate the concept.               See H.R. Rep. No. 82-1365 (1952),\n\nreprinted in 1952 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1653, 1740.\n\n            Legal relationships between parents and children are\n\ntypically governed by state law, there being \"no federal law of\n\ndomestic relations.\"         De Sylva v. Ballentine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580\n\n(1956); see also Ex parte Burrus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92845\"><a href=\"/opinion/92845/in-re-burrus/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593-94 (1890).\n\nAccordingly, subject to possible limitations, we think that the\n\nrequirement of \"legal custody\" in section 1432 should be taken\n\npresumptively to mean legal custody under the law of the state\n\nin question.      Although there is no decision directly on point,\n\nthis view is consistent with the approach taken in other cases\n\nin which a federal statute depends upon relations that are\n\nprimarily governed by state law.              E.g., De </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sylva,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at\n\n<span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n            On the premise that state law presumptively governs\n\nsuch relationships, Fierro reasons that the matter is controlled\n\nby the state probate court judgment entered in May 1998.                      In\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat   judgment,    the    court   purported   to    decree   that   \"as   of\n\nSeptember 1, 1977 custody of the minor child [Fierro] . . . is\n\nto be awarded\" to the father and that \"said order granting\n\ncustody [of Fierro to his father] . . . be entered nunc pro tunc\n\nto September 1, 1977.\"          There is authority under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, as in other jurisdictions, that a \"judgment entered nunc\n\npro tunc is respected and enforced as if it had been entered at\n\nthe proper time.\"         43 Flanagan, Massachusetts Practice § 406\n\n(1993 & Supp. 1999).\n\n            Fierro's argument is not without a certain surface\n\nplausibility, but we do not accept it.              It is, as will become\n\napparent, quite doubtful whether the nunc pro tunc decree is\n\ncorrect even as a matter of Massachusetts law; but while the\n\nreasons for suspecting a possible infirmity are pertinent to our\n\nultimate holding, we do not rely upon this ground.            Rather, even\n\nassuming arguendo that the nunc pro tunc order accords with\n\nMassachusetts law, it reflects an approach to defining legal\n\ncustody that is not consistent with section 1432.\n\n            It is useful to begin by explaining in somewhat more\n\ndetail (there is not a lot of detail available) the origin and\n\nsubstance    of   the   state    decree-modification     proceeding.       In\n\nDecember 1997, after the removal proceedings against Fierro had\n\nbegun but before the immigration judge rejected Fierro's claim\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fof citizenship, his parents filed a \"complaint for modification\"\n\nin the probate court which asserted that on or about September\n\n1, 1977, Fierro had moved to Florida to live with his father.\n\nAccompanying affidavits from Fierro's parents indicated that\n\nFierro had at that date moved to Florida to live with his father\n\nin order to enroll in a school in Miami, Florida, and that\n\nFierro was thus living with his father when in early 1978 his\n\nfather became an American citizen.\n\n              The complaint for modification expressed the joint\n\nrequest of the parents that the order be entered \"nunc pro tunc\n\nto   .   .    .   September   1,   1977,\"   explaining     that    \"[t]his\n\nmodification is necessary for Miguel Noel Fierro to derive\n\ncitizenship through his father and avoid being deported to\n\nCuba.\"       There is no indication of what proceedings, if any,\n\nfollowed, but by order dated May 18, 1998, the probate court\n\ngranted the judgment modifying the earlier divorce and custody\n\ndecree   in    terms   already   described--awarding     custody   to   the\n\nfather and providing that the custody order be entered nunc pro\n\ntunc to September 1, 1977.\n\n              Whether this is a proper nunc pro tunc order under\n\nstate law is open to question.        Like many other concepts in the\n\nlaw wrongly assumed to have a fixed meaning, nunc pro tunc is a\n\nsomewhat loose concept, like \"jurisdiction\" or \"waiver,\" used\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fsomewhat differently by different courts in different contexts.\n\nLiterally meaning \"now for then\" (in Latin)         see Black's Law\n\nDictionary 1097 (7th ed. 1999), it is a phrase typically used by\n\ncourts to specify that an order entered at a later date should\n\nbe given effect retroactive to an earlier date--that is, that it\n\nshould be treated for legal purposes as if entered on the\n\nearlier date.      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>   The critical </span><pre class=\"inline\">question here is not the\n\nintended effect of the phrase but in what circumstances a court\n\nmay properly order that a new judgment be given effect nunc pro\n\ntunc.\n\n         The core notion, in Massachusetts as in many other\n\njurisdictions, is that a nunc pro tunc order is appropriate\n\nprimarily to correct the record at a later date to make the\n\nrecord reflect what the court or other body actually intended to\n\ndo at an earlier date but did not sufficiently express or did\n\nnot get around to doing through some error or inadvertence.\n\nThus, a clerical mistake in a judgment might be corrected nunc\n\npro tunc when discovered later or a franchise sought as of\n\nOctober 1 might be backdated to that date where the application\n\nwas timely made.\n\n         These     concepts   are   embodied   in   a   widely   cited\n\nMassachusetts case explaining the scope of a court's nunc pro\n\ntunc authority as follows:\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f            The function of a nunc pro tunc order in\n         general is to put upon the record and to\n         render efficacious some finding, direction\n         or adjudication of the court made actually\n         or inferentially at an earlier time, which\n         by accident, mistake or oversight was not\n         made [a] matter of record, or to validate\n         some proceeding actually taken but by\n         oversight or mistake not authorized, or to\n         prevent a failure of justice resulting,\n         directly or indirectly from delay in court\n         proceedings subsequent to a time when a\n         judgment, order or decree ought to and would\n         have been entered, save that the cause was\n         pending under advisement.\n\nPerkins v.

However,\n\nit is clear that there are limits on the court's authority to\n\nmake retroactive revisions to prior orders.

Seemingly,\n\nwe could choose to disregard the probate court's modification\n\norder here as a misapplication of Massachusetts law.\n\n            Instead, we are more comfortable leaving the state law\n\nissue    undecided   and   resting    instead   on   a   strictly   federal\n\nground.    We do not think that Congress can be taken as intending\n\nto give effect, for purposes of section 1432, to the kind of ex\n\npost modification of a custody decree reflected in this record--\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\feven if we assume that for purposes of Massachusetts law (e.g.,\n\ninheritance, taxation), the probate court's modification decree\n\ncould properly reclassify Fierro's status nunc pro tunc as of\n\nSeptember 1977.         This is so for two different reasons.\n\n              First, both the language of the automatic citizenship\n\nprovision and its apparent underlying rationale suggest that\n\nCongress was concerned with the legal custody status of the\n\nchild at the time that the parent was naturalized and during the\n\nminority of the child.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a)(4)-(5) (1994).\n\nCongress clearly intended that the child's citizenship should\n\nfollow that of the parent who then had legal custody and it is\n\nrather easy to imagine the reasons for this choice:                   presumably\n\nCongress wanted the child to be protected against separation\n\nfrom    the    parent    having    legal     custody    during    the   child's\n\nminority.\n\n              Here, viewing matters at the time that Fierro's father\n\nbecame naturalized (and indeed through the time that Fierro\n\nturned 18), Fierro was under Massachusetts law in the legal\n\ncustody of his mother, and any Massachusetts court asked in 1978\n\nwould   certainly       have   identified      his     mother    as   the   legal\n\ncustodian under the 1973 decree.             It is thus hard to see how it\n\ncould be said that in 1978 there occurred the \"naturalization of\n\nthe parent having legal custody of the child,\" as section 1432\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\frequires.     Similarly, the apparent rationale of the statute\n\nwould hardly be served by conferring citizenship on Fierro for\n\nthe first time at age 35.\n\n            Second, recognizing the nunc pro tunc order in the\n\npresent case would in substance allow the state court to create\n\nloopholes in the immigration laws on grounds of perceived equity\n\nor fairness.    There is no suggestion that the original custody\n\ndecree was entered by mistake, was contrary to law, or otherwise\n\ndid not reflect the true legal relationship between Fierro and\n\nhis parents at any time during his minority.         Congress' rules\n\nfor naturalization must be applied as they are written, and a\n\nstate court has no more power to modify them on equitable\n\ngrounds than does a federal court or agency.

In our case there was a judicial decree granting\n\ncustody to, and only to, Fierro's mother.

There\n\nare too many possible variations to say in the abstract, as the\n\ngovernment urges, that a later state court decree must always be\n\ndisregarded in applying section 1432.          Suppose the original 1973\n\ndecree in Fierro's case had through a clerical error named his\n\nmother as legal custodian when the judge had ruled orally, and\n\nthe parties had understood at the time, that custody had been\n\nawarded to his father.
