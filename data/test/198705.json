Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to review\r\nthe district court's discretionary refusal to depart from the\r\nsentencing guideline range.

Further, the district court's decision is\r\nnot inconsistent with, or undermined by, the ruling in United\r\nStates v. Perez, 160 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 1998), because the\r\ndistrict court determined that, on the facts of this case, it\r\nwould not grant a departure even were it authorized to do so.\r\n          Affirmed.
