Contrary to\n\nappellant Daniel R. Stanton’s (“Stanton’s”) contention, the\n\nrecord clearly shows that the district court did dispose of\n\nhis motions for judgment (docket nos. 55 & 57) by striking\n\nthem for non-compliance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 5.       Stanton has\n\nmade no showing that the court’s decision to award relief\n\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) prejudiced him or that the\n\ndelay adversely affected the proceedings, see     Pioneer Inv.\n\nServs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S.\n\n380, 395 (1993), so we find no abuse of discretion.        See\n\nSea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Ceramica Europa II, Inc., 160 F.3d\n\n849, 852 (1st Cir. 1998) (order of relief under Rule 60(b)\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion).       Stanton’s claim that\n\ndefendants/appellees failed to comply with a discovery order\n\nis unsupported by any explanation as to why the materials in\n\nquestion were important to his case or in what way they\n\ncould have changed the outcome of the litigation, so the\n\nargument is forfeited.
