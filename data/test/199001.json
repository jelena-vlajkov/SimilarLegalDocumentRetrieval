In September of 1997, U.S. Customs\n\nagents intercepted a container holding cocaine bricks with a street\n\nvalue of close to one billion dollars. The cocaine was amidst cartons\n\nof plastic cups. A jury convicted José Ramón Hernández and Douglas\n\nGorbea Del-Valle of various federal offenses associated with a\n\nconspiracy to import, possess, and distribute this cocaine. Gorbea\n\nclaimed to be the owner of the container; Hernández and his company\n\ntransported the container in Puerto Rico.       Hernández was given\n\nconcurrent sentences of 293 months on each of five counts, and Gorbea\n\nwas given concurrent sentences of 292 months on each of four counts.\n\nBoth defendants appeal, alleging numerous errors.        We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          We briefly sketch the facts here, saving the details for the\n\nanalysis of the defendants' claims.\n\n          On September 27, 1997, U.S. Customs officials received\n\ninformation that a particular container, which was expected to arrive\n\nat the Crowley Yard in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contained contraband.\n\nThe container had been shipped by sea from Venezuela.         Customs\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fofficials located the container the next day, placed an electronic hold\n\non it, and moved it to Customs facilities in Cataño for inspection.\n\nThe bill of lading indicated that the container held disposable plastic\n\ncups, that the consignee was a supermarket, and that the consignee's\n\nrepresentative was South Atlantic Trading Company (SATCO). Defendant\n\nGorbea was one of the owners of SATCO and ran its business. He was\n\nlisted as the person to be notified of the container's arrival. On\n\nunloading the container, Customs agents discovered that some of the\n\nboxes of plastic cups contained bricks of cocaine. All in all, the\n\nagents removed 7,514 pounds (a gross weight of approximately 3,415\n\nkilograms) of cocaine from the container. Approximately 141 of the 830\n\nboxes in the container contained cocaine.\n\n          The Customs agents repacked the container, leaving\n\napproximately 24 pounds (10 kilograms) of cocaine in it. The agents\n\ninstalled electronic equipment that allowed them to track the\n\ncontainer's location and to determine whether it had been opened. The\n\ncontainer was returned to the Crowley Yard, where it was placed under\n\n24-hour surveillance.\n\n          On September 29, defendant Gorbea called the Customs office,\n\nidentified himself as the owner of the container, and asked why the\n\ncontainer had been taken to Cataño for inspection. He was told that\n\nthere was no problem with the container and that he could pick it up\n\nlater that day. Around October 1, Gorbea went to the customs broker\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fand arranged for payment of the freight charges associated with the\n\ncontainer. An employee of the customs broker said that Gorbea was in\n\na hurry to receive this shipment. In fact, Gorbea had instructed his\n\nsecretary to call the customs broker several times to \"see what the\n\nstatus [of this shipment] was and to hasten them.\"\n\n          The customs broker completed the necessary paperwork by the\n\nnext day, October 2. That day, two employees of J.R. Transport, a\n\ncompany owned by defendant Hernández, arrived at Crowley Yard to pick\n\nup the container. The driver, Alain Ruiz-Galíndez,1 retrieved the\n\ncontainer and drove it out of Crowley Yard.\n\n          The truck stopped several times during its route, sometimes\n\nremaining stopped for half an hour or more. A trip that the district\n\ncourt judge estimated would normally take about half an hour to make\n\ntook about four hours. At times when some of the other cars on the\n\nroad had their headlights on, the truck drove without its headlights.\n\n          Hernández followed the truck in a gray van from the time it\n\nleft Crowley Yard. During one of the stopovers, Hernández emerged from\n\nthe gray van and got into the truck with Ruiz-Galíndez. Hernández\n\nremained in the truck for the duration of its trip and, at some point,\n\nthe gray van stopped following the truck. Eventually, the truck arrived\n\n\n\n     1    Ruiz-Galíndez was acquitted at trial. Edward Maldonado-Baez,\nthe employee who signed the bill of lading and who directed Ruiz-\nGalíndez to retrieve the container, entered into a plea agreement with\nthe government prior to trial.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fat J.R. Transport's truck yard. One of the officers following the\n\ntruck reported that a number of people in a Crown Victoria arrived at\n\nJ.R. Transport around the same time.     He reported that one of the\n\npassengers in the Crown Victoria appeared to be giving orders and that\n\none of the passengers was holding a \"dark, black long object.\" The\n\nindividuals in the truck yard greeted and congratulated one another\n\nonce the container was moved into the lot.\n\n          After watching the people and cars coming and going into the\n\ntruck yard, the officers moved in. Arrests were made and the container\n\nwas seized.   It had not been opened.\n\n          Gorbea was arrested in December. At the time of his arrest,\n\na document was found in his briefcase. It was a fax dated February 5,\n\n1997, from a Marina Kassert in Venezuela to Gorbea regarding an earlier\n\nshipment of plastic cups. It said, \"I urgently need the information of\n\nyour friend that has the truck to square everything with him.\" On the\n\nback of the fax, Gorbea had written the name José Hernández.\n\n          At the time of the cocaine shipment, Gorbea's company was\n\nprimarily in the business of importing crackers. Another trucker was\n\nused for transporting the shipments of crackers. Although this trucker\n\nhauled some shipments of plastic cups, the evidence suggests that\n\nHernández's trucking company was used only for plastic cup shipments.\n\n                                 II.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           The jury found the defendants guilty of all charges.2 On\n\nappeal, Gorbea challenges the district court's denial of his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, arguing that the government failed \"to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that [he] knew he was importing cocaine,\" an\n\nessential element \"for any of the violations of federal law charged in\n\nthe indictment.\" Gorbea also argues that the prosecutor made improper\n\ncomments during closing arguments that denied him a fair trial.\n\n           Hernández challenges the denial of his motion for judgment\n\nof acquittal, saying that there was insufficient evidence of his\n\nknowledge of the scheme and his voluntary participation in it to\n\nsupport his convictions. Hernández also argues that the district court\n\nerred in allowing testimony as to the street value of the seized\n\ncocaine, that he should not have been held responsible for the entire\n\nquantity of cocaine seized, and that he should have been sentenced to\n\na minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months.\n\n\n\n     2     Hernández was charged with five counts: conspiracy to possess\nwith intent to distribute approximately 3,017 kilograms of cocaine in\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846 (Count One); aiding and\nabetting in the attempt to possess with intent to distribute\napproximately 3,017 kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n§ 846 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count Two); aiding and abetting in the\npossession with intent to distribute approximately 10 kilograms of\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count\nThree); conspiracy to import approximately 3,017 kilograms of cocaine\ninto the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 952(a) and 963\n(Count Four); and aiding and abetting in the importation of cocaine\ninto the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. 952(a) and 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2 (Count Five). Gorbea was charged with Counts One, Two, Four, and\nFive.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          We review each of the defendants' claims in turn.\n\nA. Denial of the Motions for Judgment of Acquittal.\n\n          At trial, Gorbea and Hernández opted not to present any\n\nevidence in their defense and moved, at the close of the government's\n\ncase, for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 29.3 Before the district court, Gorbea argued that \"the\n\nelement of knowledge is not present in the case and the United States\n\nhas failed to prove at any time the element of possession.\"\n\nHernández's primary argument to the district court was that there was\n\ninsufficient proof of \"any agreement between him or any other of the\n\ndefendants to posses[s] with intent to distribute cocaine or to\n\nposses[s] or to attempt to import into the United States the cocaine.\"\n\n          Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, the district court denied the motions. The district court\n\npointed to the \"abundance of evidence presented by the government.\" In\n\nparticular, the district court relied on evidence that (1) the bill of\n\nlading listed a supermarket as the consignee, even though that\n\nsupermarket had never purchased plastic cups from SATCO; (2) there was\n\na change in the trucking company used and in SATCO's standard operating\n\n     3     Because the defendants did not present any evidence in their\ndefense, it was not necessary for them to renew their motions to\npreserve review of the sufficiency of the evidence issue. See United\nStates v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.\nCheung, 836 F.2d 729, 730 n.1 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fprocedures for plastic cup shipments; (3) although SATCO was in\n\nfinancial trouble, it was selling plastic cups at a loss; (4) shipments\n\nof plastic cups often were not delivered to SATCO until a delay of one\n\nor two days after they were picked up at the dock; (5) Ruiz-Galíndez,\n\nthe driver, gave an untrue account of his activities when he was\n\ninterrogated by the police on the day of the surveillance; (6) Ruiz-\n\nGalíndez and Hernández gave the container their \"undivided attention\"\n\nand took four hours to drive the container from Crowley Yard to their\n\ndestination, a distance that normally would not take \"more than half an\n\nhour\" to drive; (7) there were \"concerns about the load,\" as evidenced\n\nby the arrival of the individuals in the Crown Victoria and \"what\n\nappeared to [a law enforcement officer] to be a weapon\"; (8) around the\n\ntime that the shipments of plastic cups began, Gorbea had begun using\n\nthe nickname \"Wallace\" and receiving phone calls, which he would only\n\ntake in private, from someone who identified himself as \"Wallace\"; and\n\n(9) when one of the earlier containers of plastic cups had arrived at\n\nSATCO with half of the boxes missing and with some of the boxes opened\n\nand scattered in the trailer, Gorbea had told his secretary he \"already\n\nknew it\" and that it \"didn't matter.\"     On appeal, both Gorbea and\n\nHernández challenge the district court's denial of their motions for\n\njudgment of acquittal.4\n\n     4     \"[C]hallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and to the\ndenial of the motion for judgment of acquittal raise a single issue\"\nand thus we apply the traditional sufficiency of the evidence standard\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          Defendants challenging convictions for insufficiency of\n\nevidence face an uphill battle on appeal.      We review de novo the\n\ndistrict court's Rule 29 determinations.        See United States v.\n\nHernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998). However, \"[o]ur review of\n\nthe district court's decision to deny a motion for acquittal is quite\n\nlimited; we must affirm unless the evidence, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government, could not have persuaded any trier of fact\n\nof the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v.\n\nParadis, 802 F.2d 553, 559 (1st Cir. 1986); see United States v. Loder,\n\n23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir. 1994) (referring to the \"formidable standard\n\nof review\" applicable to such cases). \"[T]he government need not\n\npresent evidence that precludes every reasonable hypothesis\n\ninconsistent with guilt in order to sustain a conviction.\" Loder, 23\n\nF.3d at 590.   Rather, \"the total evidence, with all reasonable\n\ninferences made in the light most favorable to the government, must be\n\nsuch that a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\" Id. In applying this standard, \"no premium is\n\nplaced upon direct as opposed to circumstantial evidence; both types of\n\nproof can adequately ground a conviction.\" United States v. Ortiz, 966\n\n\nto these claims. United States v. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.\n1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see United\nStates v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 590 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[T]his court\nreviews a district court's denial of a defendant's motion for a\njudgment of acquittal using the identical standard employed to measure\nthe sufficiency of the evidence supporting a guilty verdict.\")\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fF.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992). And in conducting its review, this\n\ncourt cannot weigh the evidence or make credibility judgments; these\n\ntasks are solely within the jury's province. See id. The court must\n\nreject only \"those evidentiary interpretations . . . that are\n\nunreasonable, insupportable, or overly speculative,\" United States v.\n\nSpinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995), and must uphold any verdict\n\nthat is \"supported by a plausible rendition of the record,\" Ortiz, 966\n\nF.2d at 711.\n\n          The defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as\n\nto both their conspiracy and aiding and abetting convictions. To prove\n\nconspiracy, the government must show \"the existence of a conspiracy,\n\nthe defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's\n\nvoluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" United States v. Gomez-\n\nPabon, 911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st Cir. 1990).     To establish that the\n\ndefendants belonged to and participated in the drug conspiracy, the\n\ngovernment must show two kinds of intent: \"intent to agree and intent\n\nto commit the substantive offense.\" Id. at 853 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).     Aiding and abetting requires the\n\ngovernment to show that a defendant \"participated in the venture and\n\nsought by [his] actions to make it succeed.\"        United States v.\n\nGuerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 341 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted). This burden is fulfilled by \"a showing that the\n\ndefendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the\n\n\n                                -11-\n\funderlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal.\" Spinney,\n\n65 F.3d at 235. Knowledge of the particular controlled substance being\n\nimported or distributed is not necessary, see United States v. Kairouz,\n\n751 F.2d 467, 468-69 (1st Cir. 1985); cf. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d at 853,\n\nand intent to distribute can be inferred from the quantity of drugs\n\ninvolved, see United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n1.   Gorbea\n\n          At bottom, Gorbea's argument is, as to both the conspiracy\n\nand the aiding and abetting convictions, that the government failed to\n\nprove intent because it offered insufficient proof that he had\n\nknowledge of the criminal scheme and made a conscious decision to\n\nparticipate in it and further its objectives.\n\n          A reasonable jury could have found Gorbea guilty of the\n\ncrimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.           A great deal of\n\ncircumstantial evidence linked Gorbea to the scheme and indicated his\n\nknowledge of the scheme's contours. Shipments of plastic cups were\n\nhandled differently than were shipments of other items imported by\n\nSATCO. Gorbea's involvement in these shipments was more extensive than\n\nwas his involvement in the shipments of crackers -- SATCO's primary\n\nbusiness line. Unusually, Gorbea insisted on taking calls in private\n\nfrom a person identifying himself as \"Wallace\" around the time SATCO\n\nbegan importing plastic cups. SATCO imported the cups even though it\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\flost money on them. Hernández's employees, rather than the normal\n\ntrucking company used for shipments of crackers, were sometimes used to\n\nretrieve and deliver the plastic cups. At least one shipment of cups\n\nhad arrived at SATCO in a state that suggested that the boxes had been\n\nopened and something removed prior to delivery to SATCO. When Gorbea's\n\nsecretary brought this fact to his attention, Gorbea said that he\n\n\"already knew it\" and that it \"didn't matter.\" Gorbea showed concern\n\nabout the shipment of plastic cups involved in this case: he instructed\n\nhis secretary to call the customs broker to hurry things up, and he\n\nhimself called the customs office to ask why the container had been\n\ntaken off-site on a Sunday for inspection. Quite compelling is the\n\nfact that the consignee listed on the bill of lading had never\n\npurchased plastic cups from SATCO and had no intention of purchasing\n\nany of the cups in the container. Indeed, Gorbea described himself as\n\nthe owner of the container. This evidence, together with the fact that\n\nthe previous shipments of cups had been sold at a loss, readily\n\nsupports the rational conclusion that the shipments of cups were merely\n\na vehicle and a subterfuge for the larger criminal scheme.\n\n          Gorbea, quoting United States v. DeLutis, 722 F.2d 902, 906\n\n(1st Cir. 1983), dismisses this evidence as \"the piling of 'unfounded\n\nand unsupported inferences on top of each other.'\"       His argument\n\nignores the fact that \"[c]hains of inference are a familiar, widely\n\naccepted ingredient\" of any process of reasoning and that they are\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f\"regularly relied upon in the realm of human endeavor, and should not\n\nbe forbidden to a criminal jury.\" Spinney, 65 F.3d at 238. Juries\n\n\"take full advantage of their collective experience and common sense\"\n\nin evaluating the evidence presented to them at trial and reaching a\n\nverdict. Id. at 237 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nThat these inferences are based on circumstantial evidence is of no\n\nimport. Intent can be proven \"wholly on the basis of circumstantial\n\nevidence.\" United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\nsee Spinney, 65 F.3d at 234 (\"Reliance on indirect, as opposed to\n\ndirect, evidence in a criminal case is both permissible and\n\ncommonplace.\"). Given the nature of the crime, \"[k]nowledge and intent\n\nin narcotics cases often must be proved largely by circumstantial\n\nevidence.\" United States v. Valencia, 907 F.2d 671, 678 (7th Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n          There is sufficient evidence in the record to support the\n\nconclusion that Gorbea knew of and actively participated in the scheme\n\nto import and distribute cocaine. A container carrying a large amount\n\nof cocaine was shipped to Puerto Rico, and Gorbea was listed as the\n\nperson to be notified of its arrival.     He was the person with the\n\ncontacts in Venezuela, and he arranged for the retrieval of the\n\ncontainer.   Cf. Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678 (\"Both constructive\n\npossession and guilty knowledge may be inferred from a defendant's\n\ndominion and control over an area where narcotics are found.\"). It\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fstrains credulity to suggest that he would not have known the\n\ncontainer's contents or the plans for distributing them. Gorbea cannot\n\nclaim to be an innocent third party through whose hands contraband\n\ncould easily pass unknown.     He was the intended recipient of the\n\ncontainer, and he exercised control over the container once it landed\n\nin Puerto Rico. That the name of the consignee was fabricated and\n\nGorbea seemed to have little beneficial, economic use for the\n\ncontainer's legitimate contents only fortifies this conclusion. The\n\njury's inferences are rooted in a plausible reading of the record and\n\ntheir conclusions regarding knowledge, intent, and participation flow\n\nlogically from these reasonable inferences.5 Thus, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's denial of Gorbea's motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\n2.   Hernández\n\n          Hernández argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nshould have been granted because the government produced no evidence\n\nthat he \"knew of the existence of the cocaine inside the sealed\n\ncontainer\" or that he \"knowingly participated in or knowingly helped\n\nfacilitate\" the scheme to import and distribute cocaine. Instead, he\n\n\n\n     5    Perhaps in a last ditch effort to convince us of the\ninsufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions, Gorbea casts\naspersions on some of the testimony offered at trial and relied upon by\nthe district court in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.\nThese arguments are to no avail. It is not our role to assess the\ncredibility of trial witnesses or to resolve conflicts in the evidence,\ninstead we must resolve all such issues in favor of the verdict. See\nMorillo, 158 F.3d at 22.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fsays the evidence shows only that he was merely present at the scene of\n\nthe crime.   That is not so.\n\n          Hernández's best argument is that he only participated in the\n\ntransport of the container from Crowley Yard to the J.R. Transport\n\ntruck yard and that he never opened the container, so he did not know\n\nwhat he was transporting. Nonetheless, a reasonable jury could infer\n\nhis knowledge of the contents of the container and his participation in\n\nthe larger scheme. The manner in which the container was transported\n\nin his company's truck was unusual, suspicious, and evasive, both while\n\nhe followed the truck in the van and while he was in the truck.\n\nFurther, Hernández acted as a look-out might, following the truck in\n\nhis van and getting into the truck only after it was some distance from\n\nCrowley Yard. Cf. Paradis, 802 F.2d at 564 (citing evidence that the\n\ndefendant engaged in \"countersurveillance techniques\" to support the\n\nconclusion that she was \"an active participant in the cocaine\n\ndistribution scheme\" and \"much more than an innocent bystander\"). The\n\ntruck stopped a number of times along its route, taking hours to travel\n\na distance that the district judge estimated should take no more than\n\nhalf an hour. The truck engaged in evasive measures such as u-turns\n\nand driving without headlights.6\n\n          When the container eventually arrived at the truck yard,\n\n     6    As with much of the evidence in this case, the record\nprovides other possible explanations for these facts. We must view the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the government, however.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fother individuals arrived, greetings and congratulations were\n\nexchanged, and what may have been a firearm was spotted.        Ruiz-\n\nGalíndez, Hernández's employee and the driver of the truck, took part\n\nin the revelry over the seemingly successful delivery of the cocaine.\n\nA celebration of the arrival of plastic cups is hardly plausible. When\n\nhe was later interrogated by the police, Ruiz-Galíndez was misleading\n\nin his account of his activities that day.     Cf. United States v.\n\nBarbosa, 906 F.2d 1366, 1368 (9th Cir. 1990) (noting that jury could\n\ninfer guilty knowledge of contents of luggage, in part, from\n\ndiscrepancies in stories defendant told to different federal agents).\n\nThis inordinate level of attention to the container makes probable\n\nHernández's knowledge of its contents and their value.        This is\n\nsomething more than mere innocent presence at the scene of the crime.\n\nCf. Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 713 (1943) (\"The\n\nstep from knowledge to intent and agreement may be taken. There is\n\nmore than suspicion, more than knowledge, acquiescence, carelessness,\n\nindifference, lack of concern.\"). This conclusion is bolstered by the\n\nfact that the container was taken to the J.R. Transport lot, rather\n\nthan directly to SATCO. Gorbea was willing to entrust this valuable\n\nand illicit cargo to Hernández for more than the time necessary to\n\ndrive it from Crowley Yard to SATCO.\n\n          Earlier events also support the jury's verdict.       It is\n\nreasonable to conclude there had been at least one prior cocaine\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fshipment using the same plastic cup ruse, and Hernández's employees had\n\ndelivered at least one of the prior shipments of plastic cups.\n\nHernández's trucking company was not generally used by SATCO; it was\n\nused only for certain plastic cup shipments. Of great weight is the\n\nfact that Gorbea wrote Hernández's name on the back of the fax from\n\nMarina Kassert in Venezuela requesting the name of the trucker with\n\nwhom to make arrangements for a shipment of plastic cups.\n\n          Given all these facts, Hernández's knowing participation in\n\nthe scheme and his knowledge of the container's contents is a\n\nreasonable conclusion. Cf. Morillo, 158 F.3d at 24 (\"[J]uries may\n\ninfer a defendant's culpable involvement from the fact that other\n\nconspirators continued their criminal activity despite the defendant's\n\narrival in a den of iniquity.\"); United States v. Cordoba, 104 F.3d\n\n225, 229 (9th Cir. 1997). The government's evidence need not exclude\n\n\"every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\" but need only be sufficient\n\nto allow a reasonable factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Guerrero, 114 F.3d at 343 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted); see Loder, 23 F.3d at 590.       The resolution of\n\n\"conflicting factual statements\" and \"any concomitant credibility\n\ncalls\" are left to the jury; we affirm where \"the jury's decipherment\n\nof the record represented a plausible choice among reasonable\n\nalternatives, all things considered.\" Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 713. We\n\naffirm the district court's denial of Hernández's motion for judgment\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fof acquittal.\n\nB.   Statements Made During Closing Arguments\n\n          Gorbea argues that certain statements made by the prosecutor\n\nduring closing arguments denied him a fair trial. First, he argues\n\nthat statements made about the fax from Marina Kassert to Gorbea\n\n\"misrepresented the record and mislead [sic] the jury.\" In particular,\n\nGorbea points to the following statement from the prosecutor:\n\n          Now, ladies and gentlemen, why does a shipper in Venezuela\n          need the name of the trucker in Puerto Rico, to square what?\n\nHe argues that this statement and others like it improperly relied on\n\nthe fax to prove a criminal association between Kassert, Gorbea, and\n\nHernández. This reliance was improper, Gorbea asserts, because the fax\n\nconcerned an earlier shipment that was not alleged to be a part of the\n\nconspiracy and because Consorcio EFB, not Kassert, was listed on the\n\nbill of lading as the shipper of the seized container.\n\n          Second, Gorbea points to the following statement by the\n\nprosecutor:\n\n          [A]ll of a sudden Mr. Douglas and others because the others\n          to the Grand Jury well known came up with a plan; you have\n          the people in Venezuela who we don't know but we know that\n          they exist because this shipment containing one billion\n          dollars worth of drugs came from Venezuela and you must\n          consider that if that shipment is going to take place the\n          people involved, that shipped, want to know first, want to\n          assure themselves that they can use safe means and deceitful\n          means to get that shipment to Puerto Rico and they want to\n          know that the people that they entrust this shipment to are\n          with them otherwise it wouldn't make any sense.\n                  And, of course, we are not charging that these\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f           defendants were the buyers of that cocaine, no, they were\n           instruments, they were conspirators and at some point in\n           time they got on that little train of bringing the cocaine\n           from Colombia to Puerto Rico for later distribution.\n                  That shipment must have come for [sic] a lot of\n           people because you will remember from the evidence that is\n           before you that the bricks were marked in different ways .\n           . . so that is to identify the shipments and don't be\n           surprised that many people in Colombia pulled their\n           resources together to make this shipment, some contributed\n           maybe 100 kilos, other [sic] 300 kilos, and they made a\n           pool.\n\nGorbea says that this statement, and in particular the language \"others\n\nto the Grand Jury well known,\" \"went far beyond any evidence or\n\nsupportable inferences at trial, allowed the prosecutor to become an\n\nunsworn witness, and explicitly lead [sic] the jury to believe that\n\ninformation not presented at trial, which the Grand Jury had already\n\nauthoritatively decided, supported the prosecutor's conclusion that the\n\ntelefax related to the seized shipment of cocaine.\"\n\n           Gorbea lodged a contemporaneous objection to the first\n\nstatement,7 and so we review de novo the question of whether the comment\n\nwas improper and review for abuse of discretion the question whether\n\nthe misconduct, if any, warrants a new trial. See United States v.\n\nLewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1337-38 (1st Cir. 1994). Prosecutors are free to\n\nask the jury to make reasonable inferences from the evidence submitted\n\n\n\n     7    The specificity of this objection is a bit lacking. Cf.\nUnited States v. Auch, 187 F.3d 125, 128-29 (1st Cir. 1999). The\ngovernment, however, does not argue this point and so, for the purposes\nof appeal, we consider Gorbea to have properly objected to this\ncomment.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fat trial. This statement was not improper and \"simply called on the\n\njury to employ its collective common sense in evaluating the evidence\n\nand to draw reasonable inferences therefrom.\" United States v. Abreu,\n\n952 F.2d 1458, 1471 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). Gorbea argues that the prosecutor misled the jury\n\nwith this comment by suggesting that the document had to do with the\n\nseized shipment of cocaine. The government specifically said that the\n\ndocument was dated February 1997 and that the result of this fax was\n\nthe first shipment of plastic cups, which arrived in March.        The\n\ngovernment certainly asked the jury, in this comment and others, to\n\ninfer that the defendants reached an agreement regarding the scheme\n\nprior to the shipping of the seized cocaine and may have even imported\n\nsome cocaine prior to the seizure, but there is nothing improper in\n\nsuggesting that the jury draw such an inference. It goes directly to\n\nthe necessary elements of the crimes charged and is based on the\n\nevidence admitted at trial.\n\n          Gorbea also argues that reliance on the fax was improper\n\nbecause it involved a shipment outside the scope of the charged\n\nconspiracy and because it was from Kassert, whereas the seized shipment\n\nwas shipped by Consorcio EFB. Gorbea has not challenged the admission\n\nof the fax, however, and the government was free to rely on admitted\n\nevidence to explain \"the background, formation, and development of the\n\nillegal relationship\" and \"to help the jury understand the basis for\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fthe co-conspirators' relationship of mutual trust.\" United States v.\n\nEscobar-De Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 169 (1st Cir. 1999) (upholding the\n\nadmission of evidence of bad acts outside the scope of the conspiracy\n\nfor this purpose).\n\n          As for the claim that Kassert was not the shipper of the\n\nseized container, the government's comment was not misleading.\n\nFurther, while the parties have not pointed us to any evidence in the\n\nrecord that directly links Kassert with Consorcio EFB, there is\n\ntestimony that Kassert was the source for the plastic cup shipments and\n\nevidence that at least three of the previous plastic cup shipments\n\n(although not the March shipment) came from Consorcio EFB. There is\n\ncertainly evidence from which the jury could infer that Kassert was\n\nlinked in some way to the shipments from Consorcio EFB.8 And it was not\n\nimproper for the government to ask the jury to make such an inference.\n\n          As to the second statement, Gorbea's protest is really\n\ntargeted at two different statements contained in the paragraphs quoted\n\nabove. His first complaint is with the reference to \"others to the\n\nGrand Jury well known.\" His second complaint is about the suggestion\n\nthat drug suppliers pooled their resources to create the seized\n\nshipment. We evaluate these comments separately, as Gorbea objected to\n\n\n\n\n     8    It was suggested in oral argument that Kassert might have\nbeen a broker of sorts for the Venezuelan shipper.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fthe       second   statement,     but    not     to    the     first. 9\n\n            Where a defendant fails to object in a specific and timely\n\nmanner to allegedly improper prosecutorial statements, our review is\n\nonly for plain error. See Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1338-39; Arrieta-Agressot\n\nv. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 528 (1st Cir. 1993). Thus, we review the\n\ncomment regarding \"others to the Grand Jury well known\" under the plain\n\nerror standard. Under this standard, reversal is appropriate only if\n\nthe improper argument \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome\n\nwas likely affected.\"    Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n            Gorbea says that this statement was \"part of a carefully\n\ncrafted and impermissible trial strategy aimed at misleading the jury\n\ninto impermissibly inferring the government possessed additional\n\nevidence supporting their theory that Marina Kassert was involved in a\n\nconspiracy because 'others to the Grand Jury well known' had made a\n\npool to arrange for the drug shipment.\" Much more plausible is the\n\ngovernment's explanation that the reference was \"either an involuntary\n\nlapsus, by the prosecutor or an error by the court reporter who took\n\nthe phrase . . . in lieu of 'others to the Grand Jury unknown' as is\n\n\n\n      9    Gorbea suggests that the objection he made at the very end\nof the paragraphs quoted above should be sufficient to avoid plain\nerror review of the \"others to the Grand Jury well known\" comment.\nThis was only a general objection, however, and it was far enough\nremoved from the \"others to the Grand Jury well known\" comment so as\nnot to put the district court on notice. See Auch, 187 F.3d at 128-29.\n\n                                 -23-\n\fcharged in the indictment\" (emphasis added). After all, the reference\n\nwas directly followed by the statement, \"you have the people in\n\nVenezuela who we don't know but we know that they exist because this\n\nshipment containing one billion dollars worth of drugs came from\n\nVenezuela.\" This isolated and most likely non-deliberate statement\n\ncould not have caused a miscarriage of justice. See United States v.\n\nSantana-Camacho, 833 F.2d 371, 373 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"The plain-error\n\nexception to the contemporaneous objection rule is to be used\n\nsparingly, solely in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of\n\njustice would otherwise result.\") (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted); United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67 F.3d 1002, 1008-09\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          As to the portion of the statement that suggests that drug\n\nsuppliers pooled their resources to create the cocaine shipment, we\n\nreview de novo the question whether the comment was improper and review\n\nfor abuse of discretion the question whether a new trial is warranted.\n\nSee Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1337-38. This statement was not improper. There\n\nwas evidence at trial that the bricks of cocaine found in the container\n\nwere marked and packaged in different ways. Some of the bricks had\n\nWalt Disney characters pasted on the outside, some were wrapped in\n\nplastic, some in styrofoam, and some contained a reddish gel.        A\n\nCustoms agent testified that in his experience these different methods\n\nof packaging were used to identify the supplier and, in some cases, to\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fidentify the proper recipient. Contrary to Gorbea's suggestion, the\n\nprosecutor's statement was not outside of the scope of the evidence\n\npresented at trial and did not allow the prosecutor to become an\n\nunsworn witness.     It was entirely proper.\n\nC.   Admission of Testimony Regarding Street Value of Cocaine\n\n          Hernández argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the\n\ntrial court to admit the testimony of Drug Enforcement Agency Special\n\nAgent James Casey.    Casey testified that the street value of the\n\ncocaine seized from the container was close to a billion dollars in\n\nPuerto Rico at the time. Hernández objected to this testimony at\n\ntrial, claiming that it was irrelevant and that its probative value was\n\noutweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.   The district court overruled these objections and\n\nallowed the testimony, finding that the street value of the cocaine was\n\nrelevant to the knowledge of the defendants and that any prejudicial\n\neffect was outweighed by the evidence's probative value. The district\n\ncourt said, \"it certainly would be proper for the jury to infer that\n\nsuch a shipment of such a worth certainly would not be left to be\n\nhandled by persons who did not know what was in there.\"\n\n          On appeal, Hernández argues that the trial court should have\n\nexcluded this evidence because of its risk of unfair prejudice. He\n\nsays that the jury already had ample evidence from which to draw\n\ninferences regarding knowledge and intent to distribute, in the form of\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fphotographs of the load and testimony regarding the amount of cocaine\n\nfound in the container.\n\n          The district court's Rule 403 balancing stands unless it is\n\nan abuse of discretion. See United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d\n\n552, 561 (1st Cir. 1999). The street value of cocaine is relevant to\n\nthe issues of knowledge, cf. Cordoba, 104 F.3d at 229, and intent to\n\ndistribute, see United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 107 F.3d 960, 969\n\n(1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Rivera, 68 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nIt is true that \"such evidence could conceivably become substantially\n\nmore prejudicial than probative if the figure is large enough and if\n\nother evidence to prove intent to distribute is available.\" Rosario-\n\nPeralta, 199 F.3d at 565. But in this case, both defendants professed\n\nignorance of the contents of the container. They were both, they said,\n\nsimply legitimate businessmen. The evidence of street value of the\n\ncontraband in the shipment was meant to counter that contention. There\n\nis no basis to second-guess the trial court's view.\n\nD.   Hernández's Sentence\n\n          Hernández argues that it was error to hold him responsible\n\nfor the 3,017 kilograms of cocaine alleged in the charges. Given\n\nHernández's criminal history category, this quantity resulted in a\n\nsentencing range of 235 to 293 months under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1. The district court sentenced him to concurrent\n\n293-month terms. Hernández argues that this sentence was excessive and\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fthat a minimum sentence of 120 months should have been given.\n\n          In drug cases, sentences are largely driven by the quantity\n\nof the drugs involved. See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\n\n1196 (1st Cir. 1993). \"[I]n the context of jointly undertaken criminal\n\nactivity, such as a conspiracy, a defendant is not automatically\n\nsaddled with the full weight of the conspiracy's wrongdoing; rather, a\n\ndefendant is responsible for drugs he personally handled or anticipated\n\nhandling, and, under the relevant conduct rubric, for drugs involved in\n\nadditional acts that were reasonably foreseeable by him and were\n\ncommitted in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"        Id. at 1197.\n\n          Hernández argues that the 3,017 kilograms of cocaine should\n\nnot be attributed to him because there was no evidence that he had any\n\nknowledge of the amount of drugs in the container. He says that most\n\nof the district court's findings to the contrary were not supported by\n\nthe evidence introduced at trial.10 We review a sentencing court's\n\nfindings regarding the quantity of drugs involved, the role played by\n\nthe defendant, and the quantity reasonably foreseeable to the defendant\n\nfor clear error. See United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1314\n\n(1st Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 74\n\n\n\n     10   Hernández asserts that the district court acknowledged that\nthere was no evidence that he knew the quantity of drugs involved.\nThis statement is a bit misleading. The district court stated that\nwhile there was no \"direct evidence\" of knowledge, the evidence\nsuggested that Hernández \"must have known that there was a large\nquantity of drugs coming in.\"\n\n                                 -27-\n\f(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          The issue here is straightforward: is the district court's\n\nfinding that Hernández knew or could have reasonably foreseen the\n\nquantity of drugs contained in the seized container, which he was\n\ndirectly involved in transporting, clearly erroneous?         It was not.\n\n          All of the evidence and inferences discussed in connection\n\nwith Hernández's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence apply\n\nwith equal force here. The district court's conclusions were properly\n\nrooted in the evidence and its inferences founded in logical reasoning.\n\n\"A defendant who conspires to transport for distribution a large\n\nquantity of drugs, but happens not to know the precise amount, pretty\n\nmuch takes his chances that the amount actually involved will be quite\n\nlarge.\"   De La Cruz, 996 F.2d at 1314.\n\n          Even if the district court's attribution of all 3,017\n\nkilograms to Hernández could be faulted, we note that any error would\n\nbe harmless. See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1199-1200. The base offense\n\nlevel assigned to Hernández applies to crimes involving 150 kilograms\n\nor more of cocaine.   See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1.    Thus, as long as some\n\namount equal to or exceeding 150 kilograms can be attributed to\n\nHernández, the same sentencing range applies.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          After carefully considering each of the defendants'\n\nchallenges, we affirm their convictions and Hernández's sentence.\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f",

In September of 1997, U.S. Customs\n\nagents intercepted a container holding cocaine bricks with a street\n\nvalue of close to one billion dollars. The cocaine was amidst cartons\n\nof plastic cups. A jury convicted José Ramón Hernández and Douglas\n\nGorbea Del-Valle of various federal offenses associated with a\n\nconspiracy to import, possess, and distribute this cocaine. Gorbea\n\nclaimed to be the owner of the container; Hernández and his company\n\ntransported the container in Puerto Rico.       Hernández was given\n\nconcurrent sentences of 293 months on each of five counts, and Gorbea\n\nwas given concurrent sentences of 292 months on each of four counts.\n\nBoth defendants appeal, alleging numerous errors.        We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          We briefly sketch the facts here, saving the details for the\n\nanalysis of the defendants' claims.\n\n          On September 27, 1997, U.S. Customs officials received\n\ninformation that a particular container, which was expected to arrive\n\nat the Crowley Yard in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contained contraband.\n\nThe container had been shipped by sea from Venezuela.         Customs\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fofficials located the container the next day, placed an electronic hold\n\non it, and moved it to Customs facilities in Cataño for inspection.\n\nThe bill of lading indicated that the container held disposable plastic\n\ncups, that the consignee was a supermarket, and that the consignee's\n\nrepresentative was South Atlantic Trading Company (SATCO). Defendant\n\nGorbea was one of the owners of SATCO and ran its business. He was\n\nlisted as the person to be notified of the container's arrival. On\n\nunloading the container, Customs agents discovered that some of the\n\nboxes of plastic cups contained bricks of cocaine. All in all, the\n\nagents removed 7,514 pounds (a gross weight of approximately 3,415\n\nkilograms) of cocaine from the container. Approximately 141 of the 830\n\nboxes in the container contained cocaine.\n\n          The Customs agents repacked the container, leaving\n\napproximately 24 pounds (10 kilograms) of cocaine in it. The agents\n\ninstalled electronic equipment that allowed them to track the\n\ncontainer's location and to determine whether it had been opened. The\n\ncontainer was returned to the Crowley Yard, where it was placed under\n\n24-hour surveillance.\n\n          On September 29, defendant Gorbea called the Customs office,\n\nidentified himself as the owner of the container, and asked why the\n\ncontainer had been taken to Cataño for inspection. He was told that\n\nthere was no problem with the container and that he could pick it up\n\nlater that day. Around October 1, Gorbea went to the customs broker\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fand arranged for payment of the freight charges associated with the\n\ncontainer. An employee of the customs broker said that Gorbea was in\n\na hurry to receive this shipment. In fact, Gorbea had instructed his\n\nsecretary to call the customs broker several times to \"see what the\n\nstatus [of this shipment] was and to hasten them.\"\n\n          The customs broker completed the necessary paperwork by the\n\nnext day, October 2. That day, two employees of J.R. Transport, a\n\ncompany owned by defendant Hernández, arrived at Crowley Yard to pick\n\nup the container. The driver, Alain Ruiz-Galíndez,1 retrieved the\n\ncontainer and drove it out of Crowley Yard.\n\n          The truck stopped several times during its route, sometimes\n\nremaining stopped for half an hour or more. A trip that the district\n\ncourt judge estimated would normally take about half an hour to make\n\ntook about four hours. At times when some of the other cars on the\n\nroad had their headlights on, the truck drove without its headlights.\n\n          Hernández followed the truck in a gray van from the time it\n\nleft Crowley Yard. During one of the stopovers, Hernández emerged from\n\nthe gray van and got into the truck with Ruiz-Galíndez. Hernández\n\nremained in the truck for the duration of its trip and, at some point,\n\nthe gray van stopped following the truck. Eventually, the truck arrived\n\n\n\n     1    Ruiz-Galíndez was acquitted at trial. Edward Maldonado-Baez,\nthe employee who signed the bill of lading and who directed Ruiz-\nGalíndez to retrieve the container, entered into a plea agreement with\nthe government prior to trial.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fat J.R. Transport's truck yard. One of the officers following the\n\ntruck reported that a number of people in a Crown Victoria arrived at\n\nJ.R. Transport around the same time.     He reported that one of the\n\npassengers in the Crown Victoria appeared to be giving orders and that\n\none of the passengers was holding a \"dark, black long object.\" The\n\nindividuals in the truck yard greeted and congratulated one another\n\nonce the container was moved into the lot.\n\n          After watching the people and cars coming and going into the\n\ntruck yard, the officers moved in. Arrests were made and the container\n\nwas seized.   It had not been opened.\n\n          Gorbea was arrested in December. At the time of his arrest,\n\na document was found in his briefcase. It was a fax dated February 5,\n\n1997, from a Marina Kassert in Venezuela to Gorbea regarding an earlier\n\nshipment of plastic cups. It said, \"I urgently need the information of\n\nyour friend that has the truck to square everything with him.\" On the\n\nback of the fax, Gorbea had written the name José Hernández.\n\n          At the time of the cocaine shipment, Gorbea's company was\n\nprimarily in the business of importing crackers. Another trucker was\n\nused for transporting the shipments of crackers. Although this trucker\n\nhauled some shipments of plastic cups, the evidence suggests that\n\nHernández's trucking company was used only for plastic cup shipments.\n\n                                 II.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           The jury found the defendants guilty of all charges.2 On\n\nappeal, Gorbea challenges the district court's denial of his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, arguing that the government failed \"to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that [he] knew he was importing cocaine,\" an\n\nessential element \"for any of the violations of federal law charged in\n\nthe indictment.\" Gorbea also argues that the prosecutor made improper\n\ncomments during closing arguments that denied him a fair trial.\n\n           Hernández challenges the denial of his motion for judgment\n\nof acquittal, saying that there was insufficient evidence of his\n\nknowledge of the scheme and his voluntary participation in it to\n\nsupport his convictions. Hernández also argues that the district court\n\nerred in allowing testimony as to the street value of the seized\n\ncocaine, that he should not have been held responsible for the entire\n\nquantity of cocaine seized, and that he should have been sentenced to\n\na minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months.\n\n\n\n     2     Hernández was charged with five counts: conspiracy to possess\nwith intent to distribute approximately 3,017 kilograms of cocaine in\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846 (Count One); aiding and\nabetting in the attempt to possess with intent to distribute\napproximately 3,017 kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n§ 846 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count Two); aiding and abetting in the\npossession with intent to distribute approximately 10 kilograms of\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count\nThree); conspiracy to import approximately 3,017 kilograms of cocaine\ninto the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 952(a) and 963\n(Count Four); and aiding and abetting in the importation of cocaine\ninto the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. 952(a) and 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2 (Count Five). Gorbea was charged with Counts One, Two, Four, and\nFive.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          We review each of the defendants' claims in turn.\n\nA. Denial of the Motions for Judgment of Acquittal.\n\n          At trial, Gorbea and Hernández opted not to present any\n\nevidence in their defense and moved, at the close of the government's\n\ncase, for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 29.3 Before the district court, Gorbea argued that \"the\n\nelement of knowledge is not present in the case and the United States\n\nhas failed to prove at any time the element of possession.\"\n\nHernández's primary argument to the district court was that there was\n\ninsufficient proof of \"any agreement between him or any other of the\n\ndefendants to posses[s] with intent to distribute cocaine or to\n\nposses[s] or to attempt to import into the United States the cocaine.\"\n\n          Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, the district court denied the motions. The district court\n\npointed to the \"abundance of evidence presented by the government.\" In\n\nparticular, the district court relied on evidence that (1) the bill of\n\nlading listed a supermarket as the consignee, even though that\n\nsupermarket had never purchased plastic cups from SATCO; (2) there was\n\na change in the trucking company used and in SATCO's standard operating\n\n     3     Because the defendants did not present any evidence in their\ndefense, it was not necessary for them to renew their motions to\npreserve review of the sufficiency of the evidence issue.

Gorbea\n\n          At bottom, Gorbea's argument is, as to both the conspiracy\n\nand the aiding and abetting convictions, that the government failed to\n\nprove intent because it offered insufficient proof that he had\n\nknowledge of the criminal scheme and made a conscious decision to\n\nparticipate in it and further its objectives.\n\n          A reasonable jury could have found Gorbea guilty of the\n\ncrimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.           A great deal of\n\ncircumstantial evidence linked Gorbea to the scheme and indicated his\n\nknowledge of the scheme's contours. Shipments of plastic cups were\n\nhandled differently than were shipments of other items imported by\n\nSATCO. Gorbea's involvement in these shipments was more extensive than\n\nwas his involvement in the shipments of crackers -- SATCO's primary\n\nbusiness line. Unusually, Gorbea insisted on taking calls in private\n\nfrom a person identifying himself as \"Wallace\" around the time SATCO\n\nbegan importing plastic cups. SATCO imported the cups even though it\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\flost money on them. Hernández's employees, rather than the normal\n\ntrucking company used for shipments of crackers, were sometimes used to\n\nretrieve and deliver the plastic cups. At least one shipment of cups\n\nhad arrived at SATCO in a state that suggested that the boxes had been\n\nopened and something removed prior to delivery to SATCO. When Gorbea's\n\nsecretary brought this fact to his attention, Gorbea said that he\n\n\"already knew it\" and that it \"didn't matter.\" Gorbea showed concern\n\nabout the shipment of plastic cups involved in this case: he instructed\n\nhis secretary to call the customs broker to hurry things up, and he\n\nhimself called the customs office to ask why the container had been\n\ntaken off-site on a Sunday for inspection. Quite compelling is the\n\nfact that the consignee listed on the bill of lading had never\n\npurchased plastic cups from SATCO and had no intention of purchasing\n\nany of the cups in the container. Indeed, Gorbea described himself as\n\nthe owner of the container. This evidence, together with the fact that\n\nthe previous shipments of cups had been sold at a loss, readily\n\nsupports the rational conclusion that the shipments of cups were merely\n\na vehicle and a subterfuge for the larger criminal scheme.\n\n          Gorbea, quoting United States v.

A container carrying a large amount\n\nof cocaine was shipped to Puerto Rico, and Gorbea was listed as the\n\nperson to be notified of its arrival.     He was the person with the\n\ncontacts in Venezuela, and he arranged for the retrieval of the\n\ncontainer.

Gorbea cannot\n\nclaim to be an innocent third party through whose hands contraband\n\ncould easily pass unknown.     He was the intended recipient of the\n\ncontainer, and he exercised control over the container once it landed\n\nin Puerto Rico. That the name of the consignee was fabricated and\n\nGorbea seemed to have little beneficial, economic use for the\n\ncontainer's legitimate contents only fortifies this conclusion. The\n\njury's inferences are rooted in a plausible reading of the record and\n\ntheir conclusions regarding knowledge, intent, and participation flow\n\nlogically from these reasonable inferences.5 Thus, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's denial of Gorbea's motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\n2.   Hernández\n\n          Hernández argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nshould have been granted because the government produced no evidence\n\nthat he \"knew of the existence of the cocaine inside the sealed\n\ncontainer\" or that he \"knowingly participated in or knowingly helped\n\nfacilitate\" the scheme to import and distribute cocaine.

It is not our role to assess the\ncredibility of trial witnesses or to resolve conflicts in the evidence,\ninstead we must resolve all such issues in favor of the verdict.

Statements Made During Closing Arguments\n\n          Gorbea argues that certain statements made by the prosecutor\n\nduring closing arguments denied him a fair trial. First, he argues\n\nthat statements made about the fax from Marina Kassert to Gorbea\n\n\"misrepresented the record and mislead [sic] the jury.\" In particular,\n\nGorbea points to the following statement from the prosecutor:\n\n          Now, ladies and gentlemen, why does a shipper in Venezuela\n          need the name of the trucker in Puerto Rico, to square what?\n\nHe argues that this statement and others like it improperly relied on\n\nthe fax to prove a criminal association between Kassert, Gorbea, and\n\nHernández. This reliance was improper, Gorbea asserts, because the fax\n\nconcerned an earlier shipment that was not alleged to be a part of the\n\nconspiracy and because Consorcio EFB, not Kassert, was listed on the\n\nbill of lading as the shipper of the seized container.\n\n          Second, Gorbea points to the following statement by the\n\nprosecutor:\n\n          [A]ll of a sudden Mr. Douglas and others because the others\n          to the Grand Jury well known came up with a plan; you have\n          the people in Venezuela who we don't know but we know that\n          they exist because this shipment containing one billion\n          dollars worth of drugs came from Venezuela and you must\n          consider that if that shipment is going to take place the\n          people involved, that shipped, want to know first, want to\n          assure themselves that they can use safe means and deceitful\n          means to get that shipment to Puerto Rico and they want to\n          know that the people that they entrust this shipment to are\n          with them otherwise it wouldn't make any sense.\n                  And, of course, we are not charging that these\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f           defendants were the buyers of that cocaine, no, they were\n           instruments, they were conspirators and at some point in\n           time they got on that little train of bringing the cocaine\n           from Colombia to Puerto Rico for later distribution.\n                  That shipment must have come for [sic] a lot of\n           people because you will remember from the evidence that is\n           before you that the bricks were marked in different ways .\n           . . so that is to identify the shipments and don't be\n           surprised that many people in Colombia pulled their\n           resources together to make this shipment, some contributed\n           maybe 100 kilos, other [sic] 300 kilos, and they made a\n           pool.\n\nGorbea says that this statement, and in particular the language \"others\n\nto the Grand Jury well known,\" \"went far beyond any evidence or\n\nsupportable inferences at trial, allowed the prosecutor to become an\n\nunsworn witness, and explicitly lead [sic] the jury to believe that\n\ninformation not presented at trial, which the Grand Jury had already\n\nauthoritatively decided, supported the prosecutor's conclusion that the\n\ntelefax related to the seized shipment of cocaine.\"\n\n           Gorbea lodged a contemporaneous objection to the first\n\nstatement,7 and so we review de novo the question of whether the comment\n\nwas improper and review for abuse of discretion the question whether\n\nthe misconduct, if any, warrants a new trial. See United States v.\n\nLewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195723\"><a href=\"/opinion/195723/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1337-38 (1st Cir. 1994). Prosecutors are free to\n\nask the jury to make reasonable inferences from the evidence submitted\n\n\n\n     7    The specificity of this objection is a bit lacking. Cf.\nUnited States v. Auch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765610\"><a href=\"/opinion/765610/united-states-v-enrique-auch-aka-rickie-auch/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128-29 (1st Cir. 1999). The\ngovernment, however, does not argue this point and so, for the purposes\nof appeal, we consider Gorbea to have properly objected to this\ncomment.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fat trial. This statement was not improper and \"simply called on the\n\njury to employ its collective common sense in evaluating the evidence\n\nand to draw reasonable inferences therefrom.\" United States v. Abreu,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575196\"><a href=\"/opinion/575196/united-states-v-ramon-alfredo-abreu-aka-carlos-juan/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1471 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). Gorbea argues that the prosecutor misled the jury\n\nwith this comment by suggesting that the document had to do with the\n\nseized shipment of cocaine. The government specifically said that the\n\ndocument was dated February 1997 and that the result of this fax was\n\nthe first shipment of plastic cups, which arrived in March.        The\n\ngovernment certainly asked the jury, in this comment and others, to\n\ninfer that the defendants reached an agreement regarding the scheme\n\nprior to the shipping of the seized cocaine and may have even imported\n\nsome cocaine prior to the seizure, but there is nothing improper in\n\nsuggesting that the jury draw such an inference. It goes directly to\n\nthe necessary elements of the crimes charged and is based on the\n\nevidence admitted at trial.\n\n          Gorbea also argues that reliance on the fax was improper\n\nbecause it involved a shipment outside the scope of the charged\n\nconspiracy and because it was from Kassert, whereas the seized shipment\n\nwas shipped by Consorcio EFB. Gorbea has not challenged the admission\n\nof the fax, however, and the government was free to rely on admitted\n\nevidence to explain \"the background, formation, and development of the\n\nillegal relationship\" and \"to help the jury understand the basis for\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fthe co-conspirators' relationship of mutual trust.\" United States v.\n\nEscobar-De Jesus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765611\"><a href=\"/opinion/765611/united-states-v-eusebio-escobar-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 169 (1st Cir. 1999) (upholding the\n\nadmission of evidence of bad acts outside the scope of the conspiracy\n\nfor this purpose).\n\n          As for the claim that Kassert was not the shipper of the\n\nseized container, the government's comment was not misleading.\n\nFurther, while the parties have not pointed us to any evidence in the\n\nrecord that directly links Kassert with Consorcio EFB, there is\n\ntestimony that Kassert was the source for the plastic cup shipments and\n\nevidence that at least three of the previous plastic cup shipments\n\n(although not the March shipment) came from Consorcio EFB. There is\n\ncertainly evidence from which the jury could infer that Kassert was\n\nlinked in some way to the shipments from Consorcio EFB.8 And it was not\n\nimproper for the government to ask the jury to make such an inference.\n\n          As to the second statement, Gorbea's protest is really\n\ntargeted at two different statements contained in the paragraphs quoted\n\nabove. His first complaint is with the reference to \"others to the\n\nGrand Jury well known.\" His second complaint is about the suggestion\n\nthat drug suppliers pooled their resources to create the seized\n\nshipment. We evaluate these comments separately, as Gorbea objected to\n\n\n\n\n     8    It was suggested in oral argument that Kassert might have\nbeen a broker of sorts for the Venezuelan shipper.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fthe       second   statement,     but    not     to    the     first. 9\n\n            Where a defendant fails to object in a specific and timely\n\nmanner to allegedly improper prosecutorial statements, our review is\n\nonly for plain error.

This statement was not improper. There\n\nwas evidence at trial that the bricks of cocaine found in the container\n\nwere marked and packaged in different ways. Some of the bricks had\n\nWalt Disney characters pasted on the outside, some were wrapped in\n\nplastic, some in styrofoam, and some contained a reddish gel.        A\n\nCustoms agent testified that in his experience these different methods\n\nof packaging were used to identify the supplier and, in some cases, to\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fidentify the proper recipient. Contrary to Gorbea's suggestion, the\n\nprosecutor's statement was not outside of the scope of the evidence\n\npresented at trial and did not allow the prosecutor to become an\n\nunsworn witness.     It was entirely proper.\n\nC.   Admission of Testimony Regarding Street Value of Cocaine\n\n          Hernández argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the\n\ntrial court to admit the testimony of Drug Enforcement Agency Special\n\nAgent James Casey.    Casey testified that the street value of the\n\ncocaine seized from the container was close to a billion dollars in\n\nPuerto Rico at the time. Hernández objected to this testimony at\n\ntrial, claiming that it was irrelevant and that its probative value was\n\noutweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.   The district court overruled these objections and\n\nallowed the testimony, finding that the street value of the cocaine was\n\nrelevant to the knowledge of the defendants and that any prejudicial\n\neffect was outweighed by the evidence's probative value. The district\n\ncourt said, \"it certainly would be proper for the jury to infer that\n\nsuch a shipment of such a worth certainly would not be left to be\n\nhandled by persons who did not know what was in there.\"\n\n          On appeal, Hernández argues that the trial court should have\n\nexcluded this evidence because of its risk of unfair prejudice. He\n\nsays that the jury already had ample evidence from which to draw\n\ninferences regarding knowledge and intent to distribute, in the form of\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fphotographs of the load and testimony regarding the amount of cocaine\n\nfound in the container.\n\n          The district court's Rule 403 balancing stands unless it is\n\nan abuse of discretion.

Hernández's Sentence\n\n          Hernández argues that it was error to hold him responsible\n\nfor the 3,017 kilograms of cocaine alleged in the charges. Given\n\nHernández's criminal history category, this quantity resulted in a\n\nsentencing range of 235 to 293 months under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1. The district court sentenced him to concurrent\n\n293-month terms. Hernández argues that this sentence was excessive and\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fthat a minimum sentence of 120 months should have been given.\n\n          In drug cases, sentences are largely driven by the quantity\n\nof the drugs involved.

The district court stated that\nwhile there was no \"direct evidence\" of knowledge, the evidence\nsuggested that Hernández \"must have known that there was a large\nquantity of drugs coming in.\"\n\n                                 -27-\n\f(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          The issue here is straightforward: is the district court's\n\nfinding that Hernández knew or could have reasonably foreseen the\n\nquantity of drugs contained in the seized container, which he was\n\ndirectly involved in transporting, clearly erroneous?         It was not.\n\n          All of the evidence and inferences discussed in connection\n\nwith Hernández's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence apply\n\nwith equal force here. The district court's conclusions were properly\n\nrooted in the evidence and its inferences founded in logical reasoning.\n\n\"A defendant who conspires to transport for distribution a large\n\nquantity of drugs, but happens not to know the precise amount, pretty\n\nmuch takes his chances that the amount actually involved will be quite\n\nlarge.\"   De La </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610551\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cruz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/610551/united-states-v-efrain-de-la-cruz-united-states-v-luis-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n          Even if the district court's attribution of all 3,017\n\nkilograms to Hernández could be faulted, we note that any error would\n\nbe harmless.
