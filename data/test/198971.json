Roxse Homes housing project is\n\na   364-unit    housing     development   for   low-    to   moderate-income\n\ntenants in Boston, Massachusetts.          The project was built in 1969\n\nsubject to a mortgage insured by the Department of Housing and\n\nUrban Development (\"HUD\"); and it was owned and operated by a\n\nnon-profit corporation, Roxse Homes, Inc. (\"Roxse Homes\"), until\n\nHUD took over the project in 1992.           James E. Cofield, Jr., was\n\nthe chairman of the board of Roxse Homes from 1971 until 1992\n\nand Henry F. Owens, III, was an attorney who represented Roxse\n\nHomes in various matters starting in the early 1970s.\n\n             In securing HUD insurance for the mortgage, Roxse Homes\n\nsigned   a     regulatory     agreement    with   HUD    imposing    various\n\nrestrictions     on   the    company.      Pertinently,       the   agreement\n\nprovided that\n\n             ! Assets of the project may be used only for\n               reasonable    operating    expenses    and\n               necessary repairs of the project;\n\n             ! All rents and receipts of the project must\n               be deposited in project accounts; and\n\n             ! Documents, records, and other related\n               papers of the project must be maintained\n               in a reasonable condition for proper\n               audit.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f             From the outset Roxse Homes was unable to make any\n\nprincipal payments on the mortgage, and in 1975 HUD paid the\n\nmortgagee $9.5 million and took over the mortgage.                     In December\n\n1992, HUD secured a court order to replace the management of the\n\nproject (and HUD later foreclosed on the property).                     Doubtless\n\nprompted by this debacle, government investigators examined the\n\nrecords and transactions of Roxse Homes and ultimately uncovered\n\nthe two transactions that prompted this litigation.\n\n             First, in July and August 1991, Owens received on\n\nbehalf of Roxse Homes payment of $145,000 in settlement of the\n\nproject's legal claims against contractors for defective roofing\n\nwork.    Owens first deposited the funds in the Owens & Associates\n\nclient trust account, and then Owens wrote a check on the trust\n\naccount for $50,000 payable to the Owens & Associates operating\n\naccount, with the words \"Roxse Retainer\" written on the memo\n\nline.    After audit, the government took the position that Owens\n\nhad previously been paid in full by Roxse Homes for all of his\n\nwork    on   the   roofing   case       and    that   the    $50,000   was   not     a\n\njustified expenditure.\n\n             Second, the government's audit revealed that in June\n\n1991,   Roxse      Homes   had   paid    Owens's      firm   $13,870.50      out    of\n\nproject funds for legal services on four specific matters.                         HUD\n\nconcluded that these amounts, which the project admittedly paid,\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fwere for legal services that benefitted others but not the\n\nproject.          For example, $2,705 was spent on litigation involving\n\nthe Roxse Homes Limited Partnership and $1,582.50 was spent in\n\nopposing subpoenas issued by HUD.\n\n              HUD, and ultimately the U.S. Attorney's office, made\n\ndemands on Cofield and Owens for adequate explanations and/or\n\nfor the return of the disputed amounts ($50,000 and $13,870.50).\n\nMore       than    two   years   passed      with   repeated   requests    by    the\n\ngovernment,         followed     by   what    it    regarded   as   inadequate   or\n\ninconsistent explanations by Cofield and Owens.                        In October\n\n1995, the United States filed this suit against Cofield, Owens,\n\nOwens & Associates, and Roxse Homes to recover $63,870.50 plus\n\ninterest, double damages, and costs including attorney's fees.\n\n12 U.S.C. ยง 1715z-4a (1994).1             Throughout, we cite and quote the\n\nstatute as it is listed without amendments made in 1997 which,\n\nin any event, do not bear on this case.\n\n              This statutory provision empowers the Attorney General\n\nto sue in the district court \"to recover any assets or income\n\nused by any person in violation of . . . a regulatory agreement\"\n\n\n\n       1\n     In addition to its statutory claim, the United States made\nclaims of conversion, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust\nenrichment against the defendants. The district court did not\npass on the merits of these common law claims, treating them as\nsuperseded by the judgment in favor of the government on the\nstatutory claim.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fcovering a HUD-insured mortgage or \"any applicable regulation.\"\n\n12 U.S.C. ยง 1715z-4a(1).       The statute further provides:\n\n           For purposes of this section, a use of\n           assets or income in violation of the\n           regulatory agreement or any applicable\n           regulation shall include any use for which\n           the documentation in the books and accounts\n           does not establish that the use was made for\n           a reasonable operating expense or necessary\n           repair of the project and has not been\n           maintained    in   accordance    with    the\n           requirements   of  the   Secretary  and   in\n           reasonable condition for proper audit.\n\nId. ยง 1715z-4a(a)(1).\n\n           The district court conducted a bench trial on the\n\nstatutory claim and decided it in a memorandum and order dated\n\nNovember 20, 1998.      As to the $50,000 payment, the court found\n\nthat it was not a payment for previously unpaid work in the\n\nroofing litigation, that no such unpaid work had been documented\n\nby Cofield or Owens, and that the payment was at best an\n\nimpermissible     \"retainer\"    for     unspecified   work    which    was\n\nreflected in the project's records in a reasonable condition for\n\na proper audit.    The court also found that the $13,870.50 paid\n\nby Roxse Homes to Owens & Associates out of project funds were\n\nnot reasonable operating expenses of the project; further detail\n\nas   to   the   four   transactions     is   unnecessary     because   the\n\ndefendants do not now contest this finding.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            Accordingly, the court entered judgment against all\n\ndefendants for the total amount of $63,870.50 plus $56,180.49 in\n\npre-judgment interest.             The court rejected the government's\n\nrequest for double damages and attorney's fees:                       the court noted\n\nCofield's uncompensated years of service to the project and\n\nOwens's    past   recovery    in    litigation         of     large    sums      for   the\n\nbenefit of the project, the absence of fraud charges, and the\n\ngovernment's refusal shortly before trial to accept a settlement\n\noffer from the defendants for $63,000.                  Owens and Cofield have\n\nappealed    to    this    court,    and      the     United    States      has    cross-\n\nappealed.\n\n            Owens   makes    only       a    single    argument       in   his    brief,\n\nalthough he joins by cross-reference in each of the arguments\n\nmade by Cofield.         Owens's position is that he does not fit into\n\nthe category of persons who may be sued under section 1715z-4a.\n\nThe statute, as already noted, provides that suit can be brought\n\n\"to   recover     any    assets    or       income    used    by   any     person\"     in\n\nviolation of a regulatory agreement or an applicable regulation;\n\nand for mortgages like that covering the Roxse housing project,\n\nthe statute provides:\n\n            [T]he term \"any person\" shall mean any\n            person or entity which owns a project . . .\n            ; any beneficial owner under any business or\n            trust; any officer, director, or partner of\n            an entity owning the project; and any heir,\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f          assignee, successor in interest, or agent of\n          any owner.\n\n12 U.S.C. ยง 1715z-4a(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\n          Owens concedes that he was the attorney for the project\n\nin various matters, and therefore its \"agent\" in a conventional\n\nsense.   See Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432, 435-36 & n.6 (1991).\n\nBut Owens says that, in context and under the canon          ejusdem\n\ngeneris, the term \"agent\" in this statute is best read as\n\nreferring to a \"managing agent,\" that is to say, someone who has\n\ngeneral responsibility for managing a project; and Cofield urges\n\nthat the penal character of the statute (notably, provision for\n\ndouble damages) supports a restrictive reading.\n\n          While the term \"agent\" could in context be limited to\n\nmanaging agents, the statute is not so restricted by its terms,\n\nand it is easy to think of situations in which agents with\n\nnarrow   responsibility   could   wrongfully   appropriate   project\n\nfunds.   Imagine, for example, a purchasing agent who is supposed\n\nto acquire supplies for a project but pockets most of the funds\n\nfor himself.   Recovery in such a case seems as easily justified\n\nas in the case of an officer or director who takes project\n\nproperty and is perhaps more easily justified than the suit\n\nagainst an owner or director who gained nothing but was simply\n\ncareless in failing to prevent the theft.\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            Here, the expenditures that the district court found\n\nto be improper were payments to Owens or his law firm by the\n\nproject,    so       Owens's       agency     responsibilities        are     clearly\n\nimplicated.          In   somewhat       similar    circumstances,        this   court\n\ntreated an attorney as the \"agent\" of a bank under 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n656.    United States v. Doane, 975 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nOf   course,     there      must    be    some     limits   based    on    fault   and\n\ncausation      on    the    notion       of   agent      liability--surely,        the\n\npurchasing agent cannot be held liable, although an agent of the\n\nproject, if unbeknownst to him an officer walks off with project\n\nrents--but these concerns are not urged on this appeal.\n\n            We turn now to Cofield's arguments which he presents\n\npro se.    His first argument is a charge that this suit reflects\n\ndeliberate racial discrimination on the part of the government.\n\nPointing out that both he and Owens are black, he says that the\n\ngovernment would not, and has not in the past, asserted similar\n\nclaims against white directors or agents.                   According to Cofield,\n\nthe present suit is selective enforcement in violation of the\n\nEqual   Protection         Clause,    Yick    Wo    v.   Hopkins,    118    U.S.   356\n\n(1886), as incorporated in the Fifth Amendment.\n\n            In the district court, Cofield asserted a counterclaim\n\nagainst    HUD      for   unlawful       discrimination      based   on     selective\n\nenforcement.         The government says that the counterclaim was\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fbarred by sovereign immunity (it was dismissed by the district\n\ncourt) and that Cofield never properly asserted discrimination\n\nas a \"defense\" to the government's statutory claim.                      This may\n\nask a good deal of a pro se defendant, Haines v. Kerner, 404\n\nU.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam); Prou v. United States, 199\n\nF.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 1999).             In any event, the court permitted\n\nCofield to offer evidence on the issue at trial and rejected it\n\non the merits, so we treat the claim as preserved.\n\n          On   the   merits,       the    district     court    found    that    the\n\nalleged   discrepancies       in    treatment    claimed       by    Cofield    were\n\nexplained by other factors:              in particular, as to the $50,000,\n\nthat no other law firm had been paid without submitting a bill\n\nevidencing the services in question.            Cofield has not shown this\n\nfinding   to   be   clearly     erroneous.        As    for    the    $13,870.50,\n\nCofield's brief contains only general assertions of discrepant\n\ntreatment and undeveloped references to transcript and document\n\nexhibits from which we cannot construct a coherent argument; on\n\nthe   contrary,     some   of      the    referenced    material        helps    the\n\ngovernment.\n\n          It does appear from the transcript that the government\n\nacknowledged at trial that at least one other law firm, which\n\nworked for the project for approximately 20 years, also billed\n\nthe project for ineligible expenses and yet was never sued for\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\frecovery of that money.   However, the government explained that\n\nthe amount of ineligible expenses was less than for those billed\n\nby Owens and, again, that the other firm was not paid any money\n\nwithout submitting a bill.   Moreover, the government submitted\n\nevidence at trial that in the bankruptcy court it did oppose fee\n\napplications by at least two other law firms.    In sum, Cofield\n\nhas failed to make even a prima facie showing of selective\n\nprosecution.   See United States v. Graham, 146 F.3d 6, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n          Cofield's second argument concerns the district court's\n\nruling that the $50,000 was not adequately documented in the\n\nproject records.   The crux of the argument is Cofield's claim\n\nthat \"[i]t is implicit in the statute that HUD has to make a\n\nrequest on the project owner for such books, records, and other\n\ndocuments [and] Roxse had no opportunity to make such books,\n\nrecords and other documents available for audit when it was not\n\nasked.\"   Cofield's argument might have some merit if he meant\n\nthat the books and records were properly maintained, and did\n\nproperly document the $50,000, but were not found because HUD\n\ndid not ask for them.\n\n          The district court found that in fact \"the books and\n\nrecords of Roxse Homes do not reflect that Owens & Associates\n\nwas owed $50,000\"; and nothing in Cofield's brief shows this\n\n\n                              -10-\n\ffinding to be clear error.   Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto\n\nRico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).    While a set of project\n\nminutes contains a summary reference by Cofield to the supposed\n\n$50,000 debt for past services, there is no bill from the law\n\nfirm and apparently no documentation in the books and records of\n\nthe services allegedly performed.     As for the suggestion that a\n\npre-audit request should have been made, it appears that the\n\ngovernment repeatedly sought documentation but never got it.2\n\n          Cofield's last argument is that the district court\n\nerred in finding that Owens had already been paid in full for\n\nhis work on the roofing case before he obtained the $50,000.\n\nThe district court traced in detail the chronology of bills and\n\npayments relating to the roofing case, and it found that all of\n\nOwens's bills on that case had been paid.     Further, an earlier\n\naffidavit by Cofield said that the $50,000 was a retainer, as\n\ndid Owens's check memo.   Finally, there was no credible evidence\n\nfrom Owens that any specific piece of uncompensated work had\n\nbeen done on the roofing case.\n\n\n\n\n     2Since there is no indication that Owens was responsible for\nthe project books and records, Owens's liability for the $50,000\nrests more securely on the district court's finding that he had\nalready been compensated for his work on the litigation. As for\nthe $13,870.50, the district court did not rest on a lack of\nrecords but rather on the conclusion that Cofield approved, and\nOwens received, payment for inappropriate expenditures.\n\n                               -11-\n\f          Cofield says that the district court conceded that\n\nthere was \"a lot of evidence\" that Owens provided legal services\n\nfor his $50,000 payment; but the only evidence specifically\n\nmentioned by the court was the minutes that summarily mentioned\n\nthe   supposed   $50,000   debt    and   a    memorandum   by    Cofield\n\npreliminary to the meeting--neither of which gave any detail as\n\nto services.     In sum, the district court provided a plausible\n\nexplanation for its conclusion, and again Owens has not shown\n\nthat the finding was clear error.\n\n          This   discussion   disposes   of    Owens's   and    Cofield's\n\ndirect challenges of the judgment entered against them, but that\n\ndoes not end the matter.      Section 1715z-4a(c) provides that:\n\n          In any judgment favorable to the United\n          States entered under this section [section\n          1715z-4a], the Attorney General may recover\n          double the value of the assets and income of\n          the project that the court determines to\n          have   been   used  in   violation   of  the\n          regulatory agreement or any applicable\n          regulation, plus all costs relating to the\n          action,   including  but   not   limited  to\n          reasonable attorney and auditing fees.\n\nThe government has cross-appealed from the district court's\n\nrefusal to grant it double damages or attorney's fees.\n\n          Starting with attorney's fees, the statutory language\n\nis not very informative:      it does not say that attorney's fees\n\n\"must\" or \"shall\" be awarded but, contrariwise, it does not make\n\nan award of attorney's fees explicitly subject to the court's\n\n                                  -12-\n\fdiscretion.     Compare 42 U.S.C.A. ยง 1988(b) (Supp. 2000) (\"the\n\ncourt, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . .\n\na reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\").                    Nor is\n\nthere   any   pertinent    legislative     history    or     circuit    court\n\nprecedent that helps us in glossing section 1715z-4a(c) as\n\napplied to attorney's fees.\n\n          However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the language\n\nof section 1988 to require attorney's fees \"save for rare cases\n\nin which 'special circumstances' would render an award unjust.\"\n\nStanton v. Southern Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 574,\n\n576 (1st Cir. 1999).      The wording of section 1715z-4a(c) is even\n\nmore favorable to recovery of attorney's fees than the language\n\nof section 1988(b).    Although many of the statutes to which the\n\nspecial circumstances test has been applied are civil rights\n\nstatutes, the courts have applied the test in other contexts as\n\nwell.   1 Derfner & Wolf, Court Awarded Attorney Fees ยง 10.02, at\n\n10-11 n.10 (1999).    The key decisions are Blanchard v. Bergeron,\n\n489 U.S. 87, 89 n.1 (1989), Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,\n\n429 (1983), and Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390\n\nU.S. 400, 402 (1968).\n\n          The    Supreme    Court's      rationale     for    the   special\n\ncircumstances test is that Congress meant to encourage such\n\nlawsuits, because of their public purpose.           See generally Piggie\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fPark, 390 U.S. at 401-03.              It is similarly clear, from the\n\nlegislative       history   of   the    amendment       to   section   1715z-4a\n\nproviding for double damages and attorney's fees, that Congress\n\nmeant to encourage more enforcement by federal authorities, H.R.\n\nRep.     No.     100-122(I),     at    66     (1987),    reprinted     in   1987\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3382.         And incentives aside, in all cases the\n\naward of attorney's fees tends more completely to make the\n\ninjured party whole.\n\n               Accordingly, we think that the \"special circumstances\"\n\ntest is the proper standard in this case.                      It effectively\n\ncreates a strong presumption in favor of awarding attorney's\n\nfees.    See Posada v. Lamb Cty., Texas, 716 F.2d 1066, 1075 (5th\n\nCir. 1983).       The burden is on the defendant to show that unusual\n\nconditions would make an award unjust or inappropriate.                      See\n\nHerrington v. County of Sonoma, 883 F.2d 739, 744 (9th Cir.\n\n1989).    Here, in explaining its denial of attorney's fees, the\n\ndistrict court said only this:\n\n               Before trial began, the defendants offered\n               to settle this case for $63,000, the stated\n               amount   in    the   government's   Complaint.\n               Rather    than    accept   this   offer,   the\n               government embarked on a nine-day trial to\n               recover the interest on the money.          No\n               private litigant would spend nine days in\n               trial solely to recover interest. The Court\n               sees no reason to reward such tactics, which\n               are    only    possible    because    of   the\n               government's unlimited resources.\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f           We    do   not   think    that       the    government's     refusal    to\n\nsettle, standing alone, constitutes \"special circumstances.\"\n\nSee Coutin v. Young & Rubicam Puerto Rico, 124 F.3d 331, 341\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).        There was nothing whatever unreasonable or\n\nunfair in the government's decision to reject the defendants'\n\noffer, which was made only on the eve of trial and after the\n\ngovernment      had   invested      in    trial       preparation.      Since     the\n\ndefendants'     offer   did   not        include      pre-judgment    interest     or\n\ndouble damages, the defendants were belatedly offering to settle\n\nfor only about one-third of what the government might hope to\n\ncollect.\n\n           The district court's denial of double damages raises\n\na different set of issues.          Again, the statute does not say that\n\ndouble damages must or shall be provided.                   Compare 15 U.S.C. ยง\n\n15a (\"[T]he United States . . .                 shall recover threefold the\n\ndamages by it sustained and the cost of the suit.\").                      Further,\n\ndouble damages are not required to make a plaintiff whole nor,\n\nwhere   the   government      can    collect       its   full   costs    including\n\nattorney's fees, are double damages likely to be a critical\n\nincentive for bringing suit.             Rather, as the legislative history\n\nconfirms, the double damages provision was adopted simply to\n\nprovide a greater \"deterrent\" to violations.                 H.R. Rep. No. 100-\n\n122(I), at 66 (1987), reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3382.\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f            The      violations    that       give    rise     to    liability        under\n\nsection 1715z-4a are broadly defined, and perhaps ill-defined,\n\nby   cross-reference        to     a    \"regulatory          agreement\"          or    \"any\n\napplicable regulation.\"           If the present Roxse Homes agreement is\n\ntypical,    such      agreements       include       phrases        like    \"reasonable\n\noperating expenses\" and books and records kept in \"reasonable\n\ncondition      for    proper     audit,\"       which    give        rise    to    further\n\nuncertainty in their application to particular circumstances.\n\nAn added problem is the lack of clarity in the statute as to\n\nwhat level of scienter, if any, is required for a violation and\n\nwhat causal connection must be shown between the violation and\n\nany claimed loss.\n\n            These concerns encourage us to leave to the informed\n\njudgment of the district court the decision whether the award of\n\ndouble     damages     is   just       in    the     particular        circumstances.\n\nImagine, for example, that Owens had in fact performed services\n\nand properly billed for the $50,000, but in a retrospective\n\nevaluation the payment was found by a close margin to be an\n\n\"unreasonable\" operating expense of the project; or suppose that\n\npayment of a plausible bill was authorized by Cofield in good\n\nfaith    but    the     documentation          was     later        found   not       quite\n\nsufficient.       Recovery of loss and costs is one thing; a double\n\ndamages penalty is quite another.\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\f                Double damages for the government on a deterrence\n\nrationale make sense primarily where the defendant is guilty of\n\nsubstantial or repeated fault.                   Cf. Ocean Spray Cranberries,\n\nInc. v.     Pepsico, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 62 n.3 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(discussing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A). There is obviously a\n\nspectrum, with fraudulent intent or recklessness at one end and\n\na   lost    record    or    close-call      judgments     at   the   other.     The\n\ndistrict court may have felt that the defendants, after many\n\nyears      of    service,     were    no     worse     than    careless    in   the\n\ntransactions in question.             If so, we would regard this as an\n\nadequate basis for the court to exercise its discretion to deny\n\ndouble     damages--although         we    do    not   suggest   that     seriously\n\nnegligent acts could never justify double damages.\n\n                Nevertheless, we think that the government is entitled,\n\nunder the law as we have clarified it, to an opportunity to\n\npersuade the district court that the conduct of the defendants\n\nreflects sufficient fault to warrant double damages despite the\n\ndefendants' past services.                The district court is entitled to\n\nlimit the inquiry:          double damages is a remedial measure and not\n\nthe occasion for a second trial.                   Relatedly, defendants can\n\ndispute the award of attorney's fees on new grounds if they\n\nchoose, but at present no basis for refusing to impose them is\n\napparent to us.\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f          The judgment is      affirmed as to the recovery by the\n\ngovernment of $63,870.50 plus interest from the defendants.\n\nInsofar   as   it   denied   double   damages   and   costs   including\n\nattorney's fees, the judgment is vacated and the matter remanded\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

The project was built in 1969 subject to a mortgage insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"); and it was owned and operated by a non-profit corporation, Roxse Homes, Inc. (\"Roxse Homes\"), until HUD took over the project in 1992. James E. Cofield, Jr., was the chairman of the board of Roxse Homes from 1971 until 1992 and Henry F. Owens, III, was an attorney who represented Roxse Homes in various matters starting in the early 1970s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In securing HUD insurance for the mortgage, Roxse Homes signed a regulatory agreement with HUD imposing various restrictions on the company. Pertinently, the agreement provided that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*       Assets of the project may be used only for reasonable operating expenses and necessary repairs of the project;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*       All rents and receipts of the project must be deposited in project accounts; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*       Documents, records, and other related papers of the project must be maintained in a reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the outset Roxse Homes was unable to make any principal payments on the mortgage, and in 1975 HUD paid the mortgagee $9.5 million and took over the mortgage. In December 1992, HUD secured a court order to replace the management of the project (and HUD later foreclosed on the property). Doubtless prompted by this debacle, government investigators examined the records and transactions of Roxse Homes and ultimately uncovered the two transactions that prompted this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in July and August 1991, Owens received on behalf of Roxse Homes payment of $145,000 in settlement of the project's legal claims against contractors for defective roofing work. Owens first deposited the funds in the Owens &amp; Associates client trust account, and then Owens wrote a check on the trust account for $50,000 payable to the Owens &amp; Associates operating account, with the words \"Roxse Retainer\" written on the memo line. After audit, the government took the position that Owens had previously been paid in full by Roxse Homes for all of his work on the roofing case and that the $50,000 was not a justified expenditure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the government's audit revealed that in June 1991, Roxse Homes had paid Owens's firm $13,870.50 out of project funds for legal services on four specific matters. HUD concluded that these amounts, which the project admittedly paid, were for legal services that benefitted others but not the project. For example, $2,705 was spent on litigation involving the Roxse Homes Limited Partnership and $1,582.50 was spent in opposing subpoenas issued by HUD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD, and ultimately the U.S. Attorney's office, made demands on Cofield and Owens for adequate explanations and/or for the return of the disputed amounts ($50,000 and $13,870.50). More than two years passed with repeated requests by the government, followed by what it regarded as inadequate or inconsistent explanations by Cofield and Owens. In October 1995, the United States filed this suit against Cofield, Owens, Owens &amp; Associates, and Roxse Homes to recover $63,870.50 plus interest, double damages, and costs including attorney's fees. 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1715z-4a (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Throughout, we cite and quote the statute as it is listed without amendments made in 1997 which, in any event, do not bear on this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statutory provision empowers the Attorney General to sue in the district court \"to recover any assets or income used by any person in violation of... a regulatory agreement\" covering a HUD-insured mortgage or \"any applicable regulation.\" 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1715z-4a(1). The statute further provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this section, a use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement or any applicable regulation shall include any use for which the documentation in the books and accounts does not establish that the use was made for a reasonable operating expense or necessary repair of the project and has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary and in reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 1715z-4a(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted a bench trial on the statutory claim and decided it in a memorandum and order dated November 20, 1998. As to the $50,000 payment, the court found that it was not a payment for previously unpaid work in the roofing litigation, that no such unpaid work had been documented by Cofield or Owens, and that the payment was at best an impermissible \"retainer\" for unspecified work which was reflected in the project's records in a reasonable condition for a proper audit. The court also found that the $13,870.50 paid by Roxse Homes to Owens &amp; Associates out of project funds were not reasonable operating expenses of the project; further detail as to the four transactions is unnecessary because the defendants do not now contest this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court entered judgment against all defendants for the total amount of $63,870.50 plus $56,180.49 in pre-judgment interest. The court rejected the government's request for double damages and attorney's fees: the court noted Cofield's uncompensated years of service to the project and Owens's past recovery in litigation of large sums for the benefit of the project, the absence of fraud charges, and the government's refusal shortly before trial to accept a settlement offer from the defendants for $63,000. Owens and Cofield have appealed to this court, and the United States has cross-appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens makes only a single argument in his brief, although he joins by cross-reference in each of the arguments made by Cofield. Owens's position is that he does not fit into the category of persons who may be sued under section 1715z-4a. The statute, as already noted, provides that suit can be brought \"to recover any assets or income used by any person\" in violation of a regulatory agreement or an applicable regulation; and for mortgages like that covering the Roxse housing project, the statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he term \"any person\" shall mean any person or entity which owns a project...; any beneficial owner under any business or trust; any officer, director, or partner of an entity owning the project; and any heir, assignee, successor in interest, or agent of any owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12 U.S.C. &#167; 1715z-4a(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens concedes that he was the attorney for the project in various matters, and therefore its \"agent\" in a conventional sense. See Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432, 435-36 &amp; n.6 (1991). But Owens says that, in context and under the canon ejusdem generis, the term \"agent\" in this statute is best read as referring to a \"managing agent,\" that is to say, someone who has general responsibility for managing a project; and Cofield urges that the penal character of the statute (notably, provision for double damages) supports a restrictive reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the term \"agent\" could in context be limited to managing agents, the statute is not so restricted by its terms, and it is easy to think of situations in which agents with narrow responsibility could wrongfully appropriate project funds. Imagine, for example, a purchasing agent who is supposed to acquire supplies for a project but pockets most of the funds for himself. Recovery in such a case seems as easily justified as in the case of an officer or director who takes project property and is perhaps more easily justified than the suit against an owner or director who gained nothing but was simply careless in failing to prevent the theft.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the expenditures that the district court found to be improper were payments to Owens or his law firm by the project, so Owens's agency responsibilities are clearly implicated. In somewhat similar circumstances, this court treated an attorney as the \"agent\" of a bank under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 656. United States v. Doane, 975 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1992). Of course, there must be some limits based on fault and causation on the notion of agent liability--surely, the purchasing agent cannot be held liable, although an agent of the project, if unbeknownst to him an officer walks off with project rents--but these concerns are not urged on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Cofield's arguments which he presents pro se. His first argument is a charge that this suit reflects deliberate racial discrimination on the part of the government. Pointing out that both he and Owens are black, he says that the government would not, and has not in the past, asserted similar claims against white directors or agents. According to Cofield, the present suit is selective enforcement in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), as incorporated in the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, Cofield asserted a counterclaim against HUD for unlawful discrimination based on selective enforcement. The government says that the counterclaim was barred by sovereign immunity (it was dismissed by the district court) and that Cofield never properly asserted discrimination as a \"defense\" to the government's statutory claim. This may ask a good deal of a pro se defendant, Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam); Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 1999). In any event, the court permitted Cofield to offer evidence on the issue at trial and rejected it on the merits, so we treat the claim as preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits, the district court found that the alleged discrepancies in treatment claimed by Cofield were explained by other factors: in particular, as to the $50,000, that no other law firm had been paid without submitting a bill evidencing the services in question. Cofield has not shown this finding to be clearly erroneous. As for the $13,870.50, Cofield's brief contains only general assertions of discrepant treatment and undeveloped references to transcript and document exhibits from which we cannot construct a coherent argument; on the contrary, some of the referenced material helps the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does appear from the transcript that the government acknowledged at trial that at least one other law firm, which worked for the project for approximately 20 years, also billed the project for ineligible expenses and yet was never sued for recovery of that money. However, the government explained that the amount of ineligible expenses was less than for those billed by Owens and, again, that the other firm was not paid any money without submitting a bill. Moreover, the government submitted evidence at trial that in the bankruptcy court it did oppose fee applications by at least two other law firms. In sum, Cofield has failed to make even a prima facie showing of selective prosecution. See United States v. Graham, 146 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cofield's second argument concerns the district court's ruling that the $50,000 was not adequately documented in the project records. The crux of the argument is Cofield's claim that \"[i]t is implicit in the statute that HUD has to make a request on the project owner for such books, records, and other documents [and] Roxse had no opportunity to make such books, records and other documents available for audit when it was not asked.\" Cofield's argument might have some merit if he meant that the books and records were properly maintained, and did properly document the $50,000, but were not found because HUD did not ask for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that in fact \"the books and records of Roxse Homes do not reflect that Owens &amp; Associates was owed $50,000\"; and nothing in Cofield's brief shows this finding to be clear error. Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990). While a set of project minutes contains a summary reference by Cofield to the supposed $50,000 debt for past services, there is no bill from the law firm and apparently no documentation in the books and records of the services allegedly performed. As for the suggestion that a pre-audit request should have been made, it appears that the government repeatedly sought documentation but never got it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cofield's last argument is that the district court erred in finding that Owens had already been paid in full for his work on the roofing case before he obtained the $50,000. The district court traced in detail the chronology of bills and payments relating to the roofing case, and it found that all of Owens's bills on that case had been paid. Further, an earlier affidavit by Cofield said that the $50,000 was a retainer, as did Owens's check memo. Finally, there was no credible evidence from Owens that any specific piece of uncompensated work had been done on the roofing case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cofield says that the district court conceded that there was \"a lot of evidence\" that Owens provided legal services for his $50,000 payment; but the only evidence specifically mentioned by the court was the minutes that summarily mentioned the supposed $50,000 debt and a memorandum by Cofield preliminary to the meeting--neither of which gave any detail as to services. In sum, the district court provided a plausible explanation for its conclusion, and again Owens has not shown that the finding was clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discussion disposes of Owens's and Cofield's direct challenges of the judgment entered against them, but that does not end the matter. Section 1715z-4a(c) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any judgment favorable to the United States entered under this section [section 1715z-4a], the Attorney General may recover double the value of the assets and income of the project that the court determines to have been used in violation of the regulatory agreement or any applicable regulation, plus all costs relating to the action, including but not limited to reasonable attorney and auditing fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has cross-appealed from the district court's refusal to grant it double damages or attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with attorney's fees, the statutory language is not very informative: it does not say that attorney's fees \"must\" or \"shall\" be awarded but, contrariwise, it does not make an award of attorney's fees explicitly subject to the court's discretion. Compare 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1988(b) (Supp. 2000) (\"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party... a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\"). Nor is there any pertinent legislative history or circuit court precedent that helps us in glossing section 1715z-4a(c) as applied to attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the language of section 1988 to require attorney's fees \"save for rare cases in which'special circumstances' would render an award unjust.\" Stanton v. Southern Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir. 1999). The wording of section 1715z-4a(c) is even more favorable to recovery of attorney's fees than the language of section 1988(b). Although many of the statutes to which the special circumstances test has been applied are civil rights statutes, the courts have applied the test in other contexts as well. 1 Derfner &amp; Wolf, Court Awarded Attorney Fees &#167; 10.02, at 10-11 n.10 (1999). The key decisions are Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 89 n.1 (1989), Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983), and Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's rationale for the special circumstances test is that Congress meant to encourage such lawsuits, because of their public purpose. See generally Piggie Park, 390 U.S. at 401-03. It is similarly clear, from the legislative history of the amendment to section 1715z-4a providing for double damages and attorney's fees, that Congress meant to encourage more enforcement by federal authorities, H.R. Rep. No. 100-122(I), at 66 (1987), reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3382. And incentives aside, in all cases the award of attorney's fees tends more completely to make the injured party whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we think that the \"special circumstances\" test is the proper standard in this case. It effectively creates a strong presumption in favor of awarding attorney's fees. See Posada v. Lamb Cty., Texas, 716 F.2d 1066, 1075 (5th Cir. 1983). The burden is on the defendant to show that unusual conditions would make an award unjust or inappropriate. See Herrington v. County of Sonoma, 883 F.2d 739, 744 (9th Cir. 1989). Here, in explaining its denial of attorney's fees, the district court said only this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial began, the defendants offered to settle this case for $63,000, the stated amount in the government's Complaint. Rather than accept this offer, the government embarked on a nine-day trial to recover the interest on the money. No private litigant would spend nine days in trial solely to recover interest. The Court sees no reason to reward such tactics, which are only possible because of the government's unlimited resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that the government's refusal to settle, standing alone, constitutes \"special circumstances.\" See Coutin v. Young &amp; Rubicam Puerto Rico, 124 F.3d 331, 341 (1st Cir. 1997). There was nothing whatever unreasonable or unfair in the government's decision to reject the defendants' offer, which was made only on the eve of trial and after the government had invested in trial preparation. Since the defendants' offer did not include pre-judgment interest or double damages, the defendants were belatedly offering to settle for only about one-third of what the government might hope to collect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of double damages raises a different set of issues. Again, the statute does not say that double damages must or shall be provided. Compare 15 U.S.C. &#167; 15a (\"[T]he United States... shall recover threefold the damages by it sustained and the cost of the suit.\"). Further, double damages are not required to make a plaintiff whole nor, where the government can collect its full costs including attorney's fees, are double damages likely to be a critical incentive for bringing suit. Rather, as the legislative history confirms, the double damages provision was adopted simply to provide a greater \"deterrent\" to violations. H.R. Rep. No. 100-122(I), at 66 (1987), reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3382.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The violations that give rise to liability under section 1715z-4a are broadly defined, and perhaps ill-defined, by cross-reference to a \"regulatory agreement\" or \"any applicable regulation.\" If the present Roxse Homes agreement is typical, such agreements include phrases like \"reasonable operating expenses\" and books and records kept in \"reasonable condition for proper audit,\" which give rise to further uncertainty in their application to particular circumstances. An added problem is the lack of clarity in the statute as to what level of scienter, if any, is required for a violation and what causal connection must be shown between the violation and any claimed loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These concerns encourage us to leave to the informed judgment of the district court the decision whether the award of double damages is just in the particular circumstances. Imagine, for example, that Owens had in fact performed services and properly billed for the $50,000, but in a retrospective evaluation the payment was found by a close margin to be an \"unreasonable\" operating expense of the project; or suppose that payment of a plausible bill was authorized by Cofield in good faith but the documentation was later found not quite sufficient. Recovery of loss and costs is one thing; a double damages penalty is quite another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Double damages for the government on a deterrence rationale make sense primarily where the defendant is guilty of substantial or repeated fault. Cf. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v. Pepsico, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 62 n.3 (1st Cir. 1998) (discussing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A). There is obviously a spectrum, with fraudulent intent or recklessness at one end and a lost record or close-call judgments at the other. The district court may have felt that the defendants, after many years of service, were no worse than careless in the transactions in question. If so, we would regard this as an adequate basis for the court to exercise its discretion to deny double damages--although we do not suggest that seriously negligent acts could never justify double damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we think that the government is entitled, under the law as we have clarified it, to an opportunity to persuade the district court that the conduct of the defendants reflects sufficient fault to warrant double damages despite the defendants' past services. The district court is entitled to limit the inquiry: double damages is a remedial measure and not the occasion for a second trial. Relatedly, defendants can dispute the award of attorney's fees on new grounds if they choose, but at present no basis for refusing to impose them is apparent to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed as to the recovery by the government of $63,870.50 plus interest from the defendants. Insofar as it denied double damages and costs including attorney's fees, the judgment is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  In addition to its statutory claim, the United States made claims of conversion, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against the defendants. The district court did not pass on the merits of these common law claims, treating them as superseded by the judgment in favor of the government on the statutory claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Since there is no indication that Owens was responsible for the project books and records, Owens's liability for the $50,000 rests more securely on the district court's finding that he had already been compensated for his work on the litigation. As for the $13,870.50, the district court did not rest on a lack of records but rather on the conclusion that Cofield approved, and Owens received, payment for inappropriate expenditures.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The project was built in 1969 subject to a mortgage insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"); and it was owned and operated by a non-profit corporation, Roxse Homes, Inc. (\"Roxse Homes\"), until HUD took over the project in 1992. James E. Cofield, Jr., was the chairman of the board of Roxse Homes from 1971 until 1992 and Henry F. Owens, III, was an attorney who represented Roxse Homes in various matters starting in the early 1970s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In securing HUD insurance for the mortgage, Roxse Homes signed a regulatory agreement with HUD imposing various restrictions on the company. Pertinently, the agreement provided that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*       Assets of the project may be used only for reasonable operating expenses and necessary repairs of the project;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*       All rents and receipts of the project must be deposited in project accounts; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*       Documents, records, and other related papers of the project must be maintained in a reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the outset Roxse Homes was unable to make any principal payments on the mortgage, and in 1975 HUD paid the mortgagee $9.5 million and took over the mortgage. In December 1992, HUD secured a court order to replace the management of the project (and HUD later foreclosed on the property). Doubtless prompted by this debacle, government investigators examined the records and transactions of Roxse Homes and ultimately uncovered the two transactions that prompted this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in July and August 1991, Owens received on behalf of Roxse Homes payment of $145,000 in settlement of the project's legal claims against contractors for defective roofing work. Owens first deposited the funds in the Owens &amp; Associates client trust account, and then Owens wrote a check on the trust account for $50,000 payable to the Owens &amp; Associates operating account, with the words \"Roxse Retainer\" written on the memo line. After audit, the government took the position that Owens had previously been paid in full by Roxse Homes for all of his work on the roofing case and that the $50,000 was not a justified expenditure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the government's audit revealed that in June 1991, Roxse Homes had paid Owens's firm $13,870.50 out of project funds for legal services on four specific matters. HUD concluded that these amounts, which the project admittedly paid, were for legal services that benefitted others but not the project. For example, $2,705 was spent on litigation involving the Roxse Homes Limited Partnership and $1,582.50 was spent in opposing subpoenas issued by HUD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD, and ultimately the U.S. Attorney's office, made demands on Cofield and Owens for adequate explanations and/or for the return of the disputed amounts ($50,000 and $13,870.50). More than two years passed with repeated requests by the government, followed by what it regarded as inadequate or inconsistent explanations by Cofield and Owens. In October 1995, the United States filed this suit against Cofield, Owens, Owens &amp; Associates, and Roxse Homes to recover $63,870.50 plus interest, double damages, and costs including attorney's fees. 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1715z-4a (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Throughout, we cite and quote the statute as it is listed without amendments made in 1997 which, in any event, do not bear on this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statutory provision empowers the Attorney General to sue in the district court \"to recover any assets or income used by any person in violation of... a regulatory agreement\" covering a HUD-insured mortgage or \"any applicable regulation.\" 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1715z-4a(1). The statute further provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this section, a use of assets or income in violation of the regulatory agreement or any applicable regulation shall include any use for which the documentation in the books and accounts does not establish that the use was made for a reasonable operating expense or necessary repair of the project and has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary and in reasonable condition for proper audit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 1715z-4a(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted a bench trial on the statutory claim and decided it in a memorandum and order dated November 20, 1998. As to the $50,000 payment, the court found that it was not a payment for previously unpaid work in the roofing litigation, that no such unpaid work had been documented by Cofield or Owens, and that the payment was at best an impermissible \"retainer\" for unspecified work which was reflected in the project's records in a reasonable condition for a proper audit. The court also found that the $13,870.50 paid by Roxse Homes to Owens &amp; Associates out of project funds were not reasonable operating expenses of the project; further detail as to the four transactions is unnecessary because the defendants do not now contest this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court entered judgment against all defendants for the total amount of $63,870.50 plus $56,180.49 in pre-judgment interest. The court rejected the government's request for double damages and attorney's fees: the court noted Cofield's uncompensated years of service to the project and Owens's past recovery in litigation of large sums for the benefit of the project, the absence of fraud charges, and the government's refusal shortly before trial to accept a settlement offer from the defendants for $63,000. Owens and Cofield have appealed to this court, and the United States has cross-appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens makes only a single argument in his brief, although he joins by cross-reference in each of the arguments made by Cofield. Owens's position is that he does not fit into the category of persons who may be sued under section 1715z-4a. The statute, as already noted, provides that suit can be brought \"to recover any assets or income used by any person\" in violation of a regulatory agreement or an applicable regulation; and for mortgages like that covering the Roxse housing project, the statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he term \"any person\" shall mean any person or entity which owns a project...; any beneficial owner under any business or trust; any officer, director, or partner of an entity owning the project; and any heir, assignee, successor in interest, or agent of any owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12 U.S.C. &#167; 1715z-4a(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens concedes that he was the attorney for the project in various matters, and therefore its \"agent\" in a conventional sense. See Kay v. Ehrler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112571\"><a href=\"/opinion/112571/kay-v-ehrler/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 435-36 &amp; n.6 (1991). But Owens says that, in context and under the canon ejusdem generis, the term \"agent\" in this statute is best read as referring to a \"managing agent,\" that is to say, someone who has general responsibility for managing a project; and Cofield urges that the penal character of the statute (notably, provision for double damages) supports a restrictive reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the term \"agent\" could in context be limited to managing agents, the statute is not so restricted by its terms, and it is easy to think of situations in which agents with narrow responsibility could wrongfully appropriate project funds. Imagine, for example, a purchasing agent who is supposed to acquire supplies for a project but pockets most of the funds for himself. Recovery in such a case seems as easily justified as in the case of an officer or director who takes project property and is perhaps more easily justified than the suit against an owner or director who gained nothing but was simply careless in failing to prevent the theft.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the expenditures that the district court found to be improper were payments to Owens or his law firm by the project, so Owens's agency responsibilities are clearly implicated. In somewhat similar circumstances, this court treated an attorney as the \"agent\" of a bank under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 656. United States v. Doane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590892\"><a href=\"/opinion/590892/united-states-v-roger-allen-doane/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 1992). Of course, there must be some limits based on fault and causation on the notion of agent liability--surely, the purchasing agent cannot be held liable, although an agent of the project, if unbeknownst to him an officer walks off with project rents--but these concerns are not urged on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Cofield's arguments which he presents pro se. His first argument is a charge that this suit reflects deliberate racial discrimination on the part of the government. Pointing out that both he and Owens are black, he says that the government would not, and has not in the past, asserted similar claims against white directors or agents. According to Cofield, the present suit is selective enforcement in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span> </a></span>(1886), as incorporated in the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, Cofield asserted a counterclaim against HUD for unlawful discrimination based on selective enforcement. The government says that the counterclaim was barred by sovereign immunity (it was dismissed by the district court) and that Cofield never properly asserted discrimination as a \"defense\" to the government's statutory claim. This may ask a good deal of a pro se defendant, Haines v. Kerner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108432\"><a href=\"/opinion/108432/haines-v-kerner/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam); Prou v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198748\"><a href=\"/opinion/198748/prou-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir. 1999). In any event, the court permitted Cofield to offer evidence on the issue at trial and rejected it on the merits, so we treat the claim as preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits, the district court found that the alleged discrepancies in treatment claimed by Cofield were explained by other factors: in particular, as to the $50,000, that no other law firm had been paid without submitting a bill evidencing the services in question. Cofield has not shown this finding to be clearly erroneous. As for the $13,870.50, Cofield's brief contains only general assertions of discrepant treatment and undeveloped references to transcript and document exhibits from which we cannot construct a coherent argument; on the contrary, some of the referenced material helps the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does appear from the transcript that the government acknowledged at trial that at least one other law firm, which worked for the project for approximately 20 years, also billed the project for ineligible expenses and yet was never sued for recovery of that money. However, the government explained that the amount of ineligible expenses was less than for those billed by Owens and, again, that the other firm was not paid any money without submitting a bill. Moreover, the government submitted evidence at trial that in the bankruptcy court it did oppose fee applications by at least two other law firms. In sum, Cofield has failed to make even a prima facie showing of selective prosecution. See United States v. Graham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197990\"><a href=\"/opinion/197990/united-states-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cofield's second argument concerns the district court's ruling that the $50,000 was not adequately documented in the project records. The crux of the argument is Cofield's claim that \"[i]t is implicit in the statute that HUD has to make a request on the project owner for such books, records, and other documents [and] Roxse had no opportunity to make such books, records and other documents available for audit when it was not asked.\" Cofield's argument might have some merit if he meant that the books and records were properly maintained, and did properly document the $50,000, but were not found because HUD did not ask for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that in fact \"the books and records of Roxse Homes do not reflect that Owens &amp; Associates was owed $50,000\"; and nothing in Cofield's brief shows this finding to be clear error. Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir. 1990). While a set of project minutes contains a summary reference by Cofield to the supposed $50,000 debt for past services, there is no bill from the law firm and apparently no documentation in the books and records of the services allegedly performed. As for the suggestion that a pre-audit request should have been made, it appears that the government repeatedly sought documentation but never got it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cofield's last argument is that the district court erred in finding that Owens had already been paid in full for his work on the roofing case before he obtained the $50,000. The district court traced in detail the chronology of bills and payments relating to the roofing case, and it found that all of Owens's bills on that case had been paid. Further, an earlier affidavit by Cofield said that the $50,000 was a retainer, as did Owens's check memo. Finally, there was no credible evidence from Owens that any specific piece of uncompensated work had been done on the roofing case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cofield says that the district court conceded that there was \"a lot of evidence\" that Owens provided legal services for his $50,000 payment; but the only evidence specifically mentioned by the court was the minutes that summarily mentioned the supposed $50,000 debt and a memorandum by Cofield preliminary to the meeting--neither of which gave any detail as to services. In sum, the district court provided a plausible explanation for its conclusion, and again Owens has not shown that the finding was clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discussion disposes of Owens's and Cofield's direct challenges of the judgment entered against them, but that does not end the matter. Section 1715z-4a(c) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any judgment favorable to the United States entered under this section [section 1715z-4a], the Attorney General may recover double the value of the assets and income of the project that the court determines to have been used in violation of the regulatory agreement or any applicable regulation, plus all costs relating to the action, including but not limited to reasonable attorney and auditing fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has cross-appealed from the district court's refusal to grant it double damages or attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with attorney's fees, the statutory language is not very informative: it does not say that attorney's fees \"must\" or \"shall\" be awarded but, contrariwise, it does not make an award of attorney's fees explicitly subject to the court's discretion. Compare 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1988(b) (Supp. 2000) (\"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party... a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\"). Nor is there any pertinent legislative history or circuit court precedent that helps us in glossing section 1715z-4a(c) as applied to attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the language of section 1988 to require attorney's fees \"save for rare cases in which'special circumstances' would render an award unjust.\" Stanton v. Southern Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198739\"><a href=\"/opinion/198739/stanton-v-southern-berkshire-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, 576 (1st Cir. 1999). The wording of section 1715z-4a(c) is even more favorable to recovery of attorney's fees than the language of section 1988(b). Although many of the statutes to which the special circumstances test has been applied are civil rights statutes, the courts have applied the test in other contexts as well. 1 Derfner &amp; Wolf, Court Awarded Attorney Fees &#167; 10.02, at 10-11 n.10 (1999). The key decisions are Blanchard v. Bergeron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112196\"><a href=\"/opinion/112196/blanchard-v-bergeron/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 89 n.1 (1989), Hensley v. Eckerhart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 429 (1983), and Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107637\"><a href=\"/opinion/107637/newman-v-piggie-park-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 402 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's rationale for the special circumstances test is that Congress meant to encourage such lawsuits, because of their public purpose. See generally Piggie <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107637\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Park,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/107637/newman-v-piggie-park-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">401-03</span></a></span>. It is similarly clear, from the legislative history of the amendment to section 1715z-4a providing for double damages and attorney's fees, that Congress meant to encourage more enforcement by federal authorities, H.R. Rep. No. 100-122(I), at 66 (1987), reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3382. And incentives aside, in all cases the award of attorney's fees tends more completely to make the injured party whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we think that the \"special circumstances\" test is the proper standard in this case. It effectively creates a strong presumption in favor of awarding attorney's fees. See Posada v. Lamb Cty., Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424702\"><a href=\"/opinion/424702/victoria-posada-v-lamb-county-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span>, 1075 (5th Cir. 1983). The burden is on the defendant to show that unusual conditions would make an award unjust or inappropriate. See Herrington v. County of Sonoma, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528276\"><a href=\"/opinion/528276/john-s-herrington-david-s-herrington-and-quail-hill-ranch-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 744 (9th Cir. 1989). Here, in explaining its denial of attorney's fees, the district court said only this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial began, the defendants offered to settle this case for $63,000, the stated amount in the government's Complaint. Rather than accept this offer, the government embarked on a nine-day trial to recover the interest on the money. No private litigant would spend nine days in trial solely to recover interest. The Court sees no reason to reward such tactics, which are only possible because of the government's unlimited resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that the government's refusal to settle, standing alone, constitutes \"special circumstances.\" See Coutin v. Young &amp; Rubicam Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746216\"><a href=\"/opinion/746216/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1463-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45260-denise/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span>, 341 (1st Cir. 1997). There was nothing whatever unreasonable or unfair in the government's decision to reject the defendants' offer, which was made only on the eve of trial and after the government had invested in trial preparation. Since the defendants' offer did not include pre-judgment interest or double damages, the defendants were belatedly offering to settle for only about one-third of what the government might hope to collect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of double damages raises a different set of issues. Again, the statute does not say that double damages must or shall be provided. Compare 15 U.S.C. &#167; 15a (\"[T]he United States... shall recover threefold the damages by it sustained and the cost of the suit.\"). Further, double damages are not required to make a plaintiff whole nor, where the government can collect its full costs including attorney's fees, are double damages likely to be a critical incentive for bringing suit. Rather, as the legislative history confirms, the double damages provision was adopted simply to provide a greater \"deterrent\" to violations. H.R. Rep. No. 100-122(I), at 66 (1987), reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3317, 3382.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The violations that give rise to liability under section 1715z-4a are broadly defined, and perhaps ill-defined, by cross-reference to a \"regulatory agreement\" or \"any applicable regulation.\" If the present Roxse Homes agreement is typical, such agreements include phrases like \"reasonable operating expenses\" and books and records kept in \"reasonable condition for proper audit,\" which give rise to further uncertainty in their application to particular circumstances. An added problem is the lack of clarity in the statute as to what level of scienter, if any, is required for a violation and what causal connection must be shown between the violation and any claimed loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These concerns encourage us to leave to the informed judgment of the district court the decision whether the award of double damages is just in the particular circumstances. Imagine, for example, that Owens had in fact performed services and properly billed for the $50,000, but in a retrospective evaluation the payment was found by a close margin to be an \"unreasonable\" operating expense of the project; or suppose that payment of a plausible bill was authorized by Cofield in good faith but the documentation was later found not quite sufficient. Recovery of loss and costs is one thing; a double damages penalty is quite another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Double damages for the government on a deterrence rationale make sense primarily where the defendant is guilty of substantial or repeated fault. Cf. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v. Pepsico, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198206\"><a href=\"/opinion/198206/ocean-spray-v-pepsico-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 62 n.3 (1st Cir. 1998) (discussing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A). There is obviously a spectrum, with fraudulent intent or recklessness at one end and a lost record or close-call judgments at the other. The district court may have felt that the defendants, after many years of service, were no worse than careless in the transactions in question. If so, we would regard this as an adequate basis for the court to exercise its discretion to deny double damages--although we do not suggest that seriously negligent acts could never justify double damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we think that the government is entitled, under the law as we have clarified it, to an opportunity to persuade the district court that the conduct of the defendants reflects sufficient fault to warrant double damages despite the defendants' past services. The district court is entitled to limit the inquiry: double damages is a remedial measure and not the occasion for a second trial. Relatedly, defendants can dispute the award of attorney's fees on new grounds if they choose, but at present no basis for refusing to impose them is apparent to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed as to the recovery by the government of $63,870.50 plus interest from the defendants. Insofar as it denied double damages and costs including attorney's fees, the judgment is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  In addition to its statutory claim, the United States made claims of conversion, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against the defendants. The district court did not pass on the merits of these common law claims, treating them as superseded by the judgment in favor of the government on the statutory claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Since there is no indication that Owens was responsible for the project books and records, Owens's liability for the $50,000 rests more securely on the district court's finding that he had already been compensated for his work on the litigation. As for the $13,870.50, the district court did not rest on a lack of records but rather on the conclusion that Cofield approved, and Owens received, payment for inappropriate expenditures.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
