We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            On December 14, 1994, Clotilde Diaz Sustache had a\n\npacemaker surgically implanted at the Hospital Bella Vista in\n\nMayaguez,    Puerto    Rico.     The    pacemaker     was   manufactured    by\n\nIntermedics.      After this pacemaker failed, a second Intermedics\n\npacemaker was implanted.          On August 18, 1995, following the\n\nfailure of the second pacemaker, Diaz Sustache died.\n\n            On January 12, 1996, appellants filed a complaint\n\nagainst Intermedics and others in the Superior Court of Puerto\n\nRico.     Appellants sought damages from Intermedics pursuant to\n\nArticle    1802   of   the   Puerto    Rico   Civil   Code,   alleging     that\n\n\"manufacturing defects, design defects and/or insufficiency in\n\nthe warnings of the pacemakers and/or electrodes implanted in\n\nthe deceased were the proximate and immediate cause of her\n\ndeath.\"    On August 8, 1997, the Superior Court entered partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Intermedics on the ground that the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fMedical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act,\n\n21 U.S.C. § 360c et seq., preempted appellants' claims.1\n\n                 Appellants did not appeal from the superior court's\n\norder of judgment.          Rather, they filed another complaint against\n\nIntermedics and others, this time in the United States District\n\nCourt      for    the   District    of    Puerto     Rico.         There,   appellants\n\nreiterated their claim that Intermedics acted negligently under\n\nArticle 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code; they also alleged\n\nthat       Intermedics      failed       to    comply    with        Food    and    Drug\n\nAdministration           regulations          with   regard    to    the    pacemaker.\n\nIntermedics         moved   for    summary      judgment      on    the    ground   that\n\nappellants' claims had already been adjudicated by the Superior\n\nCourt of Puerto Rico and therefore were precluded.                         The district\n\ncourt allowed Intermedics' motion for summary judgment on the\n\n\n       1\n     The superior court based its determination on 21 U.S.C.\n§ 360k(a), which provides:\n\n       Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section,\n       no State or political subdivision of a State may\n       establish or continue in effect with respect to a\n       device intended for human use any requirement–\n\n       (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any\n       requirement applicable under this chapter to the\n       device, and\n\n       (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of\n       the device or to any other matter included in a\n       requirement applicable to the device under this\n       chapter.\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fgrounds of \"res judicata and/or collateral estoppel.\"                  Muniz\n\nCortes v.    Intermedics, Inc., 63 F. Supp.2d 160, 165 (D.P.R.\n\n1999).\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Appellants contend that the district court erred in\n\ndetermining that preclusion barred their complaint.              We review\n\na summary judgment de novo, viewing the record in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether there\n\nexists a genuine issue of material fact.          See Sheehy v. Town of\n\nPlymouth, 191 F.3d 15, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            Federal courts must give full faith and credit to final\n\njudgments    of   the   Commonwealth    of   Puerto   Rico   courts.     See\n\nBaez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio, 140 F.3d 24, 28 n.1 (1st\n\nCir.   1998);     see also 28 U.S.C. § 1738.           To determine the\n\npreclusive effect of such a judgment in federal court, we look\n\nto Puerto Rico law.       See 28 U.S.C. § 1738; Cruz v. Melecio, 204\n\nF.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).           The Puerto Rico Civil Code sets\n\nforth the operation of the doctrine of preclusion:\n\n            In order that the presumption of the res\n            judicata may be valid in another suit, it is\n            necessary that, between the case decided by\n            the sentence and that in which the same is\n            invoked, there be the most perfect identity\n            between the things, causes, and persons of\n            the litigants, and their capacity as such.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3343.               Although this provision speaks\n\nof \"res judicata,\" it additionally permits issue preclusion or\n\ncollateral        estoppel.         See    Baez-Cruz,       140        F.3d    at     29.\n\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that when\n\nan issue \"essential to the prior judgment is actually litigated\n\nand determined by a valid and final judgment, the determination\n\nis   conclusive      in   subsequent       litigation     among        the    parties.\"\n\nFelix Davis v. Vieques Air Link, 892 F.2d 1122, 1124-25 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (citing Pereira v. Hernandez, 83 P.R.R. 156, 161\n\n(1961)).\n\n             Appellants contend that res judicata does not apply\n\nbecause the superior court's preemption ruling deprived that\n\ncourt   of   subject      matter     jurisdiction.         It     is    true    that    a\n\ndismissal     for    lack     of    subject     matter    jurisdiction          is    not\n\nconsidered to be \"on the merits,\" and therefore is without res\n\njudicata     effect.        See    Northeast     Erectors    Ass'n       of    BTEA    v.\n\nSecretary of Labor, Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 62 F.3d\n\n37, 44 (1st Cir. 1995); 18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller\n\n& Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 4436 (1981)).\n\n             We    have   some     doubt   about    the    proposition          that    a\n\ndismissal on preemption grounds is not merits-based.                           But even\n\nassuming arguendo that res judicata does not bar the federal\n\ndistrict     court     from       adjudicating     appellants'          claims,       the\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fdoctrine     of    collateral     estoppel     prevents   the    court      from\n\nrehearing the       issue of preemption.2         Dismissal for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction precludes relitigation of the issues\n\ndetermined    in    ruling   on   the    jurisdictional   question.          See\n\nWright, Miller & Cooper, supra; cf. Railway Labor Executives'\n\nAss'n v. Guilford Transp. Indus., Inc., 989 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)   (determination       of   lack    of   jurisdiction     was   \"on    the\n\nmerits\"); Walsh v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO,\n\n630 F.2d 864, 870 (1st Cir. 1980) (same).             Here, to the extent\n\nthat the superior court determined that it had no jurisdiction\n\nover the matter, it was on the ground that appellants’ \"causes\n\nof action for defects in manufacture, design or inadequate\n\nwarning\" were preempted by the Medical Device Amendments.3 Under\n\nthis ruling, the Amendments would preempt appellants' claims in\n\n\n\n\n    2As noted supra, the district court's opinion rested on the\ndual grounds of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel. See\nMuniz Cortes, 63 F. Supp.2d at 165.\n    3Intermedics concedes that the superior court may have erred\nin holding that the claims were preempted in light of recent\nSupreme Court law. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470\n(1996).    Substantive error, however, does not deprive a\nprocedurally adequate judicial proceeding of preclusive effect.\nSee Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 398\n(1981) (\"[a] judgment merely voidable because based upon an\nerroneous view of the law is not open to collateral attack, but\ncan be corrected only by a direct review and not by bringing\nanother action\"); Cruz, 204 F.3d at 19 (citing Bolker v.\nSuperior Court, 82 P.R.R. 785, 799-800 (1961)).\n\n                                        -7-\n\ffederal      court    as    well   as   in    the    superior    court.        Hence,\n\nappellants may not relitigate the issue of preemption.\n\n             Appellants also take issue with the district court's\n\nconclusion that there existed \"perfect identity between the\n\nthings, causes, and persons of the litigants\" as required under\n\nthe Puerto Rico law of preclusion.                  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,\n\n§ 3343.   They point out that the complaint filed in the superior\n\ncourt was limited to commonwealth law, while the complaint filed\n\nin federal district court alleged that the pacemaker failed to\n\ncomply with FDA regulations.             Therefore, appellants argue, their\n\n\"causes\" were not identical with the meaning of § 3343.\n\n             The     fact   that   appellants        advanced    different      legal\n\ntheories does not undermine the identity of causes, because the\n\ncommonwealth law claim presented in the superior court arose\n\nfrom   the    pacemaker        failure,      just    as   did   the   claims    later\n\npresented     to     the    federal     district      court.      See   Boateng    v.\n\nInterAmerican Univ., Inc., 210 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir. 2000) (no\n\nright to bring separate and successive suits on different legal\n\ntheories arising out of a single nucleus of operative facts)\n\n(applying Puerto Rico law).             A claim is precluded not only if it\n\nwas actually raised in a previous suit, but if it could have\n\nbeen raised.         See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f            Finally, appellants contend that they are exempt from\n\nthe   usual    rules    of    preemption       on    the    ground   that   \"its\n\napplication would defeat the ends of justice, especially in the\n\npresence of public policy considerations.\"                  Baez-Cruz, 140 F.3d\n\nat 30 (citing Pagan Hernandez v. University of Puerto Rico, 107\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 795, 807 (1978)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     We see nothing in the facts of this case to support\n\nsuch an exception.       Appellants freely chose to litigate in the\n\nsuperior court and then to forego appeal; \"public policy does\n\nnot require giving them a chance to revisit [those] choice[s].\"\n\nId.\n\n            Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment to Intermedics.             Because we decide this case on\n\npreclusion    grounds,       we   do   not   reach    the    issue   of   whether\n\nappellants have a private right of action against Intermedics\n\nunder the Medical Device Amendments, 21 U.S.C. § 360c et seq.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",
