Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Boudin, Stahl, and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges\n\n\n\n     Brooks R.

Romano, with whom Romano & Spinella, was on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           June 26, 2000\n\f\f           STAHL, Circuit Judge.         Defendant-appellant Urohealth\n\nSystems, Inc. (“Urohealth”) appeals the district court's order,\n\nentered    pursuant   to    Fed.   R.    Civ.   P.   41(a)(2),   granting\n\nplaintiff-appellee John Doe's motion to dismiss voluntarily and\n\nwithout prejudice this diversity suit.          We reverse and remand.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           In the late summer of 1995, John Doe sought treatment\n\nfor impotence and consulted a urologist, Dr. Jacques Susset, who\n\nrecommended the surgical implantation of a penile prosthesis.\n\nDoe met with another urologist, Dr. Alan Podis, who suggested\n\nthat implantation of the Dura-II semirigid penile prosthesis\n\nwould be     appropriate.   Doe agreed with the recommendation and\n\nthe Dura-II was implanted by Podis in February 1996.\n\n           The Dura-II originally was designed and manufactured\n\nby the Dacomed Corporation (“Dacomed”), which Urohealth acquired\n\nas a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995.           After the acquisition,\n\nUrohealth manufactured and sold the Dura-II to physicians and\n\nhospitals.     It is unclear whether the actual Dura-II installed\n\nin Doe was manufactured before or after Urohealth's acquisition\n\nof Dacomed, but Urohealth has eschewed this as a defense.\n\n           About two months after the surgery, Doe began to have\n\nproblems with the device. On August 6, 1997, plaintiff filed in\n\nfederal district court a complaint against Urohealth for strict\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fliability, negligence, and breach of warranty.                         His complaint\n\nalleged that the Dura-II implant caused him pain, made noises,\n\nand would not operate properly.\n\n          Although the parties commenced discovery before the\n\nestablishment     of    a   discovery        schedule,    the      district        court\n\neventually set May 1, 1998, as the last day for Doe to make\n\nexpert disclosures; scheduled discovery to close on June 15,\n\n1998; and set June 25, 1998, as the last day for the parties to\n\nfile   dispositive      motions.        At    the    onset    of       the   discovery\n\nprocess, Doe requested many documents, and Urohealth propounded\n\ninterrogatories        about    Doe's    experts.            In        response,     Doe\n\nidentified four experts who would testify.                         When Urohealth\n\ndeposed   them,   none      proffered    an     opinion      about       whether     the\n\nDura-II was defective or unreasonably dangerous.                         In fact, it\n\nturned out that none of them had agreed to serve as an                          expert\n\non Doe's behalf.\n\n          On May 4, Doe identified three new experts, but failed\n\nto disclose their opinions or the grounds on which they would\n\nbase their opinions.           On June 23, 1998, Urohealth moved for\n\nsummary judgment.       That same day, the magistrate judge assigned\n\nto   supervise    discovery     extended       the    close       of    discovery     to\n\nSeptember 1, 1998, and adjusted all other deadlines accordingly.\n\nUrohealth objected to this extension of the discovery deadline,\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fbut on July 29, 1998, the district court affirmed that order.\n\nIn doing so, the court reprimanded Doe for his dilatory conduct\n\nwhile attempting to secure an expert.            Eventually, on August 28,\n\n1998, Doe furnished the resume and report of his newly named\n\nexpert, Edward N. Reese, Ph.D., which prompted Urohealth to\n\nsupplement its pending summary judgment motion in order to\n\naddress Reese and his opinion.\n\n           Meantime, at 5:45 p.m. on August 27, 1998, the day\n\nbefore naming Reese as his expert, Doe noticed depositions,\n\nwhich were to take place in Providence, Rhode Island, of several\n\nof   Urohealth's     California-based       employees.      The    deposition\n\nnotices prescribed September 1, 1998, as the date for these\n\ndepositions.       In response, Urohealth sought and received a\n\nprotective      order   striking    the    deposition    notices,    and   the\n\ndistrict     court      reprimanded        Doe    for    his      “absolutely\n\ninappropriate” discovery request.                The next day, Doe filed\n\nsixty-five requests for production from Urohealth, prompting\n\nanother motion for a protective order.                  The district court\n\nreferred this matter to the magistrate judge, who granted the\n\nmotion and noted that “to wait until the very last minute to\n\nfile something like this is a total abuse of discovery.”\n\n           On    December   8,     1998,   the    magistrate   judge    heard\n\nargument regarding Urohealth's motion for summary judgment, and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftwo days later, ordered Urohealth to raise any objections it\n\nmight have to Reese's proposed testimony in a motion in limine.\n\nUrohealth so moved on January 11, 1999.               On January 26, 1999,\n\nDoe filed in Rhode Island Superior Court a complaint against\n\nDacomed, Podis, Miriam Hospital, and Imagyn Technologies, Inc.1\n\nDoe's   state   court   action   made    the   same    substantive   claims\n\nagainst Urohealth as did his federal action, but added Dacomed\n\nas a defendant as well.          Subsequently, Doe moved in federal\n\ncourt for dismissal without prejudice of his federal action,\n\npursuant to Rule 41(a)(2).        Urohealth objected on the grounds\n\nthat it would be prejudiced by a Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal, but\n\nthe district court granted Doe's motion on March 23, 1999.\n\nUrohealth appeals.\n\n\n\n\n    1Urohealth changed its name to “Imagyn Medical Technologies,\nInc.” in 1997. Doe inaccurately named it “Imagyn Technologies,\nInc.” in his state court complaint.     For simplicity, we will\ncontinue to refer to this company as Urohealth.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f                                      II.\n\n              Rule 41(a)(2) provides that “an action shall not be\n\ndismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the\n\ncourt and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems\n\nproper.   .    .    .   Unless   otherwise     specified   in   the    order,   a\n\ndismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.”                       Its\n\npurpose is to permit the plaintiff, with approval of the court,\n\nsee Grover v. Eli Lilly & Co., 33 F.3d 716, 718 (6th Cir. 1994)\n\n(noting that judicial approval is required “to protect the\n\nnonmovant from unfair treatment”), voluntarily to dismiss an\n\naction as long as “no other party will be prejudiced,” Puerto\n\nRico Maritime Shipping Auth. v. Leith, 668 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir.\n\n1981) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                      The\n\ndistrict court is responsible under the rule for exercising its\n\ndiscretion to ensure that such prejudice will not occur.                    See\n\nAlamance Indus., Inc. v. Filene's, 291 F.2d 142, 146 (1st Cir.\n\n1961).\n\n              In deciding whether to grant a Rule 41(a)(2) motion,\n\ncourts typically look to “the defendant's effort and expense of\n\npreparation for trial, excessive delay and lack of diligence on\n\nthe   part     of       the   plaintiff   in     prosecuting     the    action,\n\ninsufficient explanation for the need to take a dismissal, and\n\nthe fact that a motion for summary judgment has been filed by\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthe defendant.”    Pace v. Southern Express Co., 409 F.2d 331, 334\n\n(7th Cir. 1969); accord Grover, 33 F.3d at 718.               But, courts\n\nneed not analyze each factor or limit their consideration to\n\nthese factors.     See Tyco Labs., Inc. v. Koppers Co., 627 F.2d\n\n54, 56 (7th Cir. 1980) (“The enumeration of the factors to be\n\nconsidered in Pace is not equivalent to a mandate that each and\n\nevery such factor be resolved in favor of the moving party\n\nbefore dismissal is appropriate.        It is rather simply a guide\n\nfor the trial judge, in whom the discretion ultimately rests.”);\n\nsee also Kern v. TXO Prod. Corp., 738 F.2d 968, 971 (8th Cir.\n\n1984) (“The very concept of discretion presupposes a zone of\n\nchoice within which the trial courts may go either way [in\n\ngranting or denying the motion].”).\n\n           We review for abuse of discretion the district court's\n\ndecision to grant a Rule 41(a)(2) motion.                See Puerto Rico\n\nMaritime, 668 F.2d at 49; Alamance, 291 F.2d at 146.                 “[A]n\n\nabuse of discretion is found only where the defendant would\n\nsuffer   'plain   legal   prejudice'   as   a   result   of   a   dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice, as opposed to facing the mere prospect of a\n\nsecond lawsuit.”     Grover, 33 F.3d at 718 (quoting Cone v. West\n\nVirginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 217 (1947)).\n\n           In its order granting Doe's motion, the district court\n\nfirst referenced the four factors enumerated in Pace.             The court\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fbegan by stating that Urohealth was “probably home on three” of\n\nthe Pace factors.2       By the time Doe filed his motion to dismiss,\n\nUrohealth had invested considerable resources, financial and\n\notherwise, in defending Doe's federal action.                 Urohealth had\n\nproduced    numerous     documents    and   deposed      several     of   Doe's\n\npurported     experts.      And,     Urohealth     had   to   file    several\n\nprotective orders because of Doe's dilatory discovery tactics.3\n\nDoe also was less than diligent in his prosecution of this case.\n\nAs Urohealth notes in its brief, Doe “conducted no discovery,\n\n[and did nothing] to advance his case for that matter, from\n\nOctober 8, 1997 to August 27, 1998.”             The district court twice\n\nreprimanded Doe for his failure to meet discovery deadlines and\n\nfor his discovery abuses.       Finally, Urohealth had filed a motion\n\nfor summary judgment, which was pending when the court dismissed\n\nthe action.\n\n\n\n\n    2We agree with the district court's initial assessment of\nthe Pace factors, notwithstanding its less specific comments\nlater in its opinion.\n    3 The district court suggested that because the discovery\nfrom the federal case would apply in the state case, the fact\nthat Urohealth had considerable discovery expenditures did not\nweigh against granting Doe's motion.     We disagree.   Much of\nUrohealth's effort and expense, such as its efforts to respond\nto Doe's dilatory and sometimes abusive discovery practices and\nto weed through Doe's experts, will not benefit it in the state\ncase because those issues will not resurface there.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f              The district court then indicated that, even though the\n\nPace    factors       favored    Urohealth,        it   did   not    believe     that\n\nUrohealth would “truly suffer legal prejudice” if it dismissed\n\nthe federal lawsuit without prejudice because Urohealth still\n\nwould have to litigate these claims on behalf of Dacomed in the\n\nstate suit.         Urohealth argued that if the district court denied\n\nDoe's    Rule       41(a)(2)    motion     and    granted     Urohealth       summary\n\njudgment, the judgment would have preclusive effect for both\n\nUrohealth and Dacomed; thus, Urohealth could avoid relitigating\n\nthe    case    in    state     court.      The     district    court    disagreed,\n\nreasoning       that    even     if     summary     judgment    would        preclude\n\nrelitigation for Urohealth in the state case, Dacomed, which “is\n\na separate entity, albeit wholly owned by Urohealth,” would not\n\nbe protected by res judicata because it was not a defendant in\n\nthe federal case.\n\n              We think the district court erred in its assumption\n\nthat Dacomed would not be entitled to assert a res judicata\n\ndefense   if     Urohealth      had     garnered    judgment    in     the   federal\n\naction. An evaluation of the res judicata effects normally would\n\nnot be part of the Rule 41(a)(2) analysis, but this case is\n\nunusual because of the relationship of the two entities.                       To the\n\nextent the district court permissibly considered the potential\n\nprejudice stemming from Urohealth's having to litigate on behalf\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fof Dacomed in the state case, 4 we find an abuse of discretion\n\nbecause   the   court   erred   in   finding     no   privity   between   the\n\ncompanies.\n\n           As a general matter, res judicata bars “parties to an\n\noriginal action and those in privity with such parties” from\n\nrelitigating “all the issues that were tried or might have been\n\ntried in the original suit.”                Providence Teachers Union v.\n\nMcGovern, 319 A.2d 358, 361 (R.I. 1974).5               Because there is\n\nlittle doubt that judgment for Urohealth in the federal suit\n\nwould have had preclusive effect with regard to Doe's claims\n\nagainst Urohealth in the state case, see Eigabri v. Lekas, 681\n\n\n\n\n    4We do not decide today whether it was proper for the\ndistrict court to consider in its Rule 41(a)(2) determination\nthe effect dismissal without prejudice for Urohealth in the\nfederal case would have on Dacomed in the state case. Because\nwe conclude that the district court's conclusion about whether\nDacomed could use res judicata as a defense in the state case\nwas erroneous, we simply will assume without deciding that the\ndistrict court properly considered the effects on Dacomed.\n    5 As a general rule, \"[f]ederal law determines the effects\nunder the rules of res judicata of a judgment of a federal\ncourt.\" 2 Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 87. Some courts\nhave held that the federal law of preclusion should incorporate\nstate law with respect to questions of privity--the central\nissue here. See, e.g., Lowell Staats Mining Co. v. Philadelphia\nElec. Co., 878 F.2d 1271, 1274 (10th Cir. 1989); see also, e.g.,\n2 Restatement, supra, §87 cmt. b; 18 Charles Alan Wright et al.,\nFederal Practice & Procedure § 4472, at 737-78 & n.37.5 (1981 &\nSupp. 2000).    We need not decide this question, as we are\nconfident that the privity analysis here would be the same\nwhether governed by state or federal law.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fA.2d 271, 280 (R.I. 1996), the appropriateness of the dismissal\n\nturns on whether Dacomed and Urohealth are in privity.\n\n            We believe that Urohealth and Dacomed are in privity\n\nfor several reasons. “Under the concept of privity, a non-party\n\nmay be bound by a prior judgment if that party substantially\n\ncontrolled    or   [is]    represented     by   a   party   to   the   original\n\naction.”     Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676,\n\n680 (R.I. 1999).      Someone in privity with a party may also claim\n\nthe preclusive benefit of the prior action.             See, e.g., Pan Am.\n\nMatch Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 454 F.2d 871, 874 (1st Cir.\n\n1972).     In this case, the parent and subsidiary are in privity\n\nbecause Urohealth always has taken legal responsibility for the\n\nproduct and Dacomed's actions and stands ready to defend Dacomed\n\nin the state case.        Moreover, in determining whether two parties\n\nare in privity, courts often look to the commonality of their\n\ninterest in the matter.        See Commercial Union Ins., 727 A.2d at\n\n680.     In this case, Urohealth's and Dacomed's interests are\n\nidentical.     See Aunyx Corp. v. Cannon U.S.A., Inc., 978 F.2d 3,\n\n7 (1st Cir. 1992) (“The identity of parties requirement was also\n\nsatisfied, even though ABM was not a party to the [prior]\n\nproceedings.       [ABM's sister company] had adequate interest in\n\nlitigating ABM's interests before the [prior court].”); cf. id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fat 7-8 (noting that companies who had represented themselves as\n\nalter egos are in privity).\n\n            A further factor supporting determination of privity\n\nhere   is   that   the   companies   are   parent   and   wholly   owned\n\nsubsidiary.    This factor has been stressed in a number of cases,\n\nincluding a decision of our own addressed to Rhode Island Law.\n\nSee, e.g., Hart Steel Co. v. Railroad Supply Co., 244 U.S. 294,\n\n298 (1917); Acton Co. v. Bachman Foods, Inc., 668 F.2d 76, 78\n\n(1st Cir. 1982); Pan Am. Match, 454 F.2d at 874; Capraro v.\n\nTilcon Gammino, Inc., 751 F.2d 56, 57 (1st Cir. 1985) (Rhode\n\nIsland law).       We do not suggest that the parent-subsidiary\n\nrelationship automatically establishes privity, but given the\n\nrelationship of the companies in this case coupled with their\n\njoint involvement with the product in question, we have little\n\ndoubt that a Rhode Island court would treat a merits judgment in\n\nfavor of Urohealth as resolving an identical claim against its\n\nwholly owned subsidiary.\n\n            Accordingly, we disagree with the district court's\n\nlegal conclusion that the lawsuit against the subsidiary could\n\nbe maintained in state court if the motion for summary judgment\n\nwere granted in favor of the parent on the merits.          We, in some\n\nmeasure, are making a prediction because we do not know how a\n\nRhode Island court would review the matter.          An assessment of\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fthe legal rules that would be applied by a Rhode Island court,\n\nhowever, presents a clear-cut legal issue on which no special\n\ndeference is due to the district court.                      See Salve      Regina\n\nCollege v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 238-39 (1991).\n\n          Because the district court's main stated reason for\n\ndismissing without prejudice was based on a legal error, the\n\nmatter must be remanded for further proceedings.                       This result\n\ndoes not necessarily preclude the possibility that for some\n\nother reason the district court could dismiss the case without\n\nruling on the summary judgment motion, but given the record, it\n\nis somewhat difficult to discern what that reason might be.                      As\n\nmatters   now    stand,     the     defendant       has    made    a   significant\n\ninvestment of time and money in the case, a motion for summary\n\njudgment apparently is ripe for decision, and judgment in favor\n\nof   Urohealth    would     avoid    what     may    be    otherwise     years   of\n\nlitigation in state court against its subsidiary on an identical\n\nclaim.\n\n          While     the    reason     given    by    the    district     court   is\n\ninadequate, it is far from clear from the case law what reason\n\nadequately      would    justify     dismissal       at    the    present   stage.\n\nAlthough the courts talk about \"legal prejudice,\" the governing\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure lays down no specific test, see\n\nFed. R. Civ. P.         41(a)(2), and the precedents could be read as\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fsaying that everything depends on the particular circumstances\n\nand that a range of factors could be taken into account.

One can\n\nimagine a situation in which even though the plaintiff chose to\n\nbring the case in federal court, peculiarities such as very\n\ndifficult     issues    of   state   law,         for   example,   might     make\n\nresolution in the state court more appropriate, at least to the\n\nextent of permitting the plaintiff voluntarily to dismiss its\n\nfederal case and pursue a state remedy.                 Cf. Kern, 738 F.2d at\n\n971.   We do not say that this is such a case, but merely offer\n\nthat as an illustrative example.\n\n            At the same time, it is very difficult to imagine in\n\nthe circumstances of this case a no-prejudice dismissal at\n\nplaintiff's    behest    that   would       not    involve    payment   by    the\n\nplaintiff of the defendant's attorney's fees and other expenses\n\nof litigation in federal court to date.                 We do not suggest that\n\npayment of attorney's fees and costs automatically would justify\n\na dismissal.    But if there were other valid justifications for\n\ndismissal, payment of attorney's fees and other expenses might\n\nin some measure ameliorate the prejudice to the defendants of\n\nthe plaintiff's abortive federal court litigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f            On remand, the plaintiff is free to offer any other\n\nreasons it may have to justify a voluntarily dismissal, assuming\n\nit wishes to pursue its motion.

(\"Urohealth\") appeals the district court's order, entered pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2), granting plaintiff-appellee John Doe's motion to dismiss voluntarily and without prejudice this diversity suit. We reverse and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late summer of 1995, John Doe sought treatment for impotence and consulted a urologist, Dr. Jacques Susset, who recommended the surgical implantation of a penile prosthesis. Doe met with another urologist, Dr. Alan Podis, who suggested that implantation of the Dura-II semirigid penile prosthesis would be appropriate. Doe agreed with the recommendation and the Dura-II was implanted by Podis in February 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dura-II originally was designed and manufactured by the Dacomed Corporation (\"Dacomed\"), which Urohealth acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. After the acquisition, Urohealth manufactured and sold the Dura-II to physicians and hospitals. It is unclear whether the actual Dura-II installed in Doe was manufactured before or after Urohealth's acquisition of Dacomed, but Urohealth has eschewed this as a defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About two months after the surgery, Doe began to have problems with the device. On August 6, 1997, plaintiff filed in federal district court a complaint against Urohealth for strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty. His complaint alleged that the Dura-II implant caused him pain, made noises, and would not operate properly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties commenced discovery before the establishment of a discovery schedule, the district court eventually set May 1, 1998, as the last day for Doe to make expert disclosures; scheduled discovery to close on June 15, 1998; and set June 25, 1998, as the last day for the parties to file dispositive motions. At the onset of the discovery process, Doe requested many documents, and Urohealth propounded interrogatories about Doe's experts. In response, Doe identified four experts who would testify. When Urohealth deposed them, none proffered an opinion about whether the Dura-II was defective or unreasonably dangerous. In fact, it turned out that none of them had agreed to serve as an expert on Doe's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, Doe identified three new experts, but failed to disclose their opinions or the grounds on which they would base their opinions. On June 23, 1998, Urohealth moved for summary judgment. That same day, the magistrate judge assigned to supervise discovery extended the close of discovery to September 1, 1998, and adjusted all other deadlines accordingly. Urohealth objected to this extension of the discovery deadline, but on July 29, 1998, the district court affirmed that order. In doing so, the court reprimanded Doe for his dilatory conduct while attempting to secure an expert. Eventually, on August 28, 1998, Doe furnished the resume and report of his newly named expert, Edward N. Reese, Ph.D., which prompted Urohealth to supplement its pending summary judgment motion in order to address Reese and his opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meantime, at 5:45 p.m. on August 27, 1998, the day before naming Reese as his expert, Doe noticed depositions, which were to take place in Providence, Rhode Island, of several of Urohealth's California-based employees. The deposition notices prescribed September 1, 1998, as the date for these depositions. In response, Urohealth sought and received a protective order striking the deposition notices, and the district court reprimanded Doe for his \"absolutely inappropriate\" discovery request. The next day, Doe filed sixty-five requests for production from Urohealth, prompting another motion for a protective order. The district court referred this matter to the magistrate judge, who granted the motion and noted that \"to wait until the very last minute to file something like this is a total abuse of discovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 8, 1998, the magistrate judge heard argument regarding Urohealth's motion for summary judgment, and two days later, ordered Urohealth to raise any objections it might have to Reese's proposed testimony in a motion in limine. Urohealth so moved on January 11, 1999. On January 26, 1999, Doe filed in Rhode Island Superior Court a complaint against Dacomed, Podis, Miriam Hospital, and Imagyn Technologies, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Doe's state court action made the same substantive claims against Urohealth as did his federal action, but added Dacomed as a defendant as well. Subsequently, Doe moved in federal court for dismissal without prejudice of his federal action, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2). Urohealth objected on the grounds that it would be prejudiced by a Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal, but the district court granted Doe's motion on March 23, 1999. Urohealth appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 41(a)(2) provides that \"an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.... Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.\" Its purpose is to permit the plaintiff, with approval of the court, see Grover v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 33 F.3d 716, 718 (6th Cir. 1994) (noting that judicial approval is required \"to protect the non-movant from unfair treatment\"), voluntarily to dismiss an action as long as \"no other party will be prejudiced,\" Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth. v. Leith, 668 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1981) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court is responsible under the rule for exercising its discretion to ensure that such prejudice will not occur. See Alamance Indus., Inc. v. Filene's, 291 F.2d 142, 146 (1st Cir. 1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding whether to grant a Rule 41(a)(2) motion, courts typically look to \"the defendant's effort and expense of preparation for trial, excessive delay and lack of diligence on the part of the plaintiff in prosecuting the action, insufficient explanation for the need to take a dismissal, and the fact that a motion for summary judgment has been filed by the defendant.\" Pace v. Southern Express Co., 409 F.2d 331, 334 (7th Cir. 1969); accord Grover, 33 F.3d at 718. But, courts need not analyze each factor or limit their consideration to these factors. See Tyco Labs., Inc. v. Koppers Co., 627 F.2d 54, 56 (7th Cir. 1980) (\"The enumeration of the factors to be considered in Pace is not equivalent to a mandate that each and every such factor be resolved in favor of the moving party before dismissal is appropriate. It is rather simply a guide for the trial judge, in whom the discretion ultimately rests.\"); see also Kern v. TXO Prod. Corp., 738 F.2d 968, 971 (8th Cir. 1984) (\"The very concept of discretion presupposes a zone of choice within which the trial courts may go either way [in granting or denying the motion].\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court's decision to grant a Rule 41(a)(2) motion. See Puerto Rico Maritime, 668 F.2d at 49; Alamance, 291 F.2d at 146. \"[A]n abuse of discretion is found only where the defendant would suffer'plain legal prejudice' as a result of a dismissal without prejudice, as opposed to facing the mere prospect of a second lawsuit.\" Grover, 33 F.3d at 718 (quoting Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 217 (1947)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order granting Doe's motion, the district court first referenced the four factors enumerated in Pace. The court began by stating that Urohealth was \"probably home on three\" of the Pace factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> By the time Doe filed his motion to dismiss, Urohealth had invested considerable resources, financial and otherwise, in defending Doe's federal action. Urohealth had produced numerous documents and deposed several of Doe's purported experts. And, Urohealth had to file several protective orders because of Doe's dilatory discovery tactics.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Doe also was less than diligent in his prosecution of this case. As Urohealth notes in its brief, Doe \"conducted no discovery, [and did nothing] to advance his case for that matter, from October 8, 1997 to August 27, 1998.\" The district court twice reprimanded Doe for his failure to meet discovery deadlines and for his discovery abuses. Finally, Urohealth had filed a motion for summary judgment, which was pending when the court dismissed the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then indicated that, even though the Pace factors favored Urohealth, it did not believe that Urohealth would \"truly suffer legal prejudice\" if it dismissed the federal lawsuit without prejudice because Urohealth still would have to litigate these claims on behalf of Dacomed in the state suit. Urohealth argued that if the district court denied Doe's Rule 41(a)(2) motion and granted Urohealth summary judgment, the judgment would have preclusive effect for both Urohealth and Dacomed; thus, Urohealth could avoid relitigating the case in state court. The district court disagreed, reasoning that even if summary judgment would preclude relitigation for Urohealth in the state case, Dacomed, which \"is a separate entity, albeit wholly owned by Urohealth,\" would not be protected by res judicata because it was not a defendant in the federal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the district court erred in its assumption that Dacomed would not be entitled to assert a res judicata defense if Urohealth had garnered judgment in the federal action. An evaluation of the res judicata effects normally would not be part of the Rule 41(a)(2) analysis, but this case is unusual because of the relationship of the two entities. To the extent the district court permissibly considered the potential prejudice stemming from Urohealth's having to litigate on behalf of Dacomed in the state case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we find an abuse of discretion because the court erred in finding no privity between the companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, res judicata bars \"parties to an original action and those in privity with such parties\" from relitigating \"all the issues that were tried or might have been tried in the original suit.\" Providence Teachers Union v. McGovern, 319 A.2d 358, 361 (R.I. 1974).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Because there is little doubt that judgment for Urohealth in the federal suit would have had preclusive effect with regard to Doe's claims against Urohealth in the state case, see Eigabri v. Lekas, 681 A.2d 271, 280 (R.I. 1996), the appropriateness of the dismissal turns on whether Dacomed and Urohealth are in privity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Urohealth and Dacomed are in privity for several reasons. \"Under the concept of privity, a non-party may be bound by a prior judgment if that party substantially controlled or [is] represented by a party to the original action.\" Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676, 680 (R.I. 1999). Someone in privity with a party may also claim the preclusive benefit of the prior action. See, e.g., Pan Am. Match Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 454 F.2d 871, 874 (1st Cir. 1972). In this case, the parent and subsidiary are in privity because Urohealth always has taken legal responsibility for the product and Dacomed's actions and stands ready to defend Dacomed in the state case. Moreover, in determining whether two parties are in privity, courts often look to the commonality of their interest in the matter. See Commercial Union Ins., 727 A.2d at 680. In this case, Urohealth's and Dacomed's interests are identical. See Aunyx Corp. v. Cannon U.S.A., Inc., 978 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"The identity of parties requirement was also satisfied, even though ABM was not a party to the [prior] proceedings. [ABM's sister company] had adequate interest in litigating ABM's interests before the [prior court].\"); cf. id. at 7-8 (noting that companies who had represented themselves as alter egos are in privity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further factor supporting determination of privity here is that the companies are parent and wholly owned subsidiary. This factor has been stressed in a number of cases, including a decision of our own addressed to Rhode Island Law. See, e.g., Hart Steel Co. v. Railroad Supply Co., 244 U.S. 294, 298 (1917); Acton Co. v. Bachman Foods, Inc., 668 F.2d 76, 78 (1st Cir. 1982); Pan Am. Match, 454 F.2d at 874; Capraro v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc., 751 F.2d 56, 57 (1st Cir. 1985) (Rhode Island law). We do not suggest that the parent-subsidiary relationship automatically establishes privity, but given the relationship of the companies in this case coupled with their joint involvement with the product in question, we have little doubt that a Rhode Island court would treat a merits judgment in favor of Urohealth as resolving an identical claim against its wholly owned subsidiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we disagree with the district court's legal conclusion that the lawsuit against the subsidiary could be maintained in state court if the motion for summary judgment were granted in favor of the parent on the merits. We, in some measure, are making a prediction because we do not know how a Rhode Island court would review the matter. An assessment of the legal rules that would be applied by a Rhode Island court, however, presents a clear-cut legal issue on which no special deference is due to the district court. See Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 238-39 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's main stated reason for dismissing without prejudice was based on a legal error, the matter must be remanded for further proceedings. This result does not necessarily preclude the possibility that for some other reason the district court could dismiss the case without ruling on the summary judgment motion, but given the record, it is somewhat difficult to discern what that reason might be. As matters now stand, the defendant has made a significant investment of time and money in the case, a motion for summary judgment apparently is ripe for decision, and judgment in favor of Urohealth would avoid what may be otherwise years of litigation in state court against its subsidiary on an identical claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the reason given by the district court is inadequate, it is far from clear from the case law what reason adequately would justify dismissal at the present stage. Although the courts talk about \"legal prejudice,\" the governing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure lays down no specific test, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2), and the precedents could be read as saying that everything depends on the particular circumstances and that a range of factors could be taken into account. See generally 9 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2364, at 290-96 (2d ed. 1995). One can imagine a situation in which even though the plaintiff chose to bring the case in federal court, peculiarities such as very difficult issues of state law, for example, might make resolution in the state court more appropriate, at least to the extent of permitting the plaintiff voluntarily to dismiss its federal case and pursue a state remedy. Cf. Kern, 738 F.2d at 971. We do not say that this is such a case, but merely offer that as an illustrative example.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, it is very difficult to imagine in the circumstances of this case a no-prejudice dismissal at plaintiff's behest that would not involve payment by the plaintiff of the defendant's attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation in federal court to date. We do not suggest that payment of attorney's fees and costs automatically would justify a dismissal. But if there were other valid justifications for dismissal, payment of attorney's fees and other expenses might in some measure ameliorate the prejudice to the defendants of the plaintiff's abortive federal court litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the plaintiff is free to offer any other reasons it may have to justify a voluntarily dismissal, assuming it wishes to pursue its motion. We appreciate that any decision by the district court on such motion, if unaffected by error on a matter of law, is entitled to considerable deference. We do think that a plaintiff cannot conduct a serious product liability claim in a federal court, provoke over a year's worth of discovery and motion practice, allow the case to reach the stage at which the defendant filed a full-scale summary judgment motion, and then when matters seemed to be going badly for plaintiff simply dismiss its case and begin all over again in a state court in what is essentially an identical proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment dismissing the plaintiff's complaint without prejudice is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

We disagree. Much of Urohealth's effort and expense, such as its efforts to respond to Doe's dilatory and sometimes abusive discovery practices and to weed through Doe's experts, will not benefit it in the state case because those issues will not resurface there.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  We do not decide today whether it was proper for the district court to consider in its Rule 41(a)(2) determination the effect dismissal without prejudice for Urohealth in the federal case would have on Dacomed in the state case.

We need not decide this question, as we are confident that the privity analysis here would be the same whether governed by state or federal law.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(\"Urohealth\") appeals the district court's order, entered pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2), granting plaintiff-appellee John Doe's motion to dismiss voluntarily and without prejudice this diversity suit. We reverse and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late summer of 1995, John Doe sought treatment for impotence and consulted a urologist, Dr. Jacques Susset, who recommended the surgical implantation of a penile prosthesis. Doe met with another urologist, Dr. Alan Podis, who suggested that implantation of the Dura-II semirigid penile prosthesis would be appropriate. Doe agreed with the recommendation and the Dura-II was implanted by Podis in February 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dura-II originally was designed and manufactured by the Dacomed Corporation (\"Dacomed\"), which Urohealth acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. After the acquisition, Urohealth manufactured and sold the Dura-II to physicians and hospitals. It is unclear whether the actual Dura-II installed in Doe was manufactured before or after Urohealth's acquisition of Dacomed, but Urohealth has eschewed this as a defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About two months after the surgery, Doe began to have problems with the device. On August 6, 1997, plaintiff filed in federal district court a complaint against Urohealth for strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty. His complaint alleged that the Dura-II implant caused him pain, made noises, and would not operate properly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties commenced discovery before the establishment of a discovery schedule, the district court eventually set May 1, 1998, as the last day for Doe to make expert disclosures; scheduled discovery to close on June 15, 1998; and set June 25, 1998, as the last day for the parties to file dispositive motions. At the onset of the discovery process, Doe requested many documents, and Urohealth propounded interrogatories about Doe's experts. In response, Doe identified four experts who would testify. When Urohealth deposed them, none proffered an opinion about whether the Dura-II was defective or unreasonably dangerous. In fact, it turned out that none of them had agreed to serve as an expert on Doe's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, Doe identified three new experts, but failed to disclose their opinions or the grounds on which they would base their opinions. On June 23, 1998, Urohealth moved for summary judgment. That same day, the magistrate judge assigned to supervise discovery extended the close of discovery to September 1, 1998, and adjusted all other deadlines accordingly. Urohealth objected to this extension of the discovery deadline, but on July 29, 1998, the district court affirmed that order. In doing so, the court reprimanded Doe for his dilatory conduct while attempting to secure an expert. Eventually, on August 28, 1998, Doe furnished the resume and report of his newly named expert, Edward N. Reese, Ph.D., which prompted Urohealth to supplement its pending summary judgment motion in order to address Reese and his opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meantime, at 5:45 p.m. on August 27, 1998, the day before naming Reese as his expert, Doe noticed depositions, which were to take place in Providence, Rhode Island, of several of Urohealth's California-based employees. The deposition notices prescribed September 1, 1998, as the date for these depositions. In response, Urohealth sought and received a protective order striking the deposition notices, and the district court reprimanded Doe for his \"absolutely inappropriate\" discovery request. The next day, Doe filed sixty-five requests for production from Urohealth, prompting another motion for a protective order. The district court referred this matter to the magistrate judge, who granted the motion and noted that \"to wait until the very last minute to file something like this is a total abuse of discovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 8, 1998, the magistrate judge heard argument regarding Urohealth's motion for summary judgment, and two days later, ordered Urohealth to raise any objections it might have to Reese's proposed testimony in a motion in limine. Urohealth so moved on January 11, 1999. On January 26, 1999, Doe filed in Rhode Island Superior Court a complaint against Dacomed, Podis, Miriam Hospital, and Imagyn Technologies, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Doe's state court action made the same substantive claims against Urohealth as did his federal action, but added Dacomed as a defendant as well. Subsequently, Doe moved in federal court for dismissal without prejudice of his federal action, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2). Urohealth objected on the grounds that it would be prejudiced by a Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal, but the district court granted Doe's motion on March 23, 1999. Urohealth appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 41(a)(2) provides that \"an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper....

The court began by stating that Urohealth was \"probably home on three\" of the Pace factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> By the time Doe filed his motion to dismiss, Urohealth had invested considerable resources, financial and otherwise, in defending Doe's federal action. Urohealth had produced numerous documents and deposed several of Doe's purported experts. And, Urohealth had to file several protective orders because of Doe's dilatory discovery tactics.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Doe also was less than diligent in his prosecution of this case. As Urohealth notes in its brief, Doe \"conducted no discovery, [and did nothing] to advance his case for that matter, from October 8, 1997 to August 27, 1998.\" The district court twice reprimanded Doe for his failure to meet discovery deadlines and for his discovery abuses. Finally, Urohealth had filed a motion for summary judgment, which was pending when the court dismissed the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then indicated that, even though the Pace factors favored Urohealth, it did not believe that Urohealth would \"truly suffer legal prejudice\" if it dismissed the federal lawsuit without prejudice because Urohealth still would have to litigate these claims on behalf of Dacomed in the state suit. Urohealth argued that if the district court denied Doe's Rule 41(a)(2) motion and granted Urohealth summary judgment, the judgment would have preclusive effect for both Urohealth and Dacomed; thus, Urohealth could avoid relitigating the case in state court. The district court disagreed, reasoning that even if summary judgment would preclude relitigation for Urohealth in the state case, Dacomed, which \"is a separate entity, albeit wholly owned by Urohealth,\" would not be protected by res judicata because it was not a defendant in the federal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the district court erred in its assumption that Dacomed would not be entitled to assert a res judicata defense if Urohealth had garnered judgment in the federal action. An evaluation of the res judicata effects normally would not be part of the Rule 41(a)(2) analysis, but this case is unusual because of the relationship of the two entities. To the extent the district court permissibly considered the potential prejudice stemming from Urohealth's having to litigate on behalf of Dacomed in the state case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we find an abuse of discretion because the court erred in finding no privity between the companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, res judicata bars \"parties to an original action and those in privity with such parties\" from relitigating \"all the issues that were tried or might have been tried in the original suit.\" Providence Teachers Union v. McGovern, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2366596\"><a href=\"/opinion/2366596/providence-teachers-u-loc-958-aft-v-mcgovern/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 361 (R.I. 1974).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Because there is little doubt that judgment for Urohealth in the federal suit would have had preclusive effect with regard to Doe's claims against Urohealth in the state case, see Eigabri v. Lekas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2266159\"><a href=\"/opinion/2266159/eigabri-v-lekas/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 280 (R.I. 1996), the appropriateness of the dismissal turns on whether Dacomed and Urohealth are in privity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Urohealth and Dacomed are in privity for several reasons. \"Under the concept of privity, a non-party may be bound by a prior judgment if that party substantially controlled or [is] represented by a party to the original action.\" Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Pelchat, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1895249\"><a href=\"/opinion/1895249/commercial-union-ins-co-v-pelchat/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 680 (R.I. 1999). Someone in privity with a party may also claim the preclusive benefit of the prior action. See, e.g., Pan Am. Match Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"301240\"><a href=\"/opinion/301240/pan-american-match-inc-v-sears-roebuck-and-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span>, 874 (1st Cir. 1972). In this case, the parent and subsidiary are in privity because Urohealth always has taken legal responsibility for the product and Dacomed's actions and stands ready to defend Dacomed in the state case. Moreover, in determining whether two parties are in privity, courts often look to the commonality of their interest in the matter. See Commercial Union <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1895249\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ins.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1895249/commercial-union-ins-co-v-pelchat/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span>. In this case, Urohealth's and Dacomed's interests are identical. See Aunyx Corp. v. Cannon U.S.A., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593290\"><a href=\"/opinion/593290/aunyx-corporation-v-canon-usa-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"The identity of parties requirement was also satisfied, even though ABM was not a party to the [prior] proceedings. [ABM's sister company] had adequate interest in litigating ABM's interests before the [prior court].\"); cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593290\"><a href=\"/opinion/593290/aunyx-corporation-v-canon-usa-incorporated/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 7-8 </a></span>(noting that companies who had represented themselves as alter egos are in privity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further factor supporting determination of privity here is that the companies are parent and wholly owned subsidiary. This factor has been stressed in a number of cases, including a decision of our own addressed to Rhode Island Law. See, e.g., Hart Steel Co. v. Railroad Supply Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98965\"><a href=\"/opinion/98965/hart-steel-co-v-railroad-supply-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 298 (1917); Acton Co. v.

We do not suggest that the parent-subsidiary relationship automatically establishes privity, but given the relationship of the companies in this case coupled with their joint involvement with the product in question, we have little doubt that a Rhode Island court would treat a merits judgment in favor of Urohealth as resolving an identical claim against its wholly owned subsidiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we disagree with the district court's legal conclusion that the lawsuit against the subsidiary could be maintained in state court if the motion for summary judgment were granted in favor of the parent on the merits. We, in some measure, are making a prediction because we do not know how a Rhode Island court would review the matter. An assessment of the legal rules that would be applied by a Rhode Island court, however, presents a clear-cut legal issue on which no special deference is due to the district court. See Salve Regina College v. Russell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112564\"><a href=\"/opinion/112564/salve-regina-college-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 238-39 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's main stated reason for dismissing without prejudice was based on a legal error, the matter must be remanded for further proceedings. This result does not necessarily preclude the possibility that for some other reason the district court could dismiss the case without ruling on the summary judgment motion, but given the record, it is somewhat difficult to discern what that reason might be. As matters now stand, the defendant has made a significant investment of time and money in the case, a motion for summary judgment apparently is ripe for decision, and judgment in favor of Urohealth would avoid what may be otherwise years of litigation in state court against its subsidiary on an identical claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the reason given by the district court is inadequate, it is far from clear from the case law what reason adequately would justify dismissal at the present stage. Although the courts talk about \"legal prejudice,\" the governing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure lays down no specific test, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2), and the precedents could be read as saying that everything depends on the particular circumstances and that a range of factors could be taken into account. See generally 9 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2364, at 290-96 (2d ed. 1995). One can imagine a situation in which even though the plaintiff chose to bring the case in federal court, peculiarities such as very difficult issues of state law, for example, might make resolution in the state court more appropriate, at least to the extent of permitting the plaintiff voluntarily to dismiss its federal case and pursue a state remedy. Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438745\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kern,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/438745/frances-kern-v-txo-production-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>. We do not say that this is such a case, but merely offer that as an illustrative example.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, it is very difficult to imagine in the circumstances of this case a no-prejudice dismissal at plaintiff's behest that would not involve payment by the plaintiff of the defendant's attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation in federal court to date. We do not suggest that payment of attorney's fees and costs automatically would justify a dismissal. But if there were other valid justifications for dismissal, payment of attorney's fees and other expenses might in some measure ameliorate the prejudice to the defendants of the plaintiff's abortive federal court litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the plaintiff is free to offer any other reasons it may have to justify a voluntarily dismissal, assuming it wishes to pursue its motion. We appreciate that any decision by the district court on such motion, if unaffected by error on a matter of law, is entitled to considerable deference. We do think that a plaintiff cannot conduct a serious product liability claim in a federal court, provoke over a year's worth of discovery and motion practice, allow the case to reach the stage at which the defendant filed a full-scale summary judgment motion, and then when matters seemed to be going badly for plaintiff simply dismiss its case and begin all over again in a state court in what is essentially an identical proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment dismissing the plaintiff's complaint without prejudice is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Much of Urohealth's effort and expense, such as its efforts to respond to Doe's dilatory and sometimes abusive discovery practices and to weed through Doe's experts, will not benefit it in the state case because those issues will not resurface there.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  We do not decide today whether it was proper for the district court to consider in its Rule 41(a)(2) determination the effect dismissal without prejudice for Urohealth in the federal case would have on Dacomed in the state case. Because we conclude that the district court's conclusion about whether Dacomed could use res judicata as a defense in the state case was erroneous, we simply will assume without deciding that the district court properly considered the effects on Dacomed.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  As a general rule, \"[f]ederal law determines the effects under the rules of res judicata of a judgment of a federal court.\" 2 Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 87. Some courts have held that the federal law of preclusion should incorporate state law with respect to questions of privity--the central issue here. See, e.g., Lowell Staats Mining Co. v.

We need not decide this question, as we are confident that the privity analysis here would be the same whether governed by state or federal law.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
