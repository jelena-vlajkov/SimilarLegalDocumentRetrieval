Hctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Peter Goldberger, with whom Pamela A. Wilk was on brief, for\r\nTorres-Otero.\r\n\n   Grace Chung Becker, Trial Attorney, United States Department\r\nof Justice, for the United States.\r\n\nSeptember 16, 1999\r\n\n                                                                 Per Curiam.  In this opinion we address the issue of the\r\ncourse to take in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in\r\nPeguero v. United States, 119 S. Ct. 961 (1999).  The Court held\r\nthat, \"petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief based on a Rule\r\n32(a)(2) violation when he had independent knowledge of the right\r\nto appeal and so was not prejudiced by the trial court's omission.\" \r\nId. at 965.\r\nWe had before us consolidated appeals arising from\r\nproceedings under 28 U.S.C.  2255 in which the district court\r\ndetermined that defendant Luis Torres-Otero (Torres) had not, at\r\nhis original sentencing in 1992, been informed by the district\r\ncourt of his right to appeal.  As a remedy for this violation, the\r\ndistrict court denied Torres's request that he be resentenced and,\r\nover Torres's objection, ordered the clerk to file a notice of\r\nappeal on Torres's behalf.\r\nBefore we address the main subject of this opinion, we\r\nmust first consider the government's challenge to our jurisdiction\r\nto hear the appeals.  The government contends that AEDPA deprives\r\nthis court of jurisdiction over the appeal of the denial of\r\nTorres's  2255 motion because AEDPA precluded a \"second or\r\nsuccessive\"  2255 motion unless certain preconditions, not present\r\nhere, were met.  We disagree because we conclude that the matter\r\nbefore us is not a \"second or successive\"  2255 motion.  Rather,\r\nwe find it a final decision on Torres's first  2255 motion, albeit\r\na decision issued as a result of a motion to reconsider.\r\nThe district court characterized its failure to have\r\nadvised Torres of his right to appeal as \"per se error.\"  It held: \r\n\"A criminal defendant is automatically entitled to relief if he was\r\nnot advised at sentencing of his right to appeal.\"  Dist. Ct. Op.\r\nD.P.R., June 16, 1998.\r\nThe decision in Peguero, issued on March 2, 1999, was\r\nsubsequent to the district court opinion and prior to oral argument\r\nin the appeal before us.  There can be no doubt that Peguero is\r\nbinding on us.\r\nIn Peguero the Court stated:\r\n  Trial judges must be meticulous and precise in\r\nfollowing each of the requirements of Rule 32\r\nin every case.  It is undisputed, then, that\r\nthe court's failure to give the required\r\nadvice was error.\r\n\nId. at 964.  Immediately following this admonition, the Court\r\nstated:\r\n     A violation of Rule 32(a)(2), however, does\r\nnot entitle a defendant to collateral relief\r\nin all circumstances.  Our precedents\r\nestablish, as a general rule, that a court's\r\nfailure to give a defendant advice required by\r\nthe Federal Rules is a sufficient basis for\r\ncollateral relief only when the defendant is\r\nprejudiced by the court's error.\r\n\nId. \r\nIn the course of its opinion the Court rejected the\r\nargument that, \"a Rule 32(a)(2) oversight, though nonprejudicial,\r\nautomatically entitles the defendant to habeas relief.\"  Id. at\r\n965.  \r\nThe court then made the following statement:\r\n  Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\r\nProcedure prohibits federal courts from\r\ngranting relief based on errors that \"d[o] not\r\naffect substantial rights.\"  See Rule 52(a)\r\n(\"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance\r\nwhich does not affect substantial rights shall\r\nbe disregarded\"); see also Bank of Nova Scotia \r\nv. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 254-55, 108 S.\r\nCt. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988) (\"[A] federal\r\ncourt may not invoke supervisory power to\r\ncircumvent the harmless-error inquiry\r\nprescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal\r\nProcedure 52(a). . . .  Rule 52 is, in every\r\npertinent respect, as binding as any statute\r\nduly enacted by Congress, and federal courts\r\nhave no more discretion to disregard the\r\nRule's mandate than they do to disregard\r\nconstitutional or statutory provisions\").\r\n\nId. at 965.\r\nIn light of the holding of Peguero and its teaching we\r\nfeel constrained to remand this case to the district court for a\r\nfactual inquiry as to whether Torres-Otero knew that he had a right\r\nto appeal notwithstanding the district court's failure to so advise\r\nhim.  If he had such knowledge then the sentencing appeal is moot. \r\nIf he did not know of his right to appeal, we will proceed to\r\ndecide the sentencing appeal.\r\nWe hesitate to tell the district court how to conduct\r\nsuch a factual hearing.  We point out the obvious.  The hearing\r\nshall be conducted as would any other factual hearing under the\r\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  If Torres-Otero denies that\r\nhe had knowledge of his right to appeal, the government has the\r\nburden of proving otherwise.\r\n                   So Ordered.\n",

After imposing sentence in any case, the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence, and of the right of a person who is unable to pay the cost of an appeal to apply for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.
