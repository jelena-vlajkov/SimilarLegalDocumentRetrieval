Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n           Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n     Boudin and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nDemetrio Fernndez and Melva A. Quintana on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Fidel A. Sevillano\r\nDel Ro, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJanuary 24, 2000\r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  This is an appeal from a denial\r\nof an award of attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988.  The\r\ndistrict court refused to award fees to plaintiff, who opted out of\r\na settlement, continued litigation, and then received damages\r\ncalculated according to the same formula used in the earlier\r\nsettlement.  The history of the case is set forth in Rivera-Rosario\r\nv. U.S. Department of Agriculture, 151 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIn 1986, eight individuals including Rivera-Rosario\r\n(Rivera) brought an employment discrimination action against the\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture for national origin discrimination in the payment of\r\nbenefits.  Ayala v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., Civil No. 86-1825CC \r\n(D.P.R.).  In 1988, the USDA adopted an administrative law judge's\r\nfinding that it had discriminated.  On May 6, 1991, a Stipulation\r\nfor Consent Judgment was entered between the USDA and the seven\r\nplaintiffs other than Rivera.  Under that settlement: (a) each of\r\nthe seven plaintiffs would receive $10,000 for the period 1982-1988\r\n(and three of the plaintiffs would receive interest); (b) the caps\r\nfor accrued home leave benefits and annual leave would remain as\r\nthey were; (c) the remedy for future home leave would be\r\nprospective; and (d) defendants would pay $31,433.52 in fees for\r\ncounsel for the seven (who had also been counsel for Rivera). \r\nRivera chose not to participate in the settlement.\r\nIn August 1992, Rivera executed a stipulation of\r\ndismissal, dismissing his own case without prejudice.  See id. at\r\n36.  He brought a new action pro se in April 1993 to recover for\r\nthe same national origin discrimination.  See id.  Counsel entered\r\nan appearance for Rivera in September 1993.  The district court\r\ndetermined that damages would be calculated according to the\r\nprocedure set out in its order in the Ayala case.  Based on those\r\nprinciples, the court awarded Rivera $21,448.50, which included\r\nprincipal and interest to May 6, 1991, the date of the earlier\r\nsettlement.  The district judge rejected Rivera's argument that the\r\ntwo year back-pay period of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(1),\r\ndid not apply.  If he were freed of that constraint, Rivera said,\r\nhe would then be owed $113,864.60.  This court then deemed his back\r\npay argument waived because it was not briefed, and affirmed the\r\ndistrict court's order.  See Rivera-Rosario, 151 F.3d at 36-38.  \r\nHaving been awarded the $21,448.50, Rivera then sought\r\nattorney's fees in the amount of $38,150 for the action brought in\r\n1993.  The fees were denied.  The district court found the\r\n$21,448.50 awarded was what Rivera would have received had he\r\naccepted the 1991 settlement; accordingly, he was not a prevailing\r\nparty.  Further, the court found that the litigation was frivolous,\r\nbut it did not award fees against Rivera, as it might have.\r\nIn order to obtain attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.\r\n1988, plaintiff must be a prevailing party.  See 42 U.S.C.\r\n1988(b).  On appeal, Rivera claims that he did prevail: he\r\nreceived $21,448.50 and not $10,000, and he received an enforceable\r\njudgment.  He also says he received a prospective benefit not\r\navailable before.  In light of this, Rivera argues the district\r\ncourt committed error of law in refusing to award him any\r\nattorney's fees.  Rivera argues that the district court, under\r\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), could consider the degree of\r\nsuccess in determining the size of the fee but not as to the\r\neligibility for a fee award at all.  Fees must be awarded unless\r\nthere are special circumstances rendering an award unjust, Rivera\r\nsays, and that may only be done on findings of fact and conclusions\r\nof law.\r\nThe USDA says Rivera is not a prevailing party because\r\nthere is no causal relationship between his post-1991 pursuit of\r\nhis suit and the amount he obtained.  The USDA points to the fact\r\nthat Rivera's $21,448.50 total award was calculated by applying to\r\nhis claim the same principles used to calculate the awards of the\r\nseven plaintiffs who settled in 1991.\r\nQuestions of law regarding the award of attorney's fees\r\nare reviewed de novo; otherwise, the decision on the award is\r\nreviewed with deference and will be reversed only for an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico,\r\n187 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam); see also Bercovitch\r\nv. Baldwin Sch., Inc., 191 F.3d 8, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1999).  We agree\r\nwith the district judge that Rivera was not a prevailing party in\r\nthe 1993 action.  First, it is evident that the purpose of that\r\naction was to pursue Rivera's claim that he was entitled to\r\n$113,864.60.  He lost as to that, and so was hardly a prevailing\r\nparty.  Rivera's effort to recoup by claiming that the 1994 award\r\nof $21,488.50 nonetheless means he was a prevailing party is also\r\nunsuccessful.  Rivera contrasts his award with the $10,000 he says\r\nwas offered to the Ayala plaintiffs in the 1991 settlement.  But\r\nthe $21,488.50 is no more than $10,000 plus interest calculated as \r\nof the date of the 1991 settlement, and three of the seven\r\nplaintiffs who settled in 1991 similarly received interest on their\r\n$10,000 principal amounts.  Rivera fails to show that he received\r\nanything more than what was available to him in 1991, so the\r\noutcome of the 1993 action cannot be deemed successful. \r\nFurthermore, the fact that Rivera obtained an enforceable judgment\r\nas opposed to a settlement agreement does not make him a prevailing\r\nparty.  Settlement agreements are enforceable in contract.  See\r\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 381-82\r\n(1994).  Finally, Rivera's argument that he received an additional\r\nenforceable benefit is belied by the record.  The only judgment he\r\nreceived was for the sum of money described.\r\nRivera also suggests that the administrative law judge's\r\nfinding that the USDA discriminated reinforces his claim that he is\r\na prevailing party.  This \"catalyst\" argument, however, is\r\nsimilarly unavailing.  The reality is that it was the Ayala\r\nlawsuit, settled in 1991, which served as a catalyst for the\r\nfinding of discrimination, and not his later suit.  To use the\r\nlanguage of the Farrar opinion, it was the Ayala suit that\r\n\"modifie[d] the defendant's behavior for the plaintiff's benefit.\" \r\nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 113.  Defendants have already paid the counsel\r\nfees for the prevailing plaintiffs in Ayala.  No benefit beyond\r\nthat available in 1991 was gained in this lawsuit.  This case\r\nprovides no occasion to explore any contours of the catalyst theory\r\npost-Farrar.  See Williams v. Hanover Hous. Auth., 113 F.3d 1294,\r\n1299-1300 (1st Cir. 1997) (finding plaintiff qualified as\r\nprevailing party under catalyst theory); see also Stanton v.\r\nSouthern Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., No. 99-1050, 1999 WL 1128856,\r\nat *3 &amp; n.2 (1st Cir. Dec. 14, 1999) (noting that the circuits are\r\ndivided on the continuing viability of the catalyst theory).  See\r\ngenerally 2 Sheldon H. Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties\r\nLitigation: The Law of Section 1983 10:10 (4th ed. 1999). \r\nFinally, because Rivera is not a \"prevailing party,\" we do not\r\naddress his arguments about the \"special circumstances\" test. \r\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Costs to\r\nappellees.\n",

Rivera argues that the district court, under Farrar v. Hobby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span> </a></span>(1992), could consider the degree of success in determining the size of the fee but not as to the eligibility for a fee award at all. Fees must be awarded unless there are special circumstances rendering an award unjust, Rivera says, and that may only be done on findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The USDA says Rivera is not a prevailing party because there is no causal relationship between his post-1991 pursuit of his suit and the amount he obtained. The USDA points to the fact that Rivera's $21,448.50 total award was calculated by applying to his claim the same principles used to calculate the awards of the seven plaintiffs who settled in 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Questions of law regarding the award of attorney's fees are reviewed de novo; otherwise, the decision on the award is reviewed with deference and will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion. See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765608\"><a href=\"/opinion/765608/robert-e-schneider-jr-v-colegio-de-abogados-de-puerto-rico-robert-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam); see also Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198615\"><a href=\"/opinion/198615/bercovitch-v-baldwin-school-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1999). We agree with the district judge that Rivera was not a prevailing party in the 1993 action. First, it is evident that the purpose of that action was to pursue Rivera's claim that he was entitled to $113,864.60. He lost as to that, and so was hardly a prevailing party. Rivera's effort to recoup by claiming that the 1994 award of $21,488.50 nonetheless means he was a prevailing party is also unsuccessful. Rivera contrasts his award with the $10,000 he says was offered to the Ayala plaintiffs in the 1991 settlement. But the $21,488.50 is no more than $10,000 plus interest calculated as of the date of the 1991 settlement, and three of the seven plaintiffs who settled in 1991 similarly received interest on their $10,000 principal amounts. Rivera fails to show that he received anything more than what was available to him in 1991, so the outcome of the 1993 action cannot be deemed successful. Furthermore, the fact that Rivera obtained an enforceable judgment as opposed to a settlement agreement does not make him a prevailing party. Settlement agreements are enforceable in contract. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 381-82 (1994). Finally, Rivera's argument that he received an additional enforceable benefit is belied by the record. The only judgment he received was for the sum of money described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera also suggests that the administrative law judge's finding that the USDA discriminated reinforces his claim that he is a prevailing party. This \"catalyst\" argument, however, is similarly unavailing. The reality is that it was the Ayala lawsuit, settled in 1991, which served as a catalyst for the finding of discrimination, and not his later suit. To use the language of the Farrar opinion, it was the Ayala suit that \"modifie[d] the defendant's behavior for the plaintiff's benefit.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Farrar,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>. Defendants have already paid the counsel fees for the prevailing plaintiffs in Ayala. No benefit beyond that available in 1991 was gained in this lawsuit. This case provides no occasion to explore any contours of the catalyst theory post-Farrar. See Williams v. Hanover Hous. Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740978\"><a href=\"/opinion/740978/tashima-williams-v-the-hanover-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span>, 1299-1300 (1st Cir. 1997) (finding plaintiff qualified as prevailing party under catalyst theory); see also Stanton v. Southern Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198739\"><a href=\"/opinion/198739/stanton-v-southern-berkshire-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, 576-577, &amp; n.2 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that the circuits are divided on the continuing viability of the catalyst theory). See generally 2 Sheldon H. Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation: The Law of Section 1983 &#167;10:10 (4th ed. 1999). Finally, because Rivera is not a \"prevailing party,\" we do not address his arguments about the \"special circumstances\" test. Hensley v. Eckerhart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 429 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
