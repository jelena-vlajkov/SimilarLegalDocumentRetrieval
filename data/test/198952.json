Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Stahl, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Jean B. Weld, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellant.\n\n     Joseph S. Berman, with whom Berman and Dowell was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\fMay 31, 2000\n\f            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.             This is an appeal from\n\na conviction and sentence imposed by the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of New Hampshire.                 Defendant-Appellant\n\nLouis Duclos offers two grounds for reversal of his conviction\n\nand one claimed error in sentencing.               We reject Duclos's claimed\n\ntrial errors as having no basis in law or fact and find that the\n\ndistrict    court    did   not    abuse      its    discretion   in    imposing\n\nsentence.    Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n            I. Facts\n\n            This case involves a relationship gone horribly awry.\n\nWhile many of the predicate facts are in dispute, this much is\n\nclear:     Duclos was involved with a woman named Angela Gillis,\n\nand after that relationship ended, he invested a great deal of\n\ntime and energy in searching for her.                 It is this search that\n\nbrought about the events leading to his prosecution.\n\n            The specific nature and chronology of the relationship\n\nbetween Duclos and Gillis is complicated.                   The full record\n\n(including    a     host   of    pro   se    filings)     details     the   many\n\nvacillations between Duclos and Gillis.               The crux of the matter,\n\nhowever, is that when Gillis left Duclos, she resumed a previous\n\nrelationship with Ronald Bossey.             Duclos, for his part, simply\n\nwould not let go.      Over an extended period of time he engaged in\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fa   pattern    of   behavior   that    both   the     government   and    Gillis\n\ncredibly characterize as stalking.\n\n              As part of Duclos's multi-faceted plan to locate Gillis\n\nand rescue her from the clutches of Bossey, as he saw it, Duclos\n\nmonitored the post office box that Bossey shared with Gillis.\n\nOn September 15, 1997, Duclos filed a change-of-address card in\n\nthe United States Post Office in Laconia, New Hampshire, where\n\nBossey's box was located.            The card requested that the United\n\nStates Postal Service forward all mail addressed to the post\n\noffice box of Ronald Bossey to a new address: Duclos's home\n\naddress.      Duclos signed the form \"Ronald Bossey.\"              Because the\n\ncard requested that the change be permanent, Bossey's post\n\noffice box was closed, and the lock was changed.\n\n              Ten   days   after     diverting      Bossey's   mail,      Duclos\n\napparently attempted to cancel the forwarding order.                 Because he\n\nhad   denoted       the    earlier     change    as     permanent,       he   was\n\nunsuccessful.\n\n              In late September or early October of 1997, Ronald\n\nBossey attempted to retrieve mail from his rented box, only to\n\nfind that the lock had been changed.            Bossey inquired about this\n\nand learned that there had been a permanent change-of-address\n\nrequest.      When the postal clerk compared the signature on the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fchange-of-address           card    with    the    one   on    Bossey's    driver's\n\nlicense, it was apparent that the card had been forged.\n\n             Soon thereafter, United States Postal Inspector Peter\n\nKeefe    obtained        the       original      change-of-address        card     and\n\ninterviewed Bossey, who led him to Duclos.                     When Keefe spoke to\n\nDuclos, Duclos told Keefe \"that he was not going to lie,\" and\n\nadmitted filing the card.\n\n             Duclos explained his actions, both to Keefe and later\n\nat trial, by arguing that he had done what he did out of a\n\ndesire to protect Gillis.               Duclos claimed that he understood\n\nBossey   to    be    a   violent      person,     who    had    been   dishonorably\n\ndischarged from the military and who kept a firearm in his\n\napartment.         Duclos also believed that Bossey had taken money\n\nfrom Gillis, including a death benefit check due her because of\n\nthe death of her husband.              Duclos also claimed that he feared\n\nthat Gillis, who was pregnant, was using drugs with Bossey.\n\n             Apparently, Duclos monitored the post office box for\n\na   number    of    weeks    and    then   eventually      submitted      the    false\n\naddress card.        The government presented testimony at trial in\n\nwhich \"[Duclos] said he figured they may have made plans the\n\nprior month to go somewhere and that he would be able to trace\n\nthem via the telephone bill of the calls they made.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f            A federal grand jury indicted Duclos on two charges:\n\nfiling a false statement with the United States Postal Service,\n\nin   violation    of   18    U.S.C.    §    1001       (Supp.     IV    1998),   and\n\nobstructing correspondence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1702\n\n(1994).     At   trial,     Duclos    invoked      a    defense    of   necessity,\n\nclaiming that his actions were taken out of fear for Gillis'\n\nsafety and a desire to protect her.                    The jury rejected these\n\ndefenses, convicting him on both counts.\n\n            The United States Probation Department recommended a\n\nbase offense level of 4, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 2F1.1 and\n\n2H3.3(b).    The Department also recommended an increase of two\n\nlevels for taking undelivered United States mail, pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(3)(A), an increase of two levels for more\n\nthan minimal planning under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(4)(A), and an\n\nincrease of two levels for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3C1.1.     Duclos made timely objections to the latter two\n\nenhancements.     The trial judge found that Duclos had engaged in\n\nmore than minimal planning and accordingly added two levels; the\n\ncourt declined to increase the sentence for obstruction of\n\njustice.    With Duclos's criminal history category of IV, and a\n\ntotal offense level of 8, the court sentenced him to 14 months,\n\nwhich was within the guideline range of 10-16 months.\n\n            II. Sentencing Appeal\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            In his brief on appeal, Duclos devotes the majority of\n\nhis argument to his sentencing appeal.        Accordingly, we consider\n\nit first.    Duclos claims that the district court should not have\n\nimposed     the   two-level    enhancement    for   more     than   minimal\n\nplanning.\n\n            In reviewing a decision to enhance a sentence from the\n\nbase offense level, we employ a bifurcated standard of review.\n\nSee United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994).             We\n\nreview the legal determination of the guideline's meaning and\n\nscope de novo, see id.; United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), but allow due deference to the district court's\n\nfactfinding, reviewing it only for clear error, see Brewster, 1\n\nF.3d at 54; Thompson, 32 F.3d at 4; United States v. Nunez, 146\n\nF.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            The   relevant    enhancement    states:   \"If    the   offense\n\ninvolved more than minimal planning, increase by 2 levels.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(4)(A).         Section 2F1.1 of the guidelines,\n\nwhich applies to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, allows for use\n\nof this enhancement. 1        The Commission provides a gloss on the\n\n\n    1  Duclos offers an argument for the first time on appeal\nthat the district court should only have considered the\nenhancement as it related to the false statement charge.\nSetting aside serious questions of waiver, we reject his\ncontention by pointing to the fact that the two offenses were\nproperly grouped together under U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b), and that\nthe enhancement may be considered with respect to all relevant\n\n                                   -7-\n\fbare language of the enhancement in Application Note 1(f) to\n\nSection 1B1.1, which states:\n\n         \"More than minimal planning\" means more\n         planning than is typical for commission of\n         the offense in a simple form.     \"More than\n         minimal planning\" also exists if significant\n         affirmative steps were taken to conceal the\n         offense . . . .         \"More than minimal\n         planning\" is deemed present in any case\n         involving repeated acts over a period of\n         time, unless it is clear that each instance\n         was purely opportune.     Consequently, this\n         adjustment will apply especially frequently\n         in property crimes.\n\n\n         The most recent statement in this circuit on \"more than\n\nminimal planning\" comes from our decision in United States v.\n\nPhath, 144 F.3d 146 (1st Cir. 1998).       In that case, we found\n\nclear error in the district court's imposition of the \"more than\n\nminimal planning\" enhancement, marking the first time that we\n\nhad overturned such an enhancement.     See id. at 151.   The crime\n\nat issue in Phath was an unsophisticated bank fraud scheme.      In\n\nPhath, a stranger approached the defendant in a casino and\n\noffered him money to deposit checks in his bank account and\n\nwithdraw cash a short time later when the checks had cleared.\n\nSee id. at 147-48.    The stranger also asked Phath to find\n\nfriends who would do the same.       See id. at 148.   This was the\n\n\n\nconduct. See United States v. Ivery, 999 F.2d 1043, 1046 & n.2\n(6th Cir. 1993).\n\n                               -8-\n\fextent of his crime.          The district court in that case applied\n\nthe more than minimal planning enhancement, stating:                \"[T]his is\n\nnot an offense in its simplest terms.             It has several layers of\n\nintricacy which are designed to conceal the offense itself.\"\n\nId. at 150.\n\n          We reversed, stating that:             \"Phath's crime was simple\n\nand short-lived.\"       Id.     We rejected the argument proffered by\n\nthe government that any crime that is not \"purely opportune\"\n\ninvolves more than minimal planning.            See id.    Instead, we found\n\ndispositive two facts.           First, Phath's acts were in no way\n\n\"repeated acts over a period of time.\"            Id.     Second, Phath took\n\nno \"significant affirmative steps to conceal the offense.\"                    Id.\n\nWe suggested that, had the defendant's actions been repeated\n\nacts, we would have then continued the inquiry to determine\n\nwhether each repeated action was \"purely opportune.\"                     See id.\n\n          With these principles in mind, we consider the instant\n\ncase,   mindful   of    the   mandate    that    \"[t]he    district      court's\n\njudgment that an offense involves more than minimal planning is\n\na   factual   finding    that    we   overturn    only    if   it   is   clearly\n\nerroneous.\"    Id. at 149.       In this case, the difference between\n\nthe defendant's view of the enhancement and the view adopted by\n\nthe district court is essentially one of perspective.                     Duclos\n\nwishes us to view his conduct close-up — that is, he urges us to\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fask whether he engaged in more than minimal planning for the act\n\nof filing the false change-of-address card.       The district court,\n\non the other hand, took a more holistic view, and one we think\n\nmore in line with the Guidelines' definition of conduct relevant\n\nto   planning   the   crime.   The   district   court   considered   the\n\nconduct in light of the entire scheme admittedly engaged in by\n\nDuclos in order to commit the offense.\n\n           The district court stated:\n\n                 The defendant first had to determine\n          where Mr. Bossie [sic] lived, and that\n          certainly required time and effort. He then\n          had to determine that his mail was not being\n          delivered to his residence. He then had to\n          determine where the post office was and the\n          box where Mr. Bossie's mail was being\n          delivered. He then had to fill out PS Form\n          3546, which is the forward change notice\n          form, and file that with the postal\n          authorities.\n                 The mail was then forwarded. He used,\n          got whatever information he wanted to from\n          the mail and then to avoid detection\n          destroyed mail.    He then had to forward a\n          cancellation notice in order to once again\n          attempt to avoid detection.\n                 So taking the totality of these\n          circumstances, it is the opinion of the\n          Court that having considered the Fath [sic]\n          case and its ruling[,] that these offenses,\n          taken together, involved more than minimal\n          planning.\nAs the district court suggested, there are crucial differences\n\nfrom Phath that make Duclos's case distinct.            First, Duclos's\n\ncase involves an extended course of conduct, or a scheme that\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcontinued over a significant period of time.2                Second, Duclos\n\ntook affirmative steps to cover up his crime.            This is a clear\n\nground for applying the enhancement, see Application Note 1(f)\n\nto § 1B1.1, and the district court's fact-finding on this point\n\nis unassailable.     Accordingly, we are unable to say that the\n\ndistrict court's findings of fact and concomitant imposition of\n\nthe enhancement were clearly erroneous.\n\n         III. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n         Duclos     claims   that,   in   light   of   his    necessity    or\n\njustification defense, the jury's verdict was against the weight\n\nof the evidence.    He claims that his defense raised a reasonable\n\ndoubt that his conduct was willful and knowing.                   The high\n\nstandard for such a challenge is well-known.            Duclos must show\n\nthat no rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.    See United States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).    We review the sufficiency of the evidence as\n\na whole, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict and taking into account all reasonable inferences, and\n\nresolving all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.                 See\n\n\n\n    2  We do not mean to suggest that Duclos's stalking\nactivities that were not in preparation for the criminal act\nrender him eligible for a \"more than minimal planning\"\nenhancement.   Rather, we focus solely on those of Duclos's\nactions that were relevant to obtaining the information\nnecessary to commit the offense.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fid.   The scope of review is over the totality of the evidence,\n\nboth direct and circumstantial.            See United States v. Woodward,\n\n149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied 119 S. Ct. 1026\n\n(1999).\n\n             To prove a false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   1001,    the    government   must      show    that      the   defendant:    (1)\n\nknowingly and willfully, (2) made a statement, (3) in relation\n\nto a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of\n\nthe United States, (4) with knowledge of its falsity.                            See\n\nUnited States v. Wiener, 96 F.3d 35, 37 (2d Cir. 1996), aff'd\n\nsub nom. Brogan v. United States, 522 U.S. 398 (1998).                    To prove\n\nobstruction of correspondence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1702,\n\nthe government must prove that the defendant (1) knowingly took\n\nmail from a post office or authorized depository for mail, (2)\n\nbefore      it   was   delivered,    (3)    with    the      specific   intent    to\n\nobstruct correspondence or pry into the business or secrets of\n\nanother.         See United States v. Gaber, 745 F.2d 952, 955 (5th\n\nCir. 1984).\n\n             As    a   preliminary   matter,       it   is    beyond    cavil   that\n\nDuclos, absent his affirmative defense, admitted the elements of\n\nboth crimes.       Duclos attempts to dispute his intent, saying that\n\nhe committed the act in question so quickly and without thinking\n\nthat he did not have time to form the requisite intent.                         This\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fargument, however, confuses intent with premeditation.           Duclos\n\nadmitted at trial that he knew the nature of his act, and that\n\nhe knew what its likely effect would be.              This amounts to\n\nintent.\n\n            Duclos's more complicated argument on sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence involves the question of his affirmative defense.\n\nDuclos notes correctly that his behavior might be excused by the\n\ndefense of necessity.       This defense, like other justification\n\ndefenses,    allows    a   defendant   to   evade   responsibility    for\n\notherwise criminal actions notwithstanding proof of the elements\n\nof the offense.       See United States v. Smith, 160 F.3d 117, 123\n\n(2d Cir. 1998).       The essence of the defense is that otherwise\n\ncriminal conduct may be excused when the defendant commits the\n\nacts in order to avoid a greater evil.          In one formulation of\n\nthis defense (on which Duclos himself relies in his brief on\n\nappeal), the defense requires that the defendant had no legal\n\nalternative to violating the law; the harm he sought to prevent\n\nwas imminent, and a direct, causal relationship is reasonably\n\nanticipated    to   exist    between   defendant's    actions   and   the\n\navoidance of harm.3\n\n\n    3  As the Tenth Circuit has noted, there are differing\nformulations of the defense. See United States v. Unser, 165\nF.3d 755, 764 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 40 (1999).\nNotably, the Model Penal Code's version of the defense (\"Choice\nof Evils,\" in the parlance of the Code) appears to set a higher\n\n                                  -13-\n\f           Duclos's sufficiency of the evidence argument is that\n\nhis properly alleged affirmative defense was not rebutted by the\n\ngovernment, which, he argues, bore the burden of proving the\n\nnon-existence of the defense by a reasonable doubt.                   Throughout\n\nthis opinion, we assume arguendo that Duclos is correct in\n\nassigning the burden of proof at all times to the government.\n\nDuclos's argument, however, is without foundation in the facts\n\nof this case.       First, his defense was predicated on his own\n\ntestimony that he believed his conduct necessary to avoid harm\n\nto   Gillis.        The    government,        however,      savaged    Duclos's\n\ncredibility at trial such that a rational juror might have\n\nrejected    his    defense     based    on    lack   of   credibility     alone.\n\nSecond, Duclos's own testimony undercut his defense.                   While he\n\nargued that he felt his conduct necessary to avert harm to\n\nGillis, he also testified repeatedly that he acted on the spur\n\nof the moment, without knowing what he was thinking.                   The jury\n\ncould have concluded from this that he acted upon impulse, and\n\nwithout    the    sort    of   deliberation      they     might   think   should\n\naccompany his affirmative defense.             Third, the jury heard a vast\n\n\n\nbar for defendants.    See Model Penal Code § 3.02; see also\nSmith, 160 F.3d at 123 & n.3 (noting distinctions between\nformulations of the defense). We do not intend our recitation\nof this particular formulation to suggest that we adopt it as\nthe law of the First Circuit. We have accepted the formulation\noffered by Duclos only arguendo.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fquantity of evidence about Duclos's stalking of Gillis that\n\nmight well have led it to believe that Duclos committed his\n\ncrime   because   he    was     obsessed     with   Gillis,    not    out    of    a\n\nreasonable belief in her imminent harm.               Fourth, the government\n\nprovided sufficient evidence on cross-examination for the jury\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt that the imminence prong of\n\nthe defense was not present.\n\n           Accordingly, Duclos's claim of insufficiency of the\n\nevidence must fail.\n\n           IV. Jury Instructions\n\n           Duclos presents a properly preserved claim of error in\n\nthe court's jury instructions.              Such a claim is subject to de\n\nnovo review.      See United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 68\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1026 (1999).                 An error\n\nin jury instructions will mandate reversal only when the error\n\nis prejudicial based on a review of the entire record.                           See\n\nDavet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           Duclos      argues    that      although    the    court    properly\n\ninstructed the jury on the affirmative defenses, the court's\n\ncomments   immediately        after   the    instruction      amounted      to    an\n\ninstruction that shifted the burden of proof on the affirmative\n\ndefense to the defendant.          The court stated:\n\n           A general fear, or an apprehension of danger\n           that is vague or imprecise or that is not a\n\n                                      -15-\n\f             fear of immediate harm or death, is not\n             sufficient to support the necessity to act\n             in defense of a third person.\n\nThe court then stated:\n\n             On this issue [the affirmative defense],\n             just as on the others, the burden is on the\n             government to prove the defendant's guilt\n             beyond a reasonable doubt.    To find Louis\n             Duclos guilty, therefore, in addition to\n             finding beyond a reasonable doubt each of\n             the elements of the two offenses charged,\n             you must conclude beyond a reasonable doubt\n             that when he committed the acts charged in\n             the indictment, one, no such harm existed or\n             it was not immediate; or two, he did not\n             have a well-grounded belief that the harm\n             existed; or three, there were reasonable\n             alternatives   to    prevent   such    harm.\n             (emphasis added).\n\nThe   only    instructions    that     came   between   the    objected-to\n\ninstruction and the above-quoted burden of proof instruction was\n\na proper continuation of the affirmative defense instruction.\n\nAccordingly, the above instruction corrected immediately any\n\nmisimpression the jury might have had with respect to the burden\n\nof proof.     We are therefore unable to say that any error in the\n\ninstruction,     if   there   was    indeed   any   error     at   all,   was\n\nprejudicial.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

This is an appeal from\n\na conviction and sentence imposed by the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of New Hampshire.                 Defendant-Appellant\n\nLouis Duclos offers two grounds for reversal of his conviction\n\nand one claimed error in sentencing.               We reject Duclos's claimed\n\ntrial errors as having no basis in law or fact and find that the\n\ndistrict    court    did   not    abuse      its    discretion   in    imposing\n\nsentence.    Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n            I. Facts\n\n            This case involves a relationship gone horribly awry.\n\nWhile many of the predicate facts are in dispute, this much is\n\nclear:     Duclos was involved with a woman named Angela Gillis,\n\nand after that relationship ended, he invested a great deal of\n\ntime and energy in searching for her.                 It is this search that\n\nbrought about the events leading to his prosecution.\n\n            The specific nature and chronology of the relationship\n\nbetween Duclos and Gillis is complicated.                   The full record\n\n(including    a     host   of    pro   se    filings)     details     the   many\n\nvacillations between Duclos and Gillis.               The crux of the matter,\n\nhowever, is that when Gillis left Duclos, she resumed a previous\n\nrelationship with Ronald Bossey.             Duclos, for his part, simply\n\nwould not let go.      Over an extended period of time he engaged in\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fa   pattern    of   behavior   that    both   the     government   and    Gillis\n\ncredibly characterize as stalking.\n\n              As part of Duclos's multi-faceted plan to locate Gillis\n\nand rescue her from the clutches of Bossey, as he saw it, Duclos\n\nmonitored the post office box that Bossey shared with Gillis.\n\nOn September 15, 1997, Duclos filed a change-of-address card in\n\nthe United States Post Office in Laconia, New Hampshire, where\n\nBossey's box was located.            The card requested that the United\n\nStates Postal Service forward all mail addressed to the post\n\noffice box of Ronald Bossey to a new address: Duclos's home\n\naddress.      Duclos signed the form \"Ronald Bossey.\"              Because the\n\ncard requested that the change be permanent, Bossey's post\n\noffice box was closed, and the lock was changed.\n\n              Ten   days   after     diverting      Bossey's   mail,      Duclos\n\napparently attempted to cancel the forwarding order.                 Because he\n\nhad   denoted       the    earlier     change    as     permanent,       he   was\n\nunsuccessful.\n\n              In late September or early October of 1997, Ronald\n\nBossey attempted to retrieve mail from his rented box, only to\n\nfind that the lock had been changed.            Bossey inquired about this\n\nand learned that there had been a permanent change-of-address\n\nrequest.      When the postal clerk compared the signature on the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fchange-of-address           card    with    the    one   on    Bossey's    driver's\n\nlicense, it was apparent that the card had been forged.\n\n             Soon thereafter, United States Postal Inspector Peter\n\nKeefe    obtained        the       original      change-of-address        card     and\n\ninterviewed Bossey, who led him to Duclos.                     When Keefe spoke to\n\nDuclos, Duclos told Keefe \"that he was not going to lie,\" and\n\nadmitted filing the card.\n\n             Duclos explained his actions, both to Keefe and later\n\nat trial, by arguing that he had done what he did out of a\n\ndesire to protect Gillis.               Duclos claimed that he understood\n\nBossey   to    be    a   violent      person,     who    had    been   dishonorably\n\ndischarged from the military and who kept a firearm in his\n\napartment.         Duclos also believed that Bossey had taken money\n\nfrom Gillis, including a death benefit check due her because of\n\nthe death of her husband.              Duclos also claimed that he feared\n\nthat Gillis, who was pregnant, was using drugs with Bossey.\n\n             Apparently, Duclos monitored the post office box for\n\na   number    of    weeks    and    then   eventually      submitted      the    false\n\naddress card.        The government presented testimony at trial in\n\nwhich \"[Duclos] said he figured they may have made plans the\n\nprior month to go somewhere and that he would be able to trace\n\nthem via the telephone bill of the calls they made.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f            A federal grand jury indicted Duclos on two charges:\n\nfiling a false statement with the United States Postal Service,\n\nin   violation    of   18    U.S.C.    §    1001       (Supp.     IV    1998),   and\n\nobstructing correspondence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1702\n\n(1994).     At   trial,     Duclos    invoked      a    defense    of   necessity,\n\nclaiming that his actions were taken out of fear for Gillis'\n\nsafety and a desire to protect her.                    The jury rejected these\n\ndefenses, convicting him on both counts.\n\n            The United States Probation Department recommended a\n\nbase offense level of 4, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 2F1.1 and\n\n2H3.3(b).    The Department also recommended an increase of two\n\nlevels for taking undelivered United States mail, pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(3)(A), an increase of two levels for more\n\nthan minimal planning under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(4)(A), and an\n\nincrease of two levels for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3C1.1.     Duclos made timely objections to the latter two\n\nenhancements.     The trial judge found that Duclos had engaged in\n\nmore than minimal planning and accordingly added two levels; the\n\ncourt declined to increase the sentence for obstruction of\n\njustice.    With Duclos's criminal history category of IV, and a\n\ntotal offense level of 8, the court sentenced him to 14 months,\n\nwhich was within the guideline range of 10-16 months.\n\n            II. Sentencing Appeal\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            In his brief on appeal, Duclos devotes the majority of\n\nhis argument to his sentencing appeal.        Accordingly, we consider\n\nit first.    Duclos claims that the district court should not have\n\nimposed     the   two-level    enhancement    for   more     than   minimal\n\nplanning.\n\n            In reviewing a decision to enhance a sentence from the\n\nbase offense level, we employ a bifurcated standard of review.\n\nSee United States v.

Section 2F1.1 of the guidelines,\n\nwhich applies to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, allows for use\n\nof this enhancement. 1        The Commission provides a gloss on the\n\n\n    1  Duclos offers an argument for the first time on appeal\nthat the district court should only have considered the\nenhancement as it related to the false statement charge.\nSetting aside serious questions of waiver, we reject his\ncontention by pointing to the fact that the two offenses were\nproperly grouped together under U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b), and that\nthe enhancement may be considered with respect to all relevant\n\n                                   -7-\n\fbare language of the enhancement in Application Note 1(f) to\n\nSection 1B1.1, which states:\n\n         \"More than minimal planning\" means more\n         planning than is typical for commission of\n         the offense in a simple form.     \"More than\n         minimal planning\" also exists if significant\n         affirmative steps were taken to conceal the\n         offense . . . .         \"More than minimal\n         planning\" is deemed present in any case\n         involving repeated acts over a period of\n         time, unless it is clear that each instance\n         was purely opportune.     Consequently, this\n         adjustment will apply especially frequently\n         in property crimes.\n\n\n         The most recent statement in this circuit on \"more than\n\nminimal planning\" comes from our decision in United States v.\n\nPhath, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197960\"><a href=\"/opinion/197960/united-states-v-phath/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1998).       In that case, we found\n\nclear error in the district court's imposition of the \"more than\n\nminimal planning\" enhancement, marking the first time that we\n\nhad overturned such an enhancement.     See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197960\"><a href=\"/opinion/197960/united-states-v-phath/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 151. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  The crime\n\nat issue in Phath was an unsophisticated bank fraud scheme.

The district court in that case applied\n\nthe more than minimal planning enhancement, stating:                \"[T]his is\n\nnot an offense in its simplest terms.

Duclos\n\nwishes us to view his conduct close-up — that is, he urges us to\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fask whether he engaged in more than minimal planning for the act\n\nof filing the false change-of-address card.       The district court,\n\non the other hand, took a more holistic view, and one we think\n\nmore in line with the Guidelines' definition of conduct relevant\n\nto   planning   the   crime.   The   district   court   considered   the\n\nconduct in light of the entire scheme admittedly engaged in by\n\nDuclos in order to commit the offense.\n\n           The district court stated:\n\n                 The defendant first had to determine\n          where Mr. Bossie [sic] lived, and that\n          certainly required time and effort. He then\n          had to determine that his mail was not being\n          delivered to his residence. He then had to\n          determine where the post office was and the\n          box where Mr. Bossie's mail was being\n          delivered. He then had to fill out PS Form\n          3546, which is the forward change notice\n          form, and file that with the postal\n          authorities.\n                 The mail was then forwarded. He used,\n          got whatever information he wanted to from\n          the mail and then to avoid detection\n          destroyed mail.    He then had to forward a\n          cancellation notice in order to once again\n          attempt to avoid detection.\n                 So taking the totality of these\n          circumstances, it is the opinion of the\n          Court that having considered the Fath [sic]\n          case and its ruling[,] that these offenses,\n          taken together, involved more than minimal\n          planning.\nAs the district court suggested, there are crucial differences\n\nfrom Phath that make Duclos's case distinct.            First, Duclos's\n\ncase involves an extended course of conduct, or a scheme that\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcontinued over a significant period of time.2                Second, Duclos\n\ntook affirmative steps to cover up his crime.            This is a clear\n\nground for applying the enhancement, see Application Note 1(f)\n\nto § 1B1.1, and the district court's fact-finding on this point\n\nis unassailable.     Accordingly, we are unable to say that the\n\ndistrict court's findings of fact and concomitant imposition of\n\nthe enhancement were clearly erroneous.\n\n         III. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n         Duclos     claims   that,   in   light   of   his    necessity    or\n\njustification defense, the jury's verdict was against the weight\n\nof the evidence.    He claims that his defense raised a reasonable\n\ndoubt that his conduct was willful and knowing.                   The high\n\nstandard for such a challenge is well-known.            Duclos must show\n\nthat no rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.    See United States v. Scharon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198519\"><a href=\"/opinion/198519/united-states-v-scharon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).    We review the sufficiency of the evidence as\n\na whole, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict and taking into account all reasonable inferences, and\n\nresolving all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.                 See\n\n\n\n    2  We do not mean to suggest that Duclos's stalking\nactivities that were not in preparation for the criminal act\nrender him eligible for a \"more than minimal planning\"\nenhancement.   Rather, we focus solely on those of Duclos's\nactions that were relevant to obtaining the information\nnecessary to commit the offense.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198519\"><a href=\"/opinion/198519/united-states-v-scharon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   The scope </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">of review is over the totality of the evidence,\n\nboth direct and circumstantial.

Duclos attempts to dispute his intent, saying that\n\nhe committed the act in question so quickly and without thinking\n\nthat he did not have time to form the requisite intent.                         This\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fargument, however, confuses intent with premeditation.           Duclos\n\nadmitted at trial that he knew the nature of his act, and that\n\nhe knew what its likely effect would be.              This amounts to\n\nintent.\n\n            Duclos's more complicated argument on sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence involves the question of his affirmative defense.\n\nDuclos notes correctly that his behavior might be excused by the\n\ndefense of necessity.       This defense, like other justification\n\ndefenses,    allows    a   defendant   to   evade   responsibility    for\n\notherwise criminal actions notwithstanding proof of the elements\n\nof the offense.       See United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759125\"><a href=\"/opinion/759125/united-states-v-decaress-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123\n\n(2d Cir. 1998).       The essence of the defense is that otherwise\n\ncriminal conduct may be excused when the defendant commits the\n\nacts in order to avoid a greater evil.          In one formulation of\n\nthis defense (on which Duclos himself relies in his brief on\n\nappeal), the defense requires that the defendant had no legal\n\nalternative to violating the law; the harm he sought to prevent\n\nwas imminent, and a direct, causal relationship is reasonably\n\nanticipated    to   exist    between   defendant's    actions   and   the\n\navoidance of harm.3\n\n\n    3  As the Tenth Circuit has noted, there are differing\nformulations of the defense. See United States v. Unser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760871\"><a href=\"/opinion/760871/united-states-v-robert-w-unser/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1999).\nNotably, the Model Penal Code's version of the defense (\"Choice\nof Evils,\" in the parlance of the Code) appears to set a higher\n\n                                  -13-\n\f           Duclos's sufficiency of the evidence argument is that\n\nhis properly alleged affirmative defense was not rebutted by the\n\ngovernment, which, he argues, bore the burden of proving the\n\nnon-existence of the defense by a reasonable doubt.                   Throughout\n\nthis opinion, we assume arguendo that Duclos is correct in\n\nassigning the burden of proof at all times to the government.\n\nDuclos's argument, however, is without foundation in the facts\n\nof this case.       First, his defense was predicated on his own\n\ntestimony that he believed his conduct necessary to avoid harm\n\nto   Gillis.        The    government,        however,      savaged    Duclos's\n\ncredibility at trial such that a rational juror might have\n\nrejected    his    defense     based    on    lack   of   credibility     alone.\n\nSecond, Duclos's own testimony undercut his defense.                   While he\n\nargued that he felt his conduct necessary to avert harm to\n\nGillis, he also testified repeatedly that he acted on the spur\n\nof the moment, without knowing what he was thinking.                   The jury\n\ncould have concluded from this that he acted upon impulse, and\n\nwithout    the    sort    of   deliberation      they     might   think   should\n\naccompany his affirmative defense.             Third, the jury heard a vast\n\n\n\nbar for defendants.

We do not intend our recitation\nof this particular formulation to suggest that we adopt it as\nthe law of the First Circuit. We have accepted the formulation\noffered by Duclos only arguendo.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fquantity of evidence about Duclos's stalking of Gillis that\n\nmight well have led it to believe that Duclos committed his\n\ncrime   because   he    was     obsessed     with   Gillis,    not    out    of    a\n\nreasonable belief in her imminent harm.               Fourth, the government\n\nprovided sufficient evidence on cross-examination for the jury\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt that the imminence prong of\n\nthe defense was not present.\n\n           Accordingly, Duclos's claim of insufficiency of the\n\nevidence must fail.\n\n           IV. Jury Instructions\n\n           Duclos presents a properly preserved claim of error in\n\nthe court's jury instructions.              Such a claim is subject to de\n\nnovo review.      See United States v. Woodward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1999).                 An error\n\nin jury instructions will mandate reversal only when the error\n\nis prejudicial based on a review of the entire record.                           See\n\nDavet v. Maccarone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589645\"><a href=\"/opinion/589645/richard-f-davet-v-enrico-maccarone/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           Duclos      argues    that      although    the    court    properly\n\ninstructed the jury on the affirmative defenses, the court's\n\ncomments   immediately        after   the    instruction      amounted      to    an\n\ninstruction that shifted the burden of proof on the affirmative\n\ndefense to the defendant.          The court stated:\n\n           A general fear, or an apprehension of danger\n           that is vague or imprecise or that is not a\n\n                                      -15-\n\f             fear of immediate harm or death, is not\n             sufficient to support the necessity to act\n             in defense of a third person.\n\nThe court then stated:\n\n             On this issue [the affirmative defense],\n             just as on the others, the burden is on the\n             government to prove the defendant's guilt\n             beyond a reasonable doubt.    To find Louis\n             Duclos guilty, therefore, in addition to\n             finding beyond a reasonable doubt each of\n             the elements of the two offenses charged,\n             you must conclude beyond a reasonable doubt\n             that when he committed the acts charged in\n             the indictment, one, no such harm existed or\n             it was not immediate; or two, he did not\n             have a well-grounded belief that the harm\n             existed; or three, there were reasonable\n             alternatives   to    prevent   such    harm.\n             (emphasis added).\n\nThe   only    instructions    that     came   between   the    objected-to\n\ninstruction and the above-quoted burden of proof instruction was\n\na proper continuation of the affirmative defense instruction.\n\nAccordingly, the above instruction corrected immediately any\n\nmisimpression the jury might have had with respect to the burden\n\nof proof.     We are therefore unable to say that any error in the\n\ninstruction,     if   there   was    indeed   any   error     at   all,   was\n\nprejudicial.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f</pre>",
