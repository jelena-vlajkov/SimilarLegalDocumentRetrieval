Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Rolando Belen on brief pro se.\r\n   Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney and Peter E. Papps,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nNovember 17, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Before us are Mr. Belen's appeal from the\r\ndismissal as time-barred of his 28 U.S.C.  2255 petition and\r\nthe government's motions for summary disposition and to treat\r\nits motion as its brief on appeal.  We allow the government to\r\ntreat its motion as its brief on appeal.\r\n          The district court held that Mr. Belen's petition was\r\nuntimely because it \"was not deposited in the institution's\r\ninternal mail system on or before April 23, 1997, the deadline\r\nfor filing the petition.\"  In Rogers v. United States, 180 F.3d\r\n349, 355 (1st Cir. 1999), which was decided after the district\r\ncourt issued its opinion, we held that the relevant AEDPA\r\ndeadline is April 24, 1997.  In Morales-Rivera v. United\r\nStates, 184 F.3d 109 (1st Cir. 1999), another decision issued\r\nafter the district court's opinion, we held: \"a pro se\r\nprisoner's motion under 28 U.S.C.  2255 or  2254 is filed on\r\nthe date that it is deposited in the prison's internal mail-\r\nsystem for forwarding to the district court, provided that the\r\nprisoner utilizes, if available, the prison's system for\r\nrecording legal mail.\"  \r\n          We vacate the judgment and remand to the district\r\ncourt to determine whether Mr. Belen deposited his petition by\r\nApril 24, 1997 in the prison's internal mail-system, utilizing,\r\nif available, the prison's system for recording legal mail.\r\n          Vacated and remanded.
