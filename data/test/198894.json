Dodge, Jr. and Rubin and\nRudman LLP, were on brief for appellee.\n\f                             April 18, 2000\n\n\n\n\n          Per Curiam.       Defendants-appellants DeWitt Davenport,\n\nPalmer   Davenport,   and    John   Davenport,   individually   and   as\n\ntrustees of the Davenport Realty Trust (\"DRT\" or \"the Trust\"),\n\nappeal a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff-appellee Allen\n\nBragdon on his claims of securities fraud, common law fraud, and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.       We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          We set forth the facts as the jury might have found\n\nthem, consistent with the record but in a light most favorable\n\nto the verdict.   See, e.g., Grajales-Romero v. American Airlines\n\nInc., 194 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The DRT is a Massachusetts realty trust founded in the\n\n1950s as a family business.         The DRT's assets and subsidiary\n\noperating companies are now valued at nearly $50 million.        There\n\nare approximately 5800 to 6000 outstanding shares of the Trust.\n\nThe Davenports manage the Trust and collectively own a majority\n\nof its shares.\n\n          In 1984, Bragdon inherited 310 shares of the Trust from\n\nhis mother.   In April 1991, Bragdon contemplated selling his\n\nshares, and asked the Davenports about the financial condition\n\n                                    -2-\n\fof   the    Trust.      The    Davenports         gave   Bragdon     some   general\n\nfinancial information, but refused to show him the Trust's\n\nfinancial statements.          By way of explanation, Palmer Davenport\n\nshowed him an amendment to the Declaration of Trust which stated\n\nthat shareholders are not entitled to receive past or present\n\nfinancial statements.\n\n             In February 1994, Bragdon hired independent counsel for\n\nassistance in his communications with the Davenports.                       In May\n\n1994,      Bragdon   wrote     to    DeWitt     Davenport      and   requested   an\n\nestimate     of   the   fair    market     value    of   his    shares.     DeWitt\n\nresponded, during a meeting at Bragdon's home, that the Trust\n\nhad experienced financial difficulties during the last four to\n\nfive years, and that it recently had purchased some of its own\n\nshares for approximately $525 apiece.                Once again, however, the\n\nDavenports resisted providing Bragdon with further financial\n\ninformation about the Trust.\n\n             During a subsequent telephone conversation, DeWitt\n\nDavenport      stated   that        the   Trust    would    purchase      Bragdon's\n\nholdings at $600 per share.                 While Bragdon considered this\n\noffer, his attorney advised him that his right to sue the DRT\n\nwould survive any purchase at this price if the Davenports were\n\nmisrepresenting the value of the shares.                   In June 1994, Bragdon\n\nand his attorney went to DeWitt's office to discuss the sale.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fDavenport again declined to provide any financial information\n\nregarding the value of the DRT.         Bragdon’s attorney stated to\n\nDeWitt during that meeting that the Trustees, as fiduciaries,\n\nmust accurately disclose the fair market value of the shares,\n\nand that failing to do so would be a breach of their duty to\n\nBragdon.\n\n           On June 9, 1994, DeWitt Davenport spoke with Bragdon\n\nover the phone.   During this conversation, DeWitt stated that\n\nthe fair market value of the Trust was $600 per share.            On July\n\n27, 1994, Bragdon sold his shares to DRT for $186,000 ($600 per\n\nshare) despite never having received the specific financial\n\ninformation he requested.      In 1996, Bragdon learned that the\n\nestimated value for his shares at the time of the sale actually\n\nranged between $1.45 and $2.42 million.\n\n           On April 1, 1996, Bragdon brought the present action\n\ncharging   defendants   with   breach    of   fiduciary   duty;   unjust\n\nenrichment; violation of the Securities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 78 et seq. (1997); violation of the Massachusetts Uniform\n\nSecurities Act (\"MUSA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 110A (1999); and\n\nintentional misrepresentation.     The unjust enrichment claim was\n\ntried to the court; all other claims were tried to a jury.\n\n           At the conclusion of Bragdon's case, the Davenports\n\nmoved for judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative for\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fa new trial, on all counts.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), 59.   The\n\ndistrict court granted their motion as to Bragdon's claim under\n\nthe   MUSA,    but   otherwise    denied   it.     The   Davenports\n\nunsuccessfully renewed their motion after presenting their case.\n\n\n\n          Eventually, the jury returned a verdict for Bragdon in\n\nthe amount of $1,730,760 on his securities fraud, common law\n\nfraud, and breach of fiduciary duty claims.      After the verdict,\n\nthe Davenports again moved for judgment as a matter of law, or\n\nfor a new trial.     As to the claim for unjust enrichment, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that there was no need for an independent\n\ndetermination because the jury verdict adequately compensated\n\nplaintiff.    In all other respects, the court denied the motion.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                                       II.\n\n          On appeal, the Davenports argue that (1) Bragdon's\n\nsecurities      fraud   claim     is         time-barred;     (2)   Bragdon's\n\nrepresentation by independent counsel precluded his claim for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty; (3) the trial court erred in allowing\n\ntestimony by plaintiff's experts concerning the value of the\n\nDRT; (4) Bragdon presented insufficient evidence of reliance to\n\nsupport   a   common    law    fraud    claim;     (5)   Bragdon    presented\n\ninsufficient evidence of a misrepresentation to support a common\n\nlaw fraud claim; (6) the court erred in allowing testimony\n\nconcerning the Davenports’ personal assets and Trust assets of\n\nwhich the Davenports made use; and (7) the evidence of damages\n\nwas insufficient to support the jury award.                 At oral argument,\n\nhowever, the Davenports’ counsel conceded that an affirmation of\n\nthe jury’s verdict on the breach of fiduciary duty claim would\n\nobviate   the    need   to    consider       unrelated   appellate    issues.\n\nConcluding that such an affirmation is appropriate, we confine\n\nour discussion to appellate issues which implicate this verdict.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n          We start with the standards that govern our review of\n\nthe preserved appellate issues.              We review de novo a district\n\ncourt's grant or denial of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) motion.                See\n\nCollazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp., 149 F.3d 23, 27 (1st\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fCir.    1998).       In   determining       the   propriety       of    the   district\n\ncourt's    action,        we   view   the    evidence       \"in   the    light      most\n\nfavorable      to   the    non-moving       party,    drawing      all    reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor\".             Id. (internal citations omitted).               We\n\nthus will not reverse a denial of a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter    of   law    “unless     the    facts,      seen    in   the    light      most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, as well as inferences reasonably\n\ndrawn therefrom 'lead to but one conclusion - that there is a\n\ntotal failure of evidence to prove the plaintiff’s case.’”\n\nTransAmerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, 107 F.3d 925, 929 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (citations omitted).                In a similar vein, we will not\n\nreverse a denial of a motion for a new trial unless \"the verdict\n\nis so seriously mistaken, so clearly against the law or the\n\nevidence, as to constitute a miscarriage of justice\".                         Id.\n\n            As to arguments the Davenports raise for the first time\n\non appeal, we review only for \"plain error.\"                       See, e.g., Beal\n\nBank,    SSB   v.    Pittorino,       177   F.3d     65,    71    (1st   Cir.    1999)\n\n(considering challenge to unobjected-to jury instruction in a\n\ncivil case).         In this context, error is plain if it causes a\n\nmiscarriage of justice or somehow undermines the integrity of\n\nthe judicial process.           See id. (citing Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS\n\nMetromedia Communications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fB.   Challenge         to   the    Finding    of    Liability     for    Breach    of\n\nFiduciary Duty\n\n            The       Davenports    assert    that       the   jury’s   finding    of\n\nliability for a breach a fiduciary duty was infected by legal\n\nerror.   Specifically, the Davenports contend that the district\n\ncourt, in instructing the jury, erroneously placed the burden on\n\nthem to prove that their conduct in purchasing Bragdon’s shares\n\n\"conformed to their fiduciary obligations.\"                       In making this\n\nargument,    the       Davenports     acknowledge         that    the    burden    is\n\npresumptively theirs under Massachusetts law,                      see Cleary v.\n\nCleary, 692 N.E.2d 955, 958 (Mass. 1998), but make a strained\n\nargument for a burden shift on the basis of a statement in\n\nCleary   that     a    fiduciary’s    burden       \"is    generally     met   if   the\n\nfiduciary shows . . . [that the questioned transaction was made]\n\nwith the advice of independent legal counsel.\"                     Id. at 959.\n\n            The Davenports have little reason to complain about the\n\ndistrict court’s burden-of-proof instruction.                     Prior to trial,\n\nthey submitted to the court a proposed instruction which stated\n\nthat it was       their burden to show that the transaction \"was\n\nadvantageous for the Plaintiff.\"                   Moreover, at trial, they\n\nfailed to articulate a coherent objection to the instruction\n\ngiven.   Finally, they failed to object to the Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n49(a) breach of fiduciary duty question that was put to the\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fjury, which asked whether the Davenports had established by a\n\npreponderance        of   evidence     that      they    had    carried      out     their\n\nfiduciary      obligations      to   Bragdon.           In    view    of   this    triple\n\nwaiver, we ask only whether the jury’s conclusion that there had\n\nbeen a breach of fiduciary duty constitutes a miscarriage of\n\njustice or calls into question the integrity of the judicial\n\nprocess.      See Beal Bank, SSB, 177 F.3d at 71.                    Patently, it does\n\nneither.\n\n              Under Massachusetts law, \"the general rule is that one\n\nacting in a fiduciary capacity for another has the burden of\n\nshowing that a transaction with himself was advantageous for the\n\nperson for whom he was acting.\"                   Cleary, 692 N.E.2d at 958.\n\nHere, there was overwhelming evidence to support the jury’s\n\nconclusion      that      the   Davenports’            deal     with       Bragdon     was\n\nadvantageous for them but disadvantageous for Bragdon, and thus\n\nconstituted      a   breach     of   the     Davenports’        fiduciary      duty     to\n\nBragdon.      Moreover, our review of the record as a whole does not\n\nlead     us    to    conclude        that,       the    Davenports’          deceptions\n\nnotwithstanding,          Bragdon     unjustifiably           proceeded       with    the\n\npurchase.       Under these circumstances, there is no basis for\n\nupsetting the jury’s liability determination.\n\nC.     Challenge to the Damages Award for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f                The Davenports assail the jury’s damages award on three\n\ngrounds.        First, they contend that the district court erred in\n\npermitting Bragdon’s expert witnesses to testify because these\n\nwitnesses, in combination, used an improper and prejudicial\n\nmethod to assess the true worth of plaintiff’s DRT shares.\n\nSecond, they assert that the court erred in allowing Bragdon to\n\ncross-examine DeWitt Davenport about the value of defendants’\n\npersonal assets and Trust assets of which the Davenports made\n\nuse.        Third, they argue that the jury’s damages award was\n\ninsufficiently grounded in the evidence and grossly excessive.\n\nEach of these arguments merits only the briefest of responses.\n\n                The only challenge the Davenports made to Bragdon’s\n\nexperts below was grounded on the fact that Bragdon’s first\n\nexpert, a real estate appraiser named William Curley, used a\n\nvaluation methodology that initially valued in toto all holdings\n\nin which DRT had an interest, and Bragdon’s second expert, an\n\naccountant named Stephen Grizey, then reduced this figure to\n\naccount for the fact that DRT only had a partial interest in\n\nsome       of   the   holdings. 1   In    the   Davenports’   view,   Curley’s\n\ntestimony regarding the total value of the holdings in which DRT\n\n\n       1\n     Although we explicitly address only the preserved challenge\nto the district court’s decision to permit Bragdon’s experts to\ntestify, we believe it worth stating explicitly that the court’s\ndecision was not otherwise plainly erroneous.     See Beal Bank\nSSB, 177 F.3d at 71.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fhad an interest somehow created a possibility that the jury was\n\nmisled into thinking that DRT was far more valuable than was in\n\nfact the case.         Our review of the record persuades us, however,\n\nthat    there    is    no    reason    for    concern    about    jury     confusion;\n\nBragdon’s       experts       clearly     and      coherently     explained        their\n\nmethodology       and       conclusions       as    to   DRT’s    value,     and     the\n\nconclusions      were       amply   supported       by   record   evidence.         The\n\ndistrict court thus acted well within its wide discretion in\n\npermitting Bragdon’s experts to present the jury with their\n\nconclusions.          See Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S.\n\n137, 141-42 (1999) (reviewing for abuse of discretion decision\n\nwhether to admit challenged expert testimony).\n\n            As to the Davenports’ second argument, our review of\n\nthe record persuades us that, due to the overwhelming evidence\n\nof a breach of fiduciary duty and the ample evidence supporting\n\nthe    damages    award,      any     error   in    admitting     evidence    of     the\n\nDavenports’ personal assets and/or Trust assets of which the\n\nDavenports made use was harmless.                  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 61.           And\n\ngiven what we have just said about the evidence supporting the\n\ndamages award, we summarily reject the Davenports’ challenge to\n\nthe foundation and size of the damages award – a challenge, we\n\nadd, that was levied only on appeal.\n\n            Affirmed.         Costs to appellee.\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f",

In April 1991, Bragdon contemplated selling his\n\nshares, and asked the Davenports about the financial condition\n\n                                    -2-\n\fof   the    Trust.      The    Davenports         gave   Bragdon     some   general\n\nfinancial information, but refused to show him the Trust's\n\nfinancial statements.          By way of explanation, Palmer Davenport\n\nshowed him an amendment to the Declaration of Trust which stated\n\nthat shareholders are not entitled to receive past or present\n\nfinancial statements.\n\n             In February 1994, Bragdon hired independent counsel for\n\nassistance in his communications with the Davenports.                       In May\n\n1994,      Bragdon   wrote     to    DeWitt     Davenport      and   requested   an\n\nestimate     of   the   fair    market     value    of   his    shares.     DeWitt\n\nresponded, during a meeting at Bragdon's home, that the Trust\n\nhad experienced financial difficulties during the last four to\n\nfive years, and that it recently had purchased some of its own\n\nshares for approximately $525 apiece.                Once again, however, the\n\nDavenports resisted providing Bragdon with further financial\n\ninformation about the Trust.\n\n             During a subsequent telephone conversation, DeWitt\n\nDavenport      stated   that        the   Trust    would    purchase      Bragdon's\n\nholdings at $600 per share.                 While Bragdon considered this\n\noffer, his attorney advised him that his right to sue the DRT\n\nwould survive any purchase at this price if the Davenports were\n\nmisrepresenting the value of the shares.                   In June 1994, Bragdon\n\nand his attorney went to DeWitt's office to discuss the sale.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fDavenport again declined to provide any financial information\n\nregarding the value of the DRT.         Bragdon’s attorney stated to\n\nDeWitt during that meeting that the Trustees, as fiduciaries,\n\nmust accurately disclose the fair market value of the shares,\n\nand that failing to do so would be a breach of their duty to\n\nBragdon.\n\n           On June 9, 1994, DeWitt Davenport spoke with Bragdon\n\nover the phone.   During this conversation, DeWitt stated that\n\nthe fair market value of the Trust was $600 per share.            On July\n\n27, 1994, Bragdon sold his shares to DRT for $186,000 ($600 per\n\nshare) despite never having received the specific financial\n\ninformation he requested.      In 1996, Bragdon learned that the\n\nestimated value for his shares at the time of the sale actually\n\nranged between $1.45 and $2.42 million.\n\n           On April 1, 1996, Bragdon brought the present action\n\ncharging   defendants   with   breach    of   fiduciary   duty;   unjust\n\nenrichment; violation of the Securities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 78 et seq. (1997); violation of the Massachusetts Uniform\n\nSecurities Act (\"MUSA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 110A (1999); and\n\nintentional misrepresentation.     The unjust enrichment claim was\n\ntried to the court; all other claims were tried to a jury.\n\n           At the conclusion of Bragdon's case, the Davenports\n\nmoved for judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative for\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fa new trial, on all counts.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), 59.   The\n\ndistrict court granted their motion as to Bragdon's claim under\n\nthe   MUSA,    but   otherwise    denied   it.     The   Davenports\n\nunsuccessfully renewed their motion after presenting their case.\n\n\n\n          Eventually, the jury returned a verdict for Bragdon in\n\nthe amount of $1,730,760 on his securities fraud, common law\n\nfraud, and breach of fiduciary duty claims.      After the verdict,\n\nthe Davenports again moved for judgment as a matter of law, or\n\nfor a new trial.     As to the claim for unjust enrichment, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that there was no need for an independent\n\ndetermination because the jury verdict adequately compensated\n\nplaintiff.    In all other respects, the court denied the motion.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                                       II.\n\n          On appeal, the Davenports argue that (1) Bragdon's\n\nsecurities      fraud   claim     is         time-barred;     (2)   Bragdon's\n\nrepresentation by independent counsel precluded his claim for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty; (3) the trial court erred in allowing\n\ntestimony by plaintiff's experts concerning the value of the\n\nDRT; (4) Bragdon presented insufficient evidence of reliance to\n\nsupport   a   common    law    fraud    claim;     (5)   Bragdon    presented\n\ninsufficient evidence of a misrepresentation to support a common\n\nlaw fraud claim; (6) the court erred in allowing testimony\n\nconcerning the Davenports’ personal assets and Trust assets of\n\nwhich the Davenports made use; and (7) the evidence of damages\n\nwas insufficient to support the jury award.                 At oral argument,\n\nhowever, the Davenports’ counsel conceded that an affirmation of\n\nthe jury’s verdict on the breach of fiduciary duty claim would\n\nobviate   the    need   to    consider       unrelated   appellate    issues.\n\nConcluding that such an affirmation is appropriate, we confine\n\nour discussion to appellate issues which implicate this verdict.\n\nA.

Challenge         to   the    Finding    of    Liability     for    Breach    of\n\nFiduciary Duty\n\n            The       Davenports    assert    that       the   jury’s   finding    of\n\nliability for a breach a fiduciary duty was infected by legal\n\nerror.   Specifically, the Davenports contend that the district\n\ncourt, in instructing the jury, erroneously placed the burden on\n\nthem to prove that their conduct in purchasing Bragdon’s shares\n\n\"conformed to their fiduciary obligations.\"                       In making this\n\nargument,    the       Davenports     acknowledge         that    the    burden    is\n\npresumptively theirs under Massachusetts law,                      see Cleary v.\n\nCleary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 958 (Mass. 1998), but make a strained\n\nargument for a burden shift on the basis of a statement in\n\nCleary   that     a    fiduciary’s    burden       \"is    generally     met   if   the\n\nfiduciary shows . . .

Prior to trial,\n\nthey submitted to the court a proposed instruction which stated\n\nthat it was       their burden to show that the transaction \"was\n\nadvantageous for the Plaintiff.\"                   Moreover, at trial, they\n\nfailed to articulate a coherent objection to the instruction\n\ngiven.

In    view    of   this    triple\n\nwaiver, we ask only whether the jury’s conclusion that there had\n\nbeen a breach of fiduciary duty constitutes a miscarriage of\n\njustice or calls into question the integrity of the judicial\n\nprocess.

Moreover, our review of the record as a whole does not\n\nlead     us    to    conclude        that,       the    Davenports’          deceptions\n\nnotwithstanding,          Bragdon     unjustifiably           proceeded       with    the\n\npurchase.

Challenge to the Damages Award for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f                The Davenports assail the jury’s damages award on three\n\ngrounds.        First, they contend that the district court erred in\n\npermitting Bragdon’s expert witnesses to testify because these\n\nwitnesses, in combination, used an improper and prejudicial\n\nmethod to assess the true worth of plaintiff’s DRT shares.\n\nSecond, they assert that the court erred in allowing Bragdon to\n\ncross-examine DeWitt Davenport about the value of defendants’\n\npersonal assets and Trust assets of which the Davenports made\n\nuse.        Third, they argue that the jury’s damages award was\n\ninsufficiently grounded in the evidence and grossly excessive.\n\nEach of these arguments merits only the briefest of responses.\n\n                The only challenge the Davenports made to Bragdon’s\n\nexperts below was grounded on the fact that Bragdon’s first\n\nexpert, a real estate appraiser named William Curley, used a\n\nvaluation methodology that initially valued in toto all holdings\n\nin which DRT had an interest, and Bragdon’s second expert, an\n\naccountant named Stephen Grizey, then reduced this figure to\n\naccount for the fact that DRT only had a partial interest in\n\nsome       of   the   holdings. 1   In    the   Davenports’   view,   Curley’s\n\ntestimony regarding the total value of the holdings in which DRT\n\n\n       1\n     Although we explicitly address only the preserved challenge\nto the district court’s decision to permit Bragdon’s experts to\ntestify, we believe it worth stating explicitly that the court’s\ndecision was not otherwise plainly erroneous.

Our review of the record persuades us, however,\n\nthat    there    is    no    reason    for    concern    about    jury     confusion;\n\nBragdon’s       experts       clearly     and      coherently     explained        their\n\nmethodology       and       conclusions       as    to   DRT’s    value,     and     the\n\nconclusions      were       amply   supported       by   record   evidence.
