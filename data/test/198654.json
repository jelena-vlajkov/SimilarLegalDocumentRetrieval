Appellant, Juan Carlos Cadavid,\r\nchallenges the district court's calculation of his criminal\r\nsentence.  For the reasons fully enunciated herein, we affirm the\r\ndistrict court's determination.\r\n                     I.\r\n                Introduction\r\nOn November 29, 1995, a grand jury indicted Cadavid and\r\nAlbeiro Castrilln for a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent\r\nto distribute from August 19, 1992, until September 4, 1992, in\r\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.  846 (\"count one\"); possession of cocaine\r\nwith intent to distribute and aiding and abetting on August 29,\r\n1992, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.  2\r\n(\"count two\"); Cadavid and Jess Gutirrez with a conspiracy to\r\npossess cocaine with intent to distribute from January 1, 1994,\r\nuntil September 30, 1994, (\"count three\"); possession and\r\ndistribution of cocaine in or about January 1994 (\"count four\");\r\nJune 1994 (\"count five\"); between June and September 1994 (\"count\r\nsix\"); and on September 15, 1994 (\"count seven\").\r\nOn May 27, 1997, pursuant to a plea agreement, Cadavid\r\npled guilty to counts one through seven of the superseding\r\nindictment.  Prior to his sentencing hearing, Cadavid filed\r\nobjections to the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") which were followed\r\nby sentencing memoranda filed by both Cadavid and the government.\r\nOn November 21, 1997, the district court sentenced\r\nCadavid.  At the hearing, the court ruled on objections to the PSR\r\nfiled by Cadavid and rejected his request for a downward departure. \r\nThe district court determined that Cadavid's total offense level\r\nwas a 36 with a criminal history category (\"CHC\") of II. \r\nTherefore, the court found that the applicable U.S.S.G. range was\r\n210 to 262 months.  Accordingly, the court imposed a 228-month\r\nincarceration sentence, representing a partially concurrent\r\ndisposition to an extant 108-month federal sentence Cadavid was\r\ncurrently serving, followed by 60 months of supervised release, and\r\na special monetary assessment of three-hundred and fifty dollars.\r\n                    II.\r\n             The Plea Agreement\r\nThe plea agreement specified that the quantity of\r\nnarcotics attributable to Cadavid was between 50 and 150 kilograms\r\nof cocaine; that because he accepted responsibility under U.S.S.G.\r\n3E1.1(a), Cadavid was entitled to a two-point reduction in his\r\nbase offense level; that because Cadavid had provided the\r\ngovernment with information regarding his own involvement in the\r\noffense within the meaning of U.S.S.G.  3E1.1(b), he was entitled\r\nto a one-point reduction in his base offense level under U.S.S.G.\r\n3E1.1(b)(1); and that the sentence the court imposed would run\r\npartially concurrently with a prior federal sentence Cadavid was\r\nserving in the Southern District of Florida pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n5G1.3(c).  The agreement further stated that \"there is no basis\r\nfor departure.\"\r\nThe agreement also enunciated several disputed issues\r\nbetween the parties.  First, the government explicitly reserved the\r\nright to argue for an upward role adjustment of no more than three\r\npoints for Cadavid's role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n3B1.1.  Cadavid reserved the right to oppose that argument and to\r\nargue that no upward adjustment was appropriate.  Second, Cadavid\r\nreserved his right to contend that his prior 1994 sentence was for\r\nconduct that formed part of the instant offense within the meaning\r\nof U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(a)(1).  The government reserved the right to\r\ndispute this point and oppose any incorrect application of the law. \r\nFinally, the government agreed not to argue that CHC III applies in\r\nthis case.  Pursuant to the plea agreement, Cadavid pled guilty on\r\nMay 27, 1997.\r\n                    III.\r\n           The Presentence Report\r\nThe Probation Department concluded, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n2D1.1 and the quantity of cocaine involved in this case, that\r\nCadavid's base offense level was 36.  They further determined that\r\nan upward adjustment of three points was appropriate considering\r\nCadavid's managerial or supervisory role in a criminal activity\r\nthat involved more than five people. U.S.S.G.  3B1.1(c).  The\r\nProbation Department further credited Cadavid with a three-point\r\ndownward adjustment for acceptance of criminal responsibility \r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  3B1.1(b).  Thus, Cadavid's adjusted base\r\noffense level, as calculated by the Probation Department, was 36.\r\nIn calculating Cadavid's criminal history, the Probation\r\nDepartment found five prior convictions: (1) a 1988 Florida state\r\ncourt conviction for disorderly intoxication to which Cadavid pled\r\nnolo contendere and received an adjudication withheld, a fine and\r\nwas ordered to pay costs; (2) a 1990 Florida state court conviction\r\nfor driving under the influence of alcohol (\"DUI\") for which\r\nCadavid was found guilty, fined, sentenced to fifty hours of\r\ncommunity service followed by six months probation and ordered to\r\nattend a DUI school; (3) a 1990 Florida state court conviction for\r\nbattery to which Cadavid pled nolo contendere and received an\r\nadjudication withheld and an order to pay court costs; (4) a 1991\r\nFlorida state court conviction for DUI to which Cadavid pled nolo\r\ncontendere and received an order to pay a fine; and (5) the 1994\r\nfederal narcotics conviction.  Based upon this history, the\r\nProbation Department determined that Cadavid had six criminal\r\nhistory points: one point for the 1990 DUI conviction pursuant to\r\nU.S.S.G.  4A1.2(c); one point for the 1990 battery conviction\r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(f); one point for the 1991 DUI\r\nconviction pursuant to U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(c); and three points for\r\nthe 1994 narcotics conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G.  4A1.1(a). \r\nTherefore, the Probation Department originally calculated Cadavid's\r\nCHC to be III and the applicable sentencing range to be 235 to 293\r\nmonths.\r\nThe Probation Department next noted that Cadavid was\r\ncurrently serving an undischarged 108-month federal sentence and\r\nthat the court had the discretion to impose a concurrent, partially\r\nconcurrent or consecutive sentence with the prior sentence.\r\nU.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c) (1997).  The Probation Department then\r\nsuggested a partially concurrent sentence and computed the\r\nadditional consecutive component of punishment for Cadavid to be\r\nserved after completion of his extant federal sentence.  See\r\nU.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c) nn. 3-5.  In order to create a theoretical\r\nyardstick upon which to evaluate the proposed section 5G1.3(c)\r\npartial concurrence and the extent of any consecutive component of\r\nthe sentence, the Probation Department consolidated the 1994\r\nconviction and the instant offense by combining the amounts of\r\ncocaine from both offenses (73.995 kilograms, base offense level\r\n36).  Next, they added the three-point leadership enhancement, then\r\nsubtracted three points for acceptance of responsibility.  Since\r\nthey consolidated the two cases, the Probation Department ignored\r\nthe three criminal history points from the 1994 narcotics\r\nconviction and used CHC II in its recommendation.  The Probation\r\nDepartment determined that Cadavid's \"theoretical guideline\r\nsentencing range\" for both the 1994 and 1997 offenses was 210 to\r\n262 months (offense level 33, CHC II).  Thus, the Probation\r\nDepartment concluded that the appropriate incremental punishment\r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c) was to add 118 to 170 months to\r\nCadavid's prior 108-month sentence.\r\n                    IV.\r\n            Cadavid's Objections\r\nTwo months prior to sentencing, on September 17, 1997,\r\nCadavid obtained new counsel.  Cadavid then filed several\r\nobjections to the PSR's criminal history calculation. \r\nSpecifically, he alleged that: (1) the award of one criminal\r\nhistory point for the 1991 DUI conviction was erroneous because he\r\nwas not represented by counsel; (2) the award of one criminal\r\nhistory point for the 1990 battery conviction was erroneous because\r\na sentence of adjudication withheld fails to constitute a judicial\r\ndetermination of guilt; and (3) the award of three criminal history\r\npoints for the 1994 narcotics case was erroneous because it\r\nconstituted the \"same course of conduct as alleged in the\r\nIndictment.\"\r\nThe Probation Department disagreed with each of Cadavid's\r\nobjections finding that: (1) the 1991 conviction, even if no\r\ncounsel was present, was for a misdemeanor and thus eligible to\r\ncount pursuant to Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738 (1994)\r\n(holding that, consistent with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments,\r\nuncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid for use in enhancing\r\npunishment at subsequent conviction); (2) the 1990 \"adjudication\r\nwithheld\" battery conviction was properly counted as a diversionary\r\ndisposition under U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(f); and (3) the 1994 conviction\r\nand this case were separate.\r\nCadavid then filed a sentencing memorandum raising, for\r\nthe first time, the contention that he was entitled to the benefit\r\nof the \"safety valve\" pursuant to U.S.S.G.  5C1.2(5).  Cadavid\r\nalso claimed that there were grounds for departure from the\r\nguidelines, despite the fact that the agreement provided that no\r\nsuch grounds existed.  The five specific grounds he claimed\r\nincluded: (1) that he suffered a physical injury while in prison;\r\n(2) that he would agree to deportation; (3) that his criminal\r\nactivity constituted aberrant behavior; (4) that his criminal\r\nhistory was overstated; and (5) that there were a combination of\r\nthese factors.\r\nPerceiving Cadavid's contentions for a downward departure\r\nas a breach of his pledge under the plea agreement not to seek such\r\na departure, the government objected and withdrew from the\r\nagreement prior to sentencing.  Nonetheless, the withdrawal was of\r\nno effect as the government maintained its original positions as\r\nstated in the agreement.\r\n                     V.\r\n             Sentencing Hearing\r\nAt the sentencing hearing, the district court found that\r\neven if it were to accept Cadavid's challenge to the 1991 DUI\r\nconviction, the two points from the 1990 DUI conviction coupled\r\nwith the battery conviction sufficed to place Cadavid in CHC II. \r\nThe court endorsed the criminal history calculation of the PSR,\r\ngrounded in U.S.S.G. 5G1.3(c), and the determination that Cadavid\r\nhad a CHC of II.  Cadavid objected, asserting that the battery\r\nconviction should not count because an adjudication withheld fails\r\nto constitute a judicial determination or admission of guilt.  The\r\ndistrict court disagreed but went on to hold that, alternatively,\r\neven if it sustained each of Cadavid's objections, a CHC of I\r\nconstituted a \"gross understatement of the severity of this\r\ndefendant's record.\"  The court went on to note that:\r\n           If I took the closest look possible in\r\n[Cadavid's] favor and came to the\r\nconclusion you were right, I've just said\r\nto you it would not make any difference in\r\nmy sentence in this case, because if I did\r\nthat, then I would plainly be forced to\r\nthe conclusion in my mind, to do a fair\r\nsentencing adjudication, to determine that\r\na CHC of \"I\" seriously under-represents\r\nthe severity of this defendant's criminal\r\nrecord.\r\n\nThe district court proceeded to apply CHC II.  The Memorandum of\r\nSentencing Hearing and Report of Statement of Reasons further\r\nilluminates this point.\r\nThe court, citing the PSR, also imposed a three-level\r\nupward adjustment, adding:\r\n           [T]his is not at all a situation in which\r\nMr. Cadavid, who is before me now,\r\nfunctioned in the role comparable to a\r\nforeman.  He was involved in planning and\r\ndirecting methods of operation by the\r\nother participants in the offense charged\r\nhere and I find that the 3B1.1(b)\r\nadjustment of three points is entirely\r\nappropriate.\r\n\nAs to Cadavid's safety valve argument, the court\r\nconcluded that his written proffers lacked both in veracity and\r\ncompleteness.  The court, accordingly, disregarded the safety valve\r\nissue.  The court further rejected Cadavid's contention that the\r\n1994 conviction and the instant case were part of the same course\r\nof conduct and, therefore, the same offense.  In rejecting this\r\nclaim, the court relied upon the Probation Department's proposal\r\nenunciated in the PSR and consolidated the 1994 conviction with the\r\ncurrent case while disregarding the three criminal history points\r\narising from the 1994 conviction.  The court concluded that\r\nCadavid's sentencing guideline range was 210 to 262 months, his\r\ntotal offense level was 36, and his CHC was II.\r\nThe court next considered Cadavid's claims for a downward\r\ndeparture.  Following oral argument, the court rejected Cadavid's\r\ncontentions that a downward departure was appropriate.  The court\r\nexamined each of Cadavid's claims and rejected them in turn.\r\nIn conclusion, the court imposed a sentence of 228 months\r\nupon Cadavid.  Exercising its discretion under U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c),\r\nthe court ordered that the sentence be partially concurrent with\r\nthe 108-month sentence Cadavid was currently serving. See U.S.S.G.\r\n5G1.3(c) n.5.  The court obviously had considered the relevant\r\nguidelines factors in imposing a partially concurrent sentence. \r\nTherefore, the court ordered Cadavid to serve 120 months beyond the\r\ncompletion of his sentence in the 1994 narcotics case.\r\n                    VI.\r\n                 The Issues\r\nThe following issues are now before this Court: (1)\r\nwhether the district court committed plain error in assessing\r\nCadavid a three-point upward adjustment under U.S.S.G.  3B1.1; (2)\r\nwhether the district court erred in calculating Cadavid's CHC; (3)\r\nwhether the district court committed clear error in determining\r\nthat Cadavid failed to meet the requirements of the \"safety valve\"\r\nprovision in U.S.S.G.  5C1.2 and 2D1.1(b)(4); and (4) whether\r\nthis Court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court's\r\ndiscretionary refusal to depart downward from the otherwise\r\napplicable Guidelines sentencing range.\r\n                    VII.\r\n       Cadavid's Role in the Offense\r\nAdopting the recommendation of the PSR, the district\r\ncourt increased Cadavid's base offense level by three points,\r\nconcluding that he held a leadership or supervisory role over at\r\nleast five other persons in the drug enterprise.  Cadavid\r\nchallenges the facts underlying the adjustment, specifically\r\nconcerning the number of persons involved, and contends that the\r\ncourt clearly erred in its upward role in the offense adjustment.\r\nThe Guidelines provide for a three-level enhancement of\r\na defendant's offense level if he acts as a manager or supervisor\r\nof a criminal enterprise that either includes five or more\r\nparticipants (including the defendant) or is \"otherwise extensive.\"\r\nSee U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(b) (1997).  This determination requires a\r\ntwo-step showing: (1) \"evidence that a defendant, in committing the\r\ncrime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for\r\noverseeing the activities of, at least one other person,\" United\r\nStates v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 1996); and (2) that the\r\ncriminal scheme had five or more participants or was \"otherwise\r\nextensive.\"  U.S.S.G.  3B1.1(b) (1997).  The specific contours of\r\nthe terms manager and supervisor are not elucidated.  However, the\r\nguidelines offer direction to courts in making the distinction\r\nbetween a manager/supervisor and a leader/organizer.  The factors\r\nidentified are:\r\n           [t]he exercise of decision making\r\nauthority, the nature of participation in\r\nthe commission of the offense, the\r\nrecruitment of accomplices, the claimed\r\nright to a larger share of the fruits of\r\nthe crime, the degree of participation in\r\nplanning or organizing the offense, the\r\nnature and scope of the illegal activity,\r\nand the degree of control and authority\r\nexercised over others.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.1, n.4 (1997).\r\nWe review role in the offense determinations, steeped in\r\nthe facts of the case, under a clearly-erroneous standard.  See\r\nUnited States v. Fontana, 50 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing\r\nUnited States v. Ovalle-Mrquez, 36 F.3d 212, 225 (1st Cir. 1994)). \r\n\"[B]arring a mistake of law . . . 'battles over a defendant's\r\nstatus . . . will almost always be won or lost in the district\r\ncourt.'\"  United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(quoting United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.\r\n1995)).    Cadavid contends that the evidence presented does not\r\nclearly identify five separate persons and that the evidence does\r\nnot support Cadavid's upward adjustment as a manager or supervisor. \r\nWe disagree.  The PSR concluded that there were seven members of\r\nthe 1994 conspiracy: (1) Cadavid; (2) John Freddy Cadavid;\r\n(3) Jess Gutirrez; (4) Fabio Pulgarn; (5) Ivn Ricuarte; (6) an\r\nunknown Hispanic male; and (7) a second unknown Hispanic male. \r\nBased upon this report and the record, the court concluded that\r\nthere were more than five participants in the conspiracy.  We find\r\nthis ruling is not clearly erroneous.  Even if, as Cadavid asserts,\r\none were to concede that the two unknown Hispanic males were either\r\nthe same person or another named member of the conspiracy, we still\r\ncount five participants.\r\nFurthermore, we find the record clearly supports the fact\r\nthat Cadavid exercised control over the activities of at least one\r\nother person.  We find the record to be replete with instances of\r\nCadavid exercising a managerial or supervisory role.  A few\r\nexamples include: Cadavid's supervision, management and payment of\r\nGutirrez and Pulgarn in the January 1994 cocaine transaction;\r\nCadavid's hiring of Pulgarn and Gutirrez to transport cocaine\r\nfrom Massachusetts to New York; Castrilln's statements that he\r\nworked for Cadavid; and Cadavid identifying one of the unknown\r\nHispanic males as his worker during a cocaine transaction in\r\nSeptember 1994.  Therefore, we conclude that the district court's\r\nrole in the offense determination was not clearly erroneous.\r\n                   VIII.\r\nCadavid's Criminal History Category (\"CHC\")\r\nCadavid argues that the court improperly calculated his\r\nCHC by erroneously including points in its tabulation. \r\nSpecifically, he maintains that (1) the 1990 battery conviction\r\nwhich resulted in a judgment of \"adjudication withheld\" and where\r\nhe was not assisted by counsel and (2) the 1991 DUI conviction\r\nwhich resulted in a work release sentence and under which he was\r\nnot represented by counsel, should be excluded from the computation\r\nof his CHC.  He further contends that the court failed to resolve\r\nthis dispute and instead relied upon U.S.S.G.  4A1.3 to upwardly\r\ndepart.\r\nWe begin by examining the district court's calculation. \r\nThe court stated that it was relying upon the PSR and Cadavid's\r\nentire record of past malfeasance to determine that CHC II was the\r\nproper category.  The court swiftly agreed with the PSR's criminal\r\nhistory calculation.  As an alternative basis, the court found that\r\nCHC I unjustly under-represented Cadavid's criminal past.  See\r\nU.S.S.G.  4A1.3 (1997).  \r\nWe agree with the court's determination and the PSR's\r\ncalculation that Cadavid's criminal history places him in CHC II. \r\nWe find that combining Cadavid's criminal history points from his\r\n1989 DUI conviction with his 1990 battery conviction places him in\r\nCHC II.  Alternatively, we turn to the court's alternative\r\ndeparture ground.\r\nWe employ a tripartite test to review a district court's\r\ndeparture decision on CHC under U.S.S.G.  4A1.3:\r\n           First, we determine as a theoretical\r\nmatter whether the stated ground for\r\ndeparture is permissible under the\r\nguidelines.  If the ground is\r\ntheoretically appropriate, we next examine\r\nwhether it finds adequate factual support\r\nin the record.  If so, we must probe the\r\ndegree of the departure in order to verify\r\nits reasonableness.\r\n\nUnited States v. Dethelefs, 123 F.3d 39, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1997).   \r\nSection 4A1.3 of the guidelines states that \"[i]f\r\nreliable information indicates that the CHC does not adequately\r\nreflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct\r\n. . . the court may consider imposing a sentence departure from the\r\notherwise applicable guideline range.\"  In this case, the district\r\ncourt concluded that \"a CHC of 'I' seriously under-represent[ed]\r\nthe severity of [Cadavid]'s criminal record.\"  Thus, the reasons\r\nthe court announced, nearly parroting the language of the\r\nguideline, are permissible and appropriate.\r\nNext, we turn to whether there is an adequate factual\r\nfoundation to support the departure.  The district court expounded\r\nthat even if it were to find merit in Cadavid's objections to the\r\nbattery and DUI convictions, it would depart upward to CHC II. \r\nThis, as discussed above, is clearly within the province of the\r\ncourt and supported by the record.  Since 1988, Cadavid has been a\r\nfrequent presence in our judicial system.  He has two DUI\r\nconvictions and one conviction each for disorderly intoxication,\r\nbattery, and narcotics offenses.  Moreover, at the time of\r\nsentencing, Cadavid was incarcerated, serving a 108-month federal \r\nsentence for narcotics trafficking.  Given this relatively recent\r\nyet quite extensive illicit background, we find the district court\r\ncorrectly concluded that CHC I severely under-represented Cadavid's\r\npast illegal conduct.\r\nFinally, we examine the reasonableness of the degree of\r\nthe departure.  \"This third step involves what is quintessentially\r\na judgment call.\"  United States v. Daz-Villafae, 874 F.2d 43, 51\r\n(1st Cir. 1989).  \"Since the trial judge is in the trenches and is\r\napt to be best informed about the offense and the offender, '[w]e\r\nwill not lightly disturb decisions . . . implicating degrees of\r\ndeparture.'\"  United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 336 (1st Cir.\r\n1990)(citing Daz-Villafae, 874 F.2d at 50).  However, judicial\r\ndiscretion in departure decisions is not unfettered.  See Ocasio,\r\n914 F.2d at 336.  Congress has statutorily determined that circuit\r\ncourts are to consider the factors ordinarily examined in\r\nsentencing decisions.  See 18 U.S.C.  3742(e)(3)(A).  Thus, we\r\n\"look not only to the particular circumstance warranting departure\r\nin the first place, but to the overall aggregate of known\r\ncircumstances pertaining to the offense of conviction and to the\r\noffender who committed it.\"  Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 337.  In the\r\ninstant case, we find that the degree of departure was reasonable\r\ngiven Cadavid's felonious background, which is replete with\r\nconvictions.  In addition, the district court, in effect, imposed\r\na partially concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c). \r\nThis amply reduced the actual time Cadavid will serve.  The CHC\r\ncalculation and resultant sentence in this case are proportionate\r\nto the criminal history.\r\nMoreover, the issue of whether a judgment of\r\n\"adjudication withheld\" constitutes a predicate conviction under\r\nthe guidelines, has been decided by this Court.  In United States\r\nv. Pierce, 60 F.3d 886 (1st Cir. 1995), we held that a prior\r\nwithheld adjudication in which the defendant pled nolo contendere\r\nconstituted a predicate conviction for purposes of the \"career\r\noffender\" guideline.  U.S.S.G.  4B1.1.  Furthermore, U.S.S.G.\r\n4A1.2(f) provides that \"[a] diversionary disposition resulting\r\nfrom a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere,\r\nin a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under  4A1.1(c)\r\n[the CHR Guideline] even if a conviction is not formally entered.\" \r\nThe guidelines define a prior sentence as \"any sentence previously\r\nimposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial,\r\nor plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant\r\noffense.\"  U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(a)(1) (1997).  Thus, we find that the\r\ndistrict court's calculation of criminal history points based upon\r\nCadavid's 1990 battery conviction was correct.\r\nCombining the criminal history point from Cadavid's 1990\r\nbattery conviction with the criminal history point to which Cadavid\r\nhas conceded for DUI puts his CHC at II.  Therefore, we need not\r\nexplore whether the district court considered his uncounseled 1991\r\nDUI conviction in calculating his CHC.\r\n                    IX.\r\n          \"Safety Valve\" Provision\r\nThe next issue we analyze is whether the district court\r\ncommitted clear error in determining that Cadavid failed to meet\r\nthe requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision in U.S.S.G.\r\n5C1.2 and 2D1.1(b)(4).  In order to qualify for relief under the\r\n\"safety valve\" provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant\r\nmust satisfy the following five criteria: (1) not have more than\r\none criminal history point; (2) not have used violence or possessed\r\na firearm during commission of the offense; (3) not have killed or\r\nseriously injured another person; (4) not have been a leader or\r\nmanager in the offense; and (5) have truthfully provided the\r\ngovernment with all information and evidence he possesses\r\nconcerning the offense.  See U.S.S.G.  5C1.2 (1997).  The burden\r\nis upon the defendant to convince the court that he meets the\r\nrequirements.  See United States v. Montaez, 82 F.3d 520, 523 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (citing United States v. Thompson, 81 F.3d 877, 880 (9th\r\nCir. 1996) (stating that \"it is the court, and not the Government,\r\nthat determines whether a defendant qualifies for relief under\r\n5C1.2\")).  We review district court factual determinations of\r\nentitlement to relief under U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(4) and 5C1.2 for\r\nclear error.  See United States v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 73 n.6 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (citing United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517,\r\n527 (1st Cir. 1996)).\r\nThe district court found that Cadavid failed to meet two\r\nof the five requirements for \"safety valve\" qualification: Having\r\nno more than one criminal history point and being a supervisor or\r\nmanager of the criminal enterprise.  Cadavid challenges both\r\nfindings and also asserts that the court's determination of the\r\nlast criteria, the issue of whether defendant had truthfully\r\nprovided the government with all information relating to the\r\noffense, was clouded by the earlier findings on the other criteria.\r\nWe find the district court was not clearly erroneous in\r\nconcluding that Cadavid failed to meet the requisites under the\r\nGuidelines.  First, as discussed previously, we find that Cadavid\r\nfails both the criminal history point and supervisor or manager\r\nrequirements.  Cadavid has failed to carry his burden in convincing\r\nthe court that he qualifies for the safety valve provision.  In\r\nthis case, the government noted a number of deficiencies in\r\nCadavid's written proffer and the court found that his submission\r\n\"came nowhere near satisfying the requirements of the safety valve\r\nprovision.\"  The Judge continued, \"I think he has withheld instead\r\nof being fully candid with the Court as well as with the Government\r\nin what he has filed in this case.\"  \"Full disclosure is the price\r\nthat Congress has attached to relief under the statute.\"  Montaez,\r\n82 F.3d at 523 (citing United States v. Flanagan, 80 F.3d 143,\r\n146-47 (5th Cir. 1996)).  Cadavid's submission fails to meet the\r\nstandard.\r\n                     X.\r\n        Refusal to Downwardly Depart\r\nOur final determination is whether the district court\r\nimproperly refused to depart downward from the otherwise applicable\r\nguideline sentencing range.  The government asserts that the\r\ndistrict court's refusal to downwardly depart is not reviewable.\r\nCadavid asserted five separate grounds allegedly\r\njustifying a downward departure: (1) a physical injury sustained\r\nwhile in prison; (2) his agreement to be deported; (3) that his\r\ncriminal history constituted aberrant behavior; (4) that his\r\ncriminal history was overstated; and (5) a catch-all totality of\r\nthe circumstances category.\r\nThe rule of this Circuit is that \"a criminal defendant\r\ncannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary\r\ndecision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.\"\r\nUnited States v. Robbio, No. 98-1785, 1999 WL 551045 at *6 (1st\r\nCir. Aug. 2, 1999) (citing United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93,\r\n109 (1st Cir. 1999)).  Review of the sentencing hearing memorandum\r\nand transcript convince us that the district court fully\r\ncomprehended its authority to depart downward in an appropriate\r\ncase, but denied Cadavid's motion because of its perceived lack of\r\nmerit.  Because Cadavid challenges the district court's exercise of\r\ndiscretion not to depart downward, we do not have jurisdiction to\r\nentertain his argument.  See United States v. Field, 39 F.3d 15, 21\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  Furthermore, the lion's share of Cadavid's\r\ncurrent arguments for a downward departure is based on grounds he\r\ndid not raise in the district court, a fact that further forecloses\r\nour consideration of those grounds.  See id.                               XI.\r\n                 Conclusion\r\nIn accordance with the foregoing, we AFFIRM the district\r\ncourt's sentence calculation.\n",

For the reasons fully enunciated herein, we affirm the district court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Introduction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 1995, a grand jury indicted Cadavid and Albeiro Castrillon for a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute from August 19, 1992, until September 4, 1992, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (\"count one\"); possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and aiding and abetting on August 29, 1992, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (\"count two\"); Cadavid and Jesus Gutierrez with a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute from January 1, 1994, until September 30, 1994, (\"count three\"); possession and distribution of cocaine in or about January 1994 (\"count four\"); June 1994 (\"count five\"); between June and September 1994 (\"count six\"); and on September 15, 1994 (\"count seven\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 27, 1997, pursuant to a plea agreement, Cadavid pled guilty to counts one through seven of the superseding indictment. Prior to his sentencing hearing, Cadavid filed objections to the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") which were followed by sentencing memoranda filed by both Cadavid and the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 1997, the district court sentenced Cadavid. At the hearing, the court ruled on objections to the PSR filed by Cadavid and rejected his request for a downward departure. The district court determined that Cadavid's total offense level was a 36 with a criminal history category (\"CHC\") of II. Therefore, the court found that the applicable U.S.S.G. range was 210 to 262 months. Accordingly, the court imposed a 228-month incarceration sentence, representing a partially concurrent disposition to an extant 108-month federal sentence Cadavid was currently serving, followed by 60 months of supervised release, and a special monetary assessment of three-hundred and fifty dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement specified that the quantity of narcotics attributable to Cadavid was between 50 and 150 kilograms of cocaine; that because he accepted responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a), Cadavid was entitled to a two-point reduction in his base offense level; that because Cadavid had provided the government with information regarding his own involvement in the offense within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), he was entitled to a one-point reduction in his base offense level under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(1); and that the sentence the court imposed would run partially concurrently with a prior federal sentence Cadavid was serving in the Southern District of Florida pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). The agreement further stated that \"there is no basis for departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement also enunciated several disputed issues between the parties. First, the government explicitly reserved the right to argue for an upward role adjustment of no more than three points for Cadavid's role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. Cadavid reserved the right to oppose that argument and to argue that no upward adjustment was appropriate. Second, Cadavid reserved his right to contend that his prior 1994 sentence was for conduct that formed part of the instant offense within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(1). The government reserved the right to dispute this point and oppose any incorrect application of the law. Finally, the government agreed not to argue that CHC III applies in this case. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Cadavid pled guilty on May 27, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Presentence Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department concluded, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 and the quantity of cocaine involved in this case, that Cadavid's base offense level was 36. They further determined that an upward adjustment of three points was appropriate considering Cadavid's managerial or supervisory role in a criminal activity that involved more than five people. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c). The Probation Department further credited Cadavid with a three-point downward adjustment for acceptance of criminal responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b). Thus, Cadavid's adjusted base offense level, as calculated by the Probation Department, was 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In calculating Cadavid's criminal history, the Probation Department found five prior convictions: (1) a 1988 Florida state court conviction for disorderly intoxication to which Cadavid pled nolo contendere and received an adjudication withheld, a fine and was ordered to pay costs; (2) a 1990 Florida state court conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (\"DUI\") for which Cadavid was found guilty, fined, sentenced to fifty hours of community service followed by six months probation and ordered to attend a DUI school; (3) a 1990 Florida state court conviction for battery to which Cadavid pled nolo contendere and received an adjudication withheld and an order to pay court costs; (4) a 1991 Florida state court conviction for DUI<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to which Cadavid pled nolo contendere and received an order to pay a fine;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (5) the 1994 federal narcotics conviction. Based upon this history, the Probation Department determined that Cadavid had six criminal history points: one point for the 1990 DUI conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c); one point for the 1990 battery conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f); one point for the 1991 DUI conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c); and three points for the 1994 narcotics conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(a). Therefore, the Probation Department originally calculated Cadavid's CHC to be III and the applicable sentencing range to be 235 to 293 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department next noted that Cadavid was currently serving an undischarged 108-month federal sentence and that the court had the discretion to impose a concurrent, partially concurrent or consecutive sentence with the prior sentence. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) (1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Probation Department then suggested a partially concurrent sentence and computed the additional consecutive component of punishment for Cadavid to be served after completion of his extant federal sentence. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) nn. 3-5. In order to create a theoretical yardstick upon which to evaluate the proposed section 5G1.3(c) partial concurrence and the extent of any consecutive component of the sentence, the Probation Department consolidated the 1994 conviction and the instant offense by combining the amounts of cocaine from both offenses (73.995 kilograms, base offense level 36). Next, they added the three-point leadership enhancement, then subtracted three points for acceptance of responsibility. Since they consolidated the two cases, the Probation Department ignored the three criminal history points from the 1994 narcotics conviction and used CHC II in its recommendation. The Probation Department determined that Cadavid's \"theoretical guideline sentencing range\" for both the 1994 and 1997 offenses was 210 to 262 months (offense level 33, CHC II). Thus, the Probation Department concluded that the appropriate incremental punishment pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) was to add 118 to 170 months to Cadavid's prior 108-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid's Objections</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two months prior to sentencing, on September 17, 1997, Cadavid obtained new counsel. Cadavid then filed several objections to the PSR's criminal history calculation. Specifically, he alleged that: (1) the award of one criminal history point for the 1991 DUI conviction was erroneous because he was not represented by counsel; (2) the award of one criminal history point for the 1990 battery conviction was erroneous because a sentence of adjudication withheld fails to constitute a judicial determination of guilt; and (3) the award of three criminal history points for the 1994 narcotics case was erroneous because it constituted the \"same course of conduct as alleged in the Indictment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department disagreed with each of Cadavid's objections finding that: (1) the 1991 conviction, even if no counsel was present, was for a misdemeanor and thus eligible to count pursuant to Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738 (1994) (holding that, consistent with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid for use in enhancing punishment at subsequent conviction); (2) the 1990 \"adjudication withheld\" battery conviction was properly counted as a diversionary disposition under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f); and (3) the 1994 conviction and this case were separate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid then filed a sentencing memorandum raising, for the first time, the contention that he was entitled to the benefit of the \"safety valve\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(5). Cadavid also claimed that there were grounds for departure from the guidelines, despite the fact that the agreement provided that no such grounds existed. The five specific grounds he claimed included: (1) that he suffered a physical injury while in prison; (2) that he would agree to deportation; (3) that his criminal activity constituted aberrant behavior; (4) that his criminal history was overstated; and (5) that there were a combination of these factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perceiving Cadavid's contentions for a downward departure as a breach of his pledge under the plea agreement not to seek such a departure, the government objected and withdrew from the agreement prior to sentencing. Nonetheless, the withdrawal was of no effect as the government maintained its original positions as stated in the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Sentencing Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court found that even if it were to accept Cadavid's challenge to the 1991 DUI conviction, the two points from the 1990 DUI conviction coupled with the battery conviction sufficed to place Cadavid in CHC II. The court endorsed the criminal history calculation of the PSR, grounded in U.S.S.G. 5G1.3(c), and the determination that Cadavid had a CHC of II. Cadavid objected, asserting that the battery conviction should not count because an adjudication withheld fails to constitute a judicial determination or admission of guilt. The district court disagreed but went on to hold that, alternatively, even if it sustained each of Cadavid's objections, a CHC of I constituted a \"gross understatement of the severity of this defendant's record.\" The court went on to note that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If I took the closest look possible in [Cadavid's] favor and came to the conclusion you were right, I've just said to you it would not make any difference in my sentence in this case, because if I did that, then I would plainly be forced to the conclusion in my mind, to do a fair sentencing adjudication, to determine that a CHC of \"I\" seriously under-represents the severity of this defendant's criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court proceeded to apply CHC II. The Memorandum of Sentencing Hearing and Report of Statement of Reasons further illuminates this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, citing the PSR, also imposed a three-level upward adjustment, adding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his is not at all a situation in which Mr. Cadavid, who is before me now, functioned in the role comparable to a foreman. He was involved in planning and directing methods of operation by the other participants in the offense charged here and I find that the 3B1.1(b) adjustment of three points is entirely appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Cadavid's safety valve argument, the court concluded that his written proffers lacked both in veracity and completeness. The court, accordingly, disregarded the safety valve issue. The court further rejected Cadavid's contention that the 1994 conviction and the instant case were part of the same course of conduct and, therefore, the same offense. In rejecting this claim, the court relied upon the Probation Department's proposal enunciated in the PSR and consolidated the 1994 conviction with the current case while disregarding the three criminal history points arising from the 1994 conviction. The court concluded that Cadavid's sentencing guideline range was 210 to 262 months, his total offense level was 36, and his CHC was II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court next considered Cadavid's claims for a downward departure. Following oral argument, the court rejected Cadavid's contentions that a downward departure was appropriate. The court examined each of Cadavid's claims and rejected them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the court imposed a sentence of 228 months upon Cadavid. Exercising its discretion under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c), the court ordered that the sentence be partially concurrent with the 108-month sentence Cadavid was currently serving. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) n.5. The court obviously had considered the relevant guidelines factors in imposing a partially concurrent sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Therefore, the court ordered Cadavid to serve 120 months beyond the completion of his sentence in the 1994 narcotics case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following issues are now before this Court: (1) whether the district court committed plain error in assessing Cadavid a three-point upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1; (2) whether the district court erred in calculating Cadavid's CHC; (3) whether the district court committed clear error in determining that Cadavid failed to meet the requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision in U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5C1.2 and 2D1.1(b)(4); and (4) whether this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court's discretionary refusal to depart downward from the otherwise applicable Guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid's Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adopting the recommendation of the PSR, the district court increased Cadavid's base offense level by three points, concluding that he held a leadership or supervisory role over at least five other persons in the drug enterprise. Cadavid challenges the facts underlying the adjustment, specifically concerning the number of persons involved, and contends that the court clearly erred in its upward role in the offense adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines provide for a three-level enhancement of a defendant's offense level if he acts as a manager or supervisor of a criminal enterprise that either includes five or more participants (including the defendant) or is \"otherwise extensive.\" See U.S.S.G.  &#167; 3B1.1(b) (1997). This determination requires a two-step showing: (1) \"evidence that a defendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at least one other person,\" United States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 1996); and (2) that the criminal scheme had five or more participants or was \"otherwise extensive.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) (1997). The specific contours of the terms manager and supervisor are not elucidated. However, the guidelines offer direction to courts in making the distinction between a manager/supervisor and a leader/organizer. The factors identified are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, n.4 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review role in the offense determinations, steeped in the facts of the case, under a clearly-erroneous standard. See United States v. Fontana, 50 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 225 (1st Cir. 1994)). \"[B]arring a mistake of law . . . 'battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the district court.'\" United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995)). Cadavid contends that the evidence presented does not clearly identify five separate persons and that the evidence does not support Cadavid's upward adjustment as a manager or supervisor. We disagree. The PSR concluded that there were seven members of the 1994 conspiracy: (1) Cadavid; (2) John Freddy Cadavid; (3) Jesus Gutierrez; (4) Fabio Pulgarn; (5) Ivan Ricuarte; (6) an unknown Hispanic male; and (7) a second unknown Hispanic male. Based upon this report and the record, the court concluded that there were more than five participants in the conspiracy. We find this ruling is not clearly erroneous. Even if, as Cadavid asserts, one were to concede that the two unknown Hispanic males were either the same person or another named member of the conspiracy, we still count five participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we find the record clearly supports the fact that Cadavid exercised control over the activities of at least one other person. We find the record to be replete with instances of Cadavid exercising a managerial or supervisory role. A few examples include: Cadavid's supervision, management and payment of Gutierrez and Pulgarn in the January 1994 cocaine transaction; Cadavid's hiring of Pulgarn and Gutierrez to transport cocaine from Massachusetts to New York; Castrillon's statements that he worked for Cadavid; and Cadavid identifying one of the unknown Hispanic males as his worker during a cocaine transaction in September 1994. Therefore, we conclude that the district court's role in the offense determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VIII.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid's Criminal History Category (\"CHC\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid argues that the court improperly calculated his CHC by erroneously including points in its tabulation. Specifically, he maintains that (1) the 1990 battery conviction which resulted in a judgment of \"adjudication withheld\" and where he was not assisted by counsel and (2) the 1991 DUI conviction which resulted in a work release sentence and under which he was not represented by counsel, should be excluded from the computation of his CHC. He further contends that the court failed to resolve this dispute and instead relied upon U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 to upwardly depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by examining the district court's calculation. The court stated that it was relying upon the PSR and Cadavid's entire record of past malfeasance to determine that CHC II was the proper category. The court swiftly agreed with the PSR's criminal history calculation. As an alternative basis, the court found that CHC I unjustly under-represented Cadavid's criminal past. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the court's determination and the PSR's calculation that Cadavid's criminal history places him in CHC II. We find that combining Cadavid's criminal history points from his 1989 DUI conviction with his 1990 battery conviction places him in CHC II. Alternatively, we turn to the court's alternative departure ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We employ a tripartite test to review a district court's departure decision on CHC under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3:First, we determine as a theoretical matter whether the stated ground for departure is permissible under the guidelines. If the ground is theoretically appropriate, we next examine whether it finds adequate factual support in the record. If so, we must probe the degree of the departure in order to verify its reasonableness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Dethelefs, 123 F.3d 39, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4A1.3 of the guidelines states that \"[i]f reliable information indicates that the CHC does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct . . . the court may consider imposing a sentence departure from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\" In this case, the district court concluded that \"a CHC of 'I' seriously under-represent[ed] the severity of [Cadavid]'s criminal record.\" Thus, the reasons the court announced, nearly parroting the language of the guideline, are permissible and appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we turn to whether there is an adequate factual foundation to support the departure. The district court expounded that even if it were to find merit in Cadavid's objections to the battery and DUI convictions, it would depart upward to CHC II. This, as discussed above, is clearly within the province of the court and supported by the record. Since 1988, Cadavid has been a frequent presence in our judicial system. He has two DUI convictions and one conviction each for disorderly intoxication, battery, and narcotics offenses. Moreover, at the time of sentencing, Cadavid was incarcerated, serving a 108-month federal sentence for narcotics trafficking. Given this relatively recent yet quite extensive illicit background, we find the district court correctly concluded that CHC I severely under-represented Cadavid's past illegal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we examine the reasonableness of the degree of the departure. \"This third step involves what is quintessentially a judgment call.\" United States v. Daz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 51 (1st Cir. 1989). \"Since the trial judge is in the trenches and is apt to be best informed about the offense and the offender, '[w]e will not lightly disturb decisions . . . implicating degrees of departure.'\" United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 336 (1st Cir. 1990)(citing Daz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 50). However, judicial discretion in departure decisions is not unfettered. See Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 336. Congress has statutorily determined that circuit courts are to consider the factors ordinarily examined in sentencing decisions. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(3)(A). Thus, we \"look not only to the particular circumstance warranting departure in the first place, but to the overall aggregate of known circumstances pertaining to the offense of conviction and to the offender who committed it.\" Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 337. In the instant case, we find that the degree of departure was reasonable given Cadavid's felonious background, which is replete with convictions. In addition, the district court, in effect, imposed a partially concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). This amply reduced the actual time Cadavid will serve. The CHC calculation and resultant sentence in this case are proportionate to the criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the issue of whether a judgment of \"adjudication withheld\" constitutes a predicate conviction under the guidelines, has been decided by this Court. In United States v. Pierce, 60 F.3d 886 (1st Cir. 1995), we held that a prior withheld adjudication in which the defendant pled nolo contendere constituted a predicate conviction for purposes of the \"career offender\" guideline. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. Furthermore, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f) provides that \"[a] diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under &#167; 4A1.1(c) [the CHR Guideline] even if a conviction is not formally entered.\" The guidelines define a prior sentence as \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(1) (1997). Thus, we find that the district court's calculation of criminal history points based upon Cadavid's 1990 battery conviction was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combining the criminal history point from Cadavid's 1990 battery conviction with the criminal history point to which Cadavid has conceded for DUI puts his CHC at II. Therefore, we need not explore whether the district court considered his uncounseled 1991 DUI conviction in calculating his CHC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IX.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Safety Valve\" Provision</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next issue we analyze is whether the district court committed clear error in determining that Cadavid failed to meet the requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision in U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5C1.2 and 2D1.1(b)(4). In order to qualify for relief under the \"safety valve\" provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant must satisfy the following five criteria: (1) not have more than one criminal history point; (2) not have used violence or possessed a firearm during commission of the offense; (3) not have killed or seriously injured another person; (4) not have been a leader or manager in the offense; and (5) have truthfully provided the government with all information and evidence he possesses concerning the offense. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2 (1997). The burden is upon the defendant to convince the court that he meets the requirements. See United States v. Montanez, 82 F.3d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing United States v. Thompson, 81 F.3d 877, 880 (9th Cir. 1996) (stating that \"it is the court, and not the Government, that determines whether a defendant qualifies for relief under &#167; 5C1.2\")). We review district court factual determinations of entitlement to relief under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(b)(4) and 5C1.2 for clear error. See United States v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 73 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 527 (1st Cir. 1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Cadavid failed to meet two of the five requirements for \"safety valve\" qualification: Having no more than one criminal history point and being a supervisor or manager of the criminal enterprise. Cadavid challenges both findings and also asserts that the court's determination of the last criteria, the issue of whether defendant had truthfully provided the government with all information relating to the offense, was clouded by the earlier findings on the other criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the district court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that Cadavid failed to meet the requisites under the Guidelines. First, as discussed previously, we find that Cadavid fails both the criminal history point and supervisor or manager requirements. Cadavid has failed to carry his burden in convincing the court that he qualifies for the safety valve provision. In this case, the government noted a number of deficiencies in Cadavid's written proffer and the court found that his submission \"came nowhere near satisfying the requirements of the safety valve provision.\" The Judge continued, \"I think he has withheld instead of being fully candid with the Court as well as with the Government in what he has filed in this case.\" \"Full disclosure is the price that Congress has attached to relief under the statute.\" Montanez, 82 F.3d at 523 (citing United States v. Flanagan, 80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir. 1996)). Cadavid's submission fails to meet the standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">X.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Refusal to Downwardly Depart</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our final determination is whether the district court improperly refused to depart downward from the otherwise applicable guideline sentencing range. The government asserts that the district court's refusal to downwardly depart is not reviewable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid asserted five separate grounds allegedly justifying a downward departure: (1) a physical injury sustained while in prison; (2) his agreement to be deported; (3) that his criminal history constituted aberrant behavior; (4) that his criminal history was overstated; and (5) a catch-all totality of the circumstances category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule of this Circuit is that \"a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.\" United States v. Robbio, 186 F.3d 37, 44-45 (1st Cir.1999) (citing United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 109 (1st Cir.1999)). Review of the sentencing hearing memorandum and transcript convince us that the district court fully comprehended its authority to depart downward in an appropriate case, but denied Cadavid's motion because of its perceived lack of merit. Because Cadavid challenges the district court's exercise of discretion not to depart downward, we do not have jurisdiction to entertain his argument. See United States v. Field, 39 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 1994). Furthermore, the lion's share of Cadavid's current arguments for a downward departure is based on grounds he did not raise in the district court, a fact that further forecloses our consideration of those grounds.

For the reasons fully enunciated herein, we affirm the district court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Introduction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 1995, a grand jury indicted Cadavid and Albeiro Castrillon for a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute from August 19, 1992, until September 4, 1992, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (\"count one\"); possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and aiding and abetting on August 29, 1992, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (\"count two\"); Cadavid and Jesus Gutierrez with a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute from January 1, 1994, until September 30, 1994, (\"count three\"); possession and distribution of cocaine in or about January 1994 (\"count four\"); June 1994 (\"count five\"); between June and September 1994 (\"count six\"); and on September 15, 1994 (\"count seven\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 27, 1997, pursuant to a plea agreement, Cadavid pled guilty to counts one through seven of the superseding indictment. Prior to his sentencing hearing, Cadavid filed objections to the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") which were followed by sentencing memoranda filed by both Cadavid and the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 1997, the district court sentenced Cadavid. At the hearing, the court ruled on objections to the PSR filed by Cadavid and rejected his request for a downward departure. The district court determined that Cadavid's total offense level was a 36 with a criminal history category (\"CHC\") of II. Therefore, the court found that the applicable U.S.S.G. range was 210 to 262 months. Accordingly, the court imposed a 228-month incarceration sentence, representing a partially concurrent disposition to an extant 108-month federal sentence Cadavid was currently serving, followed by 60 months of supervised release, and a special monetary assessment of three-hundred and fifty dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement specified that the quantity of narcotics attributable to Cadavid was between 50 and 150 kilograms of cocaine; that because he accepted responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a), Cadavid was entitled to a two-point reduction in his base offense level; that because Cadavid had provided the government with information regarding his own involvement in the offense within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), he was entitled to a one-point reduction in his base offense level under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(1); and that the sentence the court imposed would run partially concurrently with a prior federal sentence Cadavid was serving in the Southern District of Florida pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). The agreement further stated that \"there is no basis for departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement also enunciated several disputed issues between the parties. First, the government explicitly reserved the right to argue for an upward role adjustment of no more than three points for Cadavid's role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. Cadavid reserved the right to oppose that argument and to argue that no upward adjustment was appropriate. Second, Cadavid reserved his right to contend that his prior 1994 sentence was for conduct that formed part of the instant offense within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(1). The government reserved the right to dispute this point and oppose any incorrect application of the law. Finally, the government agreed not to argue that CHC III applies in this case. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Cadavid pled guilty on May 27, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Presentence Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department concluded, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 and the quantity of cocaine involved in this case, that Cadavid's base offense level was 36. They further determined that an upward adjustment of three points was appropriate considering Cadavid's managerial or supervisory role in a criminal activity that involved more than five people. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c). The Probation Department further credited Cadavid with a three-point downward adjustment for acceptance of criminal responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b). Thus, Cadavid's adjusted base offense level, as calculated by the Probation Department, was 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In calculating Cadavid's criminal history, the Probation Department found five prior convictions: (1) a 1988 Florida state court conviction for disorderly intoxication to which Cadavid pled nolo contendere and received an adjudication withheld, a fine and was ordered to pay costs; (2) a 1990 Florida state court conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (\"DUI\") for which Cadavid was found guilty, fined, sentenced to fifty hours of community service followed by six months probation and ordered to attend a DUI school; (3) a 1990 Florida state court conviction for battery to which Cadavid pled nolo contendere and received an adjudication withheld and an order to pay court costs; (4) a 1991 Florida state court conviction for DUI<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to which Cadavid pled nolo contendere and received an order to pay a fine;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (5) the 1994 federal narcotics conviction. Based upon this history, the Probation Department determined that Cadavid had six criminal history points: one point for the 1990 DUI conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c); one point for the 1990 battery conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f); one point for the 1991 DUI conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c); and three points for the 1994 narcotics conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(a). Therefore, the Probation Department originally calculated Cadavid's CHC to be III and the applicable sentencing range to be 235 to 293 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department next noted that Cadavid was currently serving an undischarged 108-month federal sentence and that the court had the discretion to impose a concurrent, partially concurrent or consecutive sentence with the prior sentence. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) (1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Probation Department then suggested a partially concurrent sentence and computed the additional consecutive component of punishment for Cadavid to be served after completion of his extant federal sentence. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) nn. 3-5. In order to create a theoretical yardstick upon which to evaluate the proposed section 5G1.3(c) partial concurrence and the extent of any consecutive component of the sentence, the Probation Department consolidated the 1994 conviction and the instant offense by combining the amounts of cocaine from both offenses (73.995 kilograms, base offense level 36). Next, they added the three-point leadership enhancement, then subtracted three points for acceptance of responsibility. Since they consolidated the two cases, the Probation Department ignored the three criminal history points from the 1994 narcotics conviction and used CHC II in its recommendation. The Probation Department determined that Cadavid's \"theoretical guideline sentencing range\" for both the 1994 and 1997 offenses was 210 to 262 months (offense level 33, CHC II). Thus, the Probation Department concluded that the appropriate incremental punishment pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) was to add 118 to 170 months to Cadavid's prior 108-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid's Objections</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two months prior to sentencing, on September 17, 1997, Cadavid obtained new counsel. Cadavid then filed several objections to the PSR's criminal history calculation. Specifically, he alleged that: (1) the award of one criminal history point for the 1991 DUI conviction was erroneous because he was not represented by counsel; (2) the award of one criminal history point for the 1990 battery conviction was erroneous because a sentence of adjudication withheld fails to constitute a judicial determination of guilt; and (3) the award of three criminal history points for the 1994 narcotics case was erroneous because it constituted the \"same course of conduct as alleged in the Indictment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department disagreed with each of Cadavid's objections finding that: (1) the 1991 conviction, even if no counsel was present, was for a misdemeanor and thus eligible to count pursuant to Nichols v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087959/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span> </a></span>(1994) (holding that, consistent with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid for use in enhancing punishment at subsequent conviction); (2) the 1990 \"adjudication withheld\" battery conviction was properly counted as a diversionary disposition under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f); and (3) the 1994 conviction and this case were separate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid then filed a sentencing memorandum raising, for the first time, the contention that he was entitled to the benefit of the \"safety valve\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(5). Cadavid also claimed that there were grounds for departure from the guidelines, despite the fact that the agreement provided that no such grounds existed. The five specific grounds he claimed included: (1) that he suffered a physical injury while in prison; (2) that he would agree to deportation; (3) that his criminal activity constituted aberrant behavior; (4) that his criminal history was overstated; and (5) that there were a combination of these factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perceiving Cadavid's contentions for a downward departure as a breach of his pledge under the plea agreement not to seek such a departure, the government objected and withdrew from the agreement prior to sentencing. Nonetheless, the withdrawal was of no effect as the government maintained its original positions as stated in the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Sentencing Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court found that even if it were to accept Cadavid's challenge to the 1991 DUI conviction, the two points from the 1990 DUI conviction coupled with the battery conviction sufficed to place Cadavid in CHC II. The court endorsed the criminal history calculation of the PSR, grounded in U.S.S.G. 5G1.3(c), and the determination that Cadavid had a CHC of II. Cadavid objected, asserting that the battery conviction should not count because an adjudication withheld fails to constitute a judicial determination or admission of guilt. The district court disagreed but went on to hold that, alternatively, even if it sustained each of Cadavid's objections, a CHC of I constituted a \"gross understatement of the severity of this defendant's record.\" The court went on to note that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If I took the closest look possible in [Cadavid's] favor and came to the conclusion you were right, I've just said to you it would not make any difference in my sentence in this case, because if I did that, then I would plainly be forced to the conclusion in my mind, to do a fair sentencing adjudication, to determine that a CHC of \"I\" seriously under-represents the severity of this defendant's criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court proceeded to apply CHC II. The Memorandum of Sentencing Hearing and Report of Statement of Reasons further illuminates this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, citing the PSR, also imposed a three-level upward adjustment, adding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his is not at all a situation in which Mr. Cadavid, who is before me now, functioned in the role comparable to a foreman.

The court, accordingly, disregarded the safety valve issue. The court further rejected Cadavid's contention that the 1994 conviction and the instant case were part of the same course of conduct and, therefore, the same offense. In rejecting this claim, the court relied upon the Probation Department's proposal enunciated in the PSR and consolidated the 1994 conviction with the current case while disregarding the three criminal history points arising from the 1994 conviction. The court concluded that Cadavid's sentencing guideline range was 210 to 262 months, his total offense level was 36, and his CHC was II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court next considered Cadavid's claims for a downward departure. Following oral argument, the court rejected Cadavid's contentions that a downward departure was appropriate. The court examined each of Cadavid's claims and rejected them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the court imposed a sentence of 228 months upon Cadavid. Exercising its discretion under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c), the court ordered that the sentence be partially concurrent with the 108-month sentence Cadavid was currently serving. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c) n.5. The court obviously had considered the relevant guidelines factors in imposing a partially concurrent sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Therefore, the court ordered Cadavid to serve 120 months beyond the completion of his sentence in the 1994 narcotics case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following issues are now before this Court: (1) whether the district court committed plain error in assessing Cadavid a three-point upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1; (2) whether the district court erred in calculating Cadavid's CHC; (3) whether the district court committed clear error in determining that Cadavid failed to meet the requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision in U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5C1.2 and 2D1.1(b)(4); and (4) whether this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court's discretionary refusal to depart downward from the otherwise applicable Guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid's Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adopting the recommendation of the PSR, the district court increased Cadavid's base offense level by three points, concluding that he held a leadership or supervisory role over at least five other persons in the drug enterprise. Cadavid challenges the facts underlying the adjustment, specifically concerning the number of persons involved, and contends that the court clearly erred in its upward role in the offense adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines provide for a three-level enhancement of a defendant's offense level if he acts as a manager or supervisor of a criminal enterprise that either includes five or more participants (including the defendant) or is \"otherwise extensive.\" See U.S.S.G.  &#167; 3B1.1(b) (1997). This determination requires a two-step showing: (1) \"evidence that a defendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at least one other person,\" United States v. Voccola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197057\"><a href=\"/opinion/197057/united-states-v-voccola/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir. 1996); and (2) that the criminal scheme had five or more participants or was \"otherwise extensive.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) (1997). The specific contours of the terms manager and supervisor are not elucidated.

Cadavid contends that the evidence presented does not clearly identify five separate persons and that the evidence does not support Cadavid's upward adjustment as a manager or supervisor. We disagree. The PSR concluded that there were seven members of the 1994 conspiracy: (1) Cadavid; (2) John Freddy Cadavid; (3) Jesus Gutierrez; (4) Fabio Pulgarn; (5) Ivan Ricuarte; (6) an unknown Hispanic male; and (7) a second unknown Hispanic male. Based upon this report and the record, the court concluded that there were more than five participants in the conspiracy. We find this ruling is not clearly erroneous. Even if, as Cadavid asserts, one were to concede that the two unknown Hispanic males were either the same person or another named member of the conspiracy, we still count five participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we find the record clearly supports the fact that Cadavid exercised control over the activities of at least one other person. We find the record to be replete with instances of Cadavid exercising a managerial or supervisory role. A few examples include: Cadavid's supervision, management and payment of Gutierrez and Pulgarn in the January 1994 cocaine transaction; Cadavid's hiring of Pulgarn and Gutierrez to transport cocaine from Massachusetts to New York; Castrillon's statements that he worked for Cadavid; and Cadavid identifying one of the unknown Hispanic males as his worker during a cocaine transaction in September 1994. Therefore, we conclude that the district court's role in the offense determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VIII.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid's Criminal History Category (\"CHC\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid argues that the court improperly calculated his CHC by erroneously including points in its tabulation. Specifically, he maintains that (1) the 1990 battery conviction which resulted in a judgment of \"adjudication withheld\" and where he was not assisted by counsel and (2) the 1991 DUI conviction which resulted in a work release sentence and under which he was not represented by counsel, should be excluded from the computation of his CHC. He further contends that the court failed to resolve this dispute and instead relied upon U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 to upwardly depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by examining the district court's calculation. The court stated that it was relying upon the PSR and Cadavid's entire record of past malfeasance to determine that CHC II was the proper category. The court swiftly agreed with the PSR's criminal history calculation. As an alternative basis, the court found that CHC I unjustly under-represented Cadavid's criminal past. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the court's determination and the PSR's calculation that Cadavid's criminal history places him in CHC II.

The district court expounded that even if it were to find merit in Cadavid's objections to the battery and DUI convictions, it would depart upward to CHC II. This, as discussed above, is clearly within the province of the court and supported by the record. Since 1988, Cadavid has been a frequent presence in our judicial system. He has two DUI convictions and one conviction each for disorderly intoxication, battery, and narcotics offenses. Moreover, at the time of sentencing, Cadavid was incarcerated, serving a 108-month federal sentence for narcotics trafficking. Given this relatively recent yet quite extensive illicit background, we find the district court correctly concluded that CHC I severely under-represented Cadavid's past illegal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we examine the reasonableness of the degree of the departure. \"This third step involves what is quintessentially a judgment call.\" United States v.

Congress has statutorily determined that circuit courts are to consider the factors ordinarily examined in sentencing decisions. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(3)(A). Thus, we \"look not only to the particular circumstance warranting departure in the first place, but to the overall aggregate of known circumstances pertaining to the offense of conviction and to the offender who committed it.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ocasio,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>. In the instant case, we find that the degree of departure was reasonable given Cadavid's felonious background, which is replete with convictions. In addition, the district court, in effect, imposed a partially concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c). This amply reduced the actual time Cadavid will serve. The CHC calculation and resultant sentence in this case are proportionate to the criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the issue of whether a judgment of \"adjudication withheld\" constitutes a predicate conviction under the guidelines, has been decided by this Court. In United States v.

U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. Furthermore, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(f) provides that \"[a] diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under &#167; 4A1.1(c) [the CHR Guideline] even if a conviction is not formally entered.\" The guidelines define a prior sentence as \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(1) (1997).

In order to qualify for relief under the \"safety valve\" provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant must satisfy the following five criteria: (1) not have more than one criminal history point; (2) not have used violence or possessed a firearm during commission of the offense; (3) not have killed or seriously injured another person; (4) not have been a leader or manager in the offense; and (5) have truthfully provided the government with all information and evidence he possesses concerning the offense. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2 (1997). The burden is upon the defendant to convince the court that he meets the requirements. See United States v. Montanez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196724\"><a href=\"/opinion/196724/united-states-v-montanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 523 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing United States v.

We review district court factual determinations of entitlement to relief under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(b)(4) and 5C1.2 for clear error. See United States v. White, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197478\"><a href=\"/opinion/197478/united-states-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 73 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Miranda-Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir. 1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Cadavid failed to meet two of the five requirements for \"safety valve\" qualification: Having no more than one criminal history point and being a supervisor or manager of the criminal enterprise. Cadavid challenges both findings and also asserts that the court's determination of the last criteria, the issue of whether defendant had truthfully provided the government with all information relating to the offense, was clouded by the earlier findings on the other criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the district court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that Cadavid failed to meet the requisites under the Guidelines. First, as discussed previously, we find that Cadavid fails both the criminal history point and supervisor or manager requirements. Cadavid has failed to carry his burden in convincing the court that he qualifies for the safety valve provision. In this case, the government noted a number of deficiencies in Cadavid's written proffer and the court found that his submission \"came nowhere near satisfying the requirements of the safety valve provision.\" The Judge continued, \"I think he has withheld instead of being fully candid with the Court as well as with the Government in what he has filed in this case.\" \"Full disclosure is the price that Congress has attached to relief under the statute.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196724\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Montanez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196724/united-states-v-montanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">523</span> </a></span>(citing United States v.

Cadavid's submission fails to meet the standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">X.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Refusal to Downwardly Depart</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our final determination is whether the district court improperly refused to depart downward from the otherwise applicable guideline sentencing range. The government asserts that the district court's refusal to downwardly depart is not reviewable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cadavid asserted five separate grounds allegedly justifying a downward departure: (1) a physical injury sustained while in prison; (2) his agreement to be deported; (3) that his criminal history constituted aberrant behavior; (4) that his criminal history was overstated; and (5) a catch-all totality of the circumstances category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule of this Circuit is that \"a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.\" United States v. Robbio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198587\"><a href=\"/opinion/198587/united-states-v-robbio/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 44-45 (1st Cir.1999) (citing United States v. Reeder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762263\"><a href=\"/opinion/762263/united-states-v-george-wayneti-reeder-aka-wayne-reeder/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1999)). Review of the sentencing hearing memorandum and transcript convince us that the district court fully comprehended its authority to depart downward in an appropriate case, but denied Cadavid's motion because of its perceived lack of merit. Because Cadavid challenges the district court's exercise of discretion not to depart downward, we do not have jurisdiction to entertain his argument. See United States v. Field, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195707\"><a href=\"/opinion/195707/united-states-v-field/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 1994). Furthermore, the lion's share of Cadavid's current arguments for a downward departure is based on grounds he did not raise in the district court, a fact that further forecloses our consideration of those grounds.
