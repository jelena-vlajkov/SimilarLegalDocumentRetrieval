Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Owen S. Walker, Federal Defender Office, for appellant.\n     Brian T. Kelly, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 5, 2000\n\f\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.          In July 1994, Gerald Caron was\n\nconvicted after a jury trial on four counts of being a felon in\n\npossession of firearms and ammunition.           18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1).\n\nAt sentencing in September 1994, he was found to be an armed\n\ncareer criminal and therefore subject to an increased sentence.\n\n18   U.S.C.   ยง   924(e).    This    label    attaches   to   a   felon   in\n\npossession who has three prior convictions for, inter alia,\n\nviolent felonies, id.; Caron had four prior violent felony\n\nconvictions in state courts--three in Massachusetts and one in\n\nCalifornia--and three such convictions in the federal courts\n\n(although those convictions arose out of one incident and thus\n\nare only counted as one conviction under section 924(e)(1)).\n\nUnited States v. Caron, 941 F. Supp. 238, 241 n.6 (D. Mass.\n\n1996).   He was then sentenced to 262 months in prison.\n\n          Although    this   court   initially     affirmed   on   appeal,\n\nUnited States v.     Caron, 64 F.3d 713 (1st Cir. 1995),             cert.\n\ndenied, 518 U.S. 1027 (1996), we later granted rehearing en\n\nbanc, id. at 719, and concluded that further proceedings were\n\nrequired to determine whether Caron had enough prior convictions\n\nto qualify as an armed career criminal.         United States v. Caron,\n\n77 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.) (en banc) (1996).          The doubt arose because\n\nCaron claimed that as to his Massachusetts state convictions, he\n\nhad had his \"civil rights restored\" and, in such cases (with an\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fexception not here relevant), the statute says that a prior\n\nconviction \"shall not be considered a conviction\" for purposes\n\nof   the   firearms      chapter.      18     U.S.C.   ยง   921(a)(20).         This\n\nrestriction may make little sense in determining whether someone\n\nis an armed career criminal, but the courts have (reasonably\n\nenough) followed the clear statutory language.\n\n              On remand, the district court ruled that Caron's civil\n\nrights had been restored with respect to the three Massachusetts\n\nconvictions, leaving only the California conviction and the\n\nfederal convictions (from one incident) to \"count\" toward armed\n\ncareer status--one short of the necessary number.                United States\n\nv. Caron, 941 F. Supp. 238 (D. Mass. 1996).                  Departing upward,\n\nthe district court in October 1996 re-sentenced Caron as an\n\nordinary felon in possession to 120 months.                  On appeal by the\n\ngovernment, this court reversed in an unpublished order on the\n\nground that (under intervening case law in this court) Caron's\n\ncivil    right     had   not   been   fully    \"restored\"     after    his   prior\n\nconvictions.       United States v. Caron, Nos. 96-2338, 96-2339 (1st\n\nCir.    May   9,   1997).      The    Supreme   Court      granted    review    and\n\naffirmed.      United States v. Caron, 524 U.S. 308, 315-16 (1998).\n\n              The case was then remanded to the district court for\n\na new re-sentencing which in turn gives rise to the present\n\nappeal.       Although now subject to re-sentencing as an armed\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcareer criminal, Caron argued in the district court that he\n\nshould    be   granted     a   downward     departure    because     he    had\n\nsubstantially      rehabilitated      himself        during   his     latest\n\nimprisonment.      At the re-sentencing in April 1999, the district\n\ncourt agreed that it had discretion to depart downward based on\n\npost-sentence rehabilitation; but the court said that this would\n\nbe justified only \"in the most rare case\" and was not warranted\n\nby the facts presented by Caron.          Caron was then sentenced once\n\nagain to 262 months.\n\n            Caron now appeals from the new sentence, attacking the\n\ndenial of the downward departure.         Of course, refusals to depart\n\nare generally unreviewable, United States v. Anderson, 139 F.3d\n\n291, 299-300 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 866 (1998), but\n\nCaron seeks to bring himself within an established exception for\n\ncases where the district court has misapprehended its legal\n\nauthority.     United States v. Clase-Espinal, 115 F.3d 1054, 1056\n\nn.2 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 957 (1997).                 This is a\n\ntight    squeeze   since   the   district    court   agreed   that    it   had\n\nauthority to depart for post-sentence rehabilitation.               But Caron\n\nsays that the court still committed legal error by limiting its\n\nauthority to \"the most rare case.\"\n\n            Passing the government's debatable claim of waiver, its\n\nbroadest line of defense is that post-sentence rehabilitation is\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fnever   a   permissible     basis     for    departure.       While    there    are\n\narguments for this view, we have rejected it in an intervening\n\ndecision     after    careful       consideration.          United     States    v.\n\nBradstreet, No. 99-1267, 2000 WL 298570, at *4-*5 (1st Cir. Mar.\n\n27, 2000).       Bradstreet said that a departure is permissible\n\nbased on post-sentence rehabilitation where the achievement is\n\npresent \"to such an exceptional degree that the situation cannot\n\nbe   considered      typical   of    those    circumstances      in    which    the\n\nexplicit departure--rehabilitation in the context of acceptance\n\nof responsibility--is normally granted.\"                    Id. at *5 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Rhodes, 145 F.3d 1375, 1383 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).\n\nSuch departures for post-sentence rehabilitation, we added,\n\nwould be \"highly infrequent.\"                Id. (quoting      Koon v.     United\n\nStates, 518 U.S. 81, 96 (1996)).\n\n            It is quite clear that the district court accurately\n\nanticipated Bradstreet and well understood the extent of its\n\ndiscretion to depart.          There is no magic to particular terms\n\nlike    \"most    rare,\"   \"exceptional,\"        and    \"highly       infrequent.\"\n\nAbsent a mistake of law, our review of the refusal to depart is\n\nat an end.      But we think it worth adding that nothing in Caron's\n\npost-sentence      record      conflicts      with    the    district    court's\n\njudgment that it was praiseworthy in some respects but hardly\n\nexceptional.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -7-\n\f",

Bradstreet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768063\"><a href=\"/opinion/768063/united-states-v-bernard-f-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 81-84 (1st Cir. 2000). Bradstreet said that a departure is permissible based on post-sentence rehabilitation where the achievement is present \"to such an exceptional degree that the situation cannot be considered typical of those circumstances in which the explicit departure--rehabilitation in the context of acceptance of responsibility--is normally granted.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768063\"><a href=\"/opinion/768063/united-states-v-bernard-f-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 83 </a></span>(quoting United States v. Rhodes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184562\"><a href=\"/opinion/184562/united-states-v-rhodes-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span>, 1383 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). Such departures for post-sentence rehabilitation, we added, would be \"highly infrequent.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184562\"><a href=\"/opinion/184562/united-states-v-rhodes-robert/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (quoting Koon </a></span>v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 96 (1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite clear that the district court accurately anticipated Bradstreet and well understood the extent of its discretion to depart. There is no magic to particular terms like \"most rare,\" \"exceptional,\" and \"highly infrequent.\" Absent a mistake of law, our review of the refusal to depart is at an end. But we think it worth adding that nothing in Caron's post-sentence record conflicts with the district court's judgment that it was praiseworthy in some respects but hardly exceptional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
