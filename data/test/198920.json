Plaintiffs-appellants\n\nJoseph and Patricia DiStefano are shareholders and creditors of\n\nJFD Enterprises, Inc. (“JFD”).1        They appeal a grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of defendants-appellees Peter Stern, Eugene\n\nBerman and Roger Dialessi (the “appellees”).              The DiStefanos\n\nallege that during the course of JFD's reorganization under\n\nChapter   11   of   the   Bankruptcy   Code,   the    appellees   violated\n\nvarious fiduciary duties owed to them.               These breaches, the\n\nDiStefanos contend, caused them to suffer financial losses on\n\nadvances they had extended to JFD and prevented their recovery\n\non other liens they held against the company's assets.                  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                               Background\n\n          Prior to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings,\n\nJFD operated a liquor store under the trade name Century Liquor\n\nMart (“Century”) in West Springfield, Massachusetts.                Joseph\n\nDiStefano managed the business.        In February 1989, he personally\n\n\n\n\n    1Joseph DiStefano is an unsecured creditor, while Patricia\nDiStefano is an undersecured creditor.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fguaranteed about $300,000 of indebtedness owed by JFD to the\n\nPark West Bank and Trust Company (the “Bank”).\n\n            Century was a successful operation until about 1990.\n\nAfter that, its business declined, probably due in large part to\n\nthe closure of a nearby bridge and a consequent reduction in\n\ntraffic to the shopping center of which the store was a part.\n\nOn June 10, 1993, JFD filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in\n\nthe   United       States    Bankruptcy         Court   for      the     District     of\n\nMassachusetts.         As    part    of    the    Chapter     11    proceeding,       an\n\nOfficial     Unsecured       Creditors'         Committee     (“Committee”)          was\n\nappointed.         With     the     bankruptcy      court's        permission,       the\n\nCommittee    hired     Kamberg,      Berman,      P.C.,    and      appellee      Eugene\n\nBerman in particular, as its counsel.\n\n            It appears from the record that when JFD filed for\n\nbankruptcy, its indebtedness to the Bank totaled approximately\n\n$275,000.      On July 30, 1993, Berman and counsel for the Bank\n\nnegotiated     a    stipulation         agreeing    that      the      Bank   held    an\n\nenforceable first security interest in all of JFD's personal\n\nproperty     and    cash.         The     bankruptcy      court        approved     this\n\nstipulation on August 18, 1993.             Subsequently, during the autumn\n\nof 1993, Patricia DiStefano, JFD and the Committee also agreed\n\nthat Mrs. DiStefano possessed an enforceable claim against the\n\nJFD estate in the amount of $40,000; that her claim was secured\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fby JFD's inventory, proceeds, and accounts receivable; and that\n\nit was junior to the Bank's interests. 2                   The bankruptcy court\n\napproved this stipulation on November 17, 1993.\n\n              In the meantime, on September 24, 1993, the Committee\n\nhad    filed      a   motion    to     convert     the   case    to    a     Chapter   7\n\nliquidation.          The Committee alleged that JFD had lost $475,000\n\nbetween August 1990 and May 1993, that it was poorly managed,\n\nand that it faced continued financial losses.                         On October 12,\n\nperhaps in response to the Committee's efforts, Joseph DiStefano\n\nentered      into     a    stipulation      (the   “October     12     Stipulation”)\n\npursuant to which he ceded management responsibility for Century\n\nto Roger Dialessi and the Committee withdrew its conversion\n\nmotion.      But immediately before this agreement was memorialized\n\nand approved by the bankruptcy court, the Bank filed its own\n\nmotion to convert the case to a Chapter 7 action, charging that\n\nthe    Committee          unlawfully    had    installed   new       JFD     management\n\nwithout regard to the safeguarding of the Bank's interests.                         The\n\nBank       also   complained         that     JFD's   inventory        had     declined\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     The stipulation also provided that if Mrs. DiStefano\nreceived less than $25,000 on her claim, she would have a junior\nsecurity interest in JFD's liquor license for the difference\nbetween the amount paid and $25,000.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fsubstantially since the bankruptcy proceeding had commenced,\n\nthus reducing the security of its lien.3\n\n              On October 29, 1993, the United States Trustee (“UST”)\n\nobjected to the October 12 Stipulation and filed a motion for\n\nthe appointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee, claiming that Dialessi\n\nwas unlawfully acting as a de facto trustee.             On November 10,\n\n1993, however, JFD, the Committee, the Bank, and the UST entered\n\ninto a stipulation (the “Appointment Stipulation”) providing\n\nthat Dialessi would be appointed as the Chapter 11 Trustee and\n\nlimiting his pay to $600 per week for “services rendered in the\n\noperation of the business of the Debtor.”             That same day, the\n\nsame parties except for the UST entered into another stipulation\n\nthat       accorded   the   Bank   a   perfected,   enforceable   security\n\ninterest in JFD's liquor license.            As part of this agreement,\n\nthe Bank agreed both to withdraw its motion to convert the\n\nproceedings into a Chapter 7 action and not to seek such a\n\nconversion in the future so long as certain stated conditions\n\nwere met.       The bankruptcy court approved both stipulations.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n     At around the same time, the Bank froze JFD's account,\nwhich contained about $40,000, and refused to grant Dialessi\ncheck-signing authority on the account.      JFD subsequently\nbrought an adversarial action seeking an order requiring the\nBank to allow access to its account.      The Bank relented,\nallowing Dialessi access.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           The   parties'     stipulation   notwithstanding,     and   for\n\nreasons that are not clear, appellee Stern was appointed as\n\ntrustee instead of Dialessi.4         Dialessi continued to manage\n\nCentury.\n\n           On May 31, 1994, Stern, acting as Trustee, moved to\n\nsell Century's personal property, including its liquor license,\n\nfor $275,000, including a $20,000 “carve-out” to be paid to the\n\nbankruptcy estate.        By this point, however, Century's liquor\n\nlicense    was   on   a   Massachusetts   Alcoholic   Beverage   Control\n\nCommission (\"ABCC\") payment “delinquent list” pursuant to Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 138, § 25.       That provision states that delinquent\n\nlicensees may only make cash purchases from liquor wholesalers.\n\nMoreover, the statute's requirements continue to apply even if\n\nthe license is transferred.       Thus, the Committee objected to the\n\nasset sale, arguing that the license could only be sold subject\n\nto the bar against purchases made other than for cash.                 The\n\ncourt ultimately rejected the proposed sale on the ground that\n\nit would not substantially benefit the estate.\n\n\n\n\n    4Citing Berman's deposition testimony, the appellants\nsuggest that the UST opposed Dialessi's appointment. As noted\nabove, however, the UST was a party to the Appointment\nStipulation.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f          As   Century's   general   manager,    Dialessi   engaged   in\n\nvarious   activities   relevant    to   this    appeal.     These   were\n\ndescribed by the district court as follows:\n\n          Dialessi . . . discontinued the use of a\n          computerized cash register system capable of\n          monitoring inventory levels.     He contends\n          that such action was prompted by Mr.\n          DiStefano's failure to record beer and wine\n          purchases in the system, which he claims\n          resulted in the system generating inaccurate\n          inventory reports.   Additionally, Dialessi\n          sold some of Century['s] wine inventory to\n          another liquor store owner for approximately\n          $2,000.   Although Mr. DiStefano originally\n          maintained at his deposition that the value\n          of the wine sold was $25,000, cross\n          examination revealed that this position was\n          based on what another employee had allegedly\n          told him. He later conceded that the value\n          of the wine sold was approximately $4,000,\n          which is more consistent with Dialessi's\n          affidavit, which stated that the liquor was\n          worth $3,200. Moreover, Dialessi failed to\n          pay Massachusetts withholding taxes, but\n          personally resolved all claims by the\n          government at no expense to JFD. Lastly,\n          Dialessi, due to JFD's cash shortage, paid\n          employees out of an account in which\n          proceeds from JFD's lottery ticket sales\n          were deposited.\n\nDiStefano v. Stern, 236 B.R. 112, 115 (D. Mass. 1999).\n\n          On August 26, 1994, Stern moved to convert the case to\n\na Chapter 7 proceeding.       The court allowed his motion and\n\nappointed Stern as the Chapter 7 Trustee.        On December 20, 1994,\n\nStern sold Century's liquor license for $100,000; he sold JFD's\n\npersonal property separately for about $31,000.           In June 1995,\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe court ordered the ABCC to approve the license's transfer\n\nfree and clear of its delinquent status.                 Due to the disparity\n\nbetween the value of the Bank's loan, which, at that point,\n\nexceeded $300,000, and the price for which the JFD assets were\n\nsold, $131,000, Mr. DiStefano was required to pay $50,000 on his\n\nguaranty (pursuant to a settlement with the Bank), and Mrs.\n\nDiStefano      failed      to   recover     anything    on    her    undersecured\n\ninterest in the JFD estate.\n\n              On February 14, 1997, the DiStefanos filed an action\n\nin    the    Massachusetts      Superior     Court    against   Stern,     Berman,\n\nDialessi, the Bank, and the Bank's attorney.5                   The DiStefanos\n\nalleged      that    the    appellees       behaved    negligently        in   their\n\nstewardship of JFD and breached fiduciary duties owed to them as\n\nshareholders and creditors of JFD.6              On March 11, 1997, Berman\n\nhad    the    case   removed     to   the    bankruptcy      court   as    a   “core\n\nproceeding” in JFD's bankruptcy case.\n\n              Eventually, the appellees moved for summary judgment.\n\nThey claimed, inter alia, that the DiStefanos lacked standing to\n\n\n\n       5The Bank and its counsel subsequently were dropped from the\ncase.\n       6\n      The DiStefanos contended that Stern and Dialessi owed them\nfiduciary duties by virtue of their positions as bankruptcy\ntrustee and Century's manager, respectively, and that Berman\nowed such a duty by virtue of his de facto control of JFD during\nthe Chapter 11 proceedings.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpursue their claims and that their own behavior did not result\n\nin any harm to the DiStefanos.                The bankruptcy court granted\n\nsummary judgment to all the appellees on all counts.                     The court\n\ndetermined, in pertinent part, that the DiStefanos indeed lacked\n\nstanding    to     bring    their    claims    and   that,       irrespective    of\n\nstanding, the DiStefanos would be unable to prove that the\n\nappellees' conduct caused them any damages.\n\n            The DiStefanos appealed the bankruptcy court's ruling\n\nto the district court.         That court affirmed the grant of summary\n\njudgment, grounding its decision entirely on the DiStefanos'\n\ninability    to     prove    that     their   losses      were    caused   by   the\n\nappellees' conduct.         The DiStefanos again appeal.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n            The question whether a genuine issue of material fact\n\nexists, such that a grant of summary judgment must be reversed,\n\npresents a legal issue subject to de novo review.                    See Desmond\n\nv. Varrasso (In re Varrasso), 37 F.3d 760, 763 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nWe view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, granting all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\n\nSee Barreto-Rivero v. Medina-Vargas, 168 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).      Even    so,     summary    judgment      is   appropriate      if   the\n\nnonmovant's       evidence     is      \"merely    colorable,        or     is   not\n\nsignificantly probative.\"           Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fU.S.    242,     249-50     (1986)    (citations      omitted).      \"The       mere\n\nexistence      of    a   scintilla     of   evidence       in   support   of     the\n\nplaintiff's         position   will    be   insufficient;        there    must    be\n\nevidence    on      which   the   jury    could    reasonably     find    for    the\n\nplaintiff.\"         Id. at 252.      We will not “accept the nonmovant's\n\nsubjective characterizations of events, unless the underlying\n\nevents themselves are revealed.”                Simas v. First Citizens' Fed.\n\nCredit Union, 170 F.3d 37 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Liberty\n\nLobby, 477 U.S. at 256; Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            Given these standards, we believe summary judgment in\n\nthe appellees' favor was appropriate on the grounds identified\n\nby the district court: an absence of harm attributable to the\n\nappellees' conduct.         We explain by discussing separately the two\n\nclasses of harm the DiStefanos have identified:                      (1) losses\n\nrelating to JFD's declining value and (2) the legal fees the\n\nDiStefanos purportedly incurred defending an action brought by\n\nthe IRS because of Dialessi's failure to withhold employee\n\nincome taxes as manager of Century.\n\nI.     Losses Associated with the JFD Estate's Declining Value\n\n            The      DiStefanos       assert     various    arguments     against\n\nDialessi, Berman and Stern, most of which boil down to the\n\nfollowing contentions: (1) the DiStefanos were creditors and\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fshareholders of JFD; (2) Dialessi and Stern, who held appointed\n\npositions in JFD's bankruptcy proceedings, and Berman, who acted\n\nas    a    “de   facto”      bankruptcy          trustee,     owed   the    DiStefanos\n\nfiduciary duties in the latter's capacity as JFD's creditors and\n\nshareholders; (3) each appellee breached his fiduciary duty to\n\nthe       DiStefanos;       (4)   as    a   proximate       consequence       of    these\n\nbreaches, JFD lost substantial value before the ultimate sale of\n\nits       assets,    resulting         in   the    DiStefanos'       losses    on    Mrs.\n\nDiStefano's          lien    as   outlined         in   the    November       17,   1993\n\nstipulation          and     on   Mr.       DiStefano's       guaranty        of    JFD's\n\nindebtedness to the Bank.                   Although the DiStefanos may have\n\nsuffered other losses, such as those associated with their\n\nequity interest in JFD -- which was ultimately worthless --\n\nthose losses are not here at issue, because the DiStefanos could\n\nonly have avoided those losses if the JFD estate had first\n\nsatisfied all claims of JFD's general creditors.\n\n              The DiStefanos' claims cannot survive summary judgment\n\nbecause       they    have    failed        to    adduce    adequate       evidence    of\n\ncausation linking their losses to the appellees' conduct.                            That\n\nis, even if we were to assume arguendo that the appellees each\n\nowed a fiduciary duty to the DiStefanos, that they each breached\n\nthat duty, and that JFD's value declined precipitously during\n\nthe course of its bankruptcy proceedings, the DiStefanos have\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fnot submitted enough evidence indicating a causal link between\n\nthe   breaches     and    the   losses   to    survive    summary   judgment.\n\nCorrelation alone, here as elsewhere, does not prove causation.\n\nWe explain with respect to each allegation made in support of\n\nthe DiStefanos' claims.\n\nA.    Timing of the Sale\n\n            The DiStefanos' principal allegation in support of\n\ntheir claims relates to the timing of the sale of Century's\n\nassets.     As noted above, in May of 1994, Stern filed a motion\n\nseeking approval to sell JFD's business to a third party in\n\nexchange for $275,000.          The DiStefanos contend that at the time\n\nof that proposed sale, the Bank's claim was valued at $294,000.\n\nIf the sale had proceeded, they argue, the Bank would have\n\nrecovered    all    but   $19,000   of   its    total    claim   from   JFD   in\n\nliquidation.       At the very least, Mr. DiStefano's exposure under\n\nthe loan guaranty would have been far less than the $50,000 for\n\nwhich he ultimately was held responsible. 7                Berman, however,\n\n\n      7\n      The DiStefanos also theorize that there was a “likelihood\nthat other bidders would have offered more, leaving (at most) a\nsmall deficiency for the Bank.” This price increase presumably\nwould have further reduced the DiStefanos' exposure and might\neven have resulted in a surplus that would have inured to the\nbenefit of an undersecured creditor such as Mrs. DiStefano.\nHowever, Stern's motion specified the $275,000 price and did not\non its face provide for any further bidding process. Even if it\nhad, we would be unwilling to rely upon speculation that a\nhigher   price  would   have   been  reached.     “[C]onclusory\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation\n\n                                     -12-\n\fobjected to the sale.           On July 13, 1994, the court held a\n\nhearing   on    the   motion   and   Berman's       objection.        The    court\n\nultimately refused to allow the sale.               The DiStefanos contend\n\nthat Berman's objection to the sale constituted a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty to the estate8 and a proximate cause of their\n\nsubsequent losses.\n\n          The DiStefanos' argument regarding the aborted sale\n\nfalters, however, because the discretion and authority to allow\n\nor disallow the sale lay, of course, not with any of the\n\nappellees, but rather with the court.                 See, e.g., 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 157(b)(2)(N).        It is true that the court might not have\n\nintervened at all save for Berman's objection.                  See, e.g., 11\n\nU.S.C. § 363(b)(1) (requiring “notice and a hearing” before sale\n\nof estate property outside the ordinary course of business); id.\n\n§   102(1)(B)    (defining     “notice   and    a    hearing”    in    a    manner\n\nallowing a sale without any hearing where no party requests\n\none); In re Crowell, 225 B.R. 334, 335 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 1997)\n\n\n\n. . . are insufficient to establish a genuine dispute of fact.”\nTriangle Trading Co. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\nCir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n      8\n     Berman, they contend, usurped the trustee's role and thus\nowed the estate a fiduciary duty. In opposing the sale, they\nargue, Berman breached that duty by elevating the interests of\none particular subset of JFD creditors -- a group of liquor\nwholesalers who held claims for unpaid bills -- over the\ninterests of other creditors.\n\n                                     -13-\n\f(“In the absence of objections to a proposed sale, so long as\n\nthere is compliance with the notice and a hearing mandate by the\n\ntrustee . . . judicial involvement is not required and approval\n\nby the bankruptcy judge of the sale is unnecessary.”).                               But\n\nBerman's intervention did not itself doom the asset transfer;\n\nafter    all,      the        court   could   have    permitted   the   sale    if    it\n\nbelieved that that course of action was in the estate's best\n\ninterest.       See Jeremiah v. Richardson, 148 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).       In this case, the court determined that that was not so.\n\nIn light of the court's intervening exercise of discretion, even\n\nif Berman's objection constituted a breach of some duty to the\n\nDiStefanos, that breach did not “cause” harm, for it was the\n\naction of the court which doomed the sale.\n\n              Nor    may        the   DiStefanos      rest   their   case      on    the\n\nallegation that the appellees should have effected an earlier\n\nsale of JFD's assets to insure that those assets would cover the\n\nBank's secured loan and the interests of other creditors as\n\nwell.         It    is    not     our    role    to   second-guess      a   trustee's\n\ndetermination not to sell an estate's assets at a given point in\n\ntime    so    long       as    that   determination      reflects    the    trustee's\n\nbusiness judgment:\n\n              The Bankruptcy Code designates the trustee\n              as the representative of the estate.   The\n              trustee has ample discretion to administer\n              the estate, including authority to conduct\n\n                                              -14-\n\f                  public or private sales of estate property.\n                  Courts have much discretion on whether to\n                  approve proposed sales, but the trustee's\n                  business judgment is subject to great\n                  judicial deference.\n\nIn re WPRV-TV, Inc., 143 B.R. 315, 319 (D.P.R. 1991), vacated on\n\nother grounds, 165 B.R. 1 (D.P.R. 1992); see also In re Bakalis,\n\n220 B.R. 525, 531-32 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1998) (noting discretion\n\naccorded to trustee with regard to sale of assets); In re\n\nThinking Machs. Corp., 182 B.R. 365, 368 (D. Mass.) (emphasizing\n\n“the high degree of deference usually afforded purely economic\n\ndecisions of trustees”), rev'd on other grounds, 67 F.3d 1021\n\n(1st       Cir.    1995).   As   the   district   court     pointed   out,   the\n\nDiStefanos          presented   no   evidence   regarding    the   price   JFD's\n\nassets would have commanded at any earlier sale and no evidence\n\nthat JFD's demise was or should have been a foregone conclusion\n\nfrom the opening months of JFD's bankruptcy.9                      Absent such\n\nevidence, there would have no basis upon which to doubt a\n\ntrustee's business judgment.\n\nB.     Causation of Harm\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      Indeed, any suggestion that JFD's assets should have been\nsold earlier than May 1994 presupposes that the trustee should\nhave known that the value of those assets would necessarily\ndecline over time.     That presupposition conflicts with the\nDiStefanos' assertion that JFD's losses proximately were caused\nby particular actions or inactions on the part of the appellees.\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            We turn, then, to whether, considering the respective\n\nvalue of JFD and of the Bank's loan when the assets were\n\nactually sold, the DiStefanos can demonstrate that their harms\n\nwere caused by the appellees' misdeeds.                  They cannot.\n\n            The        DiStefanos     suggest         that      the    appellees'\n\nmismanagement resulted in JFD's losses, and hence in their own.\n\nBut the record makes clear, and there is no dispute, that JFD\n\nwas hemorrhaging value long before its bankruptcy filing.                        In\n\nthe three years preceding JFD's bankruptcy, while Century was\n\nunder Mr. DiStefano's management, the business lost a total of\n\n$403,874.        When     JFD   initiated     bankruptcy        proceedings,    the\n\nbankruptcy       schedules      indicated       assets    of    $549,331.37     and\n\nliabilities of $1,100,662 -- a                negative net equity of over\n\n$500,000.\n\n            By the time JFD's liquor license and personal property\n\nwere sold, the value of its assets was about $131,000.                          The\n\namount of the Bank's loan, meanwhile, had increased to over\n\n$300,000.         As   we   have    stated,     the     harms    claimed   by   the\n\nDiStefanos consist of Mr. DiStefano's $50,000 liability on his\n\nguaranty    of    JFD's     loan   from   the    Bank    and    Mrs.   DiStefano's\n\nforfeited junior interest in JFD's assets.                     These losses could\n\nhave been “caused” by the appellees' actions only if JFD's\n\nassets, but for those actions, would have exceeded $250,000 at\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthe time of the sale -- that is, if those actions caused at\n\nleast $119,000 in lost value.   Otherwise, Mr. DiStefano would\n\nhave remained liable for the entire $50,000 he ultimately paid\n\non his guaranty, and the DiStefanos would have suffered the same\n\nharms about which they now complain.10\n\n         The DiStefanos invite us to disregard JFD's prepetition\n\nlosses and to assume that any decline in JFD's value following\n\nthe initiation of bankruptcy proceedings must be attributed to\n\nthe appellees' purported malfeasance.    This we cannot do.   The\n\nDiStefanos bear the burden of demonstrating that any particular\n\nlosses were attributable to the appellees.   We thus review the\n\nappellees' specific “misdeeds” to determine the most generous\n\nloss figures that the DiStefanos might be able to prove at\n\ntrial.\n\n         The DiStefanos first contend that Century's business\n\ndeclined precipitously during Dialessi's tenure as its manager.\n\n\n\n    10As noted, the Bank's loan in fact exceeded $300,000.\nAlthough the loan's balance was appreciating as time passed, we\nwill use the $300,000 figure as the basis for our analysis.\nGreater indebtedness to the Bank would only have required that\nthe appellee's acts caused even more damage in order for the\nDiStefanos to merit relief because the total difference between\nthe Bank's claim and JFD's value would be correspondingly\ngreater. Thus, our assumption of a $300,000 secured interest\nredounds in the DiStefanos' favor.     Even assuming that the\nBank's loan amounted to “only” $300,000, the DiStefanos cannot\nprove that their claimed losses resulted from the appellees'\nbehavior.\n\n                             -17-\n\fAs the district court noted, however, given JFD's steep pre-\n\nbankruptcy decline, the DiStefanos would be unable to link post-\n\nbankruptcy    losses      to   Dialessi's      conduct,    absent   specific\n\nallegations of mismanagement:\n\n           [T]he overwhelming and undisputed facts show\n           that Century Liquor was in severe financial\n           distress   long   before   Dialessi   became\n           manager . . . . Following the commencement\n           of  the   bankruptcy   proceeding   and  the\n           appointment of Dialessi as manager, the\n           record does not reflect any significant\n           decline in business different from the\n           preexisting downward spiral that ended in\n           bankruptcy.\n\nDiStefano, 236 B.R. at 117-18.\n\n           The DiStefanos next charge that Dialessi discontinued\n\nthe use of Century's computerized inventory monitoring system.\n\nHowever,     they    offer     no   proof      whatsoever    linking      this\n\ndiscontinuance to any decline in JFD's value.\n\n           Mr. and Mrs. DiStefano also allege that Dialessi paid\n\nhimself $150 more per week than the Appointment Stipulation\n\nauthorized.      As the bankruptcy and district courts noted, even\n\nif this allegation were proven, the resulting loss would not\n\nexceed $7000.\n\n           The DiStefanos further have asserted that Dialessi sold\n\na large quantity of premium wines for an unacceptably low price.\n\nMr.   DiStefano     first    indicated    that   these    wines   were    worth\n\n$25,000,   but    later     conceded    they   probably   were    worth    only\n\n                                       -18-\n\fapproximately $4000.    The evidence indicates that they were sold\n\nfor about $2000.     Giving the DiStefanos the (generous) benefit\n\nof the doubt, we will assume for present purposes (without\n\nfinding) that the DiStefanos could prove that the wines were,\n\nindeed, worth $25,000.        Thus, we will assume a net loss of\n\n$23,000 arising from the sale of these wines.\n\n          Next, the DiStefanos accuse Dialessi of neglecting to\n\npay Massachusetts employee withholding taxes.           Joseph DiStefano\n\nhas testified, however, that he never was held personally liable\n\nfor the taxes and that attachments to secure their payment were\n\nlifted.   Neither was the estate held liable.       Rather, Dialessi\n\nremedied the tax problem himself, with no direct financial\n\nconsequences inuring either to the DiStefanos or to JFD.11\n\n          Finally,    the    appellants   note   that    Dialessi   paid\n\nemployees from an account dedicated to the proceeds of Century's\n\nlottery ticket sales.       They fail, however, to specify how this\n\naction -- even if improper -- might relate to the decline in\n\nJFD's value.\n\n          It is evident that the DiStefanos cannot escape summary\n\njudgment, because they have no meaningful evidence that the\n\nappellees' misconduct resulted in a loss of $119,000 or more in\n\n\n    11The DiStefanos contend that this failure required them to\nincur legal fees to defend an action brought by the Internal\nRevenue Service. We address this argument below in Part II.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fJFD's       value.     Even   on    summary       judgment,    we   cannot     credit\n\nunsupported conjecture and speculation linking JFD's decline\n\nunder the appellees' stewardship to their actions, particularly\n\nwhen    JFD    had     endured     similar    deterioration         in   the   period\n\npreceding its bankruptcy.                 Even a generous accounting of the\n\nappellees' specific misdeeds suggests that the DiStefanos could\n\nprove, at most, a $30,000 loss resulting from those actions.12\n\nThis    figure       does   not    even    approach    the    $119,000     loss   the\n\nDiStefanos would need to prove in order to establish causation.\n\nThus, the bankruptcy and district courts properly concluded that\n\nthe DiStefanos would be unable to prove that the appellees\n\ncaused them any harm.\n\nII.    Losses Associated with the IRS Suit for Taxes Not Withheld\n\n              The DiStefanos also argue that “after Dialessi failed\n\nto pay certain payroll taxes,” Mr. DiStefano “was forced to\n\ndefend himself against” a government claim, and that this cost\n\nwould not have been incurred “but for Appellees' misconduct.”\n\nThis claim is distinct from their claim that the failure to\n\n\n\n\n       12\n      This figure comprises a $7000 loss arising from Dialessi's\nexcessive salary and a $23,000 loss stemming from Dialessi's\ntransfer of the premium wines.    Of course, if we adopted the\nmore likely loss figure for the latter -- $4000 in value minus\nthe $2000 price, for a net $2000 loss -- the maximum loss figure\nthe DiStefanos could prove would be closer to $9000.\n\n                                           -20-\n\fwithhold taxes contributed to JFD's deteriorating value,                              see\n\nPart I, supra, but it, too, fails.\n\n             First,      irrespective       of    whether      Stern      could       have\n\nbreached his fiduciary duties to the DiStefanos by forcing them\n\nto   incur    legal      fees,    the   DiStefanos           have   not    submitted\n\nsufficient evidence to conjure a “genuine issue” of fact with\n\nrespect to those fees.           As noted above, \"[t]he mere existence of\n\na scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position\n\nwill be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury\n\ncould reasonably find for the plaintiff.\"                     Liberty Lobby, 477\n\nU.S. at 252.       Here, there is not.              The record evidence the\n\nDiStefanos cite regarding this issue consists entirely of two\n\noff-hand remarks Mr. DiStefano made at his deposition.                           In one\n\ninstance, referring to Dialessi's failure to pay income tax\n\nwithholdings,      opposing       counsel      asked    DiStefano,        “So,    [that\n\nfailure] hasn't caused any damage to you?”                    He responded, “Yes,\n\nit did.      It caused me tremendous emotional distress, legal\n\nfees.”     Later, counsel sought to confirm that any attachments\n\nfiled on the DiStefanos' property as a result of Dialessi's\n\nactions ultimately were removed.                 DiStefano responded, “To the\n\nbest of my knowledge, after a long period of time and numerous\n\nlegal fees.”       These remarks constitute the entirety of the\n\nevidence     on   this    matter.       There      is   no    indication         of   the\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fmagnitude of the fees referenced, nor of the precise context in\n\nwhich they were incurred.                 Second, even if the DiStefanos\n\ncould point to sufficient evidence of harm to ground this claim,\n\nthey have failed to set forth any legal theory justifying an\n\naward of damages.          “We have steadfastly deemed waived issues\n\nraised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by\n\ndeveloped argumentation.”           United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d\n\n1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997); see also United States v. Rosario-\n\nPerala,    199    F.3d     552,    563    n.4   (1st   Cir.    1999)    (quoting\n\nBongiorno); United States v. Salimonu, 182 F.3d 63, 74 n.10 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (determining that appellant had waived an argument by\n\nfailing    to    develop    it).     Aside      from   the    factual   averment\n\ndescribed above and a single, unsupported assertion that Mr.\n\nDiStefano “was forced to defend against [a government] claim,”\n\nthe DiStefanos' initial brief nowhere provides an argument that\n\nthe appellees owed them any duty relating to the legal fees at\n\nissue.     Their reply brief similarly mentions the harm, noting\n\nthat it would not have occurred but for the appellees' misdeeds,\n\nbut fails even to sketch a theory of liability upon which\n\nrecovery    would    be     appropriate.          At   oral     argument,    the\n\nDiStefanos' counsel cited the legal fees as an example of the\n\nlosses for which they were seeking relief, but again neglected\n\nto link those losses to any duty on Dialessi's part.                        This\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fargument, then, has not been developed to a degree sufficient to\n\nwarrant our consideration.\n\n         AFFIRMED.

The DiStefanos\n\nallege that during the course of JFD's reorganization under\n\nChapter   11   of   the   Bankruptcy   Code,   the    appellees   violated\n\nvarious fiduciary duties owed to them.               These breaches, the\n\nDiStefanos contend, caused them to suffer financial losses on\n\nadvances they had extended to JFD and prevented their recovery\n\non other liens they held against the company's assets.                  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                               Background\n\n          Prior to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings,\n\nJFD operated a liquor store under the trade name Century Liquor\n\nMart (“Century”) in West Springfield, Massachusetts.                Joseph\n\nDiStefano managed the business.        In February 1989, he personally\n\n\n\n\n    1Joseph DiStefano is an unsecured creditor, while Patricia\nDiStefano is an undersecured creditor.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fguaranteed about $300,000 of indebtedness owed by JFD to the\n\nPark West Bank and Trust Company (the “Bank”).\n\n            Century was a successful operation until about 1990.\n\nAfter that, its business declined, probably due in large part to\n\nthe closure of a nearby bridge and a consequent reduction in\n\ntraffic to the shopping center of which the store was a part.\n\nOn June 10, 1993, JFD filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in\n\nthe   United       States    Bankruptcy         Court   for      the     District     of\n\nMassachusetts.         As    part    of    the    Chapter     11    proceeding,       an\n\nOfficial     Unsecured       Creditors'         Committee     (“Committee”)          was\n\nappointed.         With     the     bankruptcy      court's        permission,       the\n\nCommittee    hired     Kamberg,      Berman,      P.C.,    and      appellee      Eugene\n\nBerman in particular, as its counsel.\n\n            It appears from the record that when JFD filed for\n\nbankruptcy, its indebtedness to the Bank totaled approximately\n\n$275,000.      On July 30, 1993, Berman and counsel for the Bank\n\nnegotiated     a    stipulation         agreeing    that      the      Bank   held    an\n\nenforceable first security interest in all of JFD's personal\n\nproperty     and    cash.         The     bankruptcy      court        approved     this\n\nstipulation on August 18, 1993.             Subsequently, during the autumn\n\nof 1993, Patricia DiStefano, JFD and the Committee also agreed\n\nthat Mrs. DiStefano possessed an enforceable claim against the\n\nJFD estate in the amount of $40,000; that her claim was secured\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fby JFD's inventory, proceeds, and accounts receivable; and that\n\nit was junior to the Bank's interests. 2                   The bankruptcy court\n\napproved this stipulation on November 17, 1993.\n\n              In the meantime, on September 24, 1993, the Committee\n\nhad    filed      a   motion    to     convert     the   case    to    a     Chapter   7\n\nliquidation.          The Committee alleged that JFD had lost $475,000\n\nbetween August 1990 and May 1993, that it was poorly managed,\n\nand that it faced continued financial losses.                         On October 12,\n\nperhaps in response to the Committee's efforts, Joseph DiStefano\n\nentered      into     a    stipulation      (the   “October     12     Stipulation”)\n\npursuant to which he ceded management responsibility for Century\n\nto Roger Dialessi and the Committee withdrew its conversion\n\nmotion.      But immediately before this agreement was memorialized\n\nand approved by the bankruptcy court, the Bank filed its own\n\nmotion to convert the case to a Chapter 7 action, charging that\n\nthe    Committee          unlawfully    had    installed   new       JFD     management\n\nwithout regard to the safeguarding of the Bank's interests.                         The\n\nBank       also   complained         that     JFD's   inventory        had     declined\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     The stipulation also provided that if Mrs. DiStefano\nreceived less than $25,000 on her claim, she would have a junior\nsecurity interest in JFD's liquor license for the difference\nbetween the amount paid and $25,000.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fsubstantially since the bankruptcy proceeding had commenced,\n\nthus reducing the security of its lien.3\n\n              On October 29, 1993, the United States Trustee (“UST”)\n\nobjected to the October 12 Stipulation and filed a motion for\n\nthe appointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee, claiming that Dialessi\n\nwas unlawfully acting as a de facto trustee.             On November 10,\n\n1993, however, JFD, the Committee, the Bank, and the UST entered\n\ninto a stipulation (the “Appointment Stipulation”) providing\n\nthat Dialessi would be appointed as the Chapter 11 Trustee and\n\nlimiting his pay to $600 per week for “services rendered in the\n\noperation of the business of the Debtor.”             That same day, the\n\nsame parties except for the UST entered into another stipulation\n\nthat       accorded   the   Bank   a   perfected,   enforceable   security\n\ninterest in JFD's liquor license.            As part of this agreement,\n\nthe Bank agreed both to withdraw its motion to convert the\n\nproceedings into a Chapter 7 action and not to seek such a\n\nconversion in the future so long as certain stated conditions\n\nwere met.       The bankruptcy court approved both stipulations.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n     At around the same time, the Bank froze JFD's account,\nwhich contained about $40,000, and refused to grant Dialessi\ncheck-signing authority on the account.      JFD subsequently\nbrought an adversarial action seeking an order requiring the\nBank to allow access to its account.      The Bank relented,\nallowing Dialessi access.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           The   parties'     stipulation   notwithstanding,     and   for\n\nreasons that are not clear, appellee Stern was appointed as\n\ntrustee instead of Dialessi.4         Dialessi continued to manage\n\nCentury.\n\n           On May 31, 1994, Stern, acting as Trustee, moved to\n\nsell Century's personal property, including its liquor license,\n\nfor $275,000, including a $20,000 “carve-out” to be paid to the\n\nbankruptcy estate.        By this point, however, Century's liquor\n\nlicense    was   on   a   Massachusetts   Alcoholic   Beverage   Control\n\nCommission (\"ABCC\") payment “delinquent list” pursuant to Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 138, § 25.       That provision states that delinquent\n\nlicensees may only make cash purchases from liquor wholesalers.\n\nMoreover, the statute's requirements continue to apply even if\n\nthe license is transferred.       Thus, the Committee objected to the\n\nasset sale, arguing that the license could only be sold subject\n\nto the bar against purchases made other than for cash.                 The\n\ncourt ultimately rejected the proposed sale on the ground that\n\nit would not substantially benefit the estate.\n\n\n\n\n    4Citing Berman's deposition testimony, the appellants\nsuggest that the UST opposed Dialessi's appointment. As noted\nabove, however, the UST was a party to the Appointment\nStipulation.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f          As   Century's   general   manager,    Dialessi   engaged   in\n\nvarious   activities   relevant    to   this    appeal.     These   were\n\ndescribed by the district court as follows:\n\n          Dialessi . . . discontinued the use of a\n          computerized cash register system capable of\n          monitoring inventory levels.     He contends\n          that such action was prompted by Mr.\n          DiStefano's failure to record beer and wine\n          purchases in the system, which he claims\n          resulted in the system generating inaccurate\n          inventory reports.   Additionally, Dialessi\n          sold some of Century['s] wine inventory to\n          another liquor store owner for approximately\n          $2,000.   Although Mr. DiStefano originally\n          maintained at his deposition that the value\n          of the wine sold was $25,000, cross\n          examination revealed that this position was\n          based on what another employee had allegedly\n          told him. He later conceded that the value\n          of the wine sold was approximately $4,000,\n          which is more consistent with Dialessi's\n          affidavit, which stated that the liquor was\n          worth $3,200. Moreover, Dialessi failed to\n          pay Massachusetts withholding taxes, but\n          personally resolved all claims by the\n          government at no expense to JFD. Lastly,\n          Dialessi, due to JFD's cash shortage, paid\n          employees out of an account in which\n          proceeds from JFD's lottery ticket sales\n          were deposited.\n\nDiStefano v.

Mass. 1999).\n\n          On August 26, 1994, Stern moved to convert the case to\n\na Chapter 7 proceeding.       The court allowed his motion and\n\nappointed Stern as the Chapter 7 Trustee.        On December 20, 1994,\n\nStern sold Century's liquor license for $100,000; he sold JFD's\n\npersonal property separately for about $31,000.           In June 1995,\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe court ordered the ABCC to approve the license's transfer\n\nfree and clear of its delinquent status.                 Due to the disparity\n\nbetween the value of the Bank's loan, which, at that point,\n\nexceeded $300,000, and the price for which the JFD assets were\n\nsold, $131,000, Mr. DiStefano was required to pay $50,000 on his\n\nguaranty (pursuant to a settlement with the Bank), and Mrs.\n\nDiStefano      failed      to   recover     anything    on    her    undersecured\n\ninterest in the JFD estate.\n\n              On February 14, 1997, the DiStefanos filed an action\n\nin    the    Massachusetts      Superior     Court    against   Stern,     Berman,\n\nDialessi, the Bank, and the Bank's attorney.5                   The DiStefanos\n\nalleged      that    the    appellees       behaved    negligently        in   their\n\nstewardship of JFD and breached fiduciary duties owed to them as\n\nshareholders and creditors of JFD.6              On March 11, 1997, Berman\n\nhad    the    case   removed     to   the    bankruptcy      court   as    a   “core\n\nproceeding” in JFD's bankruptcy case.\n\n              Eventually, the appellees moved for summary judgment.\n\nThey claimed, inter alia, that the DiStefanos lacked standing to\n\n\n\n       5The Bank and its counsel subsequently were dropped from the\ncase.\n       6\n      The DiStefanos contended that Stern and Dialessi owed them\nfiduciary duties by virtue of their positions as bankruptcy\ntrustee and Century's manager, respectively, and that Berman\nowed such a duty by virtue of his de facto control of JFD during\nthe Chapter 11 proceedings.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpursue their claims and that their own behavior did not result\n\nin any harm to the DiStefanos.                The bankruptcy court granted\n\nsummary judgment to all the appellees on all counts.                     The court\n\ndetermined, in pertinent part, that the DiStefanos indeed lacked\n\nstanding    to     bring    their    claims    and   that,       irrespective    of\n\nstanding, the DiStefanos would be unable to prove that the\n\nappellees' conduct caused them any damages.\n\n            The DiStefanos appealed the bankruptcy court's ruling\n\nto the district court.         That court affirmed the grant of summary\n\njudgment, grounding its decision entirely on the DiStefanos'\n\ninability    to     prove    that     their   losses      were    caused   by   the\n\nappellees' conduct.

We explain by discussing separately the two\n\nclasses of harm the DiStefanos have identified:                      (1) losses\n\nrelating to JFD's declining value and (2) the legal fees the\n\nDiStefanos purportedly incurred defending an action brought by\n\nthe IRS because of Dialessi's failure to withhold employee\n\nincome taxes as manager of Century.\n\nI.     Losses Associated with the JFD Estate's Declining Value\n\n            The      DiStefanos       assert     various    arguments     against\n\nDialessi, Berman and Stern, most of which boil down to the\n\nfollowing contentions: (1) the DiStefanos were creditors and\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fshareholders of JFD; (2) Dialessi and Stern, who held appointed\n\npositions in JFD's bankruptcy proceedings, and Berman, who acted\n\nas    a    “de   facto”      bankruptcy          trustee,     owed   the    DiStefanos\n\nfiduciary duties in the latter's capacity as JFD's creditors and\n\nshareholders; (3) each appellee breached his fiduciary duty to\n\nthe       DiStefanos;       (4)   as    a   proximate       consequence       of    these\n\nbreaches, JFD lost substantial value before the ultimate sale of\n\nits       assets,    resulting         in   the    DiStefanos'       losses    on    Mrs.\n\nDiStefano's          lien    as   outlined         in   the    November       17,   1993\n\nstipulation          and     on   Mr.       DiStefano's       guaranty        of    JFD's\n\nindebtedness to the Bank.                   Although the DiStefanos may have\n\nsuffered other losses, such as those associated with their\n\nequity interest in JFD -- which was ultimately worthless --\n\nthose losses are not here at issue, because the DiStefanos could\n\nonly have avoided those losses if the JFD estate had first\n\nsatisfied all claims of JFD's general creditors.\n\n              The DiStefanos' claims cannot survive summary judgment\n\nbecause       they    have    failed        to    adduce    adequate       evidence    of\n\ncausation linking their losses to the appellees' conduct.                            That\n\nis, even if we were to assume arguendo that the appellees each\n\nowed a fiduciary duty to the DiStefanos, that they each breached\n\nthat duty, and that JFD's value declined precipitously during\n\nthe course of its bankruptcy proceedings, the DiStefanos have\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fnot submitted enough evidence indicating a causal link between\n\nthe   breaches     and    the   losses   to    survive    summary   judgment.\n\nCorrelation alone, here as elsewhere, does not prove causation.\n\nWe explain with respect to each allegation made in support of\n\nthe DiStefanos' claims.\n\nA.    Timing of the Sale\n\n            The DiStefanos' principal allegation in support of\n\ntheir claims relates to the timing of the sale of Century's\n\nassets.     As noted above, in May of 1994, Stern filed a motion\n\nseeking approval to sell JFD's business to a third party in\n\nexchange for $275,000.          The DiStefanos contend that at the time\n\nof that proposed sale, the Bank's claim was valued at $294,000.\n\nIf the sale had proceeded, they argue, the Bank would have\n\nrecovered    all    but   $19,000   of   its    total    claim   from   JFD   in\n\nliquidation.       At the very least, Mr. DiStefano's exposure under\n\nthe loan guaranty would have been far less than the $50,000 for\n\nwhich he ultimately was held responsible. 7                Berman, however,\n\n\n      7\n      The DiStefanos also theorize that there was a “likelihood\nthat other bidders would have offered more, leaving (at most) a\nsmall deficiency for the Bank.” This price increase presumably\nwould have further reduced the DiStefanos' exposure and might\neven have resulted in a surplus that would have inured to the\nbenefit of an undersecured creditor such as Mrs. DiStefano.\nHowever, Stern's motion specified the $275,000 price and did not\non its face provide for any further bidding process. Even if it\nhad, we would be unwilling to rely upon speculation that a\nhigher   price  would   have   been  reached.     “[C]onclusory\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation\n\n                                     -12-\n\fobjected to the sale.           On July 13, 1994, the court held a\n\nhearing   on    the   motion   and   Berman's       objection.        The    court\n\nultimately refused to allow the sale.

As   the   district   court     pointed   out,   the\n\nDiStefanos          presented   no   evidence   regarding    the   price   JFD's\n\nassets would have commanded at any earlier sale and no evidence\n\nthat JFD's demise was or should have been a foregone conclusion\n\nfrom the opening months of JFD's bankruptcy.9                      Absent such\n\nevidence, there would have no basis upon which to doubt a\n\ntrustee's business judgment.\n\nB.     Causation of Harm\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      Indeed, any suggestion that JFD's assets should have been\nsold earlier than May 1994 presupposes that the trustee should\nhave known that the value of those assets would necessarily\ndecline over time.     That presupposition conflicts with the\nDiStefanos' assertion that JFD's losses proximately were caused\nby particular actions or inactions on the part of the appellees.\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            We turn, then, to whether, considering the respective\n\nvalue of JFD and of the Bank's loan when the assets were\n\nactually sold, the DiStefanos can demonstrate that their harms\n\nwere caused by the appellees' misdeeds.                  They cannot.\n\n            The        DiStefanos     suggest         that      the    appellees'\n\nmismanagement resulted in JFD's losses, and hence in their own.\n\nBut the record makes clear, and there is no dispute, that JFD\n\nwas hemorrhaging value long before its bankruptcy filing.                        In\n\nthe three years preceding JFD's bankruptcy, while Century was\n\nunder Mr. DiStefano's management, the business lost a total of\n\n$403,874.        When     JFD   initiated     bankruptcy        proceedings,    the\n\nbankruptcy       schedules      indicated       assets    of    $549,331.37     and\n\nliabilities of $1,100,662 -- a                negative net equity of over\n\n$500,000.\n\n            By the time JFD's liquor license and personal property\n\nwere sold, the value of its assets was about $131,000.                          The\n\namount of the Bank's loan, meanwhile, had increased to over\n\n$300,000.         As   we   have    stated,     the     harms    claimed   by   the\n\nDiStefanos consist of Mr. DiStefano's $50,000 liability on his\n\nguaranty    of    JFD's     loan   from   the    Bank    and    Mrs.   DiStefano's\n\nforfeited junior interest in JFD's assets.                     These losses could\n\nhave been “caused” by the appellees' actions only if JFD's\n\nassets, but for those actions, would have exceeded $250,000 at\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthe time of the sale -- that is, if those actions caused at\n\nleast $119,000 in lost value.   Otherwise, Mr. DiStefano would\n\nhave remained liable for the entire $50,000 he ultimately paid\n\non his guaranty, and the DiStefanos would have suffered the same\n\nharms about which they now complain.10\n\n         The DiStefanos invite us to disregard JFD's prepetition\n\nlosses and to assume that any decline in JFD's value following\n\nthe initiation of bankruptcy proceedings must be attributed to\n\nthe appellees' purported malfeasance.    This we cannot do.   The\n\nDiStefanos bear the burden of demonstrating that any particular\n\nlosses were attributable to the appellees.   We thus review the\n\nappellees' specific “misdeeds” to determine the most generous\n\nloss figures that the DiStefanos might be able to prove at\n\ntrial.\n\n         The DiStefanos first contend that Century's business\n\ndeclined precipitously during Dialessi's tenure as its manager.\n\n\n\n    10As noted, the Bank's loan in fact exceeded $300,000.\nAlthough the loan's balance was appreciating as time passed, we\nwill use the $300,000 figure as the basis for our analysis.\nGreater indebtedness to the Bank would only have required that\nthe appellee's acts caused even more damage in order for the\nDiStefanos to merit relief because the total difference between\nthe Bank's claim and JFD's value would be correspondingly\ngreater. Thus, our assumption of a $300,000 secured interest\nredounds in the DiStefanos' favor.     Even assuming that the\nBank's loan amounted to “only” $300,000, the DiStefanos cannot\nprove that their claimed losses resulted from the appellees'\nbehavior.\n\n                             -17-\n\fAs the district court noted, however, given JFD's steep pre-\n\nbankruptcy decline, the DiStefanos would be unable to link post-\n\nbankruptcy    losses      to   Dialessi's      conduct,    absent   specific\n\nallegations of mismanagement:\n\n           [T]he overwhelming and undisputed facts show\n           that Century Liquor was in severe financial\n           distress   long   before   Dialessi   became\n           manager . . . . Following the commencement\n           of  the   bankruptcy   proceeding   and  the\n           appointment of Dialessi as manager, the\n           record does not reflect any significant\n           decline in business different from the\n           preexisting downward spiral that ended in\n           bankruptcy.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1531532\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">DiStefano,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1531532/distefano-v-stern/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">117-18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n           The DiStefanos next charge that Dialessi discontinued\n\nthe use of Century's computerized inventory monitoring system.\n\nHowever,     they    offer     no   proof      whatsoever    linking      this\n\ndiscontinuance to any decline in JFD's value.\n\n           Mr. and Mrs. DiStefano also allege that Dialessi paid\n\nhimself $150 more per week than the Appointment Stipulation\n\nauthorized.      As the bankruptcy and district courts noted, even\n\nif this allegation were proven, the resulting loss would not\n\nexceed $7000.\n\n           The DiStefanos further have asserted that Dialessi sold\n\na large quantity of premium wines for an unacceptably low price.\n\nMr.   DiStefano     first    indicated    that   these    wines   were    worth\n\n$25,000,   but    later     conceded    they   probably   were    worth    only\n\n                                       -18-\n\fapproximately $4000.    The evidence indicates that they were sold\n\nfor about $2000.     Giving the DiStefanos the (generous) benefit\n\nof the doubt, we will assume for present purposes (without\n\nfinding) that the DiStefanos could prove that the wines were,\n\nindeed, worth $25,000.        Thus, we will assume a net loss of\n\n$23,000 arising from the sale of these wines.\n\n          Next, the DiStefanos accuse Dialessi of neglecting to\n\npay Massachusetts employee withholding taxes.           Joseph DiStefano\n\nhas testified, however, that he never was held personally liable\n\nfor the taxes and that attachments to secure their payment were\n\nlifted.   Neither was the estate held liable.       Rather, Dialessi\n\nremedied the tax problem himself, with no direct financial\n\nconsequences inuring either to the DiStefanos or to JFD.11\n\n          Finally,    the    appellants   note   that    Dialessi   paid\n\nemployees from an account dedicated to the proceeds of Century's\n\nlottery ticket sales.       They fail, however, to specify how this\n\naction -- even if improper -- might relate to the decline in\n\nJFD's value.\n\n          It is evident that the DiStefanos cannot escape summary\n\njudgment, because they have no meaningful evidence that the\n\nappellees' misconduct resulted in a loss of $119,000 or more in\n\n\n    11The DiStefanos contend that this failure required them to\nincur legal fees to defend an action brought by the Internal\nRevenue Service. We address this argument below in Part II.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fJFD's       value.     Even   on    summary       judgment,    we   cannot     credit\n\nunsupported conjecture and speculation linking JFD's decline\n\nunder the appellees' stewardship to their actions, particularly\n\nwhen    JFD    had     endured     similar    deterioration         in   the   period\n\npreceding its bankruptcy.                 Even a generous accounting of the\n\nappellees' specific misdeeds suggests that the DiStefanos could\n\nprove, at most, a $30,000 loss resulting from those actions.12\n\nThis    figure       does   not    even    approach    the    $119,000     loss   the\n\nDiStefanos would need to prove in order to establish causation.\n\nThus, the bankruptcy and district courts properly concluded that\n\nthe DiStefanos would be unable to prove that the appellees\n\ncaused them any harm.\n\nII.    Losses Associated with the IRS Suit for Taxes Not Withheld\n\n              The DiStefanos also argue that “after Dialessi failed\n\nto pay certain payroll taxes,” Mr. DiStefano “was forced to\n\ndefend himself against” a government claim, and that this cost\n\nwould not have been incurred “but for Appellees' misconduct.”\n\nThis claim is distinct from their claim that the failure to\n\n\n\n\n       12\n      This figure comprises a $7000 loss arising from Dialessi's\nexcessive salary and a $23,000 loss stemming from Dialessi's\ntransfer of the premium wines.    Of course, if we adopted the\nmore likely loss figure for the latter -- $4000 in value minus\nthe $2000 price, for a net $2000 loss -- the maximum loss figure\nthe DiStefanos could prove would be closer to $9000.\n\n                                           -20-\n\fwithhold taxes contributed to JFD's deteriorating value,                              see\n\nPart </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, but it, too, fails.\n\n             First,      irrespective       of    whether      Stern      could       have\n\nbreached his fiduciary duties to the DiStefanos by forcing them\n\nto   incur    legal      fees,    the   DiStefanos           have   not    submitted\n\nsufficient evidence to conjure a “genuine issue” of fact with\n\nrespect to those fees.           As noted above, \"[t]he mere existence of\n\na scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position\n\nwill be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury\n\ncould reasonably find for the plaintiff.\"                     Liberty </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lobby,</span> <span class=\"volume\">477</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">252</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.       Here, there is not.              The record evidence the\n\nDiStefanos cite regarding this issue consists entirely of two\n\noff-hand remarks Mr. DiStefano made at his deposition.                           In one\n\ninstance, referring to Dialessi's failure to pay income tax\n\nwithholdings,      opposing       counsel      asked    DiStefano,        “So,    [that\n\nfailure] hasn't caused any damage to you?”                    He responded, “Yes,\n\nit did.      It caused me tremendous emotional distress, legal\n\nfees.”     Later, counsel sought to confirm that any attachments\n\nfiled on the DiStefanos' property as a result of Dialessi's\n\nactions ultimately were removed.                 DiStefano responded, “To the\n\nbest of my knowledge, after a long period of time and numerous\n\nlegal fees.”       These remarks constitute the entirety of the\n\nevidence     on   this    matter.       There      is   no    indication         of   the\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fmagnitude of the fees referenced, nor of the precise context in\n\nwhich they were incurred.                 Second, even if the DiStefanos\n\ncould point to sufficient evidence of harm to ground this claim,\n\nthey have failed to set forth any legal theory justifying an\n\naward of damages.          “We have steadfastly deemed waived issues\n\nraised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by\n\ndeveloped argumentation.”           United States v.
