  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\n       United States Court of Appeals\r\n           For the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 99-1589\r\n\n            ANNETTE B. DEMAURO,\r\n\n                 Appellant,\r\n\n                     v.\r\n\nJOSEPH DEMAURO, EDWARD MARTIN, DEMAURO CO., INC., NICHOLAS\r\nDEMAURO, TRI-AREA DEVELOPMENT CO., INC, and JOAN MARTIN,\r\n\n           Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n      FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n[Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n            Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n       Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n         and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nS. James Boumil, for appellant.\r\n\nKathleen M. Morrissey, Zevnik, Horton, Guibord, McGovern,\r\nPalmer &amp; Fognani, LLP with whom Bernard A. Dwork, Kevin P. Scanlon,\r\nBarron &amp; Stadfelfd, P.C., Richard L. Fox, and Carragher &amp; Fox, were\r\non brief for appellees.\r\n\nFebruary 16, 2000\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  This case is related to a\r\nlengthy and bitterly fought divorce proceeding in New Hampshire\r\nbetween plaintiff Annette B. DeMauro and the principal defendant,\r\nJoseph DeMauro.  It would appear that the divorce proceedings were\r\nprecipitated when Annette discovered that Joseph was having an\r\naffair with the household maid.  As far as we know, there has been\r\nno final decree in the divorce proceeding.\r\nPlaintiff filed a six count amended complaint against her\r\nhusband and the five other named defendants.  Count One alleged\r\nviolations of 18 U.S.C.  1961-1968 (1982), the Racketeer\r\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  Count Two alleged\r\nconspiracy by the defendants under RICO.  \r\nThe balance of the complaint alleged pendent state-law\r\nclaims.  Count Three alleged intentional infliction of emotional\r\ndistress. Count Four alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  Count Five\r\nalleged illegal telephonic recordings.  Count Six alleged\r\nfraudulent conveyances.\r\nAfter a lengthy hearing, the district court dismissed the\r\ntwo RICO counts for failure to state a cause of action.  It stated,\r\ninter alia:\r\n          What I cannot find is a pattern of\r\nracketeering activity as defined by the RICO\r\nstatute.  Specifically, what I cannot find\r\nwhat the plaintiff claims to be a violation of\r\nthe wire fraud and mail fraud statutes. \r\n[W]here this complaint is deficient is that it\r\ndoes not allege false or fraudulent pretenses,\r\nrepresentations or promises, and to the extent\r\nthat it does so allege, those allegations are\r\nnot made with the specificity required by Rule\r\n9(b).\r\n\nThe court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\r\nwith respect to Counts Three, Four, and Six.  The court, sua\r\nsponte, dismissed the federal claim purported to be asserted in\r\nCount Five (entitled \"Illegal Telephone Recordings\") and declined\r\nto exercise jurisdiction over any state claim purported to be\r\nstated in that count.  For the following reasons, we affirm, but on\r\nsomewhat different grounds, as we can do. See Acushnet Co. v.\r\nMohasco Co., 191 F.3d 69, 76 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Cablevision\r\nof Boston, Inc. v. Public Improvement Comm'n of the City of Boston,\r\n184 F.3d 88, 97 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nI. Standard of Review\r\nWe review the district court's decision to dismiss Counts\r\nOne and Two of the complaint de novo. See Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc.,\r\n103 F.3d 186, 190 (1st Cir. 1996). We accept as true \"all well-\r\npleaded factual averments and indulg[e] all reasonable inferences\r\nin the plaintiff's favor.\" Id.  The district court's order of\r\ndismissal may be affirmed only if the \"facts alleged, taken as\r\ntrue, do not justify recovery.\" Id. \r\nII. The Elements of a RICO Claim\r\nRICO makes it unlawful \"for any person employed by or\r\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of\r\nwhich effect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\r\nparticipate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\r\nenterprises' affairs through a pattern of racketeering . . . .\" 18\r\nU.S.C.  1962(c).  Section 1964(c) provides that a private party\r\ninjured in his business or property as a result of a RICO violation\r\nmay pursue a civil claim for treble damages.  Although RICO is\r\nsilent about what limitations period governs the filing of civil\r\nRICO claims, the Supreme Court has held that civil RICO actions are\r\nsubject to a four-year limitations period. See Klehr v. A.O. Smith\r\nCorp., 521 U.S. 179, 183 (1997)(holding that civil RICO claims are\r\nsubject to a four-year limitation period contained in  4B of the\r\nClayton Act   the statute of limitations that governs private civil\r\nantitrust actions seeking treble damages). \r\nFor a civil RICO claim to survive a motion to dismiss,\r\nthe  complaint must allege: \"(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)\r\nthrough a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\" Sedima, S.P.R.L.\r\nv. Imrex Co.,Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985); see also Doyle, 103\r\nF.3d at 190.  \"In addition, the plaintiff only has standing if, and\r\ncan only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his\r\nbusiness or property by the conduct constituting the violation.\"\r\nSedima, 473 U.S. at 496.\r\nThe first requirement that the plaintiff must establish\r\nin order to survive a motion to dismiss is the existence of an\r\nenterprise. See Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 889 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  An \"enterprise includes any individual, partnership,\r\ncorporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or\r\ngroup of individuals associated in fact although not a legal\r\nentity.\"  18 U.S.C.  1961(4).\r\nOnce the plaintiff establishes the existence of an\r\nenterprise, she must allege a pattern of racketeering activity. \r\nSee McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Heritage Travel, Inc., 904 F.2d\r\n786, 788 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Establishing a RICO violation under\r\neither section 1962(a) or section 1962(c), requires proof of a\r\n'pattern of racketeering activity' . . . .\").  A pattern of\r\nracketeering activity involves at least two predicate acts, the\r\nsecond of which must occur within 10 years of the first.  See 18\r\nU.S.C.  1961(5); see also Roeder v. Alpha Industries, Inc., 814\r\nF.2d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1987).  This court has stated that \"[i]t is\r\nnot enough for a plaintiff to file a RICO action, chant the\r\nstatutory mantra, and leave the identification of predicate acts to\r\nthe time of trial.\"  Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d\r\n34, 42 (1st Cir. 1991).   Predicate acts are acts indictable under\r\ncertain specified laws, including the mail and wire fraud statutes.\r\nSee McEvoy, 904 F.2d at 788.  \r\nIt is well-settled in this circuit that when a plaintiff\r\nrelies on predicate acts containing fraud, they are subject to Rule\r\n9(b)'s heightened pleading requirement.  See New England Data\r\nServices, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286, 288 (1st Cir. 1987)(stating\r\nthat Rule 9(b) has been strictly applied where fraud lies at the\r\ncore of the claim).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) states\r\nthat fraud must be pled with particularity.  Thus, in order to\r\nsurvive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must state the time,\r\nplace, and content of the alleged misrepresentation perpetuating\r\nthat fraud.  See Ahmed, 118 F.3d at 889.\r\nIt is also well-established that a single criminal event\r\ndoes not constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. See Apparel\r\nArt Int'l, Inc., v. Jacobson, 967 F.2d 720, 722 (1st Cir. 1992);\r\nsee also H.J. Inc. v. Northweatern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.\r\n229, 239 (1989)(finding \"sporadic activity\" does not form a\r\npattern); Roeder, 814 F.2d at 31 (holding that a single bribe paid\r\nin three installments, each constituting a mail fraud violation,\r\ndid not make out a \"pattern\"). \r\nAdequately alleging two predicate acts, although\r\nnecessary, is not sufficient to establish a \"pattern of\r\nracketeering activity.\"  \"The use of the word 'requires'   as\r\nopposed to 'means'   in  1651(5) indicates that alleging two acts\r\nof mail fraud (or two or more other statutorily defined predicate\r\nacts) is necessary but not sufficient to establish a pattern of\r\nracketeering activity.\"  Fleet Credit Corp. v. Sion, 893 F.2d 441,\r\n444 (1st Cir. 1990); see also H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 237; Roeder,\r\n814 F.2d at 30 (\"It is not enough that defendants may have engaged\r\nin racketeering 'acts'; these acts must constitute a 'pattern of\r\nracketeering activity' as construed under RICO for there to be\r\nliability.\").  \r\nFollowing the Supreme Court's lead in H.J., Inc., 492\r\nU.S. at 238, we have held that a plaintiff seeking to establish a\r\n\"pattern of racketeering activity\" must establish that the\r\n\"predicate acts are related and that they amount to or pose the\r\nthreat of continued criminal activity (the 'continuity'\r\nrequirement).\"  Ahmed, 118 F.3d at 889; see also Fleet, 893 F.2d at\r\n444 (holding that a pattern of racketeering activity is formed if\r\n(a) the predicate acts were related, and (b) the predicate acts\r\namount to, or pose a threat of, continued criminal activity); \r\nRoeder, 814 F.2d at 30 (\"The constituent elements must be\r\nsufficiently related to one another and threaten to be more than an\r\nisolated occurrence.\").\r\nTo fulfill the relatedness requirement, the predicate\r\nacts must have the \"same or similar purposes, participants,\r\nvictims, or methods, or otherwise be interrelated by distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics and not be isolated events.\"  Ahmed, 118 F.3d at\r\n889; see also Fleet, 893 F.2d at 445.  In establishing the\r\ncontinuity prong, the plaintiff must show \"either that the related\r\npredicates 'amounted to' continued criminal activity or that there\r\nwas, even though the predicate acts did not span a significant\r\ntime, a 'threat' or realistic prospect of continued activity in\r\ntime yet to come.\"  Ahmed, 118 F.3d at 889 (quoting Feinstein, 942\r\nF.2d at 45).\r\nThe Supreme Court in H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241, held\r\nthat predicate acts amount to continued activity when they evince\r\na \"closed period of repeated conduct\" or \"past conduct that by its\r\nnature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\" The\r\nCourt has defined this as:\r\n                    a series of related predicates\r\n     extending over a substantial period\r\n     of time.  Predicate acts extending\r\n     over a few weeks or months and\r\n     threatening no future criminal\r\n     conduct do not satisfy this\r\n     requirement: Congress was concerned\r\n     in RICO with long-term criminal\r\n     conduct.\r\n\nId. at 242.\r\nWe have previously stated that a threat of continued\r\ncriminal activity for purposes of RICO is not established \"merely\r\nby demonstrating that the [defendants'] acts of common law fraud\r\nwere a regular way of conducting their ongoing businesses.  Rather,\r\nthe [plaintiff] must demonstrate that the predicate acts . . . \r\nwere a regular way of conducting the ongoing businesses.\" Fleet,\r\n893 F.2d at 448.\r\nWith these tenets in mind, we turn to the plaintiff's \r\ncomplaint. \r\nIII. Analyisis\r\nParagraphs 12 through 17 of Count One of the complaint\r\nallege in effect:\r\nParagraph 12: At the time of their marriage Annette and\r\nJoseph had few assets.  Joseph was \"in effect bankrupt.\"  In 1975\r\nthey left Japan and moved to the Middle East where Joseph sought\r\nopportunities to engage in heavy construction; \"an opportunity was\r\nfound.\"  \r\nParagraph 13: Before taking Annette to the \"extreme\r\nhardship\" of the Middle East, Joseph promised Annette that they\r\nwould \"share and share alike\" in any success they achieved.\r\nParagraph 14: Joseph established a bank account for\r\nAnnette and himself, first in the Middle East, and then in\r\nSwitzerland.  Joseph deposited the profits from the business into\r\n\"their\" account to pay their expenses and \"apparently to induce her\r\nto believe that he was maintaining accounts in both names as\r\npromised.\"  Joseph induced Annette to believe, \"by his repeated\r\npromises, [that] they would share equally and hold\" money earned in\r\nthe Middle East for their \"mutual benefit and control.\"\r\nParagraph 15: Annette enhanced the success of the\r\nbusiness by actually working in the office with Joseph, by\r\narranging and providing entertainment and social activities for\r\nemployees and customers, by providing counseling  and psychological\r\nassistance to employees of the company and their families, and by\r\nsharing the physical risk of the location.\r\nParagraph 16: Joseph, either directly or indirectly,\r\nestablished bank accounts in foreign jurisdictions in the name of\r\nNicholas DeMauro.  Into those accounts, Joseph deposited or caused\r\nto be deposited profits from the business and joint assets, thus\r\nconcealing the assets from Annette.  This scheme continues to this\r\nday.\r\nParagraph 17: Over the years the business earned millions\r\nof dollars by Joseph's own accounting; substantial money was earned\r\non these profits. Annette did not object to the receipt and\r\nmanagement of these funds by Joseph because he represented that he\r\nwas taking care of their monetary affairs and was investing for\r\nboth of them.\r\n\nNone of the allegations in paragraphs 12 through 17 show\r\nan enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. \r\nConcealment of assets by a husband from a wife is reprehensible and\r\nmay be a crime under certain circumstances but that does not render\r\nit a pattern of racketeering activity perpetuated through an\r\nenterprise.  Moreover, paragraph 17 states that \"Annette did not\r\nobject to the management of these funds by Joseph.\"\r\n\nParagraphs 18 through 21 allege in effect:   \r\nParagraph 18: Starting in 1976, Joseph started a pattern\r\nof racketeering activity \"known as the RICO conduct\" which\r\ncontinues to this day.  This pattern of activity was designed to\r\nconceal from Annette the assets accumulated from the business and\r\nto convince Annette and others that the assets were being held\r\njointly while actually Joseph defrauded her and misled her and\r\nothers as to their nature, location, extent and existence.\r\nParagraph 19: Joseph conspired with the other defendants\r\nin a continuous enterprise continuing to this day.  The corporate\r\ndefendants were used as shams to further the RICO enterprise.  All\r\nthe named personal defendants were agents and co-conspirators of\r\nJoseph.\r\nParagraph 20: Joseph, acting in concert with the other\r\ndefendants from time to time, by means of \"false pretenses,\r\nrepresentations and 'devices' established bank and investment\r\naccounts in Switzerland, Middle East, France, Liechtenstein,\r\nseveral states of the United States.\"  Most of these accounts were\r\nestablished under the names of \"straws, sham trusts and phony\r\nfoundations.\"  This was all done to conceal the assets from Annette\r\nand other creditors.  Thus, assets of Annette, including assets\r\nfrom her first marriage, were taken from her and concealed.\r\nParagraph 21: In doing the things alleged in Paragraph\r\n20, Joseph made \"extensive use of the wires and mails of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\nParagraphs 18 through 21 fail to plead fraud with\r\nparticularity.  Paragraph 18 uses the words \"pattern of\r\nracketeering activity,\" \"RICO conduct,\" and \"defrauded,\" but does\r\nnot specify as to when the activity took place and what was done. \r\nParagraphs 19, 20, and 21, similarly use broad conclusory language. \r\nThe last sentence of paragraph 20 does not state either the value\r\nof Annette's assets or of what they consisted.  We do not doubt\r\nthat Joseph made \"extensive use of the wires and mails of the\r\nUnited States\" but that is only one factor to consider in\r\ndetermining the validity of the complaint.  As we have stated\r\npreviously, to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to Rule\r\n9(b), a plaintiff must state the time, place, and content of the\r\nalleged misrepresentation perpetuating the fraud.  Annette fails to\r\ndo this.\r\n\nParagraphs 22 through 28 allege in effect:\r\nParagraph 22: Joseph caused property known as 2595 Ocean\r\nBlvd., Rye Beach, NH to be placed in the name of the \"Klaidonis\r\nFoundation\" despite the fact that a Purchase and Sale Agreement for\r\nthe property had been executed in the names of Annette and Joseph. \r\nAnnette had not been informed of the change in ownership of the\r\nproperty.\r\nParagraph 23: In operating the Klaidonis Foundation,\r\nJoseph used the wires and mails of the United States to transfer\r\n\"in excess of $2 million in interstate commerce in furtherance of\r\nthis scheme.\"  The existence of the Klaidonis Foundation was\r\nconcealed from Annette and only discovered recently.  The existence\r\nof this sham foundation was only discovered after the divorce\r\naction commenced.\r\nParagraph 24: Exhibit A is a true and accurate copy of\r\nthe deposition of the Honorable John Maher (now a judge) concerning\r\nthe purchase of the 2595 Ocean Blvd. property.  It summarizes the\r\ndeposition testimony of Judge Maher in four subparagraphs.\r\nParagraph 25: Joseph induced Judge Maher to place the\r\nproperty in the name of the Klaidonis Foundation.  This inducement\r\nwas obtained by fraud on the part of Joseph.\r\nParagraph 26: Since January 13, 1988, Joseph has used the\r\nwires and mails of the United States to \"contact, instruct and\r\ncompensate his foreign agents who hold and maintain the Klaidonis\r\nFoundation for his benefit.\"  This is part of a plan and scheme\r\nthrough an illegal enterprise which continues to this day. \r\nParagraph 27: Joseph has taken the position and has\r\ninstructed his attorneys and agents to take the false position that\r\nhe has no interest in or knowledge of the Klaidonis Foundation. \r\nJoseph has an outstanding warrant against him.  Joseph makes\r\nconstant threats to Annette to the effect that he will abandon any\r\ninterest in the Rye Beach property and let his creditors take it\r\nand \"auction Annette's interest in the property.\"  This is to\r\nincrease Joseph's pressure on Annette and pressure her to settle\r\nall outstanding cases against him, including this one, on his own\r\nterms.\r\nParagraph 28: On November 16, 1988, Joseph signed a\r\nbuilding permit application listing himself as owner of the\r\nproperty.  This shows that the Klaidonis Foundation is a mere\r\nstraw.\r\n\nWe think that paragraphs 22 through 28, construed most\r\nfavorably to Annette, set forth sufficient facts to allege one \r\nRICO predicate act.  Although it is a close call, we think the\r\nallegations of fraud meet the specificity requirement of Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 9(b).  As we construe these allegations, they state that at\r\nthe time of purchasing the property described therein, Joseph led\r\nAnnette to believe that the title to the real estate would be in\r\nboth their names.  We construe this to allege that there was a\r\ndeliberate misrepresentation by Joseph on which Annette relied and\r\nthat Joseph defrauded her by placing the property in the name of\r\nthe Klaidonis Foundation, which was owned and controlled by Joseph.\r\n\nParagraphs 29 through 32 bring another foundation into\r\nthe picture.  They allege in effect:\r\nParagraph 29: Joseph established the Redonia Foundation\r\nas a sham entity.  Joseph used the mails and wires of the United\r\nStates to deposit, in five named banks and other banks, \"hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars\" which he used to make, improve and conceal\r\nthe ownership of investments here in the U.S.\r\nParagraph 30: Twenty-five specific examples of wire\r\ntransfers of money to a Luxembourg Bank, Credit Swisse Bank, and\r\nUnion Bank-Switzerland are stated.  The money was hidden in the\r\n\"Redonia Foundation.\"  This is part of Joseph's scheme and artifice\r\nto defraud Annette \"and as an integral part of defendant's RICO\r\nactivity.\"\r\nParagraph 31: There were numerous other wire transfers\r\n\"siphoning off\" Annette's assets \"from the foreign bank accounts to\r\nwhich [Joseph] had removed them to Defendant DeMauro Co., and each\r\nof the other defendants.\"\r\nParagraph 32: Nicholas DeMauro knew that the Redonia\r\nFoundation was a sham used by Joseph to conceal assets in offshore\r\nentities and then wire them into the United States.\r\n\nNone of these paragraphs state that a fraud was committed\r\nagainst Annette with the specificity required by Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n9(b).  Although Annette has alleged the use of the U.S. mails\r\nand/or wires, by documenting some times and places of these\r\ntransfers, she fails to allege the content of any\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\nThe balance of the complaint fails to state a second\r\npredicate act, which is required for a RICO violation.  Some of the\r\nremaining paragraphs repeat prior allegations and others are window\r\ndressing.\r\nParagraphs 33 through 66 allege in effect:\r\nParagraph 33: Joseph, Nicholas DeMauro, Edward Martin,\r\nDeMauro Co., Inc. and Tri-Area Development Co., Inc., have\r\nconspired to place in excess of a million dollars into defendant\r\ncorporations.  There are nine separate sub-paragraphs detailing how\r\nthis conspiracy was carried out. \r\nParagraph 34: Joseph used the wires and mails to deposit\r\nmoney in the Lowell Five Cents Savings Bank to acquire and maintain\r\nproperties which he concealed from Annette.\r\nParagraph 35: Identification of some of the concealed\r\nproperties and the names of those holding the properties are\r\nstated.  The properties have no mortgages and their estimated value\r\nis \"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"\r\nParagraph 36: Most, if not all, of the money used to\r\nacquire the properties described in Paragraph 35 is a joint asset.\r\nParagraph 37: Joseph and Nicholas DeMauro acquired\r\nproperty in Tyngsborough, MA with Annette's money.  This property\r\nis in the names of DeMauro Co., Inc. and Tri-Area Development Co.,\r\nInc.\r\nParagraph 38: There were no mortgages on the Tyngsborough\r\nproperties, and DeMauro Co., Inc. and Tri-Area Development Co.,\r\nInc., the named owners, had no viable source of credit, but\r\nconstruction costing hundreds of thousands of dollars is being\r\ndone.  Joseph has \"wire transferred\" money to both corporations \"in\r\nfurtherance of the scheme.\"  There are seven sub-paragraphs\r\ndetailing a purported money laundering scheme involving $60,000.\r\nParagraph 39: Joseph makes multiple phone calls to\r\nAnnette telling her that he has hidden her assets and she will get\r\nnothing.  The amount of Annette's money so concealed is \"well in\r\nexcess of ten million dollars.\"\r\nParagraph 40: Joseph has been using DeMauro Co., Inc. and\r\nTri-Area Development Co., Inc. to provide a means of support for\r\nhis two sons, Nicholas and Michael.  The sons are assisting him in\r\nconducting his racketeering activity and fraud.\r\nParagraph 41: The payments to Joseph's sons deprived\r\nAnnette of money and property due her.\r\nParagraph 42: DeMauro Co., Inc. has provided assets to\r\nJoseph's brother-in-law Edward Martin and his sister Joan Martin by\r\nlisting on its financial statements a false account payable to\r\nEdward Martin in the amount of $135,000.\r\nParagraph 43: More details are laid out about the\r\n$135,000 referred to in paragraph 42.\r\nParagraph 44: Assets of more than $500,000 have been\r\nfraudulently transferred to Edward and Joan Martin.\r\nParagraph 45: Joseph and some other defendants have\r\nparticipated in money laundering.\r\nParagraph 46: Joseph has used other persons \"innocent and\r\notherwise\" to attend real estate auctions and bid on property for\r\nhim and he concealed such purchases from Annette.\r\nParagraph 47: Property in the name of Tri-Area\r\nDevelopment Co., Inc. as described by deed in Exhibit L is an\r\nexample of Joseph acquiring property from marital assets and\r\nconcealing it in the name of another.\r\nParagraph 48: Joseph and the other defendants conspired\r\nto hide Annette's assets, thus depriving her of millions of\r\ndollars.\r\nParagraph 49: Joseph falsely represented to the Town of\r\nRye, NH that the Klaidonis Foundation is the owner of 2595 Ocean\r\nBlvd. in Rye, NH.  Joseph invested hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars, obtained from abroad, in renovating the property.\r\nParagraph 50: Joseph has used the wire and mails to\r\nconceal assets and siphon off assets belonging to Annette.\r\nParagraph 51: Joseph, working with Nicholas DeMauro,\r\nsubmitted false and misleading loan applications to FDIC insured\r\nlending institutions.\r\nParagraph 52: Specific threats, intimidations, harassment\r\nand extortion of Annette by Joseph are described.\r\nParagraph 53: The allegations in paragraph 52 violate the\r\nlaws of New Hampshire and the United States.\r\nParagraph 54: Joseph has secretly tape-recorded\r\nconversations with Annette and played portions of the tapes to\r\nthird parties.\r\nParagraph 55: Joseph has used a law firm in West Palm\r\nBeach, Florida to pay bills and conceal from Annette the origin of\r\nhis funds.  \r\nParagraph 55(a): Annette and Joseph, through a trust\r\nestablished by Joseph, own property in Manalapan, Florida.  Five\r\nsub-paragraphs detail how Joseph has extorted Annette and misused\r\nthe property causing her damages in excess of $50,000.\r\nParagraph 56: Joseph misused credit cards in Annette's\r\nname to purchase goods.\r\nParagraph 57: Joseph has falsely registered at hotels\r\nwith other women posing as Annette.\r\nParagraph 58: Joseph purchased a yacht with another\r\nperson and then deliberately damaged it so that he could claim it\r\ndid not meet contract specifications.  A judgment has been entered\r\nagainst Joseph, threatening Annette in the amount of many hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars.\r\nParagraph 59: Joseph has, within the last two years,\r\nfurthered a conspiracy to defraud and extort Annette.  There are\r\nfour sub-paragraphs of specifications.  We have read the sub-\r\nparagraphs carefully and they neither singly nor in the aggregate\r\nallege facts sufficient to prove a present conspiracy to defraud\r\nand extort Annette.\r\nParagraph 60: The defendants have repeatedly used wires,\r\nmails, and other means of interstate commerce to violate RICO.\r\nParagraph 61: As the result of Joseph's illegal\r\nactivities, Annette has been unable to locate and control her\r\nassets.\r\nParagraph 62: Nicholas DeMauro has admitted in a public\r\ndocument that the stock of DeMauro Co., Inc. is owned by Joseph. \r\nThree sub-paragraphs from a pre-trial memorandum filed in\r\nMassachusetts Probate Court follow.\r\nParagraph 63: Nicholas DeMauro is causing valuable\r\nproperty to be deeded to him by DeMauro Co., Inc. in fraud of\r\nAnnette's rights.\r\nParagraph 64: Joseph, during his deposition, invoked the\r\n5th Amendment privilege \"to virtually every question.\"\r\nThere is no paragraph numbered 65.\r\nParagraph 66: Joseph has stolen private papers of Annette\r\nand refuses to return them.\r\nParagraph 66(a) states that the complaint does not\r\nallege: that Joseph is guilty of income tax evasion, has received\r\nany illegally paid wages, or that any wages he has earned from his\r\nown employment are from any criminal enterprise.  The final sub-\r\nparagraph (d) states that the purpose of this statement is because\r\nJoseph has invoked the fifth amendment in his depositions without\r\nany basis for doing so.\r\n\nAlthough the allegations described in paragraphs 33\r\nthrough 66 recite serious crimes and reprehensible conduct, none of\r\nthem, singly or consolidated, set forth a second predicate act\r\nsufficient to meet the legal requirements for a RICO violation.\r\nIV. Conclusion\r\nParagraphs 12 through 17 do not show an enterprise\r\nengaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.  Paragraphs 18\r\nthrough 21 fail to plead fraud with particularity.  Paragraphs 22\r\nthrough 28 set forth sufficient facts to allege one predicate act. \r\nParagraphs 29 through 32 do not state that a fraud was committed\r\nagainst Annette with the specificity required by Rule 9(b). \r\nParagraphs 33 through 66 fail to set forth a second predicate act. \r\nTherefore, we affirm the district court's ruling to dismiss Counts\r\nOne and Two of the complaint.\r\nWe point out that our affirmance of the dismissal does\r\nnot leave Annette without other remedies.  As noted in our prior\r\nopinion, she has obtained attachments in state court totaling 33\r\nmillion dollars in property owned partly or solely by Joseph. See \r\nDeMauro, 115 F.3d at 97.\r\nWe find no merit in plaintiff's objections to the\r\ndistrict court's dismissal of the other counts in the complaint. \r\nSee 28 U.S.C.  1367(c) (1990).\r\nJudgment affirmed.\n",

This case is related to a\r\nlengthy and bitterly fought divorce proceeding in New Hampshire\r\nbetween plaintiff Annette B. DeMauro and the principal defendant,\r\nJoseph DeMauro.  It would appear that the divorce proceedings were\r\nprecipitated when Annette discovered that Joseph was having an\r\naffair with the household maid.  As far as we know, there has been\r\nno final decree in the divorce proceeding.\r\nPlaintiff filed a six count amended complaint against her\r\nhusband and the five other named defendants.  Count One alleged\r\nviolations of 18 U.S.C.  1961-1968 (1982), the Racketeer\r\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  Count Two alleged\r\nconspiracy by the defendants under RICO.  \r\nThe balance of the complaint alleged pendent state-law\r\nclaims.  Count Three alleged intentional infliction of emotional\r\ndistress. Count Four alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  Count Five\r\nalleged illegal telephonic recordings.  Count Six alleged\r\nfraudulent conveyances.\r\nAfter a lengthy hearing, the district court dismissed the\r\ntwo RICO counts for failure to state a cause of action.  It stated,\r\ninter alia:\r\n          What I cannot find is a pattern of\r\nracketeering activity as defined by the RICO\r\nstatute.  Specifically, what I cannot find\r\nwhat the plaintiff claims to be a violation of\r\nthe wire fraud and mail fraud statutes. \r\n[W]here this complaint is deficient is that it\r\ndoes not allege false or fraudulent pretenses,\r\nrepresentations or promises, and to the extent\r\nthat it does so allege, those allegations are\r\nnot made with the specificity required by Rule\r\n9(b).\r\n\nThe court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\r\nwith respect to Counts Three, Four, and Six.  The court, sua\r\nsponte, dismissed the federal claim purported to be asserted in\r\nCount Five (entitled \"Illegal Telephone Recordings\") and declined\r\nto exercise jurisdiction over any state claim purported to be\r\nstated in that count.  For the following reasons, we affirm, but on\r\nsomewhat different grounds, as we can do.

Joseph deposited the profits from the business into\r\n\"their\" account to pay their expenses and \"apparently to induce her\r\nto believe that he was maintaining accounts in both names as\r\npromised.\"  Joseph induced Annette to believe, \"by his repeated\r\npromises, [that] they would share equally and hold\" money earned in\r\nthe Middle East for their \"mutual benefit and control.\"\r\nParagraph 15: Annette enhanced the success of the\r\nbusiness by actually working in the office with Joseph, by\r\narranging and providing entertainment and social activities for\r\nemployees and customers, by providing counseling  and psychological\r\nassistance to employees of the company and their families, and by\r\nsharing the physical risk of the location.\r\nParagraph 16: Joseph, either directly or indirectly,\r\nestablished bank accounts in foreign jurisdictions in the name of\r\nNicholas DeMauro.  Into those accounts, Joseph deposited or caused\r\nto be deposited profits from the business and joint assets, thus\r\nconcealing the assets from Annette.  This scheme continues to this\r\nday.\r\nParagraph 17: Over the years the business earned millions\r\nof dollars by Joseph's own accounting; substantial money was earned\r\non these profits. Annette did not object to the receipt and\r\nmanagement of these funds by Joseph because he represented that he\r\nwas taking care of their monetary affairs and was investing for\r\nboth of them.\r\n\nNone of the allegations in paragraphs 12 through 17 show\r\nan enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. \r\nConcealment of assets by a husband from a wife is reprehensible and\r\nmay be a crime under certain circumstances but that does not render\r\nit a pattern of racketeering activity perpetuated through an\r\nenterprise.  Moreover, paragraph 17 states that \"Annette did not\r\nobject to the management of these funds by Joseph.\"\r\n\nParagraphs 18 through 21 allege in effect:   \r\nParagraph 18: Starting in 1976, Joseph started a pattern\r\nof racketeering activity \"known as the RICO conduct\" which\r\ncontinues to this day.  This pattern of activity was designed to\r\nconceal from Annette the assets accumulated from the business and\r\nto convince Annette and others that the assets were being held\r\njointly while actually Joseph defrauded her and misled her and\r\nothers as to their nature, location, extent and existence.\r\nParagraph 19: Joseph conspired with the other defendants\r\nin a continuous enterprise continuing to this day.  The corporate\r\ndefendants were used as shams to further the RICO enterprise.  All\r\nthe named personal defendants were agents and co-conspirators of\r\nJoseph.\r\nParagraph 20: Joseph, acting in concert with the other\r\ndefendants from time to time, by means of \"false pretenses,\r\nrepresentations and 'devices' established bank and investment\r\naccounts in Switzerland, Middle East, France, Liechtenstein,\r\nseveral states of the United States.\"  Most of these accounts were\r\nestablished under the names of \"straws, sham trusts and phony\r\nfoundations.\"  This was all done to conceal the assets from Annette\r\nand other creditors.  Thus, assets of Annette, including assets\r\nfrom her first marriage, were taken from her and concealed.\r\nParagraph 21: In doing the things alleged in Paragraph\r\n20, Joseph made \"extensive use of the wires and mails of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\nParagraphs 18 through 21 fail to plead fraud with\r\nparticularity.  Paragraph 18 uses the words \"pattern of\r\nracketeering activity,\" \"RICO conduct,\" and \"defrauded,\" but does\r\nnot specify as to when the activity took place and what was done. \r\nParagraphs 19, 20, and 21, similarly use broad conclusory language. \r\nThe last sentence of paragraph 20 does not state either the value\r\nof Annette's assets or of what they consisted.  We do not doubt\r\nthat Joseph made \"extensive use of the wires and mails of the\r\nUnited States\" but that is only one factor to consider in\r\ndetermining the validity of the complaint.  As we have stated\r\npreviously, to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to Rule\r\n9(b), a plaintiff must state the time, place, and content of the\r\nalleged misrepresentation perpetuating the fraud.  Annette fails to\r\ndo this.\r\n\nParagraphs 22 through 28 allege in effect:\r\nParagraph 22: Joseph caused property known as 2595 Ocean\r\nBlvd., Rye Beach, NH to be placed in the name of the \"Klaidonis\r\nFoundation\" despite the fact that a Purchase and Sale Agreement for\r\nthe property had been executed in the names of Annette and Joseph. \r\nAnnette had not been informed of the change in ownership of the\r\nproperty.\r\nParagraph 23: In operating the Klaidonis Foundation,\r\nJoseph used the wires and mails of the United States to transfer\r\n\"in excess of $2 million in interstate commerce in furtherance of\r\nthis scheme.\"  The existence of the Klaidonis Foundation was\r\nconcealed from Annette and only discovered recently.  The existence\r\nof this sham foundation was only discovered after the divorce\r\naction commenced.\r\nParagraph 24: Exhibit A is a true and accurate copy of\r\nthe deposition of the Honorable John Maher (now a judge) concerning\r\nthe purchase of the 2595 Ocean Blvd. property.  It summarizes the\r\ndeposition testimony of Judge Maher in four subparagraphs.\r\nParagraph 25: Joseph induced Judge Maher to place the\r\nproperty in the name of the Klaidonis Foundation.  This inducement\r\nwas obtained by fraud on the part of Joseph.\r\nParagraph 26: Since January 13, 1988, Joseph has used the\r\nwires and mails of the United States to \"contact, instruct and\r\ncompensate his foreign agents who hold and maintain the Klaidonis\r\nFoundation for his benefit.\"  This is part of a plan and scheme\r\nthrough an illegal enterprise which continues to this day. \r\nParagraph 27: Joseph has taken the position and has\r\ninstructed his attorneys and agents to take the false position that\r\nhe has no interest in or knowledge of the Klaidonis Foundation. \r\nJoseph has an outstanding warrant against him.  Joseph makes\r\nconstant threats to Annette to the effect that he will abandon any\r\ninterest in the Rye Beach property and let his creditors take it\r\nand \"auction Annette's interest in the property.\"  This is to\r\nincrease Joseph's pressure on Annette and pressure her to settle\r\nall outstanding cases against him, including this one, on his own\r\nterms.\r\nParagraph 28: On November 16, 1988, Joseph signed a\r\nbuilding permit application listing himself as owner of the\r\nproperty.  This shows that the Klaidonis Foundation is a mere\r\nstraw.\r\n\nWe think that paragraphs 22 through 28, construed most\r\nfavorably to Annette, set forth sufficient facts to allege one \r\nRICO predicate act.  Although it is a close call, we think the\r\nallegations of fraud meet the specificity requirement of Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 9(b).  As we construe these allegations, they state that at\r\nthe time of purchasing the property described therein, Joseph led\r\nAnnette to believe that the title to the real estate would be in\r\nboth their names.  We construe this to allege that there was a\r\ndeliberate misrepresentation by Joseph on which Annette relied and\r\nthat Joseph defrauded her by placing the property in the name of\r\nthe Klaidonis Foundation, which was owned and controlled by Joseph.\r\n\nParagraphs 29 through 32 bring another foundation into\r\nthe picture.  They allege in effect:\r\nParagraph 29: Joseph established the Redonia Foundation\r\nas a sham entity.  Joseph used the mails and wires of the United\r\nStates to deposit, in five named banks and other banks, \"hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars\" which he used to make, improve and conceal\r\nthe ownership of investments here in the U.S.\r\nParagraph 30: Twenty-five specific examples of wire\r\ntransfers of money to a Luxembourg Bank, Credit Swisse Bank, and\r\nUnion Bank-Switzerland are stated.  The money was hidden in the\r\n\"Redonia Foundation.\"  This is part of Joseph's scheme and artifice\r\nto defraud Annette \"and as an integral part of defendant's RICO\r\nactivity.\"\r\nParagraph 31: There were numerous other wire transfers\r\n\"siphoning off\" Annette's assets \"from the foreign bank accounts to\r\nwhich [Joseph] had removed them to Defendant DeMauro Co., and each\r\nof the other defendants.\"\r\nParagraph 32: Nicholas DeMauro knew that the Redonia\r\nFoundation was a sham used by Joseph to conceal assets in offshore\r\nentities and then wire them into the United States.\r\n\nNone of these paragraphs state that a fraud was committed\r\nagainst Annette with the specificity required by Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n9(b).  Although Annette has alleged the use of the U.S. mails\r\nand/or wires, by documenting some times and places of these\r\ntransfers, she fails to allege the content of any\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\nThe balance of the complaint fails to state a second\r\npredicate act, which is required for a RICO violation.  Some of the\r\nremaining paragraphs repeat prior allegations and others are window\r\ndressing.\r\nParagraphs 33 through 66 allege in effect:\r\nParagraph 33: Joseph, Nicholas DeMauro, Edward Martin,\r\nDeMauro Co., Inc. and Tri-Area Development Co., Inc., have\r\nconspired to place in excess of a million dollars into defendant\r\ncorporations.  There are nine separate sub-paragraphs detailing how\r\nthis conspiracy was carried out. \r\nParagraph 34: Joseph used the wires and mails to deposit\r\nmoney in the Lowell Five Cents Savings Bank to acquire and maintain\r\nproperties which he concealed from Annette.\r\nParagraph 35: Identification of some of the concealed\r\nproperties and the names of those holding the properties are\r\nstated.  The properties have no mortgages and their estimated value\r\nis \"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"\r\nParagraph 36: Most, if not all, of the money used to\r\nacquire the properties described in Paragraph 35 is a joint asset.\r\nParagraph 37: Joseph and Nicholas DeMauro acquired\r\nproperty in Tyngsborough, MA with Annette's money.  This property\r\nis in the names of DeMauro Co., Inc. and Tri-Area Development Co.,\r\nInc.\r\nParagraph 38: There were no mortgages on the Tyngsborough\r\nproperties, and DeMauro Co., Inc. and Tri-Area Development Co.,\r\nInc., the named owners, had no viable source of credit, but\r\nconstruction costing hundreds of thousands of dollars is being\r\ndone.  Joseph has \"wire transferred\" money to both corporations \"in\r\nfurtherance of the scheme.\"  There are seven sub-paragraphs\r\ndetailing a purported money laundering scheme involving $60,000.\r\nParagraph 39: Joseph makes multiple phone calls to\r\nAnnette telling her that he has hidden her assets and she will get\r\nnothing.  The amount of Annette's money so concealed is \"well in\r\nexcess of ten million dollars.\"\r\nParagraph 40: Joseph has been using DeMauro Co., Inc. and\r\nTri-Area Development Co., Inc. to provide a means of support for\r\nhis two sons, Nicholas and Michael.  The sons are assisting him in\r\nconducting his racketeering activity and fraud.\r\nParagraph 41: The payments to Joseph's sons deprived\r\nAnnette of money and property due her.\r\nParagraph 42: DeMauro Co., Inc. has provided assets to\r\nJoseph's brother-in-law Edward Martin and his sister Joan Martin by\r\nlisting on its financial statements a false account payable to\r\nEdward Martin in the amount of $135,000.\r\nParagraph 43: More details are laid out about the\r\n$135,000 referred to in paragraph 42.\r\nParagraph 44: Assets of more than $500,000 have been\r\nfraudulently transferred to Edward and Joan Martin.\r\nParagraph 45: Joseph and some other defendants have\r\nparticipated in money laundering.\r\nParagraph 46: Joseph has used other persons \"innocent and\r\notherwise\" to attend real estate auctions and bid on property for\r\nhim and he concealed such purchases from Annette.\r\nParagraph 47: Property in the name of Tri-Area\r\nDevelopment Co., Inc. as described by deed in Exhibit L is an\r\nexample of Joseph acquiring property from marital assets and\r\nconcealing it in the name of another.\r\nParagraph 48: Joseph and the other defendants conspired\r\nto hide Annette's assets, thus depriving her of millions of\r\ndollars.\r\nParagraph 49: Joseph falsely represented to the Town of\r\nRye, NH that the Klaidonis Foundation is the owner of 2595 Ocean\r\nBlvd. in Rye, NH.  Joseph invested hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars, obtained from abroad, in renovating the property.\r\nParagraph 50: Joseph has used the wire and mails to\r\nconceal assets and siphon off assets belonging to Annette.\r\nParagraph 51: Joseph, working with Nicholas DeMauro,\r\nsubmitted false and misleading loan applications to FDIC insured\r\nlending institutions.\r\nParagraph 52: Specific threats, intimidations, harassment\r\nand extortion of Annette by Joseph are described.\r\nParagraph 53: The allegations in paragraph 52 violate the\r\nlaws of New Hampshire and the United States.\r\nParagraph 54: Joseph has secretly tape-recorded\r\nconversations with Annette and played portions of the tapes to\r\nthird parties.\r\nParagraph 55: Joseph has used a law firm in West Palm\r\nBeach, Florida to pay bills and conceal from Annette the origin of\r\nhis funds.  \r\nParagraph 55(a): Annette and Joseph, through a trust\r\nestablished by Joseph, own property in Manalapan, Florida.  Five\r\nsub-paragraphs detail how Joseph has extorted Annette and misused\r\nthe property causing her damages in excess of $50,000.\r\nParagraph 56: Joseph misused credit cards in Annette's\r\nname to purchase goods.\r\nParagraph 57: Joseph has falsely registered at hotels\r\nwith other women posing as Annette.\r\nParagraph 58: Joseph purchased a yacht with another\r\nperson and then deliberately damaged it so that he could claim it\r\ndid not meet contract specifications.  A judgment has been entered\r\nagainst Joseph, threatening Annette in the amount of many hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars.\r\nParagraph 59: Joseph has, within the last two years,\r\nfurthered a conspiracy to defraud and extort Annette.  There are\r\nfour sub-paragraphs of specifications.  We have read the sub-\r\nparagraphs carefully and they neither singly nor in the aggregate\r\nallege facts sufficient to prove a present conspiracy to defraud\r\nand extort Annette.\r\nParagraph 60: The defendants have repeatedly used wires,\r\nmails, and other means of interstate commerce to violate RICO.\r\nParagraph 61: As the result of Joseph's illegal\r\nactivities, Annette has been unable to locate and control her\r\nassets.\r\nParagraph 62: Nicholas DeMauro has admitted in a public\r\ndocument that the stock of DeMauro Co., Inc. is owned by Joseph. \r\nThree sub-paragraphs from a pre-trial memorandum filed in\r\nMassachusetts Probate Court follow.\r\nParagraph 63: Nicholas DeMauro is causing valuable\r\nproperty to be deeded to him by DeMauro Co., Inc. in fraud of\r\nAnnette's rights.\r\nParagraph 64: Joseph, during his deposition, invoked the\r\n5th Amendment privilege \"to virtually every question.\"\r\nThere is no paragraph numbered 65.\r\nParagraph 66: Joseph has stolen private papers of Annette\r\nand refuses to return them.\r\nParagraph 66(a) states that the complaint does not\r\nallege: that Joseph is guilty of income tax evasion, has received\r\nany illegally paid wages, or that any wages he has earned from his\r\nown employment are from any criminal enterprise.  The final sub-\r\nparagraph (d) states that the purpose of this statement is because\r\nJoseph has invoked the fifth amendment in his depositions without\r\nany basis for doing so.\r\n\nAlthough the allegations described in paragraphs 33\r\nthrough 66 recite serious crimes and reprehensible conduct, none of\r\nthem, singly or consolidated, set forth a second predicate act\r\nsufficient to meet the legal requirements for a RICO violation.\r\nIV. Conclusion\r\nParagraphs 12 through 17 do not show an enterprise\r\nengaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.  Paragraphs 18\r\nthrough 21 fail to plead fraud with particularity.  Paragraphs 22\r\nthrough 28 set forth sufficient facts to allege one predicate act. \r\nParagraphs 29 through 32 do not state that a fraud was committed\r\nagainst Annette with the specificity required by Rule 9(b). \r\nParagraphs 33 through 66 fail to set forth a second predicate act. \r\nTherefore, we affirm the district court's ruling to dismiss Counts\r\nOne and Two of the complaint.\r\nWe point out that our affirmance of the dismissal does\r\nnot leave Annette without other remedies.  As noted in our prior\r\nopinion, she has obtained attachments in state court totaling 33\r\nmillion dollars in property owned partly or solely by Joseph.
