Brown for appellant.\n     Jennifer Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nAmy B. Lederer, Assistant United States Attorney, Donald K.\nStern,   United  States   Attorney,   and   the  Department   of\nJustice were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        April 14, 2000\n\f\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.         William E. Freeman, Jr., an\n\nofficer in the Peabody, Massachusetts, police department, was\n\nconvicted by a jury on two counts of witness tampering.           He was\n\nalso acquitted on one count of witness tampering and one count\n\nof conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. ยง 666(a)(1)(B) (theft or\n\nbribery concerning programs receiving federal funds).1           Freeman\n\ncomplains    that    the     evidence     of   witness   tampering     was\n\ninsufficient to support the convictions.          Additionally, Freeman\n\ncontends that the court should have granted his motion for a\n\njudgment    of   acquittal   on   the   conspiracy   charge   before   its\n\nsubmission to the jury.       If it had done so, he argues, the court\n\nwould have been forced to grant a mistrial on the remaining\n\nwitness tampering charges because the testimony admitted as\n\n\n\n    1Title 18 U.S.C. ยง 666 provides that an agent of, inter\nalia, any local government that \"in any one year period,\nbenefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program,\" is\ncriminally liable if he\n\n    corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any\n    person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of\n    value from any person, intending to be influenced or\n    rewarded in connection with any business, transaction,\n    or series of transactions of such organization,\n    government, or agency involving any thing of value of\n    $5,000 or more.\n\nOn appeal, Freeman does not contest that he is an agent of a\nlocal government, or that Peabody receives the level of federal\nbenefits required for jurisdiction under this statute.\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fevidence of the conspiracy was unduly prejudicial to his defense\n\nto the witness tampering charges.            He further claims that he was\n\nentitled to a mistrial because the court admitted evidence of\n\nthe statements of a coconspirator that it later had to strike,\n\nand because of the spillover effect on the witness tampering\n\nconvictions of \"bad acts\" evidence admitted on the conspiracy\n\ncharge.    Unconvinced by Freeman's arguments, we affirm.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n           We sketch the facts of this odd case at the outset,\n\nadding    detail   below    as    it   becomes   necessary    to   the   legal\n\ndiscussion.   In 1991, Freeman became associated with the \"Golden\n\nBanana,\" a striptease nightclub located in Peabody, and the\n\nclub's    owner,    Louis    DiBella         (DiBella).      Freeman     began\n\nfrequenting   the   Golden       Banana   shortly   after    DiBella's    son,\n\nFrancis, was arrested on drug charges.            Although Freeman was not\n\nan employee of the club, DiBella paid him approximately $100 in\n\ncash each week for almost four years.                In addition, DiBella\n\nloaned Freeman money, gave him free alcoholic beverages at the\n\nclub, allowed him to influence the hiring and firing of dancers,\n\ntolerated his frequent visits to the dancers' dressing room,\n\ngenerally off limits to men, and otherwise turned a blind eye to\n\nFreeman's erratic and sometimes violent behavior.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            In 1995, a federal grand jury began investigating\n\npotential    violations      of   federal   law       at    the    Golden    Banana\n\ninvolving, inter alia, members of the Peabody police department.\n\nDuring the investigation, Freeman approached fellow Peabody\n\npolice officer Michael Ward and warned him to keep his \"mouth\n\nshut\"    about   \"anything    that   went   on    at       the    Golden   Banana.\"\n\nFreeman also approached Amy Clarke, the master of ceremonies at\n\nthe Golden Banana, telling her to \"keep the lip zipped\" and \"not\n\nto say anything about the Golden Banana.\"\n\n            The grand jury indicted Freeman on five counts.                   Count\n\nOne alleged that Freeman conspired with DiBella to receive cash\n\npayments, no-interest loans, and free alcoholic beverages, in an\n\nattempt by DiBella \"to curry favor with him and to buy his\n\nsilence about licensed premise violations which occurred at the\n\nGolden    Banana\"--i.e.,     a    conspiracy     to    violate       18    U.S.C.   ยง\n\n666(a)(1)(B).      See supra note 1.        The grand jury also indicted\n\nFreeman on four counts of witness tampering in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1512(b)(2)(A) & (b)(3): Count Two involved an unnamed\n\nPeabody police officer,2 Count Three involved Officer Ward, and\n\nCounts Four and Five involved Amy Clarke.\n\n\n\n\n    2Prior to trial, the government dismissed Count Two pursuant\nto Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a).\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            In its opening statement at trial, the government\n\noutlined its conspiracy case.                According to the government,\n\nDiBella would testify that, given the controversial nature of\n\nthe Golden Banana's business, he needed to stay on the \"good\n\nside\" of the Peabody police lest they \"do things like influence\n\nhis ability to retain the liquor license that he had at the\n\nGolden Banana.\"         In addition, DiBella would testify that he\n\nfeared    that    the   Peabody   police      would    \"take   away    his   son,\"\n\nFrancis,    because     of   Francis's       cocaine   problem.        Thus,   the\n\ngovernment       expected    DiBella   to    testify    that   he     \"willingly\"\n\nentered into a \"corrupt relationship\" with Freeman, in which he\n\n\"agreed to pay bribes\" to Freeman and Freeman \"agreed to accept\n\nthem.\"3\n\n            On the first day of trial, before the government called\n\nDiBella to the stand, it presented the testimony of Deborah\n\nDrew, the daytime manager at the Golden Banana.                 Drew testified\n\nthat DiBella told her he provided free alcoholic beverages to\n\npolice officers to avoid \"beefs\" with the police, and that\n\nDiBella instructed her to call the Peabody police, not the state\n\npolice, in the event of a licensing violation committed on the\n\n\n     3\n     DiBella himself was not charged with conspiracy. Instead,\nhe was charged with four counts of filing false income tax\nreturns, to which he pled guilty. As part of his plea bargain,\nDiBella agreed to cooperate in the government's investigation of\nFreeman and to testify against him at trial.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpremises.    Although the defense objected to this testimony as\n\nhearsay, the court provisionally admitted it under the hearsay\n\nexception for the statements of a coconspirator, Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E), promising that it would \"scrutinize it with care\n\nat the end of all the evidence.\"\n\n            On the second day of trial, the government called\n\nDiBella as a witness.       Although DiBella testified that he made\n\nregular cash payments to Freeman, he denied that Freeman had\n\nagreed to perform any favors on his behalf.           Moreover, DiBella's\n\ntestimony suggested that he provided benefits to Freeman because\n\nof his fear of Freeman rather than any willing agreement between\n\nthe two.     Following DiBella's testimony, the court warned the\n\ngovernment that \"if Mr. DiBella is the chief witness, you're in\n\ndeep serious trouble on the conspiracy count,\" suggesting that\n\nit    did   not   think   that    the     \"victim   of   extortion   is   a\n\nconspirator.\"\n\n            As the government neared the completion of its case in\n\nchief, Freeman moved for a judgment of acquittal.4             In ruling on\n\nthe   motion,     the   court    also   scrutinized      the   government's\n\nconspiracy evidence to determine whether it had properly allowed\n\nDrew to testify to DiBella's out-of-court statements on the\n\n\n      4\n     Although the government had not yet rested, it consented to\nthe court's consideration of the defendant's motion for a\njudgment of acquittal at this time.\n\n                                    -7-\n\ffirst   day   of   trial.   The   court   concluded   that   there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence of a conspiracy to admit the hearsay\n\nstatements of a coconspirator, but that there was sufficient\n\nevidence to deny the motion for a judgment of acquittal on the\n\nconspiracy charge:\n\n          [T]he Court is not persuaded by a fair\n          preponderance of the evidence, as I make\n          findings of preliminary fact, that at any\n          time there existed a conspiracy between Mr.\n          Freeman and Mr. DiBella. That requires me\n          to strike so much of the testimony of Ms.\n          Drew as recounted things that Mr. DiBella\n          had to say.\n\n                    At the same time . . .\n\n                 I think that wholly apart from\n          anything I believe about the evidence, that\n          there is enough evidence independent of Mr.\n          DiBella . . . that a reasonable jury could\n          find a conspiracy. . . .\n\n                 So, I must deny the motion           for    a\n          judgment of acquittal . . . .\n\nFreeman then moved for a mistrial, the court took the motion\n\nunder advisement, and the government presented its final two\n\nwitnesses.          After the government rested, Freeman renewed his\n\nmotions for a judgment of acquittal and a mistrial.          Again, the\n\ncourt denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal and left the\n\nmotion for a mistrial under advisement.        After concluding his\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdefense,5 Freeman renewed his motions for a judgment of acquittal\n\nand a mistrial.         The court denied both motions and submitted the\n\nconspiracy charge and three witness tampering charges to the\n\njury.       See supra note 2.\n\n                 The jury acquitted Freeman of the conspiracy charge and\n\nthe     witness      tampering    count   involving   officer    Ward,   but\n\nconvicted him on the two counts of witness tampering involving\n\nAmy Clarke. After the verdict, Freeman moved for a new trial,\n\nciting       the    \"overwhelming    capacity   of    evidence    that   was\n\nostensibly admitted on one count which was the conspiracy[:] all\n\nthis       not   very   subtle   character   assassination,     Freeman's   a\n\ndrinker, Freeman's going into the dressing rooms.\"              According to\n\nFreeman, this evidence of \"bad acts,\" admitted for its relevance\n\nto the conspiracy count, substantially prejudiced his defense to\n\nthe witness tampering charges.\n\n                 The court denied the motion for a new trial, concluding\n\nthat \"the evidence that was improperly allowed is just too\n\n\n\n       5\n     Freeman's defense consisted of only three witnesses. John\nCarney, a captain in the Marblehead Police Department, and\nRobert Marron, a Peabody police officer, were each called by the\ndefense to impeach the credibility of Officer Ward. (The court\nfound Marron's testimony inadmissible.)      Robert Russell, a\nPeabody police detective, testified that DiBella had spoken\nfavorably of Freeman and that Francis DiBella had told him that\nthe federal authorities were trying to get his father to say\nthat he had paid Freeman off. Freeman did not testify on his\nown behalf.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fperipheral here\" (referring to Deborah Drew's hearsay account of\n\nDiBella's statements to her), and that \"the jury showed their\n\nindependence and their ability to discern between counts\" by\n\nacquitting       Freeman     on     two   of   the    four    counts.      The   court\n\nsentenced Freeman to four months' incarceration followed by\n\ntwenty-four months of supervised release, the first four of\n\nthose   months      in     home    confinement.         The    court     also   ordered\n\nFreeman to pay a $3,000 fine and a $200 special assessment.\n\n            Freeman now appeals, arguing that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support his convictions on the two witness\n\ntampering counts.          Alternatively, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his motions for a mistrial and a new trial.\n\n                     II.     SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n            To      obtain        convictions     for       witness    tampering     in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1512(b)(2)(A) & (b)(3), the government\n\nhad    to   prove    beyond        a   reasonable      doubt    that     Freeman    (1)\n\n\"knowingly use[d] intimidation or physical force, threaten[ed],\n\nor corruptly persuad[ed]\" Amy Clarke, (2) intending to induce\n\nClarke to \"withhold testimony,\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent\n\nthe communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the\n\nUnited States of information relating to the commission or\n\npossible commission of a Federal offense.\"                       18 U.S.C. ยง 1512.\n\nIn    evaluating     the     sufficiency         of   the     evidence    of    witness\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\ftampering,    we       must    view    the     facts    and    witness     credibility\n\ndeterminations, as well as draw reasonable inferences, in favor\n\nof the government.            See United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).          \"So long as the evidence, taken as a whole,\n\nwarrants a judgment of conviction,\" the evidence is legally\n\nsufficient.      United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).     Viewed in the light most favorable to the government,\n\nthe evidence shows that Freeman made statements to Clarke on two\n\noccasions that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt were criminally culpable.\n\n            Freeman       was      aware       that      there      was        a    federal\n\ninvestigation of activity at the Golden Banana.                           Based on the\n\nevidence presented by the government, the jury could infer that\n\nFreeman was also aware that his own conduct might subject him to\n\ncriminal liability as a result of the investigation.                                     Thus,\n\nFreeman    had     a    motive    to     prevent       potential       witnesses          from\n\nrelaying    damaging          information       to     the    government.                Clarke\n\ntestified that Freeman approached her at the Golden Banana and\n\nsaid, \"I hear you've been talking and the feds are around,\" and\n\nstated,    \"remember,          mum's     the    word.\"         Later      in       the    same\n\nconversation       Freeman       said,    \"remember          with   the    feds      around\n\ntalking, keep the lip zipped,\" drawing his finger across his\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\flips in an accompanying gesture.                Clarke testified that this\n\nexchange made her feel \"a little bit intimidated.\"\n\n           In    light      of   his   motive    to     curtail     the    flow   of\n\ninformation to the government, the jury could reasonably infer\n\nthat Freeman selected language that he thought would intimidate,\n\nthreaten, or corruptly persuade Clarke, and that Freeman did so\n\nintending to cause her to \"withhold testimony\" or to \"hinder,\n\ndelay, or prevent the communication\" of information to the\n\nfederal authorities investigating the Golden Banana.                       Although\n\nFreeman's words did not contain overt threats, a reasonable jury\n\ncould infer that Freeman knew Clarke would be threatened by such\n\nwords, given his status as a police officer and her first-hand\n\nknowledge of his erratic personality and violent temper.\n\n           Similarly, Freeman's statements to Clarke several weeks\n\nlater at her house were sufficient to support a conviction on a\n\nsecond count of witness tampering.                Freeman went to Clarke's\n\nhouse    immediately     following      the     appearance     of   a     newspaper\n\narticle about the Golden Banana that featured a front-page\n\npicture of Clarke.          The jury could have inferred that Freeman\n\nwent to her house at this time because the article had renewed\n\nhis fear that Clarke was cooperating in the investigation.\n\nFreeman said to Clarke, \"the feds [are] coming down heavy,\" and\n\nwarned   her    \"not   to    say   anything     about    the   Golden      Banana.\"\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fClarke    testified    that       this       conversation     made     her     feel\n\n\"intimidated,\" \"very uneasy,\" and \"awkward,\" and that she was so\n\nafraid of Freeman that she hid in the basement the next time he\n\ncame to her house.\n\n           Again, Freeman's statements to Clarke, made in the\n\ncontext of a visit to her home shortly after the appearance of\n\na   newspaper   article    that    Clarke      had   reason   to     believe    had\n\nangered him, were sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that\n\nFreeman   knowingly    acted      in     a   way   designed    to    intimidate,\n\nthreaten, or corruptly persuade Clarke, with the specific intent\n\nto cause her to \"withhold testimony\" or to \"hinder, delay, or\n\nprevent   the   communication\"         of     information     to    the   federal\n\nauthorities. See United States v. Shotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301\n\n(11th Cir. 1998) (finding defendant's statement to his secretary\n\nto \"just not say anything [to the FBI] and I wasn't going to be\n\nbothered\" sufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1512).\n\n                  III. THE MOTION FOR A MISTRIAL\n\n           Freeman    argues      that       the   trial    court    abused    its\n\ndiscretion in denying his motion for a mistrial or a new trial\n\nfor three reasons.6       First, if the trial court had granted his\n\n\n      6\n     Because Freeman's motion for a new trial is not based upon\ngrounds arising subsequent to judgment, the appeal is from the\njudgment, with the denial of his motions for a mistrial and a\n\n                                       -13-\n\fmotion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge as\n\nit should have, it would have realized that so much \"bad acts\"\n\ntestimony had been admitted as evidence of the conspiracy that\n\nFreeman could not get a fair trial on the witness tampering\n\ncharges.      Second,       the   trial    court       had   exacerbated    the\n\nprejudicial effect of the conspiracy evidence by allowing the\n\ngovernment to present the hearsay testimony of a coconspirator,\n\nonly   to   strike   that    evidence     once    it    determined   that   the\n\ngovernment had failed to show the existence of a conspiracy by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.                 Third, even if the court\n\nproperly submitted the conspiracy charge to the jury, the \"bad\n\nacts\" evidence admitted in support of that charge substantially\n\nprejudiced the jury's consideration of the witness tampering\n\ncharges.\n\n            As with any review of a denial of a motion for a\n\nmistrial, we consider the totality of the circumstances to\n\ndetermine whether the defendant has demonstrated the kind of\n\n\nnew trial being assigned as an error in the judgment.      See 2\nCharles Alan Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure: Criminal 2d\nยง 559, at 367 (West 1982 & 1999 Supp.); Gray v. United States,\n299 F.2d 467, 468 (D.C. Cir. 1962). Freeman's arguments in\nsupport of a mistrial and a new trial are the same, and they are\nsubject to the same standard of review, see United States v.\nWihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 773 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"We review a trial\njudge's ruling on a motion for a mistrial, or for a new trial,\nonly for abuse of discretion.\").     We therefore simplify our\ndiscussion by referring hereafter only to the motion for a\nmistrial.\n\n                                    -14-\n\f\"clear\" prejudice that would render the court's denial of his\n\nmotion for a mistrial a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\"                            United\n\nStates v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1998).                        In conducting\n\nthis    inquiry,      we    are    mindful      that      the   trial     court       has    a\n\n\"superior point of vantage,\" and that \"it is only rarely--and in\n\nextremely compelling circumstances--that an appellate panel,\n\ninformed by a cold record, will venture to reverse a trial\n\njudge's on-the-spot decision.\"                      United States v. Pierro, 32\n\nF.3d. 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994).                     Where \"a curative instruction\n\nis    promptly    given,      a    mistrial         is    warranted      only    in     rare\n\ncircumstances implying extreme prejudice.\"                      Torres, 162 F.3d at\n\n12 (emphasis added).          This is so because a mistrial is viewed as\n\na    \"last   resort,       only    to    be    implemented         if    the    taint       is\n\nineradicable, that is, only if the trial judge believes that the\n\njury's    exposure     to    the    evidence         is   likely    to    prove    beyond\n\nrealistic hope of repair.\"               United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by denying Freeman's motion for a mistrial for the\n\nfollowing reasons: (A) the court properly denied the motion for\n\na    judgment    of   acquittal         on   the     conspiracy     charge;       (B)    the\n\nminimal hearsay statements of a coconspirator, later stricken\n\nfrom the record, did not substantially prejudice the jury's\n\n\n                                             -15-\n\fconsideration of the witness tampering charges; and (C) the \"bad\n\nacts\" evidence admitted in support of the conspiracy charge did\n\nnot   spill   over   to   substantially   prejudice   the   jury's\n\nconsideration of the witness tampering charges.\n\nA. The Denial of the Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal on the\nConspiracy Charge\n\n          We must first note the unusual nature of this mistrial\n\nargument, premised as it is on the allegedly erroneous denial of\n\na motion for a judgment of acquittal on a charge later rejected\n\nby the jury with a not guilty verdict.    Although Freeman's logic\n\nin pursuing this argument is not always clear, we divine this\n\nmeaning in his claim.      If a defendant in a trial involving\n\nmultiple charges succeeds in obtaining a judgment of acquittal\n\non some of the charges at the completion of the government's\n\ncase, the defendant can argue that he cannot get a fair trial on\n\nthe charges that remain in the case because of the evidence\n\npresented on the now dismissed charges, and hence he is entitled\n\nto a mistrial on the remaining charges.      See United States v.\n\nMcNatt, 842 F.2d 564, 565-66 (1st Cir. 1988); see also United\n\nStates v. Hamblin, 911 F.2d 551, 559 (11th Cir. 1990); Leach v.\n\nUnited States, 402 F.2d 268, 268 (5th Cir. 1968) (per curiam).\n\nAlthough Freeman was ultimately acquitted on the conspiracy\n\ncharge, and therefore has no basis for challenging as a discrete\n\nissue on appeal the denial of his motion for a judgment of\n\n                               -16-\n\facquittal on that charge, he argues that he should be able to\n\nmake on appeal the same mistrial argument that would have been\n\navailable to him if he had persuaded the court to dismiss the\n\nconspiracy charge at the completion of the government's case.\n\nThat is, he should be able to argue that the denial of the\n\nmistrial      request    was    erroneous     because    of    the    substantial\n\nprejudice created by the evidence that went to the jury in\n\nsupport of a conspiracy charge that should have been dismissed.\n\nUnder the scenario in this case, the challenge to the judge's\n\nruling on the motion for a judgment of acquittal, instead of\n\nbeing the basis for a discretely appealable issue, becomes the\n\npredicate for Freeman's first challenge to the trial court's\n\nruling on the motion for a mistrial.                    See United States v.\n\nGuiliano, 644 F.2d 85, 88-89 (2d Cir. 1981) (ordering a retrial\n\non   a   bankruptcy     fraud     count,    even    though    the    evidence      was\n\nsufficient to support the conviction, because it reversed on\n\nappeal    a    RICO   conviction     and     concluded       that    there    was    a\n\n\"distinct risk that the jury was influenced in its disposition\n\nof [the bankruptcy fraud] count by improper evidence and by the\n\nallegations of the RICO count\").\n\n              We   accept   the    theory    of    Freeman's    appeal       on   this\n\nmistrial issue.         That is a pyrrhic victory, however, because we\n\nagree with the trial court's decision to deny Freeman's motion\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\ffor a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge.                                We\n\nexplain.\n\n           Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a) provides,\n\n\"[t]he court on a motion of a defendant or of its own motion\n\nshall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more\n\noffenses charged in the indictment or information after the\n\nevidence     on   either      side       is     closed    if    the     evidence     is\n\ninsufficient      to   sustain       a    conviction       of    such      offense   or\n\noffenses.\"     Pursuant to this standard, the defendant may claim\n\na \"hopeless variance in the proof\" between the crime charged and\n\nthe evidence produced at trial.                   See 2 Charles Alan Wright,\n\nFederal Practice & Procedure: Criminal 2d ยง 466, at 654 (West\n\n1982).       Freeman    argued           that    the     government's       evidence,\n\nespecially DiBella's testimony that he was motivated by fear\n\nrather than by an agreement with Freeman, indicated that Freeman\n\nwas guilty if at all of extortion, an offense not charged by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n           Although     the    evidence          presented      by   the   government\n\narguably would have lent more support to a charge of extortion\n\nthan a charge of conspiracy, the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsubmit the conspiracy charge to the jury. To prove a conspiracy,\n\nthe government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\n\"defendant and one or more coconspirators intended to agree and\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f. . . to commit the substantive criminal offense which was the\n\nobject of their unlawful agreement.\" United States v. Tejeda,\n\n974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir. 1992) (alteration in original).\n\nHere, the \"substantive criminal offense\" charged was a violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. ยง 666(a)(1)(B), which prohibits an agent of a local\n\ngovernment, like a police officer, from \"corruptly solicit[ing]\n\nor demand[ing] for the benefit of any person, or accept[ing] or\n\nagree[ing]    to     accept,    anything      of   value   from   any   person,\n\nintending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any\n\nbusiness,    transaction,       or   series    of   transactions        of   such\n\norganization, government, or agency involving anything of value\n\nof $5,000 or more.\"        Stated in terms of the government's theory\n\nof the case, the government needed to prove that Freeman and\n\nDiBella entered into an agreement in which Freeman would \"accept\n\nor agree to accept\" valuable benefits from DiBella, including\n\ncash payoffs, loans, and special treatment at the Golden Banana,\n\nintending to be \"influenced or rewarded\" for helping DiBella and\n\nhis son avoid trouble with the Peabody police or the Peabody\n\nofficials    who    oversee    the   Golden    Banana's    license      to   sell\n\nliquor.\n\n            There    was      sufficient      evidence     to     support     the\n\ngovernment's conspiracy theory.         First, the evidence showed that\n\nFreeman received \"something of value\" from DiBella in the form\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fof money payments and special treatment at the Golden Banana.\n\nDiBella paid Freeman approximately $100 per week in cash for\n\nalmost four years, and loaned money to Freeman's brother and to\n\none of Freeman's friends--money that was never repaid.    Freeman\n\ndrank for free at the Golden Banana, spent time in the dancers'\n\ndressing room, a location generally off limits to men, and\n\nenjoyed influence over DiBella's decisions to hire and fire\n\nparticular dancers.      DiBella continued to tolerate Freeman's\n\npresence at the club despite Freeman's erratic and sometimes\n\nviolent behavior.      Amy Clarke testified that Freeman would\n\nbecome \"belligerent\" when she asked him to leave the dancers'\n\ndressing room.    Similarly, Thomas LeGault, the night manager at\n\nthe Golden Banana, testified that on one occasion, when he asked\n\nFreeman to leave the dressing room, Freeman said, \"I'll cut\n\nfucking LeGault's throat with a bottle,\" and threw a chair at\n\nthe door.\n\n            Moreover, a reasonable trier of fact could have found\n\nthat the cash payments, loans, and other special treatment that\n\nDiBella bestowed upon Freeman were not given in consideration\n\nfor any legitimate work that Freeman performed on DiBella's\n\nbehalf.     During the relevant time, Freeman was not working as a\n\nsecurity guard or in any other capacity at the club.      Indeed,\n\nseveral witnesses testified that Freeman was usually drinking at\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fthe club and was often seen intoxicated.          These facts cast doubt\n\non Freeman's defense, advanced mainly through cross-examination\n\nand in his closing argument, that he was somehow performing\n\nsurreptitious         security          duties        for     DiBella.\n\n\n\n           Second, there was some evidence that Freeman obtained\n\nthe cash payments, loans, and special treatment \"intending to be\n\ninfluenced or rewarded\" for his help in insulating the Golden\n\nBanana and Francis DiBella from trouble with local police and\n\ncity   officials.     That    Freeman    began   to    patronize   the   club\n\nregularly only after Francis's arrest on drug charges might\n\nsuggest that Freeman, who worked in the area of narcotics,\n\nviewed the arrest as an opportunity to trade his influence as a\n\npolice officer for favors.       Deborah Drew testified that shortly\n\nbefore Francis was arrested, Freeman said to her that DiBella\n\n\"shouldn't fuck with him . . . [and that] because of the things\n\nthat Frankie [Francis] was doing, that he [Freeman] could close\n\nthe club.\"   Francis DiBella testified that Freeman warned him\n\nthat he was on the \"top of the [DEA's] list,\" but that Freeman\n\n\"would take care of it and [Francis] would have no problems.\"\n\n           Freeman argues that the testimony of DiBella, who was\n\nthe    government's    star     witness,     fatally        undermined   the\n\ngovernment's conspiracy case, requiring a judgment of acquittal.\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fWhen   asked   why   he   made   cash   payments   to   Freeman,    DiBella\n\nresponded:\n\n          Why? Because I, you know, every time you\n          talk to him it was drugs, drugs, drugs. And\n          your son is on the top of the DEA list.\n          And, you know, they're watching him and you\n          got to be careful, because the City of\n          Peabody is looking to shut you down, they\n          want to take your license away from you.\n          And the least little excuse they get,\n          they'll take it away from you. So, he had\n          me in a, like in a fearful, like something\n          that you grow up in the North End with all\n          the wise guys looking down your throat. If\n          you're making a dollar, they want part of\n          that dollar.\n\nDiBella also testified that Freeman never so much as \"fixed an\n\noverdue library card\" on his behalf.           Asked whether he \"ever\n\nagreed with Sergeant Freeman to have him turn his back on\n\nlicensing violations,\" DiBella answered, \"I never agreed to\n\nanything like that.\"       Freeman insists that DiBella's testimony\n\nconclusively establishes that DiBella never voluntarily agreed\n\nto trade benefits with Freeman in return for favors, but rather\n\nthat DiBella was \"shaken down,\" the victim of extortion.              This,\n\naccording to Freeman, foreclosed a conspiracy conviction.\n\n          The trial court disagreed and so do we.                  Although\n\nDiBella denied that he entered into an agreement with Freeman,\n\nthe jury was entitled to disregard DiBella's testimony on this\n\npoint and draw opposing inferences from DiBella's course of\n\nconduct and the testimony of other witnesses.           It is elementary\n\n                                   -22-\n\fthat the agreement necessary to support a conspiracy conviction\n\ncan \"be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case.\"\n\nIanelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 778 n.10 (1975).            \"[T]he\n\nagreement may be express or tacit and may be proved by direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence.\" United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187\n\nF.3d 148, 175 (1st Cir. 1999).            Moreover, although DiBella may\n\nhave been afraid of Freeman, \"a generalized fear of harm\" is no\n\ndefense to a conspiracy charge.               United States v. Alzanki, 54\n\nF.3d       994,   1003   (1st   Cir.   1995).    Evidence   precluding   the\n\ninference of an agreement would have to show that the duress to\n\nwhich DiBella was subject was \"enough to overbear [his] will and\n\nmake his participation in the conspiracy involuntary.\"              Slater\n\nv. United States, 562 F.2d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 1976).             While there\n\nis some evidence that Freeman acted in a generally threatening\n\nmanner toward DiBella, a reasonable trier of fact could have\n\nfound that the threats were not so coercive as to \"overbear\"\n\nDiBella's will.          DiBella was a seasoned businessman7 and the\n\nowner of a controversial adult entertainment business, as well\n\nas an admitted felon who pled guilty to lying on his federal\n\nincome taxes for many years.             A reasonable trier of fact may\n\nwell have questioned DiBella's credibility and doubted whether\n\n\n\n       7\n     DiBella also owned a fruit distributorship that specialized\nin, among other things, bananas.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fDiBella could have been easily scared into making payoffs to\n\nFreeman without getting anything in return.                    Alternatively, the\n\njury might have concluded that DiBella testified as he did in a\n\nself-serving       attempt       to   deny   his   own   participation          in     the\n\nalleged conspiracy.\n\n               Despite Freeman's entreaties, our conclusion upholding\n\nthe trial court's denial of Freeman's motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal on the conspiracy charge is not altered by the fact\n\nthat     the    trial     court       simultaneously         concluded     that        the\n\ngovernment produced insufficient evidence of a conspiracy to\n\ninvoke    the     hearsay        exception       for   statements        made     by     a\n\ncoconspirator.          Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d) provides in\n\nrelevant part that           a \"statement is not hearsay if . . . (2)\n\n[t]he statement is offered against a party and is . . . (E) a\n\nstatement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\"                 The rules further provide that\n\nqualification       for    the    Rule    801    hearsay     exception     is    to     be\n\n\"determined by the court.\"               Fed. R. Evid. 104(a).\n\n               In United States v. Petrozziello, we specified that the\n\ncourt, in making this determination, must adhere to the ordinary\n\ncivil standard of proof, allowing the testimony \"if it is more\n\nlikely    than    not     that    the    declarant     and    the   defendant        were\n\nmembers of a conspiracy . . . and that the statement was in\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\ffurtherance of the conspiracy,\"           548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n1977); see also United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 702 n.13\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).    We have also stated that a trial court's own\n\nevaluation of the evidence for the purposes of an evidentiary\n\nruling does not preclude it from concluding that the jury might\n\nview the evidence differently.      See United States v. Pitochelli,\n\n830    F.2d        401,     403          (1st   Cir.    1987).\n\n         Our trial system makes a sharp distinction between\n\nfunctions: the judge is \"not a thirteenth juror, much less [is]\n\nhe a super-juror whose views of credibility could override the\n\njury's verdict.\"    Id.   Accordingly, although in a Petrozziello\n\nruling the court can make credibility assessments and draw\n\ninferences from the facts, it must take the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government in ruling on a motion for\n\na judgment of acquittal.    It is not inconsistent for a court to\n\nconclude, therefore, based on its own inferences and credibility\n\nassessments, that it is more likely than not that no conspiracy\n\nexisted, while, at the same time, concluding that the evidence,\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the government, would\n\npermit a rational juror to find the defendant guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n         For all of these reasons, we conclude that the trial\n\ncourt did not err in denying Freeman's motion for a judgment of\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\facquittal    on    the   conspiracy   charges.     The   court   properly\n\nsubmitted that charge to the jury.8\n\n\n\nB.   The Statements of a Coconspirator\n\n            As an additional argument for a mistrial, Freeman\n\ncontends that the court erred in allowing \"hearsay testimony in\n\nsupport   of      an   existing   conspiracy,\"   and   that   this   error\n\n\n     8\n     Despite these rulings, the court remained concerned about\nthe closeness of the conspiracy/extortion issue. It therefore\ntook special care in its jury instructions to distinguish\nextortion, which was not charged, from the conspiracy charge at\nissue in this case:\n\n            [T]here's some evidence here, if you believe\n            it, evidence of a shakedown.       Squeezing\n            money out of people. But that's not one of\n            the crimes charged here.    That's a crime.\n            That's extortion. But that's not one of the\n            crimes charged here.\n\n            . . . .\n\n            [L]et's suppose you believe that Mr. Freeman\n            was shaking down Mr. DiBella; that he was\n            extorting money from him. Now, extortion is\n            when someone pays money under a fear that if\n            they do not pay the money that something\n            will be done to them.       If you believe\n            evidence that the conduct here took place\n            and the payments took place, and they took\n            place because if they were not taking place,\n            given Mr. Freeman's conduct, what was going\n            on in Mr. DiBella's mind was that Mr.\n            Freeman would trump up a charge, he would\n            fabricate a charge, and that would injure\n            the business.    That's not the conspiracy\n            that's being charged here.\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f\"unfairly prejudiced Mr. Freeman with respect to the witness\n\ntampering     charges.\"       Before      the   trial   court     made   its\n\nPetrozziello ruling, it had provisionally admitted the hearsay\n\ntestimony of Deborah Drew.       This approach is consistent with the\n\nlaw of this circuit which provides that \"[h]earsay evidence may\n\nbe admitted provisionally, subject to the trial court's final\n\nPetrozziello determination, which should be made 'at the close\n\nof all the evidence.'\" Portela, 167 F.3d at 702-03 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir. 1980)).\n\nWhen   a    court   ultimately   concludes      that    hearsay    evidence\n\nprovisionally admitted does not meet the Petrozziello standards,\n\nthe court must \"give a cautionary instruction to the jury, or,\n\nupon   an    appropriate     motion,    declare    a    mistrial    if   the\n\ninstruction     will   not    suffice      to   cure    any     prejudice.\"\n\nCiampaglia, 628 F.2d at 638.              The court gave a cautionary\n\ninstruction.    We conclude that it sufficed to cure the effect of\n\nDrew's hearsay testimony.\n\n            Deborah Drew testified that DiBella told her that he\n\nprovided free alcohol to police officers to prevent the police\n\nfrom \"causing beefs\" for the club, and that DiBella instructed\n\nher to contact the local police rather than the state police if\n\nthere were any licensing violation problems.                  Later in the\n\ntrial, after DiBella testified that there was no agreement with\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fFreeman,    the    court   became   more    reluctant       to   admit   hearsay\n\nstatements made by DiBella under the coconspirator exception.\n\nThe     court     sustained    objections        to     Philip    Freeman,    the\n\ndefendant's brother, and to Amy Clarke, testifying to out-of-\n\ncourt statements made by DiBella.          The prosecution protested the\n\nruling with respect to Amy Clarke, prompting an admonition from\n\nthe court:\n\n            Understand that by pressing this, even if\n            there is sufficient evidence to get to the\n            jury on conspiracy under [Fed. R. Evid.]\n            104(a), I have to be persuaded by a fair\n            preponderance of the evidence that there was\n            a conspiracy. That's a different standard.\n            It's not a standard that gives you all the\n            breaks. It's the standard do I think these\n            people were conspiring. If I do, fine. But\n            if I don't we have to strike it out. Since\n            you cannot unring the bell, what we're faced\n            with is a motion for mistrial . . . .\n\nFollowing this admonition, the government abandoned its strategy\n\nof questioning Clarke about DiBella's statements.                  As it turned\n\nout, that was a wise decision by the government because it meant\n\nthat, other than the testimony of Drew, no hearsay testimony was\n\nprovisionally       admitted    under      the        hearsay    exception    for\n\nstatements of a coconspirator.\n\n            As the government's case in chief came to a close, the\n\ncourt    made     its   Petrozziello    ruling:         \"[T]he   Court   is   not\n\npersuaded by a fair preponderance of the evidence, as I make\n\nfindings of preliminary fact, that at any time there existed a\n\n                                    -28-\n\fconspiracy between Mr. Freeman and Mr. DiBella.                   That requires\n\nme to strike so much of the testimony of Ms. Drew as recounted\n\nthings that Mr. DiBella had to say.\"                   The trial court then\n\ninstructed the jury:\n\n           I let you hear what Ms. Drew had to say\n           about what Mr. DiBella said to her about\n           certain things.     And now having thought\n           about it, and it's my responsibility, I must\n           strike out that part of the testimony. What\n           Ms. Drew said the older DiBella said to her,\n           that's just out of the case. . . . Disregard\n           it.\n\nStriking the evidence and issuing this curative instruction were\n\nsufficient     to    shield    Freeman   from    prejudice       caused   by   the\n\nprovisional admission of Drew's hearsay testimony.                     Jurors are\n\npresumed to follow the court's instructions.                 See United States\n\nv. Magana, 127 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).                   Even assuming that\n\nthe jurors wrongly considered the stricken testimony, Drew's\n\nhearsay testimony had scant relevance to the witness tampering\n\ncharges of which Freeman was convicted, and their provisional\n\nadmission was not likely to have had any significant prejudicial\n\nimpact   on    the    jury's    evaluation      of    the   witness     tampering\n\ncharges.      Moreover, Drew's brief hearsay testimony occurred in\n\na trial that lasted seven days.\n\n           Given      the   minimal   hearsay        testimony    provisionally\n\nadmitted   under      the   coconspirator       exception,       the   peripheral\n\nimpact, if any, of such testimony on the witness tampering\n\n                                      -29-\n\foffenses of which Freeman was convicted, and the trial court's\n\nclear instructions to the jury to disregard the testimony, we\n\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying Freeman's request for a mistrial on the basis of this\n\nprovisionally admitted hearsay testimony.\n\nC. The Spillover Effect\n\n           In urging this third ground for a mistrial, Freeman\n\nlaments that \"by the close of evidence, the government had\n\ncharacterized [him] as a drunk, a violent man, a shakedown\n\nartist, a philanderer, an adulterer, and a rouge [sic] cop, and\n\nan all-around low life,\" and he complains that \"the conspiracy\n\ncharge was the vehicle for the admission of this evidence.\"\n\nSince we have concluded that the conspiracy charge was properly\n\nsubmitted to the jury, it follows that the jury was entitled to\n\nhear the evidence relevant to that charge.                The evidence of\n\nFreeman's \"bad acts\" at the Golden Banana--excessive drinking,\n\ninvading   the   dancers'    dressing     room,   erupting       in   fits   of\n\nviolence--was    relevant    to   the    conspiracy     charge   because     it\n\nshowed that Freeman received special treatment at the nightclub:\n\nthat is, that DiBella and his employees allowed Freeman to\n\nbehave in a manner that would never have been tolerated if\n\nFreeman were an ordinary patron.           That was the object of the\n\nunlawful   agreement   for   which      Freeman   was   charged--i.e.,       to\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\freceive things of value, including special treatment at the\n\nnightclub, in exchange for favors provided to DiBella.\n\n            We acknowledge that the \"bad acts\" evidence admitted\n\nfor its relevance to the conspiracy charge may have had a\n\nspillover      effect   on    the   witness     tampering     charges.    This\n\npotential exists whenever multiple counts or defendants are\n\njoined    in   a   single    trial.        Because   the   witness   tampering\n\noffenses grew out of an attempt to cover up the conspiracy\n\nscheme, however, there is no doubt that the two offenses were\n\nproperly joined.        See, e.g.,       United States v. Davis, 752 F.2d\n\n963, 972 (5th Cir. 1985) (finding joinder proper where \"the\n\ncoverup attempts bear a logical relationship to underlying . .\n\n. crimes\").9       While we have acknowledged that \"[t]here is always\n\nsome prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or\n\noffender are tried together,\" United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d\n\n230, 246 (1st Cir. 1990); see also United States v. Turoff, 853\n\nF.2d 1037, 1043 (2d Cir. 1988), the possibility that a jury may\n\nthink worse of the defendant because multiple related offenses\n\nare   tried    together      is   not,    standing   alone,    grounds   for   a\n\nmistrial,      see, e.g., United States v. Fagan, 821 F.2d 1002,\n\n1007 (5th Cir. 1987).\n\n\n\n      9\n     We note that Freeman neither opposed joinder nor moved to\nsever the conspiracy and witness tampering counts.\n\n                                         -31-\n\f          Also, and importantly, much of the \"bad acts\" evidence\n\nadmitted for its relevance to the conspiracy charge was also\n\nadmissible to show a motive for witness tampering.            Although\n\nevidence of a defendant's bad acts may not be used \"to prove\n\ncharacter of a person in order to show action in conformity\n\ntherewith,\" it may be \"admissible for other purposes, such as\n\nproof of motive.\"     Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).          The evidence of\n\nFreeman's bad conduct at the Golden Banana was relevant to show\n\nthat Freeman was aware of the criminal nature of his underlying\n\nconduct--whether characterized as conspiracy or extortion--which\n\ncreated a motive for witness tampering.            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Romero, 54 F.3d 56, 60 (2d Cir. 1995) (evidence\n\nrelating to narcotics charges admissible to show motive to\n\nmurder a government witness); Fagan, 821 F.2d at 1007 (evidence\n\nof mail fraud admissible to show motive for witness tampering).\n\nIndeed,   Freeman's   erratic   and    sometimes    violent   behavior\n\nprovides the context for understanding why Amy Clarke felt\n\nthreatened and intimidated by Freeman.\n\n          Finally, any prejudicial impact from the evidence of\n\nFreeman's conduct at the Golden Banana was mitigated by the\n\ncourt's clear instructions to the jury:\n\n          It is not a crime for him to go to a strip\n          joint. It is not a crime for him to flirt\n          with the strippers, whatever you may think\n          of that.   Nor is it a crime for him to\n\n                                -32-\n\f            drink, even to drink to excess. It is not a\n            crime for him to go into the dancers'\n            dressing room and act like a bo[o]r.\n            Whatever you think of that, that is not a\n            crime.\n\nThe court further emphasized that Freeman was not to be judged\n\non any of his underlying conduct, and that \"he's to be judged\n\nonly on\" the conspiracy and witness tampering charges.\n\n            We have held that \"within wide margins, the potential\n\nfor   prejudice     .     .    .   can    be     satisfactorily          dispelled       by\n\nappropriate curative instructions.\" Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1184.\n\n\"Jurors are presumed to follow such instructions, except in\n\nextreme cases.\"      Magana, 127 F.3d at 6.                 Here, the trial court's\n\ninstructions       were       adequate    to        safeguard        Freeman    from    any\n\nsubstantial    prejudice.            Indeed,         the    jury     demonstrated       its\n\nability to distinguish among the various counts and offenses by\n\nacquitting    Freeman         of   conspiracy         and   one      count     of   witness\n\ntampering    and    convicting        him      of    the    remaining        two    witness\n\ntampering counts.         See McNatt, 842 F.2d at 566 (\"The fact that\n\nthe jury distinguished between different charges . . . is strong\n\nevidence that the jury actually followed the instruction.\");\n\nUnited   States     v.    Porter,        764    F.2d       1,   13    (1st     Cir.   1985)\n\n(discriminating verdict indicated that the jurors were able to\n\nfollow the court's instructions and discern among the various\n\ndefendants and charges).\n\n\n                                          -33-\n\f           Simply   put,   upon   reviewing   the   totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances, we are unable to find that Freeman suffered any\n\nsubstantial prejudice in his defense to the witness tampering\n\ncharges.    The trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ndenying Freeman's motion for a mistrial.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\f",

He was also acquitted on one count of witness tampering and one count of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) (theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Freeman complains that the evidence of witness tampering was insufficient to support the convictions. Additionally, Freeman contends that the court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge before its submission to the jury. If it had done so, he argues, the court would have been forced to grant a mistrial on the remaining witness tampering charges because the testimony admitted as evidence of the conspiracy was unduly prejudicial to his defense to the witness tampering charges. He further claims that he was entitled to a mistrial because the court admitted evidence of the statements of a coconspirator that it later had to strike, and because of the spillover effect on the witness tampering convictions of \"bad acts\" evidence admitted on the conspiracy charge. Unconvinced by Freeman's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the facts of this odd case at the outset, adding detail below as it becomes necessary to the legal discussion. In 1991, Freeman became associated with the \"Golden Banana,\" a striptease nightclub located in Peabody, and the club's owner, Louis DiBella (DiBella). Freeman began frequenting the Golden Banana shortly after DiBella's son, Francis, was arrested on drug charges. Although Freeman was not an employee of the club, DiBella paid him approximately $100 in cash each week for almost four years. In addition, DiBella loaned Freeman money, gave him free alcoholic beverages at the club, allowed him to influence the hiring and firing of dancers, tolerated his frequent visits to the dancers' dressing room, generally off limits to men, and otherwise turned a blind eye to Freeman's erratic and sometimes violent behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, a federal grand jury began investigating potential violations of federal law at the Golden Banana involving, inter alia, members of the Peabody police department. During the investigation, Freeman approached fellow Peabody police officer Michael Ward and warned him to keep his \"mouth shut\" about \"anything that went on at the Golden Banana.\" Freeman also approached Amy Clarke, the master of ceremonies at the Golden Banana, telling her to \"keep the lip zipped\" and \"not to say anything about the Golden Banana.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury indicted Freeman on five counts. Count One alleged that Freeman conspired with DiBella to receive cash payments, no-interest loans, and free alcoholic beverages, in an attempt by DiBella \"to curry favor with him and to buy his silence about licensed premise violations which occurred at the Golden Banana\"--i.e., a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(B). See supra note 1. The grand jury also indicted Freeman on four counts of witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(2)(A) &amp; (b)(3): Count Two involved an unnamed Peabody police officer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Count Three involved Officer Ward, and Counts Four and Five involved Amy Clarke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opening statement at trial, the government outlined its conspiracy case. According to the government, DiBella would testify that, given the controversial nature of the Golden Banana's business, he needed to stay on the \"good side\" of the Peabody police lest they \"do things like influence his ability to retain the liquor license that he had at the Golden Banana.\" In addition, DiBella would testify that he feared that the Peabody police would \"take away his son,\" Francis, because of Francis's cocaine problem. Thus, the government expected DiBella to testify that he \"willingly\" entered into a \"corrupt relationship\" with Freeman, in which he \"agreed to pay bribes\" to Freeman and Freeman \"agreed to accept them.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial, before the government called DiBella to the stand, it presented the testimony of Deborah Drew, the daytime manager at the Golden Banana. Drew testified that DiBella told her he provided free alcoholic beverages to police officers to avoid \"beefs\" with the police, and that DiBella instructed her to call the Peabody police, not the state police, in the event of a licensing violation committed on the premises. Although the defense objected to this testimony as hearsay, the court provisionally admitted it under the hearsay exception for the statements of a coconspirator, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), promising that it would \"scrutinize it with care at the end of all the evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second day of trial, the government called DiBella as a witness. Although DiBella testified that he made regular cash payments to Freeman, he denied that Freeman had agreed to perform any favors on his behalf. Moreover, DiBella's testimony suggested that he provided benefits to Freeman because of his fear of Freeman rather than any willing agreement between the two. Following DiBella's testimony, the court warned the government that \"if Mr. DiBella is the chief witness, you're in deep serious trouble on the conspiracy count,\" suggesting that it did not think that the \"victim of extortion is a conspirator.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government neared the completion of its case in chief, Freeman moved for a judgment of acquittal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In ruling on the motion, the court also scrutinized the government's conspiracy evidence to determine whether it had properly allowed Drew to testify to DiBella's out-of-court statements on the first day of trial. The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a conspiracy to admit the hearsay statements of a coconspirator, but that there was sufficient evidence to deny the motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Court is not persuaded by a fair preponderance of the evidence, as I make findings of preliminary fact, that at any time there existed a conspiracy between Mr. Freeman and Mr. DiBella. That requires me to strike so much of the testimony of Ms. Drew as recounted things that Mr. DiBella had to say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think that wholly apart from anything I believe about the evidence, that there is enough evidence independent of Mr. DiBella... that a reasonable jury could find a conspiracy....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, I must deny the motion for a judgment of acquittal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman then moved for a mistrial, the court took the motion under advisement, and the government presented its final two witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government rested, Freeman renewed his motions for a judgment of acquittal and a mistrial. Again, the court denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal and left the motion for a mistrial under advisement. After concluding his defense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Freeman renewed his motions for a judgment of acquittal and a mistrial. The court denied both motions and submitted the conspiracy charge and three witness tampering charges to the jury. See supra note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury acquitted Freeman of the conspiracy charge and the witness tampering count involving officer Ward, but convicted him on the two counts of witness tampering involving Amy Clarke. After the verdict, Freeman moved for a new trial, citing the \"overwhelming capacity of evidence that was ostensibly admitted on one count which was the conspiracy[:] all this not very subtle character assassination, Freeman's a drinker, Freeman's going into the dressing rooms.\" According to Freeman, this evidence of \"bad acts,\" admitted for its relevance to the conspiracy count, substantially prejudiced his defense to the witness tampering charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied the motion for a new trial, concluding that \"the evidence that was improperly allowed is just too peripheral here\" (referring to Deborah Drew's hearsay account of DiBella's statements to her), and that \"the jury showed their independence and their ability to discern between counts\" by acquitting Freeman on two of the four counts. The court sentenced Freeman to four months' incarceration followed by twenty-four months of supervised release, the first four of those months in home confinement. The court also ordered Freeman to pay a $3,000 fine and a $200 special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman now appeals, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the two witness tampering counts. Alternatively, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for a mistrial and a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain convictions for witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(2)(A) &amp; (b)(3), the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Freeman (1) \"knowingly use[d] intimidation or physical force, threaten[ed], or corruptly persuad[ed]\" Amy Clarke, (2) intending to induce Clarke to \"withhold testimony,\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512. In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence of witness tampering, we must view the facts and witness credibility determinations, as well as draw reasonable inferences, in favor of the government. See United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir. 1995). \"So long as the evidence, taken as a whole, warrants a judgment of conviction,\" the evidence is legally sufficient. United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir. 1995). Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence shows that Freeman made statements to Clarke on two occasions that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt were criminally culpable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman was aware that there was a federal investigation of activity at the Golden Banana. Based on the evidence presented by the government, the jury could infer that Freeman was also aware that his own conduct might subject him to criminal liability as a result of the investigation. Thus, Freeman had a motive to prevent potential witnesses from relaying damaging information to the government. Clarke testified that Freeman approached her at the Golden Banana and said, \"I hear you've been talking and the feds are around,\" and stated, \"remember, mum's the word.\" Later in the same conversation Freeman said, \"remember with the feds around talking, keep the lip zipped,\" drawing his finger across his lips in an accompanying gesture. Clarke testified that this exchange made her feel \"a little bit intimidated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of his motive to curtail the flow of information to the government, the jury could reasonably infer that Freeman selected language that he thought would intimidate, threaten, or corruptly persuade Clarke, and that Freeman did so intending to cause her to \"withhold testimony\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent the communication\" of information to the federal authorities investigating the Golden Banana. Although Freeman's words did not contain overt threats, a reasonable jury could infer that Freeman knew Clarke would be threatened by such words, given his status as a police officer and her first-hand knowledge of his erratic personality and violent temper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Freeman's statements to Clarke several weeks later at her house were sufficient to support a conviction on a second count of witness tampering. Freeman went to Clarke's house immediately following the appearance of a newspaper article about the Golden Banana that featured a front-page picture of Clarke. The jury could have inferred that Freeman went to her house at this time because the article had renewed his fear that Clarke was cooperating in the investigation. Freeman said to Clarke, \"the feds [are] coming down heavy,\" and warned her \"not to say anything about the Golden Banana.\" Clarke testified that this conversation made her feel \"intimidated,\" \"very uneasy,\" and \"awkward,\" and that she was so afraid of Freeman that she hid in the basement the next time he came to her house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Freeman's statements to Clarke, made in the context of a visit to her home shortly after the appearance of a newspaper article that Clarke had reason to believe had angered him, were sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that Freeman knowingly acted in a way designed to intimidate, threaten, or corruptly persuade Clarke, with the specific intent to cause her to \"withhold testimony\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent the communication\" of information to the federal authorities. See United States v. Shotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cir. 1998) (finding defendant's statement to his secretary to \"just not say anything [to the FBI] and I wasn't going to be bothered\" sufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MOTION FOR A MISTRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial or a new trial for three reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> First, if the trial court had granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge as it should have, it would have realized that so much \"bad acts\" testimony had been admitted as evidence of the conspiracy that Freeman could not get a fair trial on the witness tampering charges. Second, the trial court had exacerbated the prejudicial effect of the conspiracy evidence by allowing the government to present the hearsay testimony of a coconspirator, only to strike that evidence once it determined that the government had failed to show the existence of a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. Third, even if the court properly submitted the conspiracy charge to the jury, the \"bad acts\" evidence admitted in support of that charge substantially prejudiced the jury's consideration of the witness tampering charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with any review of a denial of a motion for a mistrial, we consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the defendant has demonstrated the kind of \"clear\" prejudice that would render the court's denial of his motion for a mistrial a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1998). In conducting this inquiry, we are mindful that the trial court has a \"superior point of vantage,\" and that \"it is only rarely--and in extremely compelling circumstances--that an appellate panel, informed by a cold record, will venture to reverse a trial judge's on-the-spot decision.\" United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d. 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994). Where \"a curative instruction is promptly given, a mistrial is warranted only in rare circumstances implying extreme prejudice.\" Torres, 162 F.3d at 12 (emphasis added). This is so because a mistrial is viewed as a \"last resort, only to be implemented if the taint is ineradicable, that is, only if the trial judge believes that the jury's exposure to the evidence is likely to prove beyond realistic hope of repair.\" United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Freeman's motion for a mistrial for the following reasons: (A) the court properly denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge; (B) the minimal hearsay statements of a coconspirator, later stricken from the record, did not substantially prejudice the jury's consideration of the witness tampering charges; and (C) the \"bad acts\" evidence admitted in support of the conspiracy charge did not spill over to substantially prejudice the jury's consideration of the witness tampering charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Denial of the Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal on the Conspiracy Charge</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must first note the unusual nature of this mistrial argument, premised as it is on the allegedly erroneous denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal on a charge later rejected by the jury with a not guilty verdict. Although Freeman's logic in pursuing this argument is not always clear, we divine this meaning in his claim. If a defendant in a trial involving multiple charges succeeds in obtaining a judgment of acquittal on some of the charges at the completion of the government's case, the defendant can argue that he cannot get a fair trial on the charges that remain in the case because of the evidence presented on the now dismissed charges, and hence he is entitled to a mistrial on the remaining charges. See United States v. McNatt, 842 F.2d 564, 565-66 (1st Cir. 1988); see also United States v. Hamblin, 911 F.2d 551, 559 (11th Cir. 1990); Leach v. United States, 402 F.2d 268, 268 (5th Cir. 1968) (per curiam). Although Freeman was ultimately acquitted on the conspiracy charge, and therefore has no basis for challenging as a discrete issue on appeal the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on that charge, he argues that he should be able to make on appeal the same mistrial argument that would have been available to him if he had persuaded the court to dismiss the conspiracy charge at the completion of the government's case. That is, he should be able to argue that the denial of the mistrial request was erroneous because of the substantial prejudice created by the evidence that went to the jury in support of a conspiracy charge that should have been dismissed. Under the scenario in this case, the challenge to the judge's ruling on the motion for a judgment of acquittal, instead of being the basis for a discretely appealable issue, becomes the predicate for Freeman's first challenge to the trial court's ruling on the motion for a mistrial. See United States v. Guiliano, 644 F.2d 85, 88-89 (2d Cir. 1981) (ordering a retrial on a bankruptcy fraud count, even though the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, because it reversed on appeal a RICO conviction and concluded that there was a \"distinct risk that the jury was influenced in its disposition of [the bankruptcy fraud] count by improper evidence and by the allegations of the RICO count\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept the theory of Freeman's appeal on this mistrial issue. That is a pyrrhic victory, however, because we agree with the trial court's decision to deny Freeman's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge. We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a) provides, \"[t]he court on a motion of a defendant or of its own motion shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment or information after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\" Pursuant to this standard, the defendant may claim a \"hopeless variance in the proof\" between the crime charged and the evidence produced at trial. See 2 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Criminal 2d &#167; 466, at 654 (West 1982). Freeman argued that the government's evidence, especially DiBella's testimony that he was motivated by fear rather than by an agreement with Freeman, indicated that Freeman was guilty if at all of extortion, an offense not charged by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the evidence presented by the government arguably would have lent more support to a charge of extortion than a charge of conspiracy, the evidence was sufficient to submit the conspiracy charge to the jury. To prove a conspiracy, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the \"defendant and one or more coconspirators intended to agree and... to commit the substantive criminal offense which was the object of their unlawful agreement.\" United States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir. 1992) (alteration in original). Here, the \"substantive criminal offense\" charged was a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(B), which prohibits an agent of a local government, like a police officer, from \"corruptly solicit[ing] or demand[ing] for the benefit of any person, or accept[ing] or agree[ing] to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\" Stated in terms of the government's theory of the case, the government needed to prove that Freeman and DiBella entered into an agreement in which Freeman would \"accept or agree to accept\" valuable benefits from DiBella, including cash payoffs, loans, and special treatment at the Golden Banana, intending to be \"influenced or rewarded\" for helping DiBella and his son avoid trouble with the Peabody police or the Peabody officials who oversee the Golden Banana's license to sell liquor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence to support the government's conspiracy theory. First, the evidence showed that Freeman received \"something of value\" from DiBella in the form of money payments and special treatment at the Golden Banana. DiBella paid Freeman approximately $100 per week in cash for almost four years, and loaned money to Freeman's brother and to one of Freeman's friends--money that was never repaid. Freeman drank for free at the Golden Banana, spent time in the dancers' dressing room, a location generally off limits to men, and enjoyed influence over DiBella's decisions to hire and fire particular dancers. DiBella continued to tolerate Freeman's presence at the club despite Freeman's erratic and sometimes violent behavior. Amy Clarke testified that Freeman would become \"belligerent\" when she asked him to leave the dancers' dressing room. Similarly, Thomas LeGault, the night manager at the Golden Banana, testified that on one occasion, when he asked Freeman to leave the dressing room, Freeman said, \"I'll cut fucking LeGault's throat with a bottle,\" and threw a chair at the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the cash payments, loans, and other special treatment that DiBella bestowed upon Freeman were not given in consideration for any legitimate work that Freeman performed on DiBella's behalf. During the relevant time, Freeman was not working as a security guard or in any other capacity at the club. Indeed, several witnesses testified that Freeman was usually drinking at the club and was often seen intoxicated. These facts cast doubt on Freeman's defense, advanced mainly through cross-examination and in his closing argument, that he was somehow performing surreptitious security duties for DiBella.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was some evidence that Freeman obtained the cash payments, loans, and special treatment \"intending to be influenced or rewarded\" for his help in insulating the Golden Banana and Francis DiBella from trouble with local police and city officials. That Freeman began to patronize the club regularly only after Francis's arrest on drug charges might suggest that Freeman, who worked in the area of narcotics, viewed the arrest as an opportunity to trade his influence as a police officer for favors. Deborah Drew testified that shortly before Francis was arrested, Freeman said to her that DiBella \"shouldn't fuck with him... [and that] because of the things that Frankie [Francis] was doing, that he [Freeman] could close the club.\" Francis DiBella testified that Freeman warned him that he was on the \"top of the [DEA's] list,\" but that Freeman \"would take care of it and [Francis] would have no problems.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman argues that the testimony of DiBella, who was the government's star witness, fatally undermined the government's conspiracy case, requiring a judgment of acquittal. When asked why he made cash payments to Freeman, DiBella responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why? Because I, you know, every time you talk to him it was drugs, drugs, drugs. And your son is on the top of the DEA list. And, you know, they're watching him and you got to be careful, because the City of Peabody is looking to shut you down, they want to take your license away from you. And the least little excuse they get, they'll take it away from you. So, he had me in a, like in a fearful, like something that you grow up in the North End with all the wise guys looking down your throat. If you're making a dollar, they want part of that dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiBella also testified that Freeman never so much as \"fixed an overdue library card\" on his behalf. Asked whether he \"ever agreed with Sergeant Freeman to have him turn his back on licensing violations,\" DiBella answered, \"I never agreed to anything like that.\" Freeman insists that DiBella's testimony conclusively establishes that DiBella never voluntarily agreed to trade benefits with Freeman in return for favors, but rather that DiBella was \"shaken down,\" the victim of extortion. This, according to Freeman, foreclosed a conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court disagreed and so do we. Although DiBella denied that he entered into an agreement with Freeman, the jury was entitled to disregard DiBella's testimony on this point and draw opposing inferences from DiBella's course of conduct and the testimony of other witnesses. It is elementary that the agreement necessary to support a conspiracy conviction can \"be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case.\" Ianelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 778 n.10 (1975). \"[T]he agreement may be express or tacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\" United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 175 (1st Cir. 1999). Moreover, although DiBella may have been afraid of Freeman, \"a generalized fear of harm\" is no defense to a conspiracy charge. United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1003 (1st Cir. 1995). Evidence precluding the inference of an agreement would have to show that the duress to which DiBella was subject was \"enough to overbear [his] will and make his participation in the conspiracy involuntary.\" Slater v. United States, 562 F.2d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 1976). While there is some evidence that Freeman acted in a generally threatening manner toward DiBella, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the threats were not so coercive as to \"overbear\" DiBella's will. DiBella was a seasoned businessman<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and the owner of a controversial adult entertainment business, as well as an admitted felon who pled guilty to lying on his federal income taxes for many years. A reasonable trier of fact may well have questioned DiBella's credibility and doubted whether DiBella could have been easily scared into making payoffs to Freeman without getting anything in return. Alternatively, the jury might have concluded that DiBella testified as he did in a self-serving attempt to deny his own participation in the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Freeman's entreaties, our conclusion upholding the trial court's denial of Freeman's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge is not altered by the fact that the trial court simultaneously concluded that the government produced insufficient evidence of a conspiracy to invoke the hearsay exception for statements made by a coconspirator. Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d) provides in relevant part that a \"statement is not hearsay if... (2) [t]he statement is offered against a party and is... (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" The rules further provide that qualification for the Rule 801 hearsay exception is to be \"determined by the court.\" Fed. R. Evid. 104(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Petrozziello, we specified that the court, in making this determination, must adhere to the ordinary civil standard of proof, allowing the testimony \"if it is more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy... and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy,\" 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977); see also United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 702 n.13 (1st Cir. 1999). We have also stated that a trial court's own evaluation of the evidence for the purposes of an evidentiary ruling does not preclude it from concluding that the jury might view the evidence differently. See United States v. Pitochelli, 830 F.2d 401, 403 (1st Cir. 1987).Our trial system makes a sharp distinction between functions: the judge is \"not a thirteenth juror, much less [is] he a super-juror whose views of credibility could override the jury's verdict.\" Id. Accordingly, although in a Petrozziello ruling the court can make credibility assessments and draw inferences from the facts, it must take the evidence in the light most favorable to the government in ruling on a motion for a judgment of acquittal. It is not inconsistent for a court to conclude, therefore, based on its own inferences and credibility assessments, that it is more likely than not that no conspiracy existed, while, at the same time, concluding that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, would permit a rational juror to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Freeman's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charges. The court properly submitted that charge to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Statements of a Coconspirator</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an additional argument for a mistrial, Freeman contends that the court erred in allowing \"hearsay testimony in support of an existing conspiracy,\" and that this error \"unfairly prejudiced Mr. Freeman with respect to the witness tampering charges.\" Before the trial court made its Petrozziello ruling, it had provisionally admitted the hearsay testimony of Deborah Drew. This approach is consistent with the law of this circuit which provides that \"[h]earsay evidence may be admitted provisionally, subject to the trial court's final Petrozziello determination, which should be made 'at the close of all the evidence.'\" Portela, 167 F.3d at 702-03 (quoting United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir. 1980)). When a court ultimately concludes that hearsay evidence provisionally admitted does not meet the Petrozziello standards, the court must \"give a cautionary instruction to the jury, or, upon an appropriate motion, declare a mistrial if the instruction will not suffice to cure any prejudice.\" Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d at 638. The court gave a cautionary instruction. We conclude that it sufficed to cure the effect of Drew's hearsay testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deborah Drew testified that DiBella told her that he provided free alcohol to police officers to prevent the police from \"causing beefs\" for the club, and that DiBella instructed her to contact the local police rather than the state police if there were any licensing violation problems. Later in the trial, after DiBella testified that there was no agreement with Freeman, the court became more reluctant to admit hearsay statements made by DiBella under the coconspirator exception. The court sustained objections to Philip Freeman, the defendant's brother, and to Amy Clarke, testifying to out-of-court statements made by DiBella. The prosecution protested the ruling with respect to Amy Clarke, prompting an admonition from the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understand that by pressing this, even if there is sufficient evidence to get to the jury on conspiracy under [Fed. R. Evid.] 104(a), I have to be persuaded by a fair preponderance of the evidence that there was a conspiracy. That's a different standard. It's not a standard that gives you all the breaks. It's the standard do I think these people were conspiring. If I do, fine. But if I don't we have to strike it out. Since you cannot unring the bell, what we're faced with is a motion for mistrial....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this admonition, the government abandoned its strategy of questioning Clarke about DiBella's statements. As it turned out, that was a wise decision by the government because it meant that, other than the testimony of Drew, no hearsay testimony was provisionally admitted under the hearsay exception for statements of a coconspirator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government's case in chief came to a close, the court made its Petrozziello ruling: \"[T]he Court is not persuaded by a fair preponderance of the evidence, as I make findings of preliminary fact, that at any time there existed a conspiracy between Mr. Freeman and Mr. DiBella. That requires me to strike so much of the testimony of Ms. Drew as recounted things that Mr. DiBella had to say.\" The trial court then instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I let you hear what Ms. Drew had to say about what Mr. DiBella said to her about certain things. And now having thought about it, and it's my responsibility, I must strike out that part of the testimony. What Ms. Drew said the older DiBella said to her, that's just out of the case.... Disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Striking the evidence and issuing this curative instruction were sufficient to shield Freeman from prejudice caused by the provisional admission of Drew's hearsay testimony. Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions. See United States v. Magana, 127 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997). Even assuming that the jurors wrongly considered the stricken testimony, Drew's hearsay testimony had scant relevance to the witness tampering charges of which Freeman was convicted, and their provisional admission was not likely to have had any significant prejudicial impact on the jury's evaluation of the witness tampering charges. Moreover, Drew's brief hearsay testimony occurred in a trial that lasted seven days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the minimal hearsay testimony provisionally admitted under the coconspirator exception, the peripheral impact, if any, of such testimony on the witness tampering offenses of which Freeman was convicted, and the trial court's clear instructions to the jury to disregard the testimony, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Freeman's request for a mistrial on the basis of this provisionally admitted hearsay testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Spillover Effect</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In urging this third ground for a mistrial, Freeman laments that \"by the close of evidence, the government had characterized [him] as a drunk, a violent man, a shakedown artist, a philanderer, an adulterer, and a rouge [sic] cop, and an all-around low life,\" and he complains that \"the conspiracy charge was the vehicle for the admission of this evidence.\" Since we have concluded that the conspiracy charge was properly submitted to the jury, it follows that the jury was entitled to hear the evidence relevant to that charge. The evidence of Freeman's \"bad acts\" at the Golden Banana--excessive drinking, invading the dancers' dressing room, erupting in fits of violence--was relevant to the conspiracy charge because it showed that Freeman received special treatment at the nightclub: that is, that DiBella and his employees allowed Freeman to behave in a manner that would never have been tolerated if Freeman were an ordinary patron. That was the object of the unlawful agreement for which Freeman was charged i.e., to receive things of value, including special treatment at the nightclub, in exchange for favors provided to DiBella.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the \"bad acts\" evidence admitted for its relevance to the conspiracy charge may have had a spillover effect on the witness tampering charges. This potential exists whenever multiple counts or defendants are joined in a single trial. Because the witness tampering offenses grew out of an attempt to cover up the conspiracy scheme, however, there is no doubt that the two offenses were properly joined. See, e.g., United States v. Davis, 752 F.2d 963, 972 (5th Cir. 1985) (finding joinder proper where \"the coverup attempts bear a logical relationship to underlying... crimes\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> While we have acknowledged that \"[t]here is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together,\" United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 246 (1st Cir. 1990); see also United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d 1037, 1043 (2d Cir. 1988), the possibility that a jury may think worse of the defendant because multiple related offenses are tried together is not, standing alone, grounds for a mistrial, see, e.g., United States v. Fagan, 821 F.2d 1002, 1007 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, and importantly, much of the \"bad acts\" evidence admitted for its relevance to the conspiracy charge was also admissible to show a motive for witness tampering. Although evidence of a defendant's bad acts may not be used \"to prove character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,\" it may be \"admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive.\" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The evidence of Freeman's bad conduct at the Golden Banana was relevant to show that Freeman was aware of the criminal nature of his underlying conduct--whether characterized as conspiracy or extortion--which created a motive for witness tampering. See, e.g., United States v. Romero, 54 F.3d 56, 60 (2d Cir. 1995) (evidence relating to narcotics charges admissible to show motive to murder a government witness); Fagan, 821 F.2d at 1007 (evidence of mail fraud admissible to show motive for witness tampering). Indeed, Freeman's erratic and sometimes violent behavior provides the context for understanding why Amy Clarke felt threatened and intimidated by Freeman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, any prejudicial impact from the evidence of Freeman's conduct at the Golden Banana was mitigated by the court's clear instructions to the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not a crime for him to go to a strip joint.

Whatever you think of that, that is not a crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further emphasized that Freeman was not to be judged on any of his underlying conduct, and that \"he's to be judged only on\" the conspiracy and witness tampering charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"within wide margins, the potential for prejudice... can be satisfactorily dispelled by appropriate curative instructions.\" Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1184. \"Jurors are presumed to follow such instructions, except in extreme cases.\" Magana, 127 F.3d at 6. Here, the trial court's instructions were adequate to safeguard Freeman from any substantial prejudice. Indeed, the jury demonstrated its ability to distinguish among the various counts and offenses by acquitting Freeman of conspiracy and one count of witness tampering and convicting him of the remaining two witness tampering counts. See McNatt, 842 F.2d at 566 (\"The fact that the jury distinguished between different charges... is strong evidence that the jury actually followed the instruction.\"); United States v.

(The court found Marron's testimony inadmissible.) Robert Russell, a Peabody police detective, testified that DiBella had spoken favorably of Freeman and that Francis DiBella had told him that the federal authorities were trying to get his father to say that he had paid Freeman off.

Freeman's arguments in support of a mistrial and a new trial are the same, and they are subject to the same standard of review, see United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 773 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"We review a trial judge's ruling on a motion for a mistrial, or for a new trial, only for abuse of discretion.\").

Freeman, Jr., an officer in the Peabody, Massachusetts, police department, was convicted by a jury on two counts of witness tampering. He was also acquitted on one count of witness tampering and one count of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(B) (theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Freeman complains that the evidence of witness tampering was insufficient to support the convictions. Additionally, Freeman contends that the court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge before its submission to the jury. If it had done so, he argues, the court would have been forced to grant a mistrial on the remaining witness tampering charges because the testimony admitted as evidence of the conspiracy was unduly prejudicial to his defense to the witness tampering charges. He further claims that he was entitled to a mistrial because the court admitted evidence of the statements of a coconspirator that it later had to strike, and because of the spillover effect on the witness tampering convictions of \"bad acts\" evidence admitted on the conspiracy charge. Unconvinced by Freeman's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the facts of this odd case at the outset, adding detail below as it becomes necessary to the legal discussion. In 1991, Freeman became associated with the \"Golden Banana,\" a striptease nightclub located in Peabody, and the club's owner, Louis DiBella (DiBella). Freeman began frequenting the Golden Banana shortly after DiBella's son, Francis, was arrested on drug charges. Although Freeman was not an employee of the club, DiBella paid him approximately $100 in cash each week for almost four years. In addition, DiBella loaned Freeman money, gave him free alcoholic beverages at the club, allowed him to influence the hiring and firing of dancers, tolerated his frequent visits to the dancers' dressing room, generally off limits to men, and otherwise turned a blind eye to Freeman's erratic and sometimes violent behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, a federal grand jury began investigating potential violations of federal law at the Golden Banana involving, inter alia, members of the Peabody police department. During the investigation, Freeman approached fellow Peabody police officer Michael Ward and warned him to keep his \"mouth shut\" about \"anything that went on at the Golden Banana.\" Freeman also approached Amy Clarke, the master of ceremonies at the Golden Banana, telling her to \"keep the lip zipped\" and \"not to say anything about the Golden Banana.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury indicted Freeman on five counts. Count One alleged that Freeman conspired with DiBella to receive cash payments, no-interest loans, and free alcoholic beverages, in an attempt by DiBella \"to curry favor with him and to buy his silence about licensed premise violations which occurred at the Golden Banana\"--i.e., a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(B). See supra note 1. The grand jury also indicted Freeman on four counts of witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(2)(A) &amp; (b)(3): Count Two involved an unnamed Peabody police officer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Count Three involved Officer Ward, and Counts Four and Five involved Amy Clarke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opening statement at trial, the government outlined its conspiracy case. According to the government, DiBella would testify that, given the controversial nature of the Golden Banana's business, he needed to stay on the \"good side\" of the Peabody police lest they \"do things like influence his ability to retain the liquor license that he had at the Golden Banana.\" In addition, DiBella would testify that he feared that the Peabody police would \"take away his son,\" Francis, because of Francis's cocaine problem. Thus, the government expected DiBella to testify that he \"willingly\" entered into a \"corrupt relationship\" with Freeman, in which he \"agreed to pay bribes\" to Freeman and Freeman \"agreed to accept them.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial, before the government called DiBella to the stand, it presented the testimony of Deborah Drew, the daytime manager at the Golden Banana. Drew testified that DiBella told her he provided free alcoholic beverages to police officers to avoid \"beefs\" with the police, and that DiBella instructed her to call the Peabody police, not the state police, in the event of a licensing violation committed on the premises. Although the defense objected to this testimony as hearsay, the court provisionally admitted it under the hearsay exception for the statements of a coconspirator, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), promising that it would \"scrutinize it with care at the end of all the evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second day of trial, the government called DiBella as a witness. Although DiBella testified that he made regular cash payments to Freeman, he denied that Freeman had agreed to perform any favors on his behalf. Moreover, DiBella's testimony suggested that he provided benefits to Freeman because of his fear of Freeman rather than any willing agreement between the two. Following DiBella's testimony, the court warned the government that \"if Mr. DiBella is the chief witness, you're in deep serious trouble on the conspiracy count,\" suggesting that it did not think that the \"victim of extortion is a conspirator.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government neared the completion of its case in chief, Freeman moved for a judgment of acquittal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In ruling on the motion, the court also scrutinized the government's conspiracy evidence to determine whether it had properly allowed Drew to testify to DiBella's out-of-court statements on the first day of trial. The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a conspiracy to admit the hearsay statements of a coconspirator, but that there was sufficient evidence to deny the motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Court is not persuaded by a fair preponderance of the evidence, as I make findings of preliminary fact, that at any time there existed a conspiracy between Mr. Freeman and Mr. DiBella. That requires me to strike so much of the testimony of Ms. Drew as recounted things that Mr. DiBella had to say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think that wholly apart from anything I believe about the evidence, that there is enough evidence independent of Mr. DiBella... that a reasonable jury could find a conspiracy....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, I must deny the motion for a judgment of acquittal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman then moved for a mistrial, the court took the motion under advisement, and the government presented its final two witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government rested, Freeman renewed his motions for a judgment of acquittal and a mistrial. Again, the court denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal and left the motion for a mistrial under advisement. After concluding his defense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Freeman renewed his motions for a judgment of acquittal and a mistrial. The court denied both motions and submitted the conspiracy charge and three witness tampering charges to the jury. See supra note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury acquitted Freeman of the conspiracy charge and the witness tampering count involving officer Ward, but convicted him on the two counts of witness tampering involving Amy Clarke. After the verdict, Freeman moved for a new trial, citing the \"overwhelming capacity of evidence that was ostensibly admitted on one count which was the conspiracy[:] all this not very subtle character assassination, Freeman's a drinker, Freeman's going into the dressing rooms.\" According to Freeman, this evidence of \"bad acts,\" admitted for its relevance to the conspiracy count, substantially prejudiced his defense to the witness tampering charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied the motion for a new trial, concluding that \"the evidence that was improperly allowed is just too peripheral here\" (referring to Deborah Drew's hearsay account of DiBella's statements to her), and that \"the jury showed their independence and their ability to discern between counts\" by acquitting Freeman on two of the four counts. The court sentenced Freeman to four months' incarceration followed by twenty-four months of supervised release, the first four of those months in home confinement. The court also ordered Freeman to pay a $3,000 fine and a $200 special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman now appeals, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the two witness tampering counts. Alternatively, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for a mistrial and a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain convictions for witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(2)(A) &amp; (b)(3), the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Freeman (1) \"knowingly use[d] intimidation or physical force, threaten[ed], or corruptly persuad[ed]\" Amy Clarke, (2) intending to induce Clarke to \"withhold testimony,\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512. In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence of witness tampering, we must view the facts and witness credibility determinations, as well as draw reasonable inferences, in favor of the government. See United States v. Valle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196494\"><a href=\"/opinion/196494/united-states-v-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 216 (1st Cir. 1995). \"So long as the evidence, taken as a whole, warrants a judgment of conviction,\" the evidence is legally sufficient. United States v. Olbres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196204\"><a href=\"/opinion/196204/united-states-v-olbres/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 970 (1st Cir. 1995). Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence shows that Freeman made statements to Clarke on two occasions that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt were criminally culpable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman was aware that there was a federal investigation of activity at the Golden Banana. Based on the evidence presented by the government, the jury could infer that Freeman was also aware that his own conduct might subject him to criminal liability as a result of the investigation. Thus, Freeman had a motive to prevent potential witnesses from relaying damaging information to the government. Clarke testified that Freeman approached her at the Golden Banana and said, \"I hear you've been talking and the feds are around,\" and stated, \"remember, mum's the word.\" Later in the same conversation Freeman said, \"remember with the feds around talking, keep the lip zipped,\" drawing his finger across his lips in an accompanying gesture. Clarke testified that this exchange made her feel \"a little bit intimidated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of his motive to curtail the flow of information to the government, the jury could reasonably infer that Freeman selected language that he thought would intimidate, threaten, or corruptly persuade Clarke, and that Freeman did so intending to cause her to \"withhold testimony\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent the communication\" of information to the federal authorities investigating the Golden Banana. Although Freeman's words did not contain overt threats, a reasonable jury could infer that Freeman knew Clarke would be threatened by such words, given his status as a police officer and her first-hand knowledge of his erratic personality and violent temper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Freeman's statements to Clarke several weeks later at her house were sufficient to support a conviction on a second count of witness tampering. Freeman went to Clarke's house immediately following the appearance of a newspaper article about the Golden Banana that featured a front-page picture of Clarke. The jury could have inferred that Freeman went to her house at this time because the article had renewed his fear that Clarke was cooperating in the investigation. Freeman said to Clarke, \"the feds [are] coming down heavy,\" and warned her \"not to say anything about the Golden Banana.\" Clarke testified that this conversation made her feel \"intimidated,\" \"very uneasy,\" and \"awkward,\" and that she was so afraid of Freeman that she hid in the basement the next time he came to her house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Freeman's statements to Clarke, made in the context of a visit to her home shortly after the appearance of a newspaper article that Clarke had reason to believe had angered him, were sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that Freeman knowingly acted in a way designed to intimidate, threaten, or corruptly persuade Clarke, with the specific intent to cause her to \"withhold testimony\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent the communication\" of information to the federal authorities. See United States v. Shotts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73054\"><a href=\"/opinion/73054/united-states-v-shotts/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1301 (11th Cir. 1998) (finding defendant's statement to his secretary to \"just not say anything [to the FBI] and I wasn't going to be bothered\" sufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MOTION FOR A MISTRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial or a new trial for three reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> First, if the trial court had granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge as it should have, it would have realized that so much \"bad acts\" testimony had been admitted as evidence of the conspiracy that Freeman could not get a fair trial on the witness tampering charges. Second, the trial court had exacerbated the prejudicial effect of the conspiracy evidence by allowing the government to present the hearsay testimony of a coconspirator, only to strike that evidence once it determined that the government had failed to show the existence of a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. Third, even if the court properly submitted the conspiracy charge to the jury, the \"bad acts\" evidence admitted in support of that charge substantially prejudiced the jury's consideration of the witness tampering charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with any review of a denial of a motion for a mistrial, we consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the defendant has demonstrated the kind of \"clear\" prejudice that would render the court's denial of his motion for a mistrial a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" United States v. Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 1998).

Although Freeman's logic in pursuing this argument is not always clear, we divine this meaning in his claim. If a defendant in a trial involving multiple charges succeeds in obtaining a judgment of acquittal on some of the charges at the completion of the government's case, the defendant can argue that he cannot get a fair trial on the charges that remain in the case because of the evidence presented on the now dismissed charges, and hence he is entitled to a mistrial on the remaining charges. See United States v. McNatt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503434\"><a href=\"/opinion/503434/united-states-v-jack-mcnatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 565-66 (1st Cir. 1988); see also United States v.

Although Freeman was ultimately acquitted on the conspiracy charge, and therefore has no basis for challenging as a discrete issue on appeal the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on that charge, he argues that he should be able to make on appeal the same mistrial argument that would have been available to him if he had persuaded the court to dismiss the conspiracy charge at the completion of the government's case. That is, he should be able to argue that the denial of the mistrial request was erroneous because of the substantial prejudice created by the evidence that went to the jury in support of a conspiracy charge that should have been dismissed. Under the scenario in this case, the challenge to the judge's ruling on the motion for a judgment of acquittal, instead of being the basis for a discretely appealable issue, becomes the predicate for Freeman's first challenge to the trial court's ruling on the motion for a mistrial. See United States v. Guiliano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388315\"><a href=\"/opinion/388315/united-states-v-eugene-henry-guiliano/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 88-89 (2d Cir. 1981) (ordering a retrial on a bankruptcy fraud count, even though the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, because it reversed on appeal a RICO conviction and concluded that there was a \"distinct risk that the jury was influenced in its disposition of [the bankruptcy fraud] count by improper evidence and by the allegations of the RICO count\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept the theory of Freeman's appeal on this mistrial issue.

See 2 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Criminal 2d &#167; 466, at 654 (West 1982). Freeman argued that the government's evidence, especially DiBella's testimony that he was motivated by fear rather than by an agreement with Freeman, indicated that Freeman was guilty if at all of extortion, an offense not charged by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the evidence presented by the government arguably would have lent more support to a charge of extortion than a charge of conspiracy, the evidence was sufficient to submit the conspiracy charge to the jury. To prove a conspiracy, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the \"defendant and one or more coconspirators intended to agree and... to commit the substantive criminal offense which was the object of their unlawful agreement.\" United States v. Tejeda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590212\"><a href=\"/opinion/590212/united-states-v-john-tejeda-united-states-of-america-v-paul-christian/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir. 1992) (alteration in original). Here, the \"substantive criminal offense\" charged was a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a)(1)(B), which prohibits an agent of a local government, like a police officer, from \"corruptly solicit[ing] or demand[ing] for the benefit of any person, or accept[ing] or agree[ing] to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\" Stated in terms of the government's theory of the case, the government needed to prove that Freeman and DiBella entered into an agreement in which Freeman would \"accept or agree to accept\" valuable benefits from DiBella, including cash payoffs, loans, and special treatment at the Golden Banana, intending to be \"influenced or rewarded\" for helping DiBella and his son avoid trouble with the Peabody police or the Peabody officials who oversee the Golden Banana's license to sell liquor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence to support the government's conspiracy theory. First, the evidence showed that Freeman received \"something of value\" from DiBella in the form of money payments and special treatment at the Golden Banana. DiBella paid Freeman approximately $100 per week in cash for almost four years, and loaned money to Freeman's brother and to one of Freeman's friends--money that was never repaid. Freeman drank for free at the Golden Banana, spent time in the dancers' dressing room, a location generally off limits to men, and enjoyed influence over DiBella's decisions to hire and fire particular dancers. DiBella continued to tolerate Freeman's presence at the club despite Freeman's erratic and sometimes violent behavior. Amy Clarke testified that Freeman would become \"belligerent\" when she asked him to leave the dancers' dressing room. Similarly, Thomas LeGault, the night manager at the Golden Banana, testified that on one occasion, when he asked Freeman to leave the dressing room, Freeman said, \"I'll cut fucking LeGault's throat with a bottle,\" and threw a chair at the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the cash payments, loans, and other special treatment that DiBella bestowed upon Freeman were not given in consideration for any legitimate work that Freeman performed on DiBella's behalf. During the relevant time, Freeman was not working as a security guard or in any other capacity at the club. Indeed, several witnesses testified that Freeman was usually drinking at the club and was often seen intoxicated. These facts cast doubt on Freeman's defense, advanced mainly through cross-examination and in his closing argument, that he was somehow performing surreptitious security duties for DiBella.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there was some evidence that Freeman obtained the cash payments, loans, and special treatment \"intending to be influenced or rewarded\" for his help in insulating the Golden Banana and Francis DiBella from trouble with local police and city officials. That Freeman began to patronize the club regularly only after Francis's arrest on drug charges might suggest that Freeman, who worked in the area of narcotics, viewed the arrest as an opportunity to trade his influence as a police officer for favors. Deborah Drew testified that shortly before Francis was arrested, Freeman said to her that DiBella \"shouldn't fuck with him... [and that] because of the things that Frankie [Francis] was doing, that he [Freeman] could close the club.\" Francis DiBella testified that Freeman warned him that he was on the \"top of the [DEA's] list,\" but that Freeman \"would take care of it and [Francis] would have no problems.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman argues that the testimony of DiBella, who was the government's star witness, fatally undermined the government's conspiracy case, requiring a judgment of acquittal. When asked why he made cash payments to Freeman, DiBella responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why? Because I, you know, every time you talk to him it was drugs, drugs, drugs. And your son is on the top of the DEA list. And, you know, they're watching him and you got to be careful, because the City of Peabody is looking to shut you down, they want to take your license away from you. And the least little excuse they get, they'll take it away from you. So, he had me in a, like in a fearful, like something that you grow up in the North End with all the wise guys looking down your throat. If you're making a dollar, they want part of that dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiBella also testified that Freeman never so much as \"fixed an overdue library card\" on his behalf. Asked whether he \"ever agreed with Sergeant Freeman to have him turn his back on licensing violations,\" DiBella answered, \"I never agreed to anything like that.\" Freeman insists that DiBella's testimony conclusively establishes that DiBella never voluntarily agreed to trade benefits with Freeman in return for favors, but rather that DiBella was \"shaken down,\" the victim of extortion. This, according to Freeman, foreclosed a conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court disagreed and so do we. Although DiBella denied that he entered into an agreement with Freeman, the jury was entitled to disregard DiBella's testimony on this point and draw opposing inferences from DiBella's course of conduct and the testimony of other witnesses. It is elementary that the agreement necessary to support a conspiracy conviction can \"be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case.\" Ianelli v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109225\"><a href=\"/opinion/109225/iannelli-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 778 n.10 (1975). \"[T]he agreement may be express or tacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\" United States v.

Moreover, although DiBella may have been afraid of Freeman, \"a generalized fear of harm\" is no defense to a conspiracy charge. United States v. Alzanki, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196113\"><a href=\"/opinion/196113/united-states-v-alzanki/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 1003 (1st Cir. 1995). Evidence precluding the inference of an agreement would have to show that the duress to which DiBella was subject was \"enough to overbear [his] will and make his participation in the conspiracy involuntary.\" Slater v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349211\"><a href=\"/opinion/349211/james-slater-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir. 1976). While there is some evidence that Freeman acted in a generally threatening manner toward DiBella, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the threats were not so coercive as to \"overbear\" DiBella's will. DiBella was a seasoned businessman<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and the owner of a controversial adult entertainment business, as well as an admitted felon who pled guilty to lying on his federal income taxes for many years. A reasonable trier of fact may well have questioned DiBella's credibility and doubted whether DiBella could have been easily scared into making payoffs to Freeman without getting anything in return. Alternatively, the jury might have concluded that DiBella testified as he did in a self-serving attempt to deny his own participation in the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Freeman's entreaties, our conclusion upholding the trial court's denial of Freeman's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge is not altered by the fact that the trial court simultaneously concluded that the government produced insufficient evidence of a conspiracy to invoke the hearsay exception for statements made by a coconspirator. Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d) provides in relevant part that a \"statement is not hearsay if... (2) [t]he statement is offered against a party and is... (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" The rules further provide that qualification for the Rule 801 hearsay exception is to be \"determined by the court.\" Fed.

Petrozziello, we specified that the court, in making this determination, must adhere to the ordinary civil standard of proof, allowing the testimony \"if it is more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy... and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 1977); see also United States v.

We have also stated that a trial court's own evaluation of the evidence for the purposes of an evidentiary ruling does not preclude it from concluding that the jury might view the evidence differently. See United States v. Pitochelli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495223\"><a href=\"/opinion/495223/united-states-v-ronald-j-pitocchelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 403 (1st Cir. 1987).Our trial system makes a sharp distinction between functions: the judge is \"not a thirteenth juror, much less [is] he a super-juror whose views of credibility could override the jury's verdict.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495223\"><a href=\"/opinion/495223/united-states-v-ronald-j-pitocchelli/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Accordingly, although </a></span>in a Petrozziello ruling the court can make credibility assessments and draw inferences from the facts, it must take the evidence in the light most favorable to the government in ruling on a motion for a judgment of acquittal. It is not inconsistent for a court to conclude, therefore, based on its own inferences and credibility assessments, that it is more likely than not that no conspiracy existed, while, at the same time, concluding that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, would permit a rational juror to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Freeman's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charges.

This approach is consistent with the law of this circuit which provides that \"[h]earsay evidence may be admitted provisionally, subject to the trial court's final Petrozziello determination, which should be made 'at the close of all the evidence.'\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761694\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Portela,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/761694/united-states-v-rafael-portela-united-states-of-america-v-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">702-03</span> </a></span>(quoting United States v.

When a court ultimately concludes that hearsay evidence provisionally admitted does not meet the Petrozziello standards, the court must \"give a cautionary instruction to the jury, or, upon an appropriate motion, declare a mistrial if the instruction will not suffice to cure any prejudice.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381348\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ciampaglia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/381348/united-states-v-paul-ciampaglia-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>. The court gave a cautionary instruction. We conclude that it sufficed to cure the effect of Drew's hearsay testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deborah Drew testified that DiBella told her that he provided free alcohol to police officers to prevent the police from \"causing beefs\" for the club, and that DiBella instructed her to contact the local police rather than the state police if there were any licensing violation problems. Later in the trial, after DiBella testified that there was no agreement with Freeman, the court became more reluctant to admit hearsay statements made by DiBella under the coconspirator exception. The court sustained objections to Philip Freeman, the defendant's brother, and to Amy Clarke, testifying to out-of-court statements made by DiBella. The prosecution protested the ruling with respect to Amy Clarke, prompting an admonition from the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understand that by pressing this, even if there is sufficient evidence to get to the jury on conspiracy under [Fed. R. Evid.] 104(a), I have to be persuaded by a fair preponderance of the evidence that there was a conspiracy. That's a different standard. It's not a standard that gives you all the breaks. It's the standard do I think these people were conspiring. If I do, fine. But if I don't we have to strike it out. Since you cannot unring the bell, what we're faced with is a motion for mistrial....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this admonition, the government abandoned its strategy of questioning Clarke about DiBella's statements. As it turned out, that was a wise decision by the government because it meant that, other than the testimony of Drew, no hearsay testimony was provisionally admitted under the hearsay exception for statements of a coconspirator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government's case in chief came to a close, the court made its Petrozziello ruling: \"[T]he Court is not persuaded by a fair preponderance of the evidence, as I make findings of preliminary fact, that at any time there existed a conspiracy between Mr. Freeman and Mr. DiBella. That requires me to strike so much of the testimony of Ms. Drew as recounted things that Mr. DiBella had to say.\" The trial court then instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I let you hear what Ms. Drew had to say about what Mr. DiBella said to her about certain things. And now having thought about it, and it's my responsibility, I must strike out that part of the testimony. What Ms. Drew said the older DiBella said to her, that's just out of the case.... Disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Striking the evidence and issuing this curative instruction were sufficient to shield Freeman from prejudice caused by the provisional admission of Drew's hearsay testimony. Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions. See United States v. Magana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197561\"><a href=\"/opinion/197561/united-states-v-magana/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1997). Even assuming that the jurors wrongly considered the stricken testimony, Drew's hearsay testimony had scant relevance to the witness tampering charges of which Freeman was convicted, and their provisional admission was not likely to have had any significant prejudicial impact on the jury's evaluation of the witness tampering charges. Moreover, Drew's brief hearsay testimony occurred in a trial that lasted seven days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the minimal hearsay testimony provisionally admitted under the coconspirator exception, the peripheral impact, if any, of such testimony on the witness tampering offenses of which Freeman was convicted, and the trial court's clear instructions to the jury to disregard the testimony, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Freeman's request for a mistrial on the basis of this provisionally admitted hearsay testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Spillover Effect</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In urging this third ground for a mistrial, Freeman laments that \"by the close of evidence, the government had characterized [him] as a drunk, a violent man, a shakedown artist, a philanderer, an adulterer, and a rouge [sic] cop, and an all-around low life,\" and he complains that \"the conspiracy charge was the vehicle for the admission of this evidence.\" Since we have concluded that the conspiracy charge was properly submitted to the jury, it follows that the jury was entitled to hear the evidence relevant to that charge. The evidence of Freeman's \"bad acts\" at the Golden Banana--excessive drinking, invading the dancers' dressing room, erupting in fits of violence--was relevant to the conspiracy charge because it showed that Freeman received special treatment at the nightclub: that is, that DiBella and his employees allowed Freeman to behave in a manner that would never have been tolerated if Freeman were an ordinary patron. That was the object of the unlawful agreement for which Freeman was charged i.e., to receive things of value, including special treatment at the nightclub, in exchange for favors provided to DiBella.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the \"bad acts\" evidence admitted for its relevance to the conspiracy charge may have had a spillover effect on the witness tampering charges. This potential exists whenever multiple counts or defendants are joined in a single trial. Because the witness tampering offenses grew out of an attempt to cover up the conspiracy scheme, however, there is no doubt that the two offenses were properly joined. See, e.g., United States v.

R. Evid. 404(b). The evidence of Freeman's bad conduct at the Golden Banana was relevant to show that Freeman was aware of the criminal nature of his underlying conduct--whether characterized as conspiracy or extortion--which created a motive for witness tampering.

John Carney, a captain in the Marblehead Police Department, and Robert Marron, a Peabody police officer, were each called by the defense to impeach the credibility of Officer Ward. (The court found Marron's testimony inadmissible.) Robert Russell, a Peabody police detective, testified that DiBella had spoken favorably of Freeman and that Francis DiBella had told him that the federal authorities were trying to get his father to say that he had paid Freeman off. Freeman did not testify on his own behalf.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Because Freeman's motion for a new trial is not based upon grounds arising subsequent to judgment, the appeal is from the judgment, with the denial of his motions for a mistrial and a new trial being assigned as an error in the judgment. See 2 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Criminal 2d &#167; 559, at 367 (West 1982 &amp; 1999 Supp.); Gray v.

Squeezing money out of people. But that's not one of the crimes charged here. That's a crime. That's extortion.

Now, extortion is when someone pays money under a fear that if they do not pay the money that something will be done to them. If you believe evidence that the conduct here took place and the payments took place, and they took place because if they were not taking place, given Mr. Freeman's conduct, what was going on in Mr. DiBella's mind was that Mr. Freeman would trump up a charge, he would fabricate a charge, and that would injure the business. That's not the conspiracy that's being charged here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  We note that Freeman neither opposed joinder nor moved to sever the conspiracy and witness tampering counts.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
