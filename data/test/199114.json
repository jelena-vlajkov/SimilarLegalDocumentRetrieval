Graves, Jr. and Desai & Graves on brief for\nappellant.\n          Joan E. Smiley, Office of Immigration Litigation, Civil\nDivision, Department of Justice, David W. Ogden, Acting Assistant\nAttorney General, Civil Division, and Karen Fletcher Torstenson,\nAssistant Director, Civil Division, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          October 6, 2000\n\f-2-\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        Petitioner seeks review of an\n\norder of deportation that was based on a finding that his\n\nconviction of violating M.G.L. c. 90 ยง 24B constituted a crime\n\nof moral turpitude.       See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101 (Supp. 1997).        That\n\nsection    of   the    Massachusetts    criminal   law   is   entitled:\n\n\"Stealing, forging, or other falsification of learner's permit,\n\noperator's license, certificate of registration or inspection\n\nsticker;    use   or    possession;      penalties;   suspension   and\n\nreinstatement of license or right to operate motor vehicle.\"\n\n           We have jurisdiction to review whether the conviction\n\nis for a criminal offense which constitutes a crime of moral\n\nturpitude, as the INS concedes.        See Maghsoudi v. INS, 181 F.3d\n\n8, 13 n.12 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Sousa v. INS, No. 99-2049,\n\nslip op. at 4-5 (1st Cir. Sep. 2, 2000).        As we noted in Nguyen\n\nv. Reno, 211 F. 3d 692 (1st Cir. 2000), the statutory term\n\n\"crime of moral turpitude\" is generally understood to mean:\n\n           conduct . . . contrary to the accepted rules of\n           morality and the duties owed between persons or to\n           society in general . . . . an act which is per se\n           morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong.\n\nId. at 695.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          The question here is not whether a particular crime is\n\na crime of moral turpitude. Rather, the question is whether the\n\nconviction under M.G.L. c. 90 ยง 24B, a statute which encompasses\n\na number of offenses, was for mere possession of a fraudulent\n\ndriver's license or whether it was for use of a fraudulent\n\ndriver's license.   The BIA has held that use of a fraudulent\n\ndriver's license is a crime of moral turpitude.1    See Matter of\n\nSerna, 20 I. & N. Dec. 579 (BIA l992); cf. Zaitona v. INS, 9\n\nF.3d 432, 437-438 (6th Cir. 1993).    The Immigration Judge here\n\nfound that the offense was for use of a fraudulent license.   The\n\nBIA affirmed.   See In re Montero-Ubri, No. A44-877-524-Boston\n\n(BIA Jan. 12, 2000).\n\n          Petitioner launches a two-fold attack.     He says the\n\nagency is precluded as a matter of law from relying on the\n\ndocuments and information it did and that in any event those\n\ndocuments and information do not establish \"use,\" but only\n\n\"possession.\"\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Montero-Ubri argues that not all \"uses\" are crimes of moral\nturpitude, and that there should be some inquiry into how the fake\nlicense was used. That argument is antithetical to his primary\nargument that the agency cannot look beyond the categories in the\nstatute.\n\n                               -4-\n\f         The    agency   has   said    it   will   not   look   into   the\n\nunderlying facts of the particular crime, but will focus first\n\non the statute of conviction.          See Matter of Ajami, Interim\n\nDecision 3405 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Short; 20 I. & N.\n\nDec. 136 (BIA 1989).     If the statute of conviction, as here,\n\nincludes both crimes of moral turpitude and others, then the\n\nagency may look to the indictment, the charging papers, the\n\nconviction documents, and the like to see which type of crime\n\nwas involved.   Ajami, Interim Decision 3405.\n\n         Here, the focus was on exactly those documents.                The\n\nsentencing document shows petitioner pled guilty to \"using\" a\n\nfalse motor vehicle document.         That document shows that there\n\nwere related charges, continued without a finding, for illegally\n\noperating a motor vehicle without being duly licensed.                 From\n\nthis, the IJ drew the quite sensible conclusion that petitioner\n\nhad used a false license in connection with operating the car.\n\nThe attempt at deceit is inherent in this act.              There is no\n\nbasis to fault this factual conclusion.\n\n         Petitioner's other argument is that because he was\n\nnever convicted of those of the charged crimes which were\n\ncontinued without a finding, and per force these non-convictions\n\n                                 -5-\n\fwere not the basis of the deportation order, there was error in\n\nconsidering this information.     There was no error.     The push in\n\nthe law toward categorical approaches to classifying crimes as\n\neither involving moral turpitude or not is largely based on the\n\npolicy of not retrying prior criminal convictions in later\n\ndeportation hearings. Cf. United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139,\n\n145-46 (1997).       No such interest is served by precluding\n\nconsideration of basic facts stated on the official court\n\nrecords   of   the   charging   and    conviction   documents.   The\n\ncategorical approach does not require that blinders be worn.\n\n          The petition for review is dismissed and the stay of\n\ndeportation is lifted.    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
