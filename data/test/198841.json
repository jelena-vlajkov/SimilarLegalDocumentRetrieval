Before the Court are appeals following\n\nthe conviction and sentencing of defendants-appellants Hui Lin, Nai\n\nFook Li, Yiu Ming Kwan, Ju Lin, Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, and Ben Lin (the\n\n“appellants”). In an en banc opinion issued today, we rejected several\n\narguments three of the appellants raised concerning their purported\n\nrights under two international treaties. In this panel opinion, we\n\naddress the balance of all of the appellants' claims. We reject their\n\nchallenges, and affirm the convictions and sentences.\n\n          We adopt in full, and reference herein, the facts and\n\nprocedural history as recited in the companion en banc opinion\n\nmentioned above.    Put very briefly, the appellants engaged in a\n\nconspiracy to smuggle nationals of the People's Republic of China\n\n(“China”) into the United States on a ship called the XING DA. Hui\n\nLin, Yiu Ming Kwan, and Nai Fook Li (the “land-based defendants”)\n\noperating out of the United States, met with various law enforcement\n\npersonnel, including Immigration and Naturalization Service Special\n\nAgent Michael Rendon and Coast Guard Agent Rick Cox. Rendon, Cox, and\n\ntheir associates posed as fishermen who owned a boat on which they were\n\nwilling to transport the aliens during the final leg of their journey\n\nfrom China. The land-based defendants negotiated with the agents and\n\nacted as liaisons between the agents and the remaining appellants.\n\nMeanwhile, Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, Ju Lin, and Ben Lin (the “shipboard\n\ndefendants”) organized the XING DA's trip from China and traveled\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\faboard the vessel as it progressed toward the rendezvous with the\n\nagents' boat. It appears that Ju Lin was, in the words of the XING DA\n\npassengers, “the boss,” that Ben Lin piloted the ship, and that Mao\n\nBing Mu and Sang Li, among others, acted as “enforcers” to keep the\n\naliens under control during the long trip. Before its rendezvous with\n\nthe agents' boat, the XING DA was intercepted and boarded by officers\n\nof the United States Coast Guard.\n\n                             Discussion\n\n          In this opinion, we address various evidentiary and\n\nsentencing issues raised by the appellants. We reject each challenge.\n\nI.        Denial of Appellant Ben Lin's Motion to Suppress Evidence of\n          His Conduct Tending to Demonstrate That He Was the Captain\n          of the Ship\n\n          Ben Lin argues that the district court erred in refusing to\n\nsuppress evidence that he went to the bridge of the ship and reduced\n\nthe speed of the XING DA in response to a request by the Coast Guard\n\nboarding team. He claims that this action constituted a non-Mirandized\n\ncommunicative act in response to custodial interrogation and therefore\n\nshould have been suppressed under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436\n\n(1966).\n\n          It is well established that Miranda warnings must be\n\ncommunicated to a suspect before he is subjected to \"custodial\n\ninterrogation.\" See United States v. Ventura, 85 F.3d 708, 710 (1st\n\nCir. 1996). A \"custodial situation necessitating Miranda warnings\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\farises . . . where 'there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of\n\nmovement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.'\" United\n\nStates v. Masse, 816 F.2d 805, 809 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting California\n\nv. Beheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1125 (1983)). The term “interrogation”\n\nencompasses not only express questioning but also \"any words or actions\n\non the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to\n\narrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely\n\nto elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\" Rhode Island v.\n\nInnis, 446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980) (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n          We do not agree that the Coast Guard's request that the XING\n\nDA's crew slow the ship for further boarding can be construed as a\n\ncustodial interrogation under Miranda. First, notwithstanding any\n\nsuspicion that the XING DA was smuggling aliens into the United States,\n\nthe Coast Guard's routine stop, boarding, and inspection of a vessel on\n\nthe high seas is not considered “custodial.” See United States v.\n\nMagdaniel-Mora, 746 F.2d 715, 723 (11th Cir. 1984); United States v.\n\nGray, 659 F.2d 1296, 1301 (5th Cir. 1981). The \"custody\" determination\n\nemploys an objective test; the only relevant inquiry is how a\n\nreasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his\n\nsituation. See Ventura, 85 F.3d at 711. By all accounts, the XING DA\n\ncrew consented to the Coast Guard's boarding. The request that the\n\ncrew slow the ship -- to which Ben Lin responded -- was made during the\n\nopening moments of this boarding. No arrests had been made at that\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpoint, and no accusations of smuggling had been leveled. The officers\n\nhad merely commenced a routine safety inspection and obtained a copy of\n\nthe ship's registration papers. Moreover, although the crew members\n\nwere gathered in one section of the ship during the inspection, it\n\nappears that the Coast Guard had neither applied nor threatened any\n\nforce.   Thus, at the time Ben Lin engaged in the putatively\n\ncommunicative behavior at issue, the boarding and inspection had not\n\nyet risen to the level of a \"formal arrest or restraint on freedom of\n\nmovement of the degree associated with formal arrest.\" Stansbury v.\n\nCalifornia, 511 U.S. 318, 322 (1994); see also United States v.\n\nRioseco, 845 F.2d 299, 303 (11th Cir. 1988) (holding that the appellant\n\nwas not in \"custody\" during an initial boarding, despite the existence\n\nof probable cause to arrest, because the appellant was not told he was\n\nunder arrest and because the Coast Guard merely engaged in a routine\n\nboarding and inspection procedure in gathering the crew to one area of\n\nthe ship).\n\n          Further, even if appellant had been in \"custody\" for Miranda\n\npurposes, we cannot describe Officer Hilbert's request to slow the ship\n\nas \"interrogation.\" The simple request to slow the ship was not a\n\nremark that Officer Hilbert should have known was reasonably likely to\n\nelicit an incriminating response. Rather, the request appears to be of\n\nthe type that would normally attend a nautical arrest. Communications\n\nthat are \"normally attendant to arrest and custody\" are not\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f“interrogation” as the word is understood by Miranda. Innis, 446 U.S.\n\nat 301.\n\n          For all of these reasons, we reject Ben Lin's challenge to\n\nthe district court's denial of his motion to suppress.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fII.       Admission of Evidence of the Conditions On Board the Ship\n          and the Treatment of the Passengers on the Vessel\n\n          Appellants Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, and Ben Lin next argue that\n\nthe district court erred in allowing the government to present evidence\n\nconcerning the conditions aboard the XING DA, the deprivations suffered\n\nby the alien passengers, and the harsh treatment of those passengers.\n\nThey contend that this evidence should have been excluded under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. Rule 403 because its probative value was substantially outweighed\n\nby the risk of unfair prejudice. The district court found that the\n\ntestimony's probative value exceeded any prejudicial impact.\n\nAdmissibility determinations under Rule 403 are committed to the trial\n\ncourt's sound discretion, see United States v. Rodríguez-Estrada, 877\n\nF.2d 153, 155 (1st Cir. 1989), and we review only for an abuse of that\n\ndiscretion, see United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d 796, 801\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).    We find no such abuse here.\n\n          Appellants refer to the graphic testimony of the filthy\n\nconditions prevailing in the hold of the ship, the lack of adequate\n\nsafety devices on board, and the beatings suffered by the passengers,\n\narguing that this evidence was not relevant to any issues to be\n\ndetermined by the jury and that, even if relevant, it was so unfairly\n\nprejudicial that it should have been excluded.          We agree with\n\nappellants that this evidence was prejudicial in that it had the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fpotential to inflame the jury against those who created and controlled\n\nthis inhumane environment.\n\n          The government responds first that in order to present proof\n\nthat the criminal enterprise was conducted “for profit,” it needed to\n\nestablish not only the price paid by the aliens for the 54-day voyage,\n\nbut also the trip's minimal costs to the coconspirators. Those costs,\n\nthe government argues, were best evidenced by the XING DA's shoddy\n\nconditions, meager provisions, and inadequate safety measures. Second,\n\nthe government argues that Mao Bing Mu and Sang Li served as\n\n\"enforcers\" over the aliens and that, without evidence of the beatings,\n\nthe government would not have been able to prove their participation in\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n          We agree that this evidence was probative to material issues\n\nto be determined by the jury, notwithstanding its prejudicial nature.\n\nIn their brief, appellants admit that the evidence of beatings was\n\nrelevant to the roles of Mao Bing Mu and Sang Li.1 In fact, it appears\n\n1Although appellants concede the relevance of the beatings, they\ncomplain that the evidence of the \"continuing effects of the beatings\"\non the victims went far beyond that which was relevant to the role\nissue. However, the government correctly notes that it did not elicit\nany such \"continuing effects\" testimony; appellants did. Chou Lee Li\ntestified on direct examination by the government only that he \"felt\npain all over\" immediately after the beating. It was Ben Lin's counsel\nwho, on cross-examination of Chou Lee Li, introduced Agent Rendon's\nnotes from the Guantanamo Bay interviews, which recounted Li's\nstatement that he still suffered pain from the beating. Sang Li's\ncounsel then offered this statement into evidence. Having brought that\nevidence out at trial, defendants may not now complain it was error to\nhave let them do so.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthat the evidence of the beatings was the only evidence offered that\n\nwas relevant to this question.     As for the evidence of shipboard\n\nconditions, evidence of the substantial price paid for passage to the\n\nUnited States goes a long way towards proving profit, but it does not\n\nconclusively prove the issue without some showing of the costs of the\n\nvoyage.   Thus, evidence regarding the inadequacy of the vessel,\n\nincluding its physical limitations and spartan provisions, was very\n\nprobative to this element of the offense.\n\n          Having found that the evidence at issue was both prejudicial\n\nand probative, we must balance these findings in making a Rule 403\n\ndetermination.    The district court is granted \"especially wide\n\nlatitude\" in Rule 403 balancing. See United States v. Rivera, 83 F.3d\n\n542, 545 (1st Cir. 1996). \"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate\n\nrecord, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the\n\nrelative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v.\n\nPackage Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988); see also United\n\nStates v. Tutiven, 40 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing Freeman in\n\nupholding an admissibility determination), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1031\n\n(1995). The legal standard is also somewhat weighted in favor of\n\nadmissibility. In order to be excluded, the evidence must be not only\n\nbe prejudicial, but unfairly prejudicial, and must not only outweigh\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fprobative value, but substantially outweigh probative value. See\n\nRivera, 83 F.3d at 545.\n\n          Based on this deferential standard, we cannot find that the\n\ndistrict court committed reversible error in admitting the evidence at\n\nissue. While the evidence certainly had a potential for prejudice, it\n\nwas also highly relevant to issues before the jury. This case simply\n\ndoes not present the type of \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\"\n\nthat would warrant our upsetting the balance already struck by the\n\ndistrict court. We thus accord deference to the district court's Rule\n\n403 determination.\n\nIII.      Upward Departure Based Upon the Condition of the Vessel and\n          the Treatment of the Passengers Aboard the Vessel\n\n          Appellants Nai Fook Li, Yiu Ming Kwan, Ju Lin, and Hui Lin\n\nnext argue that the district court erred in imposing an upward\n\ndeparture from the sentencing guidelines due to the conditions on board\n\nthe vessel and the treatment of the aliens.      At each appellant's\n\nsentencing hearing, the court imposed an upward departure pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.1, Application Note 5, which states that \"[i]f the\n\noffense involved dangerous or inhumane treatment, death or bodily\n\ninjury, possession of a dangerous weapon, or substantially more than\n\n100 aliens, an upward departure may be warranted.\" The court found by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that each of these four disjunctive\n\nconditions existed in this case, based on specific findings of (1)\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\finadequate food and water; (2) corporal punishment; (3) bodily injury\n\nand threats of serious bodily injury; (4) degrading conditions and\n\nconfinement in the hold of the ship; (5) inadequate safety measures on\n\nthe ship; (6) possession of numerous weapons; and (7) involvement of\n\nmore than 100 aliens. With respect to appellants Hui Lin and Nai Fook\n\nLi, the court also supported the decision to depart upward by invoking\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K2.8, which authorizes a departure when the defendant's\n\nconduct was \"unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the\n\nvictim.\"\n\n           The four appellants argue that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that the conditions on board the XING DA were reasonably\n\nforeseeable to them. In so arguing, appellants recognize that, in the\n\ncase of a jointly undertaken criminal activity such as a conspiracy,\n\neach of them is responsible for all of the reasonably foreseeable acts\n\nand omissions of others in furtherance of the conspiracy. See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).2\n\n\n\n\n2Sentencing Guideline § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) does not expressly apply to the\nupward departure under Application Note 5 to § 2L1.1. It expressly\napplies to determinations of the base offense level, specific offense\ncharacteristics, Chapter Two cross-references, or Chapter Three\nadjustments. However, appellants do not object to the district court's\nuse of the \"reasonably foreseeable conduct\" principle in applying these\nupward departures; they actually agree with it. Because we conclude\nthat the conditions aboard the XING DA were foreseeable to these\nappellants, we need not determine whether foreseeability was required\nor not. We will assume arguendo, without holding as much, that\nforeseeability was required.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          We review departures for abuse of discretion. See Koon v.\n\nUnited States, 518 U.S. 81 (1996); United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d\n\n22, 25 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1543 (1998). However,\n\nfactual findings at sentencing must satisfy only a preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard, see United States v. Blanco, 888 F.2d 907, 909 (1st\n\nCir. 1989), and we review those findings only for clear error, see\n\nUnited States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989). Because\n\neach appellant challenges factual findings regarding his participation\n\nin, knowledge of, or ability to have foreseen the inhumane treatment\n\nand conditions aboard the XING DA, it is this latter standard that\n\napplies here, at least for Ju Lin, Nai Fook Li, and Yiu Ming Kwan, who\n\nhave preserved this issue for appeal. Because Hui Lin did not object\n\nto this upward departure at his sentencing hearing, we review his\n\narguments on this issue only for plain error. See United States v.\n\nForbes, 16 F.3d 1294, 1300 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          A.   Hui Lin\n\n          Hui Lin argues that there has been no showing that he\n\nanticipated or should have anticipated the actions of the crew or the\n\nconditions aboard the XING DA.3 He argues that he was not on the ship\n\n\n\n3This position is at odds with the position Hui Lin's counsel took at\nsentencing, where he argued first that \"it was foreseeable that much of\nthis conduct could happen aboard the vessel,\" and second that Hui Lin\nand Yiu Ming Kwan did not know that the crew members were \"going to go\ncrazy and do the kind of stuff they did,\" but that they \"should have\nforeseen it.\"\n\n                                 -14-\n\fand did not communicate with the ship during the voyage.       He also\n\nargues that there was no evidence that he ever ordered or encouraged\n\nthe use of force or the deprivations suffered by the passengers.\n\n          Hui Lin's argument is unavailing, especially under the\n\napplicable \"plain error\" standard. The facts (even if true) that he\n\nwas not on the ship, did not communicate with the ship, and did not\n\norder the actions or conditions aboard the ship, do not require the\n\nconclusion that Hui Lin could not have known about or at least foreseen\n\nthe crew's actions or the ship's conditions. Several factors noted by\n\nthe government support the opposite conclusion. First, Hui Lin's\n\nplanning and negotiation demonstrated that he was clearly in charge of\n\nthe stateside portion of the smuggling conspiracy. Second, his concern\n\nwith finances during the negotiations supports the inference that he\n\nunderstood the importance of frugality with respect to all aspects of\n\nthe conspiracy.    Third, Hui Lin knew of the inadequacy of the\n\noffloading vessel, but arranged for the aliens to be transported into\n\nthe United States on that vessel anyway. When it was pointed out that\n\nthe conditions aboard the fishing vessel would be less than ideal, Hui\n\nLin stated that the aliens would simply have to sit below deck and stay\n\nawake for two days. Fourth, Hui Lin knew that seven or eight enforcers\n\nwould control the aliens on both the XING DA and the offloading vessel.\n\nWe agree with the government that there was little need to provide for\n\nenforcers on such a voyage unless the negotiating appellants knew that\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fthe conditions were likely to provoke unrest. Finally, Hui Lin was\n\npresent when Nai Fook Li told Agent Rendon that the offloading vessel\n\nneed not have enough life jackets for the passengers.\n\n          From these facts, the district court could properly have\n\nfound that Hui Lin either knew of or could have foreseen the crew's\n\nactions or the dangerous and inhumane conditions aboard the XING DA.\n\nEven if we assume that Hui Lin did not have full knowledge of the\n\nmanner in which the aliens would be treated, the conversations with the\n\nundercover agents demonstrate that he could have and should have\n\nforeseen many of the conditions, deprivations, and abuses suffered by\n\nthe unfortunate passengers. Thus, the upward departure was not plain\n\nerror.\n\n          B.   Ju Lin\n\n          Ju Lin offers the weakest argument on this issue.         He\n\ncontends that it was not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nhe controlled or caused the inhumane conditions. We note first that\n\nsuch direct control or causation of the conditions is not required. As\n\ndiscussed above, Ju Lin is responsible for the conditions created by\n\nhis fellow co-conspirators so long as those conditions were reasonably\n\nforeseeable to him.     See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).4\n\n          Although Ju Lin is correct that there is no evidence that he\n\ncaused or controlled the food and water deprivations or unsanitary\n\n4See note 2, supra.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fconditions on the XING DA, there was sufficient evidence to support the\n\ninference that Ju Lin could have foreseen that such conditions would\n\nexist. The XING DA was at sea for approximately fifty-four days.\n\nWhen, upon boarding the XING DA, Coast Guard Officer Patrick Hilbert\n\nasked who was in charge, Ju Lin identified himself as the master of the\n\nship. Indeed, Ju Lin was called \"the boss\" by others on the ship. It\n\nis quite unlikely that the ship's “boss” would not know of or suspect\n\nthe unsanitary conditions, safety violations, food deprivations, or\n\nincidents of violence during its nearly two-month-long voyage.\n\n          In any event, there was also compelling evidence of Ju Lin's\n\ndirect participation in abusing the emigrants.        The court heard\n\ntestimony that Ju Lin personally beat one passenger with a thick wooden\n\nstick and personally kicked another as he lay on the deck.        This\n\nevidence alone is sufficient to support a finding that Ju Lin's offense\n\ninvolved dangerous or inhumane treatment, bodily injury, and possession\n\nof a dangerous weapon. Moreover, during both beatings, another crew\n\nmember told the victim that he was being beaten for stealing food or\n\nwater. This strongly suggests that Ju Lin knew of the deprivations of\n\nfood and water that were occurring. For these reasons, we reject Ju\n\nLin's claims regarding the upward departure.\n\n          C.   Nai Fook Li and Yiu Ming Kwan\n\n          Like Hui Lin, the other land-based appellants, Li and Kwan,\n\nclaim that the district court erred in finding that the actions of the\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fcrew and the conditions aboard the XING DA were reasonably foreseeable\n\nto them.   Again, we review those findings for clear error.        See\n\nMocciola, 891 F.2d at 16.\n\n           Li and Kwan claim that the mere request for a departure is\n\ninconsistent with the notion that they could reasonably have foreseen\n\nwhat took place aboard the XING DA. They argue first that it is the\n\nvery atypicality of such conditions that allows for an upward departure\n\nby taking this case outside the \"heartland\" of § 2L1.1, and second that\n\nthese atypical conditions would not be foreseen by a defendant simply\n\nbecause he or she committed the crime of alien smuggling. Li and Kwan\n\nclaim that they served only as \"go betweens\" and translators for Hui\n\nLin and Agents Rendon and Cox. They argue that this role provided them\n\nonly with the information expressed during the stateside negotiations,\n\nwhich was not sufficient to attribute to them the knowledge or\n\nforesight of what would occur during the voyage.\n\n           The government responds with several arguments. First, it\n\ncontends that Li and Kwan were more than just interpreters. According\n\nto Agent Rendon, it was Kwan alone who initially approached him about\n\nbringing approximately 100 aliens into the United States. Kwan later\n\nintroduced Agent Rendon to Hui Lin, participated in all meetings with\n\nthe agents, and negotiated the price with the agents. During the taped\n\nnegotiations, Kwan spoke of their previous experience in smuggling\n\naliens. After the XING DA left China, Kwan also provided Agent Rendon\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fwith updates regarding the voyage. Nai Fook Li attended all but one of\n\nthe meetings with the agents. At one of the meetings, Li told the\n\nagents that the aliens would be kept together in the United States\n\nuntil appellants paid the balance due them for their offloading\n\nservices. Li gave Agent Cox the XING DA's current coordinates and\n\ndelivered to Rendon $5000 of the down payment. We thus agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Li and Kwan participated in the substance of the\n\ndiscussions and were more than mere interpreters.\n\n          The government also argues that Li and Kwan had reason to\n\nknow that the conditions aboard the XING DA would be grim. It stresses\n\nthat the entire enterprise was profit driven, and that the\n\ncoconspirators were therefore likely to limit the provisions and\n\namenities provided to the passengers. As to the offloading vessel,\n\nKwan inspected it himself, so he knew that approximately 100 aliens\n\nwould be ferried into the United States in the hold of a tiny fishing\n\nboat with inadequate facilities. Both Li and Kwan were present when\n\nHui Lin stated that the aliens would have to cope with the lack of\n\nspace by foregoing sleep for two days. Li and Kwan were also present\n\nwhen Hui Lin discussed the seven or eight enforcers who would control\n\nthe aliens aboard both vessels. On September 23, 1996, Li himself told\n\nthe agents that eight men would be on board the ship to control the\n\npassengers. Li and Kwan were also present when Agent Rendon was told\n\nthat the aliens would board the fishing boat by jumping from the XING\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fDA. Later, Agent Rendon informed Hui Lin, Nai Fook Li, and Yiu Ming\n\nKwan that there would not be enough life jackets for the passengers.\n\nOn September 23, 1996, Kwan told Rendon that only a \"little bit of\n\nfood\" was necessary on the offloading boat.\n\n          After reviewing this evidence, we cannot fault the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the actions of the crew and the conditions of\n\nthe ship were either known by or foreseeable to Li and Kwan, and we\n\ncertainly do not find this conclusion to be clearly erroneous. The\n\ndistrict court could properly have inferred from their participation in\n\nthe negotiations with Rendon and his associates that Li and Kwan knew\n\nfull well what the other members of the conspiracy were planning, and\n\ncould well have foreseen that some level of inhumane treatment,\n\ndangerous conditions, or bodily injury would attend the trip.\n\nTherefore, the upward departures were appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f          D. Comparative Degree of Departures Given to Nai Fook Li\n             and Yiu Ming Kwan\n\n          Closely related to Li and Kwan's argument that they should\n\nnot have been given this upward departure is their contention that the\n\ndistrict court erred in applying a harsher upward departure to them\n\nthan was applied to their five more culpable co-defendants. We review\n\nthe extent of an upward departure for abuse of discretion, using the\n\nyardstick of \"reasonableness\" to determine whether the degree of\n\ndeparture was appropriate.     See Brewster, 127 F.3d at 30-31.\n\n          Li and Kwan complain that the \"inexplicably more severe\n\ndegree of upward departure\" imposed on them is in conflict with\n\nestablished law and the purposes of the sentencing guidelines. They\n\nargue that the grounds for departure for each of the seven co-\n\ndefendants were identical and that although they were the defendants\n\nleast culpable with respect to these inhumane conditions, they received\n\na disproportionately harsh degree of upward departure. Li and Kwan\n\neach received upward departures to sentences of 72 months,5 which\n\ncorrespond to offense levels of 26 or 27.     From this, Li and Kwan\n\nsubtract their total offense level of 14 to determine that they\n\nreceived an upward departure equivalent to 12-13 offense levels. By\n\ncontrast, Li and Kwan claim that the other defendants received upward\n\n\n\n5Kwan was actually sentenced to only 36 months, after receiving a §\n5K1.1 downward departure for substantial cooperation with the\ngovernment.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fdepartures equivalent to enhancements of only 9-10 levels (Hui Lin and\n\nMao Bing Mu); 10-11 levels (Ju Lin and Sang Li); and 11-12 levels (Ben\n\nLin). Li and Kwan contend that, at worst, the conditions and treatment\n\nof the aliens were only reasonably foreseeable to them, and that there\n\nwas no evidence that they had any hand in creating those conditions or\n\nparticipating in that treatment.     Therefore, they argue that, if\n\nanything, they should have received lesser degrees of departure, rather\n\nthan the greater comparative departure they claim to have received.\n\n          However, this analysis is flawed because appellants\n\nmistakenly utilize their total offense levels as the starting point for\n\ncalculating the extent of their departures.         Under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1324(a)(2)(B)(ii), the mandatory minimum sentence for a first or second\n\noffense of bringing in an alien for the purpose of private financial\n\ngain is three years. Appellants agree that this mandatory minimum\n\napplies to their convictions. Sentencing Guideline § 5G1.1(b) provides\n\nthat, where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the\n\nmaximum of the applicable guideline range, the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence shall be the guideline sentence. See U.S.S.G § 5G1.1(b). The\n\nCommentary to that section gives an example: if the applicable\n\nguideline range is 41-51 months and there is a mandatory minimum of 60\n\nmonths, the required sentence is 60 months and any sentence greater\n\nthan that would be a guideline departure. This makes it clear that the\n\nproper starting point from which a departure is to be subtracted or to\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fwhich it must be added is the greater of the guideline range or the\n\nmandatory minimum. Cf. United States v. Hayes, 5 F.3d 292, 295 (7th\n\nCir. 1993) (holding that the district court did not act improperly in\n\ndeparting downward from a starting point of the mandatory minimum).\n\n            It is evident that the district court calculated appellants'\n\nsentences in this proper manner. It first determined that the total\n\noffense level for Li and Kwan was 14, which carries a guideline range\n\nof 15-21 months for defendants in Criminal History Category I. Because\n\nthis range is obviously lower than the applicable 36-month mandatory\n\nminimum, the court properly adjusted the guideline range to a \"range\"\n\nof 36 to 36 months before applying any upward or downward departures.\n\nIt is from this \"range\" that Li and Kwan's upward departures must be\n\nmeasured.\n\n            When the upward departures given to Li and Kwan are\n\ncalculated from the proper starting point -- the 36-month mandatory\n\nminimum -- it becomes evident that Li and Kwan actually received\n\nsmaller upward departures than any other appellant.         A 36-month\n\nsentence corresponds to an offense level of 19 or 20, based on Criminal\n\nHistory Category I.     Therefore, Li and Kwan received an upward\n\ndeparture of seven levels. By comparison, Ju and Hui Lin received\n\ndepartures of eight levels, Mao Bing Mu received a departure of 9-10\n\nlevels, Sang Li received a departure of 10-11 levels, and Ben Lin\n\nreceived a departure of 11-12 levels.       These calculations better\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\freflect the magnitude of the departures and clearly defeat Li and\n\nKwan's claim that they received \"inexplicably more severe\" departures\n\nthan their co-defendants.\n\n          Nevertheless, Li and Kwan argue that, in imposing upward\n\ndepartures on identical grounds, the court must maintain the vertical\n\nseparation of sentences that the guidelines calculations yield. In a\n\ncontext such as this one, in which statutory mandatory minimum\n\nsentences compress much of that vertical separation, appellants'\n\nargument is essentially that the court should re-create much of that\n\nvertical separation in imposing the upward departures. This would\n\nrequire granting appellants a substantially less severe upward\n\ndeparture than their co-defendants, despite having the same basis for\n\nthe departure. Doing so would provide the co-defendants with exactly\n\nthe same \"disproportionality\" argument appellants raise here. For\n\nobvious reasons, this cannot be correct.\n\nIV.       Six-Level Adjustment to Appellants' Offense Level Because\n          the Offense Involved the Smuggling of 100 or More Aliens\n\n          All seven appellants argue that the district court erred in\n\nimposing a six-level increase to their offense levels because more than\n\n100 aliens were involved in their crime. Appellants argue that the\n\ndistrict court should have instead imposed a four-level increase\n\nbecause 25-99 aliens were involved. We review for clear error the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fdistrict court's factual finding at sentencing that more than 100\n\naliens were involved.     See Mocciola, 891 F.2d at 16.\n\n          The applicable version of Guideline § 2L1.1(b)(2) states that\n\nif the offense involved the \"smuggling, transporting, or harboring\" of\n\n100 or more unlawful aliens, the sentencing court should enhance the\n\ndefendant's offense level by six levels. U.S.S.G. § 2L1.1(b)(2)(C).\n\nApplication Note 1 to that section states that in arriving at the\n\nnumber of aliens the defendant may not be included.\n\n          Appellants argue that several of the passengers other than\n\nthe four shipboard defendants can properly be characterized as\n\nparticipants in the conspiracy and therefore should be excluded.\n\nHowever, they cite no authority for the proposition that co-\n\nconspirators who are not co-defendants are to be excluded from the\n\ncalculation.6 Instead, appellants argue that the status of the aliens\n\nas co-conspirators means that they were not smuggled into the United\n\nStates \"for profit.\"\n\n          The   problem    with    appellants'   argument    is   that\n\n§ 2L1.1(b)(2)(C) does not require that each of the 100 or more aliens\n\nbe smuggled \"for profit.\" The \"for profit\" definition of Application\n\nNote 1 refers to subsection 2L1.1(b)(1), which provides a three-level\n\n6In fact, the government offers a strong argument that even co-\ndefendants need not be excluded from the calculation. Application Note\n1 to Section 2L1.1(b) states only that the number of aliens \"does not\ninclude the defendant\"; it does not state that all co-defendants must\nalso be excluded.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fdecrease if the offense is committed other than \"for profit.\"\n\nSubsection 2L1.1(b)(2)(C), the applicable subsection here, prescribes\n\na six-level increase \"if the offense involved the smuggling,\n\ntransporting, or harboring of [100] or more unlawful aliens,\" and makes\n\nno mention of profit. This offense involved the transportation and\n\nplanned offloading in the United States of 109 aliens, only four of\n\nwhom were defendants in this case. Whether each of the remaining 105\n\naliens was smuggled in exchange for payment, work aboard the ship, or\n\nnothing at all is irrelevant for purposes of this particular\n\nsubsection. Therefore, the court did not err in imposing the six-level\n\nincrease under § 2L1.1(b)(2)(C).\n\nV.        Denial of Three-Level Decrease For Offenses Committed \"Other\n          Than For Profit\"\n\n          Appellants Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, and Ben Lin argue that the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying them a three-level decrease under\n\nGuideline § 2L1.1(b)(1), for defendants who \"commit[] the offense other\n\nthan for profit.\" They say that there was no evidence that any of them\n\nwas to be paid from the profits of the smuggling operation, and that in\n\nfact, their only form of compensation was free passage to the United\n\nStates. Application Note 1 to § 2L1.1 states that a defendant who\n\ncommitted the offense solely in return for his own transportation did\n\nnot commit the offense \"for profit.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f          The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat each of the three defendants was motivated by (1) expectations of\n\nmonetary gains, and (2) hopes of entering and remaining inside the\n\nUnited States.    The court found that the defendants were knowing\n\nparticipants in a conspiracy that was expected to yield profits to some\n\nmembers of the conspiracy. The court also found that remaining inside\n\nthe United States has monetary value because, among other things, the\n\nappellants would avoid the payment of fees and expenses incident to a\n\nlegal entry.     The government agrees with appellants that if the\n\nevidence demonstrated only that the defendants worked on the ship in\n\nexchange for free passage, they would have been entitled to the three-\n\nlevel decrease. However, the court based its decision not to grant the\n\ndecrease on an \"expectation of payment\" after their arrival in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n          Mu, Li, and Ben Lin argue that the district court engaged in\n\npure speculation when it found that they had an expectation of being\n\npaid out of the conspiracy's profits. The government concedes that it\n\noffered no specific evidence that Mu, Li, or Ben Lin had an expectation\n\nof being paid by the conspiracy, but notes that it was appellants'\n\nburden to establish that the downward adjustment was warranted. See\n\nUnited States v. Trinidad-López, 979 F.2d 249, 251 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"The validity of any claim of entitlement to a downward adjustment in\n\nthe base offense level must be demonstrated by the defendant by a\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fpreponderance of the evidence. The government is not required to\n\nestablish defendant's disentitlement.\") (citations omitted). The\n\ngovernment argues that Mu and Li offered no evidence that they\n\nparticipated in the smuggling venture solely in return for their free\n\npassage to the United States and that Ben Lin offered only a self-\n\nserving declaration that he would receive free passage in exchange for\n\npiloting the boat. Thus, the government argues that the only evidence\n\nbefore the district court on the \"for profit\" issue was the high level\n\nof responsibility accorded to Mu, Li, and Ben Lin. The government\n\nclaims that the district court properly determined that the high level\n\nof responsibility given them was indicative of their status as valued\n\nmembers of the conspiracy who would be compensated and was inconsistent\n\nwith the theory that they were merely working for free passage to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n          This is a close question. While we might not entirely agree\n\nwith the inference of expectation of payment that the district court\n\ndrew from the level of responsibility shouldered by Mu, Li, and Ben\n\nLin, we do not find the court's decision to deny the downward\n\nadjustment to be clear error.        Appellants had the burden of\n\nestablishing by a preponderance of the evidence that they were due to\n\nreceive only free passage to the United States in exchange for their\n\nservices, and the district court found that this burden was not met.\n\nNone of the three appellants offered testimony on this subject, and\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fonly Ben Lin offered an affidavit stating that he expected only free\n\npassage. After viewing and hearing all of the evidence, the district\n\ncourt simply did not believe that Mu, Li, and Ben Lin had no\n\nexpectation of payment. As the trier of fact for sentencing purposes,\n\nthe district court had a better sense of the importance of Mu, Li, and\n\nBen Lin to the conspiracy than we can glean from the record.\n\nAccordingly, we do not disturb the court's finding that Mu, Li, and Ben\n\nLin failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that they committed\n\nthe offense \"other than for profit.\"\n\nVI.         Upward Departure to Appellant Hui Lin's Sentence Based On\n            the Finding That He Was a Leader or Organizer of the\n            Criminal Activity\n\n            Finally, Hui Lin argues that the district court improperly\n\napplied a four-level increase to his offense level, based upon his role\n\nin the offense as a \"leader\" or \"organizer.\" Sentencing Guideline §\n\n3B1.1(a) prescribes a four-level increase in a defendant's offense\n\nlevel if he \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that\n\ninvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). In this context, Hui Lin essentially repeats his\n\nargument that he could not have foreseen the treatment of the aliens or\n\nthe conditions aboard the XING DA -- an argument that we have already\n\nrejected.\n\n            It is undisputed that this venture involved five or more\n\nparticipants.    Evidence was presented that Hui Lin inspected and\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fapproved of Agent Rendon's boat during negotiations; that Hui Lin\n\nagreed to pay Agent Rendon $500,000 for use of the boat; that Hui Lin\n\n\"did most of the talking\" during price negotiations; and that Hui Lin\n\ngave Agent Rendon over $30,000 as a deposit.       This evidence was\n\nsufficient to demonstrate that Hui Lin was in charge of the stateside\n\nportion of the venture, which was more than sufficient to support a\n\nfinding that he was a leader or organizer of the criminal activity.\n\n          Additionally, we note that Hui Lin was not affected by the\n\ndistrict court's decision to apply the \"role in the offense\"\n\nenhancement.   Hui Lin's guideline range, after the \"role in the\n\noffense\" enhancement was applied, was only 27-33 months and had to be\n\nraised to the statutory minimum of 36 months.      If the role in the\n\noffense enhancement had not been applied, Hui Lin's guideline range\n\nwould have been only 15-21 months, which the court would still have had\n\nto raise to the statutory minimum of 36 months. As a result, even if\n\nthe district court had erred in applying the role enhancement, Hui Lin\n\nwould not have been harmed in any way by the error. This is especially\n\nimportant because Hui Lin did not object at sentencing to the role\n\nenhancement. Consequently, we review only for a plain error affecting\n\nthe defendant's substantial rights. See United States v. Carrozza, 4\n\nF.3d 70, 87 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S.\n\n725 (1993)), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1069 (1994). Because Hui Lin\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fdemonstrates neither such an error nor such an effect, this claim\n\nfails.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n          Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court in all respects with regard to all appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                   Separate opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                              -31-\n\f          Torruella, Chief Judge (Concurring in part, dissenting in\n\npart). I concur in the panel's decision as to appellants Hui Lin, Nai\n\nFook Li, Yiu Ming Kwan, and Ju Lin. As to appellants Mao Bing Mu, Sang\n\nLi, and Ben Lin, however, I respectfully dissent, for the reasons set\n\nforth in my dissent from the opinion of the en banc Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\f",

Before the Court are appeals following\n\nthe conviction and sentencing of defendants-appellants Hui Lin, Nai\n\nFook Li, Yiu Ming Kwan, Ju Lin, Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, and Ben Lin (the\n\n“appellants”). In an en banc opinion issued today, we rejected several\n\narguments three of the appellants raised concerning their purported\n\nrights under two international treaties. In this panel opinion, we\n\naddress the balance of all of the appellants' claims. We reject their\n\nchallenges, and affirm the convictions and sentences.\n\n          We adopt in full, and reference herein, the facts and\n\nprocedural history as recited in the companion en banc opinion\n\nmentioned above.    Put very briefly, the appellants engaged in a\n\nconspiracy to smuggle nationals of the People's Republic of China\n\n(“China”) into the United States on a ship called the XING DA. Hui\n\nLin, Yiu Ming Kwan, and Nai Fook Li (the “land-based defendants”)\n\noperating out of the United States, met with various law enforcement\n\npersonnel, including Immigration and Naturalization Service Special\n\nAgent Michael Rendon and Coast Guard Agent Rick Cox. Rendon, Cox, and\n\ntheir associates posed as fishermen who owned a boat on which they were\n\nwilling to transport the aliens during the final leg of their journey\n\nfrom China. The land-based defendants negotiated with the agents and\n\nacted as liaisons between the agents and the remaining appellants.\n\nMeanwhile, Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, Ju Lin, and Ben Lin (the “shipboard\n\ndefendants”) organized the XING DA's trip from China and traveled\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\faboard the vessel as it progressed toward the rendezvous with the\n\nagents' boat. It appears that Ju Lin was, in the words of the XING DA\n\npassengers, “the boss,” that Ben Lin piloted the ship, and that Mao\n\nBing Mu and Sang Li, among others, acted as “enforcers” to keep the\n\naliens under control during the long trip. Before its rendezvous with\n\nthe agents' boat, the XING DA was intercepted and boarded by officers\n\nof the United States Coast Guard.\n\n                             Discussion\n\n          In this opinion, we address various evidentiary and\n\nsentencing issues raised by the appellants. We reject each challenge.\n\nI.        Denial of Appellant Ben Lin's Motion to Suppress Evidence of\n          His Conduct Tending to Demonstrate That He Was the Captain\n          of the Ship\n\n          Ben Lin argues that the district court erred in refusing to\n\nsuppress evidence that he went to the bridge of the ship and reduced\n\nthe speed of the XING DA in response to a request by the Coast Guard\n\nboarding team. He claims that this action constituted a non-Mirandized\n\ncommunicative act in response to custodial interrogation and therefore\n\nshould have been suppressed under Miranda v.

First, notwithstanding any\n\nsuspicion that the XING DA was smuggling aliens into the United States,\n\nthe Coast Guard's routine stop, boarding, and inspection of a vessel on\n\nthe high seas is not considered “custodial.” See United States v.\n\nMagdaniel-Mora, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443080\"><a href=\"/opinion/443080/united-states-v-ruben-magdaniel-mora-henny-dekom-ibrahim-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 723 (11th Cir. 1984); United States v.\n\nGray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"394838\"><a href=\"/opinion/394838/united-states-v-andrew-gray-paul-thomas-nelson-and-geoffrey-christian/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1301 (5th Cir. 1981).

By all accounts, the XING DA\n\ncrew consented to the Coast Guard's boarding. The request that the\n\ncrew slow the ship -- to which Ben Lin responded -- was made during the\n\nopening moments of this boarding. No arrests had been made at that\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpoint, and no accusations of smuggling had been leveled. The officers\n\nhad merely commenced a routine safety inspection and obtained a copy of\n\nthe ship's registration papers. Moreover, although the crew members\n\nwere gathered in one section of the ship during the inspection, it\n\nappears that the Coast Guard had neither applied nor threatened any\n\nforce.   Thus, at the time Ben Lin engaged in the putatively\n\ncommunicative behavior at issue, the boarding and inspection had not\n\nyet risen to the level of a \"formal arrest or restraint on freedom of\n\nmovement of the degree associated with formal arrest.\" Stansbury v.\n\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117843\"><a href=\"/opinion/117843/stansbury-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322 (1994); see also United States v.\n\nRioseco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504776\"><a href=\"/opinion/504776/united-states-v-sixto-roberto-rioseco/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (11th Cir. 1988) (holding that the appellant\n\nwas not in \"custody\" during an initial boarding, despite the existence\n\nof probable cause to arrest, because the appellant was not told he was\n\nunder arrest and because the Coast Guard merely engaged in a routine\n\nboarding and inspection procedure in gathering the crew to one area of\n\nthe ship).\n\n          Further, even if appellant had been in \"custody\" for Miranda\n\npurposes, we cannot describe Officer Hilbert's request to slow the ship\n\nas \"interrogation.\" The simple request to slow the ship was not a\n\nremark that Officer Hilbert should have known was reasonably likely to\n\nelicit an incriminating response.

Admission of Evidence of the Conditions On Board the Ship\n          and the Treatment of the Passengers on the Vessel\n\n          Appellants Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, and Ben Lin next argue that\n\nthe district court erred in allowing the government to present evidence\n\nconcerning the conditions aboard the XING DA, the deprivations suffered\n\nby the alien passengers, and the harsh treatment of those passengers.\n\nThey contend that this evidence should have been excluded under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. Rule 403 because its probative value was substantially outweighed\n\nby the risk of unfair prejudice. The district court found that the\n\ntestimony's probative value exceeded any prejudicial impact.\n\nAdmissibility determinations under Rule 403 are committed to the trial\n\ncourt's sound discretion, see United States v. Rodríguez-Estrada, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155 (1st Cir. 1989), and we review only for an abuse of that\n\ndiscretion, see United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698646\"><a href=\"/opinion/698646/united-states-v-esperanza-aguilar-aranceta/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 801\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).    We find no such abuse here.\n\n          Appellants refer to the graphic testimony of the filthy\n\nconditions prevailing in the hold of the ship, the lack of adequate\n\nsafety devices on board, and the beatings suffered by the passengers,\n\narguing that this evidence was not relevant to any issues to be\n\ndetermined by the jury and that, even if relevant, it was so unfairly\n\nprejudicial that it should have been excluded.          We agree with\n\nappellants that this evidence was prejudicial in that it had the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fpotential to inflame the jury against those who created and controlled\n\nthis inhumane environment.\n\n          The government responds first that in order to present proof\n\nthat the criminal enterprise was conducted “for profit,” it needed to\n\nestablish not only the price paid by the aliens for the 54-day voyage,\n\nbut also the trip's minimal costs to the coconspirators. Those costs,\n\nthe government argues, were best evidenced by the XING DA's shoddy\n\nconditions, meager provisions, and inadequate safety measures. Second,\n\nthe government argues that Mao Bing Mu and Sang Li served as\n\n\"enforcers\" over the aliens and that, without evidence of the beatings,\n\nthe government would not have been able to prove their participation in\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n          We agree that this evidence was probative to material issues\n\nto be determined by the jury, notwithstanding its prejudicial nature.\n\nIn their brief, appellants admit that the evidence of beatings was\n\nrelevant to the roles of Mao Bing Mu and Sang Li.1 In fact, it appears\n\n1Although appellants concede the relevance of the beatings, they\ncomplain that the evidence of the \"continuing effects of the beatings\"\non the victims went far beyond that which was relevant to the role\nissue. However, the government correctly notes that it did not elicit\nany such \"continuing effects\" testimony; appellants did. Chou Lee Li\ntestified on direct examination by the government only that he \"felt\npain all over\" immediately after the beating. It was Ben Lin's counsel\nwho, on cross-examination of Chou Lee Li, introduced Agent Rendon's\nnotes from the Guantanamo Bay interviews, which recounted Li's\nstatement that he still suffered pain from the beating. Sang Li's\ncounsel then offered this statement into evidence. Having brought that\nevidence out at trial, defendants may not now complain it was error to\nhave let them do so.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthat the evidence of the beatings was the only evidence offered that\n\nwas relevant to this question.     As for the evidence of shipboard\n\nconditions, evidence of the substantial price paid for passage to the\n\nUnited States goes a long way towards proving profit, but it does not\n\nconclusively prove the issue without some showing of the costs of the\n\nvoyage.   Thus, evidence regarding the inadequacy of the vessel,\n\nincluding its physical limitations and spartan provisions, was very\n\nprobative to this element of the offense.\n\n          Having found that the evidence at issue was both prejudicial\n\nand probative, we must balance these findings in making a Rule 403\n\ndetermination.    The district court is granted \"especially wide\n\nlatitude\" in Rule 403 balancing. See United States v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196774\"><a href=\"/opinion/196774/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (1st Cir. 1996). \"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate\n\nrecord, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the\n\nrelative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v.\n\nPackage Mach.

The legal standard is also somewhat weighted in favor of\n\nadmissibility. In order to be excluded, the evidence must be not only\n\nbe prejudicial, but unfairly prejudicial, and must not only outweigh\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fprobative value, but substantially outweigh probative value.

While the evidence certainly had a potential for prejudice, it\n\nwas also highly relevant to issues before the jury. This case simply\n\ndoes not present the type of \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\"\n\nthat would warrant our upsetting the balance already struck by the\n\ndistrict court. We thus accord deference to the district court's Rule\n\n403 determination.\n\nIII.      Upward Departure Based Upon the Condition of the Vessel and\n          the Treatment of the Passengers Aboard the Vessel\n\n          Appellants Nai Fook Li, Yiu Ming Kwan, Ju Lin, and Hui Lin\n\nnext argue that the district court erred in imposing an upward\n\ndeparture from the sentencing guidelines due to the conditions on board\n\nthe vessel and the treatment of the aliens.      At each appellant's\n\nsentencing hearing, the court imposed an upward departure pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.1, Application Note 5, which states that \"[i]f the\n\noffense involved dangerous or inhumane treatment, death or bodily\n\ninjury, possession of a dangerous weapon, or substantially more than\n\n100 aliens, an upward departure may be warranted.\" The court found by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that each of these four disjunctive\n\nconditions existed in this case, based on specific findings of (1)\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\finadequate food and water; (2) corporal punishment; (3) bodily injury\n\nand threats of serious bodily injury; (4) degrading conditions and\n\nconfinement in the hold of the ship; (5) inadequate safety measures on\n\nthe ship; (6) possession of numerous weapons; and (7) involvement of\n\nmore than 100 aliens. With respect to appellants Hui Lin and Nai Fook\n\nLi, the court also supported the decision to depart upward by invoking\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K2.8, which authorizes a departure when the defendant's\n\nconduct was \"unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the\n\nvictim.\"\n\n           The four appellants argue that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that the conditions on board the XING DA were reasonably\n\nforeseeable to them. In so arguing, appellants recognize that, in the\n\ncase of a jointly undertaken criminal activity such as a conspiracy,\n\neach of them is responsible for all of the reasonably foreseeable acts\n\nand omissions of others in furtherance of the conspiracy. See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).2\n\n\n\n\n2Sentencing Guideline § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) does not expressly apply to the\nupward departure under Application Note 5 to § 2L1.1. It expressly\napplies to determinations of the base offense level, specific offense\ncharacteristics, Chapter Two cross-references, or Chapter Three\nadjustments. However, appellants do not object to the district court's\nuse of the \"reasonably foreseeable conduct\" principle in applying these\nupward departures; they actually agree with it. Because we conclude\nthat the conditions aboard the XING DA were foreseeable to these\nappellants, we need not determine whether foreseeability was required\nor not.

Because Hui Lin did not object\n\nto this upward departure at his sentencing hearing, we review his\n\narguments on this issue only for plain error. See United States v.\n\nForbes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195227\"><a href=\"/opinion/195227/united-states-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1300 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          A.   Hui Lin\n\n          Hui Lin argues that there has been no showing that he\n\nanticipated or should have anticipated the actions of the crew or the\n\nconditions aboard the XING DA.3 He argues that he was not on the ship\n\n\n\n3This position is at odds with the position Hui Lin's counsel took at\nsentencing, where he argued first that \"it was foreseeable that much of\nthis conduct could happen aboard the vessel,\" and second that Hui Lin\nand Yiu Ming Kwan did not know that the crew members were \"going to go\ncrazy and do the kind of stuff they did,\" but that they \"should have\nforeseen it.\"\n\n                                 -14-\n\fand did not communicate with the ship during the voyage.       He also\n\nargues that there was no evidence that he ever ordered or encouraged\n\nthe use of force or the deprivations suffered by the passengers.\n\n          Hui Lin's argument is unavailing, especially under the\n\napplicable \"plain error\" standard. The facts (even if true) that he\n\nwas not on the ship, did not communicate with the ship, and did not\n\norder the actions or conditions aboard the ship, do not require the\n\nconclusion that Hui Lin could not have known about or at least foreseen\n\nthe crew's actions or the ship's conditions. Several factors noted by\n\nthe government support the opposite conclusion. First, Hui Lin's\n\nplanning and negotiation demonstrated that he was clearly in charge of\n\nthe stateside portion of the smuggling conspiracy. Second, his concern\n\nwith finances during the negotiations supports the inference that he\n\nunderstood the importance of frugality with respect to all aspects of\n\nthe conspiracy.    Third, Hui Lin knew of the inadequacy of the\n\noffloading vessel, but arranged for the aliens to be transported into\n\nthe United States on that vessel anyway. When it was pointed out that\n\nthe conditions aboard the fishing vessel would be less than ideal, Hui\n\nLin stated that the aliens would simply have to sit below deck and stay\n\nawake for two days. Fourth, Hui Lin knew that seven or eight enforcers\n\nwould control the aliens on both the XING DA and the offloading vessel.\n\nWe agree with the government that there was little need to provide for\n\nenforcers on such a voyage unless the negotiating appellants knew that\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fthe conditions were likely to provoke unrest. Finally, Hui Lin was\n\npresent when Nai Fook Li told Agent Rendon that the offloading vessel\n\nneed not have enough life jackets for the passengers.\n\n          From these facts, the district court could properly have\n\nfound that Hui Lin either knew of or could have foreseen the crew's\n\nactions or the dangerous and inhumane conditions aboard the XING DA.\n\nEven if we assume that Hui Lin did not have full knowledge of the\n\nmanner in which the aliens would be treated, the conversations with the\n\nundercover agents demonstrate that he could have and should have\n\nforeseen many of the conditions, deprivations, and abuses suffered by\n\nthe unfortunate passengers. Thus, the upward departure was not plain\n\nerror.\n\n          B.   Ju Lin\n\n          Ju Lin offers the weakest argument on this issue.         He\n\ncontends that it was not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nhe controlled or caused the inhumane conditions. We note first that\n\nsuch direct control or causation of the conditions is not required. As\n\ndiscussed above, Ju Lin is responsible for the conditions created by\n\nhis fellow co-conspirators so long as those conditions were reasonably\n\nforeseeable to him.     See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).4\n\n          Although Ju Lin is correct that there is no evidence that he\n\ncaused or controlled the food and water deprivations or unsanitary\n\n4See note </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">2,</span> supra</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fconditions on the XING DA, there was sufficient evidence to support the\n\ninference that Ju Lin could have foreseen that such conditions would\n\nexist. The XING DA was at sea for approximately fifty-four days.\n\nWhen, upon boarding the XING DA, Coast Guard Officer Patrick Hilbert\n\nasked who was in charge, Ju Lin identified himself as the master of the\n\nship. Indeed, Ju Lin was called \"the boss\" by others on the ship. It\n\nis quite unlikely that the ship's “boss” would not know of or suspect\n\nthe unsanitary conditions, safety violations, food deprivations, or\n\nincidents of violence during its nearly two-month-long voyage.\n\n          In any event, there was also compelling evidence of Ju Lin's\n\ndirect participation in abusing the emigrants.        The court heard\n\ntestimony that Ju Lin personally beat one passenger with a thick wooden\n\nstick and personally kicked another as he lay on the deck.        This\n\nevidence alone is sufficient to support a finding that Ju Lin's offense\n\ninvolved dangerous or inhumane treatment, bodily injury, and possession\n\nof a dangerous weapon. Moreover, during both beatings, another crew\n\nmember told the victim that he was being beaten for stealing food or\n\nwater. This strongly suggests that Ju Lin knew of the deprivations of\n\nfood and water that were occurring. For these reasons, we reject Ju\n\nLin's claims regarding the upward departure.\n\n          C.   Nai Fook Li and Yiu Ming Kwan\n\n          Like Hui Lin, the other land-based appellants, Li and Kwan,\n\nclaim that the district court erred in finding that the actions of the\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fcrew and the conditions aboard the XING DA were reasonably foreseeable\n\nto them.   Again, we review those findings for clear error.

They argue first that it is the\n\nvery atypicality of such conditions that allows for an upward departure\n\nby taking this case outside the \"heartland\" of § 2L1.1, and second that\n\nthese atypical conditions would not be foreseen by a defendant simply\n\nbecause he or she committed the crime of alien smuggling. Li and Kwan\n\nclaim that they served only as \"go betweens\" and translators for Hui\n\nLin and Agents Rendon and Cox. They argue that this role provided them\n\nonly with the information expressed during the stateside negotiations,\n\nwhich was not sufficient to attribute to them the knowledge or\n\nforesight of what would occur during the voyage.\n\n           The government responds with several arguments. First, it\n\ncontends that Li and Kwan were more than just interpreters. According\n\nto Agent Rendon, it was Kwan alone who initially approached him about\n\nbringing approximately 100 aliens into the United States. Kwan later\n\nintroduced Agent Rendon to Hui Lin, participated in all meetings with\n\nthe agents, and negotiated the price with the agents. During the taped\n\nnegotiations, Kwan spoke of their previous experience in smuggling\n\naliens. After the XING DA left China, Kwan also provided Agent Rendon\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fwith updates regarding the voyage. Nai Fook Li attended all but one of\n\nthe meetings with the agents. At one of the meetings, Li told the\n\nagents that the aliens would be kept together in the United States\n\nuntil appellants paid the balance due them for their offloading\n\nservices. Li gave Agent Cox the XING DA's current coordinates and\n\ndelivered to Rendon $5000 of the down payment. We thus agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Li and Kwan participated in the substance of the\n\ndiscussions and were more than mere interpreters.\n\n          The government also argues that Li and Kwan had reason to\n\nknow that the conditions aboard the XING DA would be grim. It stresses\n\nthat the entire enterprise was profit driven, and that the\n\ncoconspirators were therefore likely to limit the provisions and\n\namenities provided to the passengers. As to the offloading vessel,\n\nKwan inspected it himself, so he knew that approximately 100 aliens\n\nwould be ferried into the United States in the hold of a tiny fishing\n\nboat with inadequate facilities. Both Li and Kwan were present when\n\nHui Lin stated that the aliens would have to cope with the lack of\n\nspace by foregoing sleep for two days. Li and Kwan were also present\n\nwhen Hui Lin discussed the seven or eight enforcers who would control\n\nthe aliens aboard both vessels. On September 23, 1996, Li himself told\n\nthe agents that eight men would be on board the ship to control the\n\npassengers. Li and Kwan were also present when Agent Rendon was told\n\nthat the aliens would board the fishing boat by jumping from the XING\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fDA. Later, Agent Rendon informed Hui Lin, Nai Fook Li, and Yiu Ming\n\nKwan that there would not be enough life jackets for the passengers.\n\nOn September 23, 1996, Kwan told Rendon that only a \"little bit of\n\nfood\" was necessary on the offloading boat.\n\n          After reviewing this evidence, we cannot fault the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the actions of the crew and the conditions of\n\nthe ship were either known by or foreseeable to Li and Kwan, and we\n\ncertainly do not find this conclusion to be clearly erroneous. The\n\ndistrict court could properly have inferred from their participation in\n\nthe negotiations with Rendon and his associates that Li and Kwan knew\n\nfull well what the other members of the conspiracy were planning, and\n\ncould well have foreseen that some level of inhumane treatment,\n\ndangerous conditions, or bodily injury would attend the trip.\n\nTherefore, the upward departures were appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f          D. Comparative Degree of Departures Given to Nai Fook Li\n             and Yiu Ming Kwan\n\n          Closely related to Li and Kwan's argument that they should\n\nnot have been given this upward departure is their contention that the\n\ndistrict court erred in applying a harsher upward departure to them\n\nthan was applied to their five more culpable co-defendants. We review\n\nthe extent of an upward departure for abuse of discretion, using the\n\nyardstick of \"reasonableness\" to determine whether the degree of\n\ndeparture was appropriate.     See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brewster,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">30-31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n          Li and Kwan complain that the \"inexplicably more severe\n\ndegree of upward departure\" imposed on them is in conflict with\n\nestablished law and the purposes of the sentencing guidelines. They\n\nargue that the grounds for departure for each of the seven co-\n\ndefendants were identical and that although they were the defendants\n\nleast culpable with respect to these inhumane conditions, they received\n\na disproportionately harsh degree of upward departure. Li and Kwan\n\neach received upward departures to sentences of 72 months,5 which\n\ncorrespond to offense levels of 26 or 27.     From this, Li and Kwan\n\nsubtract their total offense level of 14 to determine that they\n\nreceived an upward departure equivalent to 12-13 offense levels. By\n\ncontrast, Li and Kwan claim that the other defendants received upward\n\n\n\n5Kwan was actually sentenced to only 36 months, after receiving a §\n5K1.1 downward departure for substantial cooperation with the\ngovernment.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fdepartures equivalent to enhancements of only 9-10 levels (Hui Lin and\n\nMao Bing Mu); 10-11 levels (Ju Lin and Sang Li); and 11-12 levels (Ben\n\nLin). Li and Kwan contend that, at worst, the conditions and treatment\n\nof the aliens were only reasonably foreseeable to them, and that there\n\nwas no evidence that they had any hand in creating those conditions or\n\nparticipating in that treatment.     Therefore, they argue that, if\n\nanything, they should have received lesser degrees of departure, rather\n\nthan the greater comparative departure they claim to have received.\n\n          However, this analysis is flawed because appellants\n\nmistakenly utilize their total offense levels as the starting point for\n\ncalculating the extent of their departures.         Under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1324(a)(2)(B)(ii), the mandatory minimum sentence for a first or second\n\noffense of bringing in an alien for the purpose of private financial\n\ngain is three years. Appellants agree that this mandatory minimum\n\napplies to their convictions. Sentencing Guideline § 5G1.1(b) provides\n\nthat, where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the\n\nmaximum of the applicable guideline range, the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence shall be the guideline sentence. See U.S.S.G § 5G1.1(b). The\n\nCommentary to that section gives an example: if the applicable\n\nguideline range is 41-51 months and there is a mandatory minimum of 60\n\nmonths, the required sentence is 60 months and any sentence greater\n\nthan that would be a guideline departure. This makes it clear that the\n\nproper starting point from which a departure is to be subtracted or to\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fwhich it must be added is the greater of the guideline range or the\n\nmandatory minimum. Cf. United States v. Hayes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652968\"><a href=\"/opinion/652968/united-states-v-daniel-hayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295 (7th\n\nCir. 1993) (holding that the district court did not act improperly in\n\ndeparting downward from a starting point of the mandatory minimum).\n\n            It is evident that the district court calculated appellants'\n\nsentences in this proper manner. It first determined that the total\n\noffense level for Li and Kwan was 14, which carries a guideline range\n\nof 15-21 months for defendants in Criminal History Category I. Because\n\nthis range is obviously lower than the applicable 36-month mandatory\n\nminimum, the court properly adjusted the guideline range to a \"range\"\n\nof 36 to 36 months before applying any upward or downward departures.\n\nIt is from this \"range\" that Li and Kwan's upward departures must be\n\nmeasured.\n\n            When the upward departures given to Li and Kwan are\n\ncalculated from the proper starting point -- the 36-month mandatory\n\nminimum -- it becomes evident that Li and Kwan actually received\n\nsmaller upward departures than any other appellant.         A 36-month\n\nsentence corresponds to an offense level of 19 or 20, based on Criminal\n\nHistory Category I.     Therefore, Li and Kwan received an upward\n\ndeparture of seven levels. By comparison, Ju and Hui Lin received\n\ndepartures of eight levels, Mao Bing Mu received a departure of 9-10\n\nlevels, Sang Li received a departure of 10-11 levels, and Ben Lin\n\nreceived a departure of 11-12 levels.       These calculations better\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\freflect the magnitude of the departures and clearly defeat Li and\n\nKwan's claim that they received \"inexplicably more severe\" departures\n\nthan their co-defendants.\n\n          Nevertheless, Li and Kwan argue that, in imposing upward\n\ndepartures on identical grounds, the court must maintain the vertical\n\nseparation of sentences that the guidelines calculations yield. In a\n\ncontext such as this one, in which statutory mandatory minimum\n\nsentences compress much of that vertical separation, appellants'\n\nargument is essentially that the court should re-create much of that\n\nvertical separation in imposing the upward departures. This would\n\nrequire granting appellants a substantially less severe upward\n\ndeparture than their co-defendants, despite having the same basis for\n\nthe departure. Doing so would provide the co-defendants with exactly\n\nthe same \"disproportionality\" argument appellants raise here. For\n\nobvious reasons, this cannot be correct.\n\nIV.       Six-Level Adjustment to Appellants' Offense Level Because\n          the Offense Involved the Smuggling of 100 or More Aliens\n\n          All seven appellants argue that the district court erred in\n\nimposing a six-level increase to their offense levels because more than\n\n100 aliens were involved in their crime. Appellants argue that the\n\ndistrict court should have instead imposed a four-level increase\n\nbecause 25-99 aliens were involved. We review for clear error the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fdistrict court's factual finding at sentencing that more than 100\n\naliens were involved.

U.S.S.G. § 2L1.1(b)(2)(C).\n\nApplication Note 1 to that section states that in arriving at the\n\nnumber of aliens the defendant may not be included.\n\n          Appellants argue that several of the passengers other than\n\nthe four shipboard defendants can properly be characterized as\n\nparticipants in the conspiracy and therefore should be excluded.\n\nHowever, they cite no authority for the proposition that co-\n\nconspirators who are not co-defendants are to be excluded from the\n\ncalculation.6 Instead, appellants argue that the status of the aliens\n\nas co-conspirators means that they were not smuggled into the United\n\nStates \"for profit.\"\n\n          The   problem    with    appellants'   argument    is   that\n\n§ 2L1.1(b)(2)(C) does not require that each of the 100 or more aliens\n\nbe smuggled \"for profit.\" The \"for profit\" definition of Application\n\nNote 1 refers to subsection 2L1.1(b)(1), which provides a three-level\n\n6In fact, the government offers a strong argument that even co-\ndefendants need not be excluded from the calculation. Application Note\n1 to Section 2L1.1(b) states only that the number of aliens \"does not\ninclude the defendant\"; it does not state that all co-defendants must\nalso be excluded.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fdecrease if the offense is committed other than \"for profit.\"\n\nSubsection 2L1.1(b)(2)(C), the applicable subsection here, prescribes\n\na six-level increase \"if the offense involved the smuggling,\n\ntransporting, or harboring of [100] or more unlawful aliens,\" and makes\n\nno mention of profit. This offense involved the transportation and\n\nplanned offloading in the United States of 109 aliens, only four of\n\nwhom were defendants in this case. Whether each of the remaining 105\n\naliens was smuggled in exchange for payment, work aboard the ship, or\n\nnothing at all is irrelevant for purposes of this particular\n\nsubsection. Therefore, the court did not err in imposing the six-level\n\nincrease under § 2L1.1(b)(2)(C).\n\nV.        Denial of Three-Level Decrease For Offenses Committed \"Other\n          Than For Profit\"\n\n          Appellants Mao Bing Mu, Sang Li, and Ben Lin argue that the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying them a three-level decrease under\n\nGuideline § 2L1.1(b)(1), for defendants who \"commit[] the offense other\n\nthan for profit.\" They say that there was no evidence that any of them\n\nwas to be paid from the profits of the smuggling operation, and that in\n\nfact, their only form of compensation was free passage to the United\n\nStates. Application Note 1 to § 2L1.1 states that a defendant who\n\ncommitted the offense solely in return for his own transportation did\n\nnot commit the offense \"for profit.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f          The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat each of the three defendants was motivated by (1) expectations of\n\nmonetary gains, and (2) hopes of entering and remaining inside the\n\nUnited States.    The court found that the defendants were knowing\n\nparticipants in a conspiracy that was expected to yield profits to some\n\nmembers of the conspiracy. The court also found that remaining inside\n\nthe United States has monetary value because, among other things, the\n\nappellants would avoid the payment of fees and expenses incident to a\n\nlegal entry.     The government agrees with appellants that if the\n\nevidence demonstrated only that the defendants worked on the ship in\n\nexchange for free passage, they would have been entitled to the three-\n\nlevel decrease. However, the court based its decision not to grant the\n\ndecrease on an \"expectation of payment\" after their arrival in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n          Mu, Li, and Ben Lin argue that the district court engaged in\n\npure speculation when it found that they had an expectation of being\n\npaid out of the conspiracy's profits. The government concedes that it\n\noffered no specific evidence that Mu, Li, or Ben Lin had an expectation\n\nof being paid by the conspiracy, but notes that it was appellants'\n\nburden to establish that the downward adjustment was warranted.

The\n\ngovernment argues that Mu and Li offered no evidence that they\n\nparticipated in the smuggling venture solely in return for their free\n\npassage to the United States and that Ben Lin offered only a self-\n\nserving declaration that he would receive free passage in exchange for\n\npiloting the boat. Thus, the government argues that the only evidence\n\nbefore the district court on the \"for profit\" issue was the high level\n\nof responsibility accorded to Mu, Li, and Ben Lin. The government\n\nclaims that the district court properly determined that the high level\n\nof responsibility given them was indicative of their status as valued\n\nmembers of the conspiracy who would be compensated and was inconsistent\n\nwith the theory that they were merely working for free passage to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n          This is a close question. While we might not entirely agree\n\nwith the inference of expectation of payment that the district court\n\ndrew from the level of responsibility shouldered by Mu, Li, and Ben\n\nLin, we do not find the court's decision to deny the downward\n\nadjustment to be clear error.        Appellants had the burden of\n\nestablishing by a preponderance of the evidence that they were due to\n\nreceive only free passage to the United States in exchange for their\n\nservices, and the district court found that this burden was not met.\n\nNone of the three appellants offered testimony on this subject, and\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fonly Ben Lin offered an affidavit stating that he expected only free\n\npassage. After viewing and hearing all of the evidence, the district\n\ncourt simply did not believe that Mu, Li, and Ben Lin had no\n\nexpectation of payment. As the trier of fact for sentencing purposes,\n\nthe district court had a better sense of the importance of Mu, Li, and\n\nBen Lin to the conspiracy than we can glean from the record.\n\nAccordingly, we do not disturb the court's finding that Mu, Li, and Ben\n\nLin failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that they committed\n\nthe offense \"other than for profit.\"\n\nVI.         Upward Departure to Appellant Hui Lin's Sentence Based On\n            the Finding That He Was a Leader or Organizer of the\n            Criminal Activity\n\n            Finally, Hui Lin argues that the district court improperly\n\napplied a four-level increase to his offense level, based upon his role\n\nin the offense as a \"leader\" or \"organizer.\" Sentencing Guideline §\n\n3B1.1(a) prescribes a four-level increase in a defendant's offense\n\nlevel if he \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that\n\ninvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). In this context, Hui Lin essentially repeats his\n\nargument that he could not have foreseen the treatment of the aliens or\n\nthe conditions aboard the XING DA -- an argument that we have already\n\nrejected.\n\n            It is undisputed that this venture involved five or more\n\nparticipants.    Evidence was presented that Hui Lin inspected and\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fapproved of Agent Rendon's boat during negotiations; that Hui Lin\n\nagreed to pay Agent Rendon $500,000 for use of the boat; that Hui Lin\n\n\"did most of the talking\" during price negotiations; and that Hui Lin\n\ngave Agent Rendon over $30,000 as a deposit.       This evidence was\n\nsufficient to demonstrate that Hui Lin was in charge of the stateside\n\nportion of the venture, which was more than sufficient to support a\n\nfinding that he was a leader or organizer of the criminal activity.\n\n          Additionally, we note that Hui Lin was not affected by the\n\ndistrict court's decision to apply the \"role in the offense\"\n\nenhancement.   Hui Lin's guideline range, after the \"role in the\n\noffense\" enhancement was applied, was only 27-33 months and had to be\n\nraised to the statutory minimum of 36 months.      If the role in the\n\noffense enhancement had not been applied, Hui Lin's guideline range\n\nwould have been only 15-21 months, which the court would still have had\n\nto raise to the statutory minimum of 36 months. As a result, even if\n\nthe district court had erred in applying the role enhancement, Hui Lin\n\nwould not have been harmed in any way by the error. This is especially\n\nimportant because Hui Lin did not object at sentencing to the role\n\nenhancement. Consequently, we review only for a plain error affecting\n\nthe defendant's substantial rights. See United States v.
