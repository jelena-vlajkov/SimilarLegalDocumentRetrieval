Curran, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n              September 15, 1999\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge. Appellant Damian Ferreras\r\n(\"Ferreras\") was charged with possession with intent to distribute\r\nover fifty grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.\r\n841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(A). The district court heard testimony on\r\nFerreras's motion to suppress the physical evidence seized in his\r\napartment and, on the same day, the court denied the motion. \r\nSubsequently, the case was tried before a jury and Ferreras was\r\nconvicted of the sole count on which he was tried.  At the\r\nsentencing hearing, the government produced testimony that the\r\ncocaine base was crack.  The district court found that the\r\nsubstance was crack and sentenced Ferreras on that basis.  Ferreras\r\nwas sentenced to 121 months imprisonment and five years of\r\nsupervised release.  As a condition of supervision, Ferreras was\r\nordered to surrender at the completion of his term of imprisonment\r\nto the Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation\r\nproceedings.  This appeal followed.\r\n                   BACKGROUND\r\nThe following facts were adduced at trial.  On\r\nFebruary 19, 1997, at 4:30 p.m., detectives from the Providence\r\nPolice Intelligence Bureau went to the vicinity of 30 Pekin Street,\r\nProvidence with a search warrant for the second floor apartment at\r\nthat address.  30 Pekin Street is a three story tenement house. \r\nThe detectives saw Damian Ferreras's car parked in front of the\r\nhouse.  Damian Ferreras came out of a side door of the house and\r\ngot into the car.  The detectives stopped the car down the street\r\nand told Ferreras that they had a search warrant for his apartment. \r\nAn electronic pager was seized from Ferreras and he and his car\r\nwere brought back to the house.\r\nAt the house, a detective used a key from the key ring\r\ntaken from the ignition of Ferreras's car to open the side door of\r\nthe building.  A team of detectives went to the second floor and\r\nsearched the bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom for narcotics. \r\nDetectives Edward Leste and David Lussier went up the stairs to the\r\nattic where three bedrooms had been constructed.  Detective Lussier\r\nused a key from Ferreras's key ring to unlock one of the bedroom\r\ndoors.  In a small closet in this bedroom Detective Leste found a\r\npair of high leather boots.  From one of the boots he withdrew a\r\nclear plastic bag which held 101.74 grams of cocaine base.  The\r\ndetective, who has extensive experience in seizures of crack\r\ncocaine, recognized the cocaine base as being the lumpy, rocklike\r\nsubstance known as crack.  From the boot he also pulled $1,750 in\r\ncash.  Searching the room further, the detective found, in a frame\r\nfor a stereo speaker, an electronic digital scale of a type\r\ncommonly used to weigh narcotics.  On top of the frame the\r\ndetective found several pieces of personal paperwork bearing the\r\nname of Damian Ferreras, including recent court documents.  The\r\ndetectives testified that pagers, quantities of cash, electronic\r\nscales, and drugs, taken together, are common elements of drug\r\nsales operations.\r\nThe bedroom had one bed mattress on a box spring and a\r\nyoung man's clothing in the closet.  There was no indication that\r\nanyone other than Ferreras stayed in the bedroom.  Ferreras was\r\nbrought to the Providence Police Station where he was escorted to\r\nthe Intelligence Bureau Office.  He was informed of his Miranda\r\nwarnings in Spanish and English and questioned by Detective\r\nLussier.  Ferreras told the detective that the boots found in his\r\ncloset by Detective Leste had been bought by Ferreras on Canal\r\nStreet in New York City.  He said that the apartment where he was\r\nstaying belonged to his mother, that he slept in the upstairs\r\nbedroom periodically, and that he had last slept in the bedroom two\r\nnights previously but had spent the last night at his girlfriend's\r\nplace.  Ferreras went on to say that the money in the boot belonged\r\nto him, but that the drugs belonged to another man, for whom\r\nFerreras was holding the drugs.  Ferreras said he did not know the\r\nname of the other person but could call him on the telephone.\r\nThe crack seized from the boot was analyzed at the Rhode\r\nIsland Drug Chemistry Laboratory and tested positive for the\r\npresence of cocaine base.  The drugs weighed 101.74 grams (3.58\r\nounces).  The detectives testified from their experience that the\r\nvalue of crack was about $1,000 to $1,200 per ounce and that this\r\nquantity of crack was definitely intended for distribution.\r\nFerreras moved to suppress the physical evidence on\r\ngrounds that the search of the third floor exceeded the scope of\r\nthe warrant.  The government entered into evidence the search\r\nwarrant, the complaint, and the affidavit.\r\nThe face of the affidavit showed that Detective Edward\r\nLeste of the Providence Police Department had information from a\r\nreliable informant that Damian Ferreras \"is storing and selling\r\ncocaine from his apartment located at 30 Pekin Street, 2nd floor\r\napt., and also storing cocaine in the basement . . . .\"  The\r\naffidavit described 30 Pekin Street in Providence as a \"2 1/2 story\r\ndwelling and being grey with white trim in color.\"\r\nThe affidavit further showed that Detective Leste, within\r\na few days prior to February 19, 1997, had sent an informant into\r\n30 Pekin Street to buy cocaine.  The informant came out with\r\ncocaine and said that he had bought it from Damian Ferreras while\r\ninside the second floor apartment.\r\nOn February 19, 1997 a state court judge issued a warrant\r\nto search for cocaine, drug sale paraphernalia, and drug money. \r\nThe search warrant stated:\r\nPlace and person to be searched:\r\n30 Pekin Street, 2nd floor apartment and basement\r\nDamian Ferreras, John Doe, dob-2-21-75.\r\n\nLater that day a Providence Police raid team went to\r\nexecute the warrant at 30 Pekin Street.  Ferreras walked out of the\r\nhouse, got into a car, and drove down the street.  He was stopped\r\nby the police and brought back to the building he had just left\r\nalong with a set of keys from the ignition of the car he had been\r\ndriving.  The police used a key from the ring to enter a side door\r\non the ground floor of the building.\r\nJust inside the entrance there was a door leading to the\r\ncellar and a flight of stairs up to the second floor.  At the top\r\nof the stairs was a door with a lock.  The door opened into a small\r\nhallway on the second floor, and was closed but not locked.\r\nAbout five feet to the right of the stairway door was a\r\nlocked door which the police opened with a key from Ferreras's key\r\nring.  Through this door, the police entered living quarters on the\r\nsecond floor including a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a\r\nliving room.  About eight feet across the vestibule from the door\r\nto the second floor living quarters another set of steps led to the\r\nattic.  There was no door at the bottom, or at the top of the steps\r\nfrom the second floor hallway to the attic.\r\nIn the attic the police saw a hall with three rooms in a\r\nrow on the left-hand side.  These rooms appeared to have been\r\nrecently constructed and not part of the original building.  The\r\nfirst room's door was closed and locked and a detective opened it\r\nwith another key from Ferreras's key ring.  Inside was a box-spring\r\nand mattress and a closet full of a man's clothes.  Inside a boot\r\nthe police found the over 100 grams of crack.  There was also a\r\ntelevision set with a cable leading through a hole in the floor to\r\nthe second story.\r\nThe second room also had a bed and appeared to have been\r\nlived in.  The third one had only a mattress.  The right-hand side\r\nof the hallway was divided into two unfinished rooms which were\r\nstill under construction and revealed plaster, sheetrock, tools,\r\ndirty floors, and in one room a metal can of urine.  There was no\r\nsink, shower, bathtub, kitchen, refrigerator, stove, or pantry, and\r\nno running water anywhere in the attic.  There was a space heater\r\nin one of the attic rooms.  The only access to the attic was via\r\nthe set of steps from the small hallway on the second floor.  A\r\ndetective examined the electric meters on the exterior of the\r\nbuilding and found that one was for the first floor apartment, and\r\nthe other for the second floor.  There was none for the attic.\r\nFerreras called his brother Victor Ferreras who testified\r\nthat on February 19th there was a door at the foot of the steps\r\nleading to the attic, that there was a working sink and toilet in\r\nthe attic, and that there had been a shower but that he had\r\ndismantled it before the date of the raid.  Victor Ferreras said\r\nthat he had been manager of the property and that his brother and\r\nanother man lived in the attic.  He said his mother lived on the\r\nsecond floor but had been away in the Dominican Republic on the day\r\nthe police entered.\r\nIn rebuttal the government entered into evidence the\r\ntestimony of a defense investigator given at a bail hearing on the\r\ncase on March 6, 1997.  That investigator testified that he had\r\nexamined the attic just after the police raid and had not seen a\r\nbathroom.\r\nThe district court found that Victor Ferreras's testimony\r\nwas not credible.  Based on the facts described by the police, the\r\ncourt found that the attic and second floor were all one apartment. \r\nHe thus found that the search of the attic was within the scope of\r\nthe search warrant.\r\nAt sentencing, Ferreras argued that the substance that\r\nwas identified by the chemist as cocaine base at trial was not the\r\nform of cocaine base known by the street term \"crack.\"  The\r\ngovernment called as its witness Sargent David Lussier who had\r\nserved nearly eleven years on the Providence Police force.  During \r\nhis tenure on the force he had been involved in hundreds of\r\ninvestigations of crack cocaine trafficking, including seizures of\r\nthe drug and arrests of those trafficking it.  He had participated\r\nin a number of law enforcement courses, including a two week school\r\nrun by the Drug Enforcement Administration, during which he had\r\nstudied aspects of drug investigations.  Lussier explained how\r\ncrack is prepared, based on his instruction at school.  At the\r\nhearing he examined the cocaine base which had been seized from\r\nFerreras's boot and noted that it was hard, lumpy, and brown.  He\r\nsaid that those were the characteristics of crack cocaine and gave\r\nhis opinion that the substance was crack.  On cross-examination he\r\nfurther described the substance as crack based on \"the feel, the\r\ntexture, the sight, everything I know about the subject . . . .\"\r\nThe court declared that it was satisfied \"from all the\r\nevidence in the case\" that Ferreras had possessed crack cocaine and\r\nimposed the minimum sentence of imprisonment within the applicable\r\nguideline range, 121 months, as requested by the government.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nI.  The Suppression Motion\r\nOn appeal, Ferreras challenges the district court's\r\ndenial of his suppression motion, contending that the search of the\r\nattic at his 30 Pekin Street residence violated the Fourth\r\nAmendment.  His argument is without merit.\r\nOur review of a district court's decision to grant or\r\ndeny a suppression motion is plenary.  See United States v.\r\nMcCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996).  \"We defer, however, to\r\na district court's factual findings if, on a reasonable view of the\r\nevidence, they are not clearly erroneous.\"  United States v.\r\nDeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1311 (1st Cir. 1994).  A clear error exists\r\nonly if, after considering all the evidence, we are left with a\r\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  See\r\nUnited States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\nMoreover, we will uphold a district court's decision to deny a\r\nsuppression motion provided that any reasonable view of the\r\nevidence supports the decision.  See United States v. Garca, 983\r\nF.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n The Fourth Amendment serves to protect the individual's\r\ninterest in privacy.  Any search intruding upon that privacy\r\ninterest must be justified by probable cause and must satisfy the\r\nparticularity requirement, which limits the scope and intensity of\r\nthe search.  See United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 867 (1st\r\nCir. 1986).  When investigators fail to limit themselves to the\r\nparticulars in the warrant, both the particularity requirement and\r\nthe probable cause requirement are drained of all significance as\r\nrestraining mechanisms, and the warrant limitation becomes a\r\npractical nullity.  See id.  The concern here is the particularity\r\nrequirement's limitation on the area to be covered by the search\r\noperation.\r\nThe authority to search granted by any warrant is limited\r\nto the specific places described in it, and does not extend to\r\nadditional or different places.  See id. at 868.  However, \"search\r\nwarrants and affidavits should be considered in a common sense\r\nmanner, and hypertechnical readings should be avoided.\"  Id.  For\r\nexample, warrants authorizing a search of \"premises\" at a certain\r\naddress authorize a search of the buildings standing on that land.\r\nSee id. (citing United States v. Williams, 687 F.2d 290, 293 (9th\r\nCir. 1982); United States v. Meyer, 417 F.2d 1020, 1023 (8th Cir.\r\n1969)).  This Court has held that a warrant authorizing a search of\r\n\"the premises known as a single family trailer . . . with attached\r\ncarport,\" also authorized the search of a disabled car, parked\r\nadjacent to the carport, and a birdhouse hanging from a tree about\r\nfifteen feet from the trailer steps.  See United States v. Asselin,\r\n775 F.2d 445, 447 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nIn United States v. Heldt, 668 F.2d 1238, 1265 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1981), the language \"suite of offices of Mr. Heldt\" was given just\r\nas broad an interpretation as \"premises\" was given in Asselin.  The\r\ncourt looked at the question of whether or not a free-standing\r\noffice, not mentioned in the warrant, belonging to a person who did\r\nnot work for Heldt, could reasonably have been viewed by the\r\nsearching agents as constituting part of \"the suite of offices of\r\nMr. Heldt.\"  See Heldt, 668 F.2d at 1263.  The office was\r\nreasonably considered by the searching agents as part of, or even\r\nappurtenant to, the \"properties\" to be searched.  See id. at 1265;\r\nsee also  United States v. Prncipe, 499 F.2d 1135 (1st Cir. 1974)\r\n(where warrant authorized search of particular apartment in a\r\nbuilding, and cabinet was three to six feet away from entrance to\r\napartment in small hallway opposite door to apartment, officers\r\nexecuting search warrant could reasonably suppose cabinet was\r\nappurtenant to apartment).\r\nJust as in United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 868\r\n(1st Cir. 1986), where we held that even though Bonner's \"detached\r\ntwo car garage\" had never been mentioned in the description of\r\nplaces to be searched, it would have been reasonably considered\r\nwithin the scope of the warrant, the search of the attic at 30\r\nPekin Street must be reasonably considered part of the area\r\nintended to be searched.\r\nWhen one reached the second floor apartment at 30 Pekin\r\nStreet, there was a door with a lock (although at the time of the\r\nsearch, the door was closed but not locked).  The door opened into\r\na small hallway on the second floor.  In this hallway, about eight\r\nfeet across the vestibule from the door to the second floor living\r\nquarters, another set of steps led to the attic.  There was no door\r\nat either the bottom or the top of the steps securing access to the\r\nattic.\r\nIt is clear from the evidence that the attic was not\r\nindependent from the second floor living quarters.  Cable\r\ntelevision was supplied to the attic by a cable through a hole in\r\nthe floor to the second story.  While three of the rooms in the\r\nattic had either a mattress or a bed, two rooms in the attic were\r\nunfinished and contained sheetrock, tools, dirty floors, and a\r\nmetal can of urine.  There was no sink, shower, bathtub, kitchen,\r\nrefrigerator, stove, food, or running water in the attic.  While\r\nthere was an electric meter for the first floor, and one for the\r\nsecond floor, there was none for the attic.\r\nGiven that: (1) the attic was open to the second floor,\r\nbut not to the street or the first floor apartment; (2) the third\r\nfloor was not equipped for independent living; and (3) the occupant\r\nof the third floor had access to the second floor kitchen and\r\nbathroom, the district court's finding that the two floors were all\r\none apartment, and conclusion that the search warrant for the\r\nsecond floor apartment included the half story above it is\r\neminently reasonable and supported by the evidence.\r\nII.  Sentencing\r\nFerreras contends that the government failed to prove\r\nthat the 101.74 grams of cocaine base seized from the apartment was\r\nin fact crack cocaine.  He complains that the government produced\r\nno evidence as to the water solubility of the cocaine base.  In\r\nlight of our opinion in United States v. Martnez, 144 F.3d 189\r\n(1st Cir. 1998), his contentions are meritless.\r\nIn Martnez, we rejected an almost identical challenge. \r\nSee id. at 190.  We held squarely that, once the government laid a\r\nproper foundation \"by introducing a chemical analysis proving that,\r\nchemically, the contraband was cocaine base,\" id. at 190 (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(ellipses omitted), no further scientific evidence was needed. \r\nInstead, the government could bridge the evidentiary gap between\r\ncocaine base and crack cocaine by presenting lay opinion evidence\r\n(or an opinion proffered by an expert who possessed practical as\r\nopposed to academic credentials) from \"a reliable witness who\r\npossesses specialized knowledge\" (gained by experience in dealing\r\nwith crack or familiarity with its appearance and texture).  See\r\nid.; see also Robinson, 144 F.3d at 108-09.  Martnez and Robinson\r\nare controlling here.\r\nAs in Martnez, Ferreras posits that the government\r\nfailed to introduce testimony as to the water solubility of the\r\ncocaine base.  That statement is true as far as it goes, but it\r\ndoes not take Ferreras very far.  Water solubility is of no\r\nassistance in distinguishing among forms of cocaine base.  See\r\nMartnez, 144 F.3d at 190.  As we wrote in Robinson, 144 F.3d at\r\n108-09:  \"Chemical analysis cannot distinguish crack from any other\r\nform of cocaine base because crack and all other forms of cocaine\r\nbase are identical at the molecular level.  Thus, no further\r\nscientific testimony would have been of any conceivable  \r\nassistance . . . .\"\r\nIn this case, as in Martnez and Robinson, the government\r\nadduced competent scientific evidence from a chemist to prove that\r\nthe 101.74 grams of contraband associated with Ferreras's arrest\r\nwas cocaine base.  Given the witness's qualifications, his opinion\r\nconstituted competent proof of the fact that the substance was\r\ncocaine base.\r\nOnce the government introduced the chemical testimony, no\r\nadditional scientific evidence was needed.  From that point\r\nforward, as in Martnez and Robinson, competent lay testimony, such\r\nas that of Detective Leste, remarking on the substance's\r\ndistinctive appearance and texture and identifying it as crack,\r\ncompleted the final link in the evidentiary chain.  See Martnez,\r\n144 F.3d at 190.\r\nWe need say no more, no less.  In Robinson, we stated\r\nthat \"[o]n the strength of [such] proof, and in the utter absence\r\nof any controverting evidence,\" the district court's finding\r\n\"easily survive[d] clear-error review.\"  Robinson, 144 F.3d at 109.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n",

Ferreras told the detective that the boots found in his closet by Detective Leste had been bought by Ferreras on Canal Street in New York City. He said that the apartment where he was staying belonged to his mother, that he slept in the upstairs bedroom periodically, and that he had last slept in the bedroom two nights previously but had spent the last night at his girlfriend's place. Ferreras went on to say that the money in the boot belonged to him, but that the drugs belonged to another man, for whom Ferreras was holding the drugs. Ferreras said he did not know the name of the other person but could call him on the telephone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crack seized from the boot was analyzed at the Rhode Island Drug Chemistry Laboratory and tested positive for the presence of cocaine base. The drugs weighed 101.74 grams (3.58 ounces). The detectives testified from their experience that the value of crack was about $1,000 to $1,200 per ounce and that this quantity of crack was definitely intended for distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ferreras moved to suppress the physical evidence on grounds that the search of the third floor exceeded the scope of the warrant. The government entered into evidence the search warrant, the complaint, and the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The face of the affidavit showed that Detective Edward Leste of the Providence Police Department had information from a reliable informant that Damian Ferreras \"is storing and selling cocaine from his apartment located at 30 Pekin Street, 2nd floor apt., and also storing cocaine in the basement . . . .\" The affidavit described 30 Pekin Street in Providence as a \"2 1/2 story dwelling and being grey with white trim in color.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit further showed that Detective Leste, within a few days prior to February 19, 1997, had sent an informant into 30 Pekin Street to buy cocaine. The informant came out with cocaine and said that he had bought it from Damian Ferreras while inside the second floor apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 1997 a state court judge issued a warrant to search for cocaine, drug sale paraphernalia, and drug money. The search warrant stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Place and person to be searched:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">30 Pekin Street, 2nd floor apartment and basement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damian Ferreras, John Doe, dob-2-21-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day a Providence Police raid team went to execute the warrant at 30 Pekin Street. Ferreras walked out of the house, got into a car, and drove down the street. He was stopped by the police and brought back to the building he had just left along with a set of keys from the ignition of the car he had been driving. The police used a key from the ring to enter a side door on the ground floor of the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just inside the entrance there was a door leading to the cellar and a flight of stairs up to the second floor. At the top of the stairs was a door with a lock. The door opened into a small hallway on the second floor, and was closed but not locked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About five feet to the right of the stairway door was a locked door which the police opened with a key from Ferreras's key ring. Through this door, the police entered living quarters on the second floor including a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a living room. About eight feet across the vestibule from the door to the second floor living quarters another set of steps led to the attic. There was no door at the bottom, or at the top of the steps from the second floor hallway to the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the attic the police saw a hall with three rooms in a row on the left-hand side. These rooms appeared to have been recently constructed and not part of the original building. The first room's door was closed and locked and a detective opened it with another key from Ferreras's key ring. Inside was a box-spring and mattress and a closet full of a man's clothes. Inside a boot the police found the over 100 grams of crack. There was also a television set with a cable leading through a hole in the floor to the second story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second room also had a bed and appeared to have been lived in. The third one had only a mattress. The right-hand side of the hallway was divided into two unfinished rooms which were still under construction and revealed plaster, sheetrock, tools, dirty floors, and in one room a metal can of urine. There was no sink, shower, bathtub, kitchen, refrigerator, stove, or pantry, and no running water anywhere in the attic. There was a space heater in one of the attic rooms. The only access to the attic was via the set of steps from the small hallway on the second floor. A detective examined the electric meters on the exterior of the building and found that one was for the first floor apartment, and the other for the second floor. There was none for the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ferreras called his brother Victor Ferreras who testified that on February 19th there was a door at the foot of the steps leading to the attic, that there was a working sink and toilet in the attic, and that there had been a shower but that he had dismantled it before the date of the raid. Victor Ferreras said that he had been manager of the property and that his brother and another man lived in the attic. He said his mother lived on the second floor but had been away in the Dominican Republic on the day the police entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rebuttal the government entered into evidence the testimony of a defense investigator given at a bail hearing on the case on March 6, 1997. That investigator testified that he had examined the attic just after the police raid and had not seen a bathroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Victor Ferreras's testimony was not credible. Based on the facts described by the police, the court found that the attic and second floor were all one apartment. He thus found that the search of the attic was within the scope of the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Ferreras argued that the substance that was identified by the chemist as cocaine base at trial was not the form of cocaine base known by the street term \"crack.\" The government called as its witness Sargent David Lussier who had served nearly eleven years on the Providence Police force. During his tenure on the force he had been involved in hundreds of investigations of crack cocaine trafficking, including seizures of the drug and arrests of those trafficking it. He had participated in a number of law enforcement courses, including a two week school run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, during which he had studied aspects of drug investigations. Lussier explained how crack is prepared, based on his instruction at school. At the hearing he examined the cocaine base which had been seized from Ferreras's boot and noted that it was hard, lumpy, and brown. He said that those were the characteristics of crack cocaine and gave his opinion that the substance was crack. On cross-examination he further described the substance as crack based on \"the feel, the texture, the sight, everything I know about the subject . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court declared that it was satisfied \"from all the evidence in the case\" that Ferreras had possessed crack cocaine and imposed the minimum sentence of imprisonment within the applicable guideline range, 121 months, as requested by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. The Suppression Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ferreras challenges the district court's denial of his suppression motion, contending that the search of the attic at his 30 Pekin Street residence violated the Fourth Amendment. His argument is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a district court's decision to grant or deny a suppression motion is plenary. See United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996). \"We defer, however, to a district court's factual findings if, on a reasonable view of the evidence, they are not clearly erroneous.\" United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1311 (1st Cir. 1994). A clear error exists only if, after considering all the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. See United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1992). Moreover, we will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion provided that any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision. See United States v. Garca, 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment serves to protect the individual's interest in privacy. Any search intruding upon that privacy interest must be justified by probable cause and must satisfy the particularity requirement, which limits the scope and intensity of the search. See United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 867 (1st Cir. 1986). When investigators fail to limit themselves to the particulars in the warrant, both the particularity requirement and the probable cause requirement are drained of all significance as restraining mechanisms, and the warrant limitation becomes a practical nullity. See id. The concern here is the particularity requirement's limitation on the area to be covered by the search operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authority to search granted by any warrant is limited to the specific places described in it, and does not extend to additional or different places. See id. at 868. However, \"search warrants and affidavits should be considered in a common sense manner, and hypertechnical readings should be avoided.\" Id. For example, warrants authorizing a search of \"premises\" at a certain address authorize a search of the buildings standing on that land. See id. (citing United States v. Williams, 687 F.2d 290, 293 (9th Cir. 1982); United States v. Meyer, 417 F.2d 1020, 1023 (8th Cir. 1969)). This Court has held that a warrant authorizing a search of \"the premises known as a single family trailer . . . with attached carport,\" also authorized the search of a disabled car, parked adjacent to the carport, and a birdhouse hanging from a tree about fifteen feet from the trailer steps. See United States v. Asselin, 775 F.2d 445, 447 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Heldt, 668 F.2d 1238, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the language \"suite of offices of Mr. Heldt\" was given just as broad an interpretation as \"premises\" was given in Asselin. The court looked at the question of whether or not a free-standing office, not mentioned in the warrant, belonging to a person who did not work for Heldt, could reasonably have been viewed by the searching agents as constituting part of \"the suite of offices of Mr. Heldt.\" See Heldt, 668 F.2d at 1263. The office was reasonably considered by the searching agents as part of, or even appurtenant to, the \"properties\" to be searched. See id. at 1265; see also United States v. Prncipe, 499 F.2d 1135 (1st Cir. 1974) (where warrant authorized search of particular apartment in a building, and cabinet was three to six feet away from entrance to apartment in small hallway opposite door to apartment, officers executing search warrant could reasonably suppose cabinet was appurtenant to apartment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as in United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 868 (1st Cir. 1986), where we held that even though Bonner's \"detached two car garage\" had never been mentioned in the description of places to be searched, it would have been reasonably considered within the scope of the warrant, the search of the attic at 30 Pekin Street must be reasonably considered part of the area intended to be searched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When one reached the second floor apartment at 30 Pekin Street, there was a door with a lock (although at the time of the search, the door was closed but not locked). The door opened into a small hallway on the second floor. In this hallway, about eight feet across the vestibule from the door to the second floor living quarters, another set of steps led to the attic. There was no door at either the bottom or the top of the steps securing access to the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the evidence that the attic was not independent from the second floor living quarters. Cable television was supplied to the attic by a cable through a hole in the floor to the second story. While three of the rooms in the attic had either a mattress or a bed, two rooms in the attic were unfinished and contained sheetrock, tools, dirty floors, and a metal can of urine. There was no sink, shower, bathtub, kitchen, refrigerator, stove, food, or running water in the attic. While there was an electric meter for the first floor, and one for the second floor, there was none for the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that: (1) the attic was open to the second floor, but not to the street or the first floor apartment; (2) the third floor was not equipped for independent living; and (3) the occupant of the third floor had access to the second floor kitchen and bathroom, the district court's finding that the two floors were all one apartment, and conclusion that the search warrant for the second floor apartment included the half story above it is eminently reasonable and supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ferreras contends that the government failed to prove that the 101.74 grams of cocaine base seized from the apartment was in fact crack cocaine. He complains that the government produced no evidence as to the water solubility of the cocaine base. In light of our opinion in United States v. Martnez, 144 F.3d 189 (1st Cir. 1998), his contentions are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Martnez, we rejected an almost identical challenge. See id. at 190. We held squarely that, once the government laid a proper foundation \"by introducing a chemical analysis proving that, chemically, the contraband was cocaine base,\" id. at 190 (quoting United States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1998) (ellipses omitted), no further scientific evidence was needed. Instead, the government could bridge the evidentiary gap between cocaine base and crack cocaine by presenting lay opinion evidence (or an opinion proffered by an expert who possessed practical as opposed to academic credentials) from \"a reliable witness who possesses specialized knowledge\" (gained by experience in dealing with crack or familiarity with its appearance and texture). See id.; see also Robinson, 144 F.3d at 108-09. Martnez and Robinson are controlling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in Martnez, Ferreras posits that the government failed to introduce testimony as to the water solubility of the cocaine base. That statement is true as far as it goes, but it does not take Ferreras very far. Water solubility is of no assistance in distinguishing among forms of cocaine base. See Martnez, 144 F.3d at 190. As we wrote in Robinson, 144 F.3d at 108-09: \"Chemical analysis cannot distinguish crack from any other form of cocaine base because crack and all other forms of cocaine base are identical at the molecular level. Thus, no further scientific testimony would have been of any conceivable assistance . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, as in Martnez and Robinson, the government adduced competent scientific evidence from a chemist to prove that the 101.74 grams of contraband associated with Ferreras's arrest was cocaine base. Given the witness's qualifications, his opinion constituted competent proof of the fact that the substance was cocaine base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the government introduced the chemical testimony, no additional scientific evidence was needed. From that point forward, as in Martnez and Robinson, competent lay testimony, such as that of Detective Leste, remarking on the substance's distinctive appearance and texture and identifying it as crack, completed the final link in the evidentiary chain. See Martnez, 144 F.3d at 190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need say no more, no less. In Robinson, we stated that \"[o]n the strength of [such] proof, and in the utter absence of any controverting evidence,\" the district court's finding \"easily survive[d] clear-error review.\" Robinson, 144 F.3d at 109.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court heard testimony on Ferreras's motion to suppress the physical evidence seized in his apartment and, on the same day, the court denied the motion. Subsequently, the case was tried before a jury and Ferreras was convicted of the sole count on which he was tried. At the sentencing hearing, the government produced testimony that the cocaine base was crack. The district court found that the substance was crack and sentenced Ferreras on that basis. Ferreras was sentenced to 121 months imprisonment and five years of supervised release. As a condition of supervision, Ferreras was ordered to surrender at the completion of his term of imprisonment to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation proceedings. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts were adduced at trial. On February 19, 1997, at 4:30 p.m., detectives from the Providence Police Intelligence Bureau went to the vicinity of 30 Pekin Street, Providence with a search warrant for the second floor apartment at that address. 30 Pekin Street is a three story tenement house. The detectives saw Damian Ferreras's car parked in front of the house. Damian Ferreras came out of a side door of the house and got into the car. The detectives stopped the car down the street and told Ferreras that they had a search warrant for his apartment. An electronic pager was seized from Ferreras and he and his car were brought back to the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the house, a detective used a key from the key ring taken from the ignition of Ferreras's car to open the side door of the building. A team of detectives went to the second floor and searched the bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom for narcotics. Detectives Edward Leste and David Lussier went up the stairs to the attic where three bedrooms had been constructed. Detective Lussier used a key from Ferreras's key ring to unlock one of the bedroom doors. In a small closet in this bedroom Detective Leste found a pair of high leather boots. From one of the boots he withdrew a clear plastic bag which held 101.74 grams of cocaine base. The detective, who has extensive experience in seizures of crack cocaine, recognized the cocaine base as being the lumpy, rocklike substance known as crack. From the boot he also pulled $1,750 in cash. Searching the room further, the detective found, in a frame for a stereo speaker, an electronic digital scale of a type commonly used to weigh narcotics. On top of the frame the detective found several pieces of personal paperwork bearing the name of Damian Ferreras, including recent court documents. The detectives testified that pagers, quantities of cash, electronic scales, and drugs, taken together, are common elements of drug sales operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bedroom had one bed mattress on a box spring and a young man's clothing in the closet. There was no indication that anyone other than Ferreras stayed in the bedroom. Ferreras was brought to the Providence Police Station where he was escorted to the Intelligence Bureau Office. He was informed of his Miranda warnings in Spanish and English and questioned by Detective Lussier. Ferreras told the detective that the boots found in his closet by Detective Leste had been bought by Ferreras on Canal Street in New York City. He said that the apartment where he was staying belonged to his mother, that he slept in the upstairs bedroom periodically, and that he had last slept in the bedroom two nights previously but had spent the last night at his girlfriend's place. Ferreras went on to say that the money in the boot belonged to him, but that the drugs belonged to another man, for whom Ferreras was holding the drugs. Ferreras said he did not know the name of the other person but could call him on the telephone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crack seized from the boot was analyzed at the Rhode Island Drug Chemistry Laboratory and tested positive for the presence of cocaine base. The drugs weighed 101.74 grams (3.58 ounces). The detectives testified from their experience that the value of crack was about $1,000 to $1,200 per ounce and that this quantity of crack was definitely intended for distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ferreras moved to suppress the physical evidence on grounds that the search of the third floor exceeded the scope of the warrant. The government entered into evidence the search warrant, the complaint, and the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The face of the affidavit showed that Detective Edward Leste of the Providence Police Department had information from a reliable informant that Damian Ferreras \"is storing and selling cocaine from his apartment located at 30 Pekin Street, 2nd floor apt., and also storing cocaine in the basement . . . .\" The affidavit described 30 Pekin Street in Providence as a \"2 1/2 story dwelling and being grey with white trim in color.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit further showed that Detective Leste, within a few days prior to February 19, 1997, had sent an informant into 30 Pekin Street to buy cocaine. The informant came out with cocaine and said that he had bought it from Damian Ferreras while inside the second floor apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 1997 a state court judge issued a warrant to search for cocaine, drug sale paraphernalia, and drug money. The search warrant stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Place and person to be searched:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">30 Pekin Street, 2nd floor apartment and basement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damian Ferreras, John Doe, dob-2-21-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day a Providence Police raid team went to execute the warrant at 30 Pekin Street. Ferreras walked out of the house, got into a car, and drove down the street. He was stopped by the police and brought back to the building he had just left along with a set of keys from the ignition of the car he had been driving. The police used a key from the ring to enter a side door on the ground floor of the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just inside the entrance there was a door leading to the cellar and a flight of stairs up to the second floor. At the top of the stairs was a door with a lock. The door opened into a small hallway on the second floor, and was closed but not locked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About five feet to the right of the stairway door was a locked door which the police opened with a key from Ferreras's key ring. Through this door, the police entered living quarters on the second floor including a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a living room. About eight feet across the vestibule from the door to the second floor living quarters another set of steps led to the attic. There was no door at the bottom, or at the top of the steps from the second floor hallway to the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the attic the police saw a hall with three rooms in a row on the left-hand side. These rooms appeared to have been recently constructed and not part of the original building. The first room's door was closed and locked and a detective opened it with another key from Ferreras's key ring. Inside was a box-spring and mattress and a closet full of a man's clothes. Inside a boot the police found the over 100 grams of crack. There was also a television set with a cable leading through a hole in the floor to the second story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second room also had a bed and appeared to have been lived in. The third one had only a mattress. The right-hand side of the hallway was divided into two unfinished rooms which were still under construction and revealed plaster, sheetrock, tools, dirty floors, and in one room a metal can of urine. There was no sink, shower, bathtub, kitchen, refrigerator, stove, or pantry, and no running water anywhere in the attic. There was a space heater in one of the attic rooms. The only access to the attic was via the set of steps from the small hallway on the second floor. A detective examined the electric meters on the exterior of the building and found that one was for the first floor apartment, and the other for the second floor. There was none for the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ferreras called his brother Victor Ferreras who testified that on February 19th there was a door at the foot of the steps leading to the attic, that there was a working sink and toilet in the attic, and that there had been a shower but that he had dismantled it before the date of the raid. Victor Ferreras said that he had been manager of the property and that his brother and another man lived in the attic. He said his mother lived on the second floor but had been away in the Dominican Republic on the day the police entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rebuttal the government entered into evidence the testimony of a defense investigator given at a bail hearing on the case on March 6, 1997. That investigator testified that he had examined the attic just after the police raid and had not seen a bathroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Victor Ferreras's testimony was not credible. Based on the facts described by the police, the court found that the attic and second floor were all one apartment. He thus found that the search of the attic was within the scope of the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Ferreras argued that the substance that was identified by the chemist as cocaine base at trial was not the form of cocaine base known by the street term \"crack.\" The government called as its witness Sargent David Lussier who had served nearly eleven years on the Providence Police force. During his tenure on the force he had been involved in hundreds of investigations of crack cocaine trafficking, including seizures of the drug and arrests of those trafficking it. He had participated in a number of law enforcement courses, including a two week school run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, during which he had studied aspects of drug investigations. Lussier explained how crack is prepared, based on his instruction at school. At the hearing he examined the cocaine base which had been seized from Ferreras's boot and noted that it was hard, lumpy, and brown. He said that those were the characteristics of crack cocaine and gave his opinion that the substance was crack. On cross-examination he further described the substance as crack based on \"the feel, the texture, the sight, everything I know about the subject . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court declared that it was satisfied \"from all the evidence in the case\" that Ferreras had possessed crack cocaine and imposed the minimum sentence of imprisonment within the applicable guideline range, 121 months, as requested by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. The Suppression Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ferreras challenges the district court's denial of his suppression motion, contending that the search of the attic at his 30 Pekin Street residence violated the Fourth Amendment.

The door opened into a small hallway on the second floor. In this hallway, about eight feet across the vestibule from the door to the second floor living quarters, another set of steps led to the attic. There was no door at either the bottom or the top of the steps securing access to the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the evidence that the attic was not independent from the second floor living quarters. Cable television was supplied to the attic by a cable through a hole in the floor to the second story. While three of the rooms in the attic had either a mattress or a bed, two rooms in the attic were unfinished and contained sheetrock, tools, dirty floors, and a metal can of urine. There was no sink, shower, bathtub, kitchen, refrigerator, stove, food, or running water in the attic. While there was an electric meter for the first floor, and one for the second floor, there was none for the attic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that: (1) the attic was open to the second floor, but not to the street or the first floor apartment; (2) the third floor was not equipped for independent living; and (3) the occupant of the third floor had access to the second floor kitchen and bathroom, the district court's finding that the two floors were all one apartment, and conclusion that the search warrant for the second floor apartment included the half story above it is eminently reasonable and supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

He complains that the government produced no evidence as to the water solubility of the cocaine base. In light of our opinion in United States v. Martnez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197988\"><a href=\"/opinion/197988/united-states-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1998), his contentions are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Martnez, we rejected an almost identical challenge.

Instead, the government could bridge the evidentiary gap between cocaine base and crack cocaine by presenting lay opinion evidence (or an opinion proffered by an expert who possessed practical as opposed to academic credentials) from \"a reliable witness who possesses specialized knowledge\" (gained by experience in dealing with crack or familiarity with its appearance and texture). See id.; see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197938\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Robinson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197938/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">108-09</span></a></span>.

That statement is true as far as it goes, but it does not take Ferreras very far. Water solubility is of no assistance in distinguishing among forms of cocaine base. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Martnez,</span> <span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">190</span></span>.

Thus, no further scientific testimony would have been of any conceivable assistance . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, as in Martnez and Robinson, the government adduced competent scientific evidence from a chemist to prove that the 101.74 grams of contraband associated with Ferreras's arrest was cocaine base. Given the witness's qualifications, his opinion constituted competent proof of the fact that the substance was cocaine base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the government introduced the chemical testimony, no additional scientific evidence was needed. From that point forward, as in Martnez and Robinson, competent lay testimony, such as that of Detective Leste, remarking on the substance's distinctive appearance and texture and identifying it as crack, completed the final link in the evidentiary chain.
