In this matter, the district\n\ncourt, understandably deeming itself bound by our holding in\n\nWilliams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588 (1st Cir. 1995),\n\nruled that the plaintiffs' action — brought to enforce claims\n\nunder a labor and materials bond for wages and fringe benefit\n\ncontributions allegedly due in respect to construction of a\n\npublic works project in Peabody, Massachusetts — was preempted\n\nby the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n\n29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461, and in particular, 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).\n\nAccordingly,      the    court   terminated    the   action     by    entering\n\njudgment on the pleadings.\n\n            We have considerably greater freedom than the district\n\ncourts to evaluate the impact of recent Supreme Court precedent\n\non our previous decisions.         Having reexamined Williams against\n\nthe   changed    legal   landscape   that     now   confronts   us,    we   are\n\npersuaded    that   subsequent     developments       have   overtaken      our\n\ndecision.       Consequently, we abrogate the central holding of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fWilliams,1 reverse the judgment below, and remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The individual plaintiffs performed carpentry work on\n\na public works project in Peabody, Massachusetts.       All of them\n\nbelonged to Carpenters Local No. 26 (the union).       At the times\n\nrelevant   hereto,   their   employer,   Henry   Construction,   Inc.\n\n(Henry), was a party to a collective bargaining agreement with\n\nthe union that required contributions to various fringe benefit\n\nfunds on the individual plaintiffs' behalf.       Henry defaulted on\n\nthis obligation before completing the Peabody job.\n\n           In Massachusetts, a so-called bond statute, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 149, § 29, the pertinent text of which is set forth in\n\nthe margin,2 requires the general contractor on a public works\n\n\n     1Following the procedure described in cases such as Trailer\nMarine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 9 n.5 (1st\nCir. 1992), and Gallagher v. Wilton Enterprises, Inc., 962 F.2d\n120, 124 n.4 (1st Cir. 1992), the panel opinion in this case was\ncirculated to all active judges of the court prior to\npublication.    None interposed an objection to our proposed\ncourse of action.    We caution, however, that the use of this\ninformal procedure does not convert this opinion into an opinion\nen banc, nor does it preclude a suggestion of rehearing en banc\non any issue in the case.\n     2The statute provides:\n\n     Officers or agents contracting in behalf of the\n     commonwealth or in behalf of any county, city, town,\n\n                                 -3-\n\fproject to post a bond covering labor and materials (including\n\nindebtedness incurred by subcontractors and suppliers for wages\n\nand fringe benefits).   The general contractor on the Peabody\n\nproject obtained such a bond from defendant-appellee United\n\nStates Fidelity & Guaranty Company (USF&G).       When Henry, a\n\nsubcontractor, failed to make contributions in respect to fringe\n\nbenefits, the union's collection agent, Massachusetts Carpenters\n\nCentral Collection Agency (MCCCA), acting for the aggrieved\n\nemployees, staked a claim on the bond.\n\n\n    district or other political subdivision of the\n    commonwealth    .   .   .   for    the   construction,\n    reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or\n    demolition of public buildings or other public works\n    . . . shall obtain security by bond in an amount not\n    less than one half of the total contract price, for\n    payment by the contractor and subcontractors for labor\n    performed or furnished and materials used or employed\n    therein [subject to certain restrictions]; for payment\n    of transportation charges for materials used or\n    employed therein . . . ; for payment by such\n    contractor and subcontractors of any sums due for the\n    rental or hire of vehicles . . . and other appliances\n    and equipment . . . ; for payment of transportation\n    charges directly related to such rental or hire; and\n    for payment by such contractor and subcontractors of\n    any sums due trustees or other persons authorized to\n    collect   such   payments  from   the  contractor   or\n    subcontractors, based upon the labor performed or\n    furnished as aforesaid, for health and welfare plans,\n    supplementary unemployment benefit plans and other\n    fringe benefits which are payable in cash and provided\n    for in collective bargaining agreements between\n    organized labor and the contractor or subcontractors\n    . . . .\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 29.\n\n                              -4-\n\f            Resolution of the controversy eluded the parties.               The\n\nindividual     plaintiffs,    the    union,    and     MCCCA    (hereinafter\n\ncollectively    the    appellants)    then    sued    USF&G    in   the   state\n\nsuperior court.       The surety removed the action, see 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1441, and immediately sought judgment on the pleadings.                     The\n\nappellants opposed this initiative and moved to remand the\n\naction to the state court.          On November 3, 1998, the federal\n\ndistrict court denied the motion to remand.              Some seven months\n\nlater, it granted USF&G's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n\nRelying on Williams, the court anchored both orders in ERISA\n\npreemption.     This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\nII.     DISCUSSION\n\n            We review the district court's preemption ruling de\n\nnovo.     See Demars v. Cigna Corp., 173 F.3d 443, 445 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); Graham v.       Balcor Co., 146 F.3d 1052, 1054 (9th Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n            ERISA is a comprehensive statutory scheme that governs\n\nemployee benefit plans.       It was enacted in response to growing\n\nconcerns    about    \"the   mismanagement     of     funds    accumulated    to\n\nfinance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees\n\nbenefits from accumulated funds.\"          Massachusetts v. Morash, 490\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fU.S. 107, 115 (1989).       The statute brooks no interference; it\n\ncontains an express preemption clause providing that it shall\n\n\"supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or\n\nhereafter relate to any [covered] employee benefit plan.\"             29\n\nU.S.C. § 1144(a).   Thus, when state-law claims \"relate to\" ERISA\n\nplans, those claims are transmuted into ERISA claims.       See Whitt\n\nv. Sherman Int'l Corp., 147 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir. 1998);\n\nParrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F.3d 699, 703 (9th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 525 U.S. 1001 (1998).       In that situation, \"any civil\n\ncomplaint raising [such] a state law claim . . . is of necessity\n\nso federal in character that it arises under federal law for\n\npurposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and permits removal to federal\n\ncourt.\"   Plumbing Indus. Bd. v. E.W. Howell Co., 126 F.3d 61, 66\n\n(2d Cir. 1997).\n\n          Despite   this    prophylaxis,   ERISA   preemption   is   not\n\ninexorable.   As the language of section 1144(a) makes plain, the\n\nincidence of ERISA preemption turns on the parameters of the\n\nphrase \"relate to.\"        See California Div. of Labor Standards\n\nEnforcement v. Dillingham Constr., 519 U.S. 316, 324 (1997).\n\nThat locution is not self-defining, and the Justices have been\n\nat least mildly schizophrenic in mapping its contours.               The\n\nCourt initially glossed the phrase by portraying the scope of\n\nERISA preemption as \"deliberately expansive.\"         Pilot Life Ins.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fCo. v. Derdeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 46 (1987).              As time passed, it\n\ngrew more guarded, emphasizing the \"starting presumption that\n\nCongress does not intend to supplant state law,\" New York State\n\nConf. of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\n\n514 U.S. 645, 654 (1995); accord De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Med. &\n\nClin. Servs. Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 813 (1997), and warning that,\n\nunless congressional intent to preempt clearly appears, ERISA\n\nwill not be deemed to supplant state law in areas traditionally\n\nregulated    by   the   states,   see   Dillingham,    519   U.S.   at   325;\n\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 655.\n\n            Importantly, these variations in emphasis have led the\n\nCourt to conclude in recent years that the phrase \"relate to,\"\n\nas   used   in    ERISA's   preemption       provision,   cannot    be   read\n\nliterally.    \"If 'relate to' were taken to extend to the furthest\n\nstretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes\n\npreemption would never run its course . . . .\"               Travelers, 514\n\nU.S. at 655.      To scale the phrase down to size, the Court has\n\ndevised a disjunctive test:             \"A law relate[s] to a covered\n\nemployee benefit plan for purposes of § 514(a) if it [1] has a\n\nconnection with or [2] a reference to such a plan.\"             Dillingham,\n\n519 U.S. at 324 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(alterations      in    original).      We    apply   this   test   to   the\n\nMassachusetts bond statute, mindful that a state law which comes\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwithin the compass of either branch of the test is subject to\n\npreemption.\n\n                             A.   Connection.\n\n          Travelers plainly signaled a significant analytic shift\n\nin   regard   to   the    \"connection     with\"   portion   of   the   ERISA\n\npreemption inquiry,3 abandoning strict textualism in favor of a\n\nmore nuanced approach:\n\n          For the same reasons that infinite relations\n          cannot be the measure of pre-emption,\n          neither can infinite connections. We simply\n          must go beyond the unhelpful text and the\n          frustrating difficulty of defining its key\n          term, and look instead to the objectives of\n          the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of\n          the state law that Congress understood would\n          survive.\n\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 656; accord Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324.\n\n          Cataloguing the objectives of the ERISA statute is a\n\nfairly straightforward exercise.           When Congress conceived the\n\nERISA scheme, it made manifest its intention to \"protect . . .\n\nthe interests of participants in employee benefit plans and\n\ntheir beneficiaries . . . by establishing standards of conduct,\n\nresponsibility,     and    obligation     for   fiduciaries   of   employee\n\nbenefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies.\"                29\n\n\n      3\n     This aspect of the case does not require us to consider\nUSF&G's stare decisis argument.      Our decision in Williams\nfocused solely on the \"reference to\" furculum of ERISA\npreemption analysis, see 45 F.3d at 591, and we will discuss it\nunder that rubric. See infra Part II(B).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fU.S.C. § 1001(b).     Achieving this end requires the avoidance of\n\n\"a multiplicity of regulation\" and, concomitantly, the creation\n\nof   a    climate     that     \"permit[s]     the    nationally     uniform\n\nadministration of employee benefit plans.\"            Travelers, 514 U.S.\n\nat 657.   Using this template, the Massachusetts bond statute, on\n\nits face, in no way inhibits the accomplishment of ERISA's\n\noverall goals.\n\n           It   is   well    accepted,    however,   even   under   the   new\n\nregime, that state laws which furnish alternative enforcement\n\nmechanisms threaten the uniformity that Congress labored to\n\nachieve and thus are preempted by ERISA. 4             See id.; see also\n\nIngersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 142-45 (1990).\n\nThis category comes to mind because the most obvious tie between\n\n\n\n     4\n     In Ingersoll-Rand, the Supreme Court recognized that a\nstate law can be preempted as an alternative enforcement\nmechanism to ERISA § 502(a). See Ingersoll-Rand v. McClendon,\n498 U.S. 133, 142-45 (1990). In Travelers and its progeny, the\nCourt has yet to state unequivocally where § 502(a) preemption\nshould be placed within the reshaped ERISA doctrine. The Second\nCircuit, however, has treated the alternative enforcement\nmechanism inquiry as a separate branch of ERISA preemption\nanalysis.   See Howell, 126 F.3d at 68.    This is by no means\ninevitable.    Conceivably, alternative enforcement mechanism\npreemption can be considered as part and parcel of a\n\"connection\" or \"reference\" analysis, or fit under § 514(a) as\na category like \"connection\" and \"reference,\" or (as Howell\nsuggests) constitute a preemption prong independent of § 514(a).\nIn this case, it makes no difference under which heading we\nplace the inquiry, and so, while we discuss this subject under\nthe \"connection\" rubric for the sake of convenience, we leave\nthe question open.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthe    Massachusetts        bond     statute     and    ERISA      plans   as    a   class\n\nconcerns the former's role as a vehicle of enforcing funding\n\nobligations.         The question, then, is whether the bond statute\n\nimpermissibly supplies an alternative enforcement mechanism for\n\nERISA plan benefits (and thereby triggers preemption).                                See\n\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 658; Parrino, 146 F.3d at 705; see also\n\nTurner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, Inc., 127 F.3d 196, 199\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              We    answer    that      question       in    the   negative.         ERISA\n\npreemption         proscribes      the    type    of        alternative    enforcement\n\nmechanism that purposes to provide a remedy for the violation of\n\na right expressly guaranteed and exclusively enforced by the\n\nERISA statute.          See Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 145.                         Those\n\nstate laws which touch upon enforcement but have no real bearing\n\non    the    intricate      web    of    relationships         among   the      principal\n\nplayers       in     the     ERISA       scenario       (e.g.,      the      plan,     the\n\nadministrators, the fiduciaries, the beneficiaries, and the\n\nemployer) are not subject to preemption on this basis.                                 See\n\nWoodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170\n\nF.3d 985, 990 (10th Cir. 1999).                It follows that a state statute\n\nwhich only creates claims against a surety does not constitute\n\nan impermissible alternative enforcement mechanism as that term\n\nis    used    in    ERISA    jurisprudence.             See     Trustees     for     Mich.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fLaborers' Health Care Fund v. Seaboard Sur. Co., 137 F.3d 427,\n\n429 (6th Cir. 1998); Bleiler v. Cristwood Constr., Inc., 72 F.3d\n\n13, 15 (2d Cir. 1995).\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter. The Massachusetts\n\nbond     statute     does     not     constitute         a     proscribed      alternate\n\nenforcement mechanism.               By the same token, it has no other\n\nmeaningful nexus with ERISA; it does not, for example, interfere\n\nwith   the    administration         of     covered      employee      benefit       plans,\n\npurport      to    regulate        plan    benefits,          or    impose    additional\n\nreporting     requirements.               Last   —    but     far   from     least    —   it\n\nregulates an area of the law traditionally thought to be the\n\nstates' preserve:           enforcing contracts under state law for the\n\ncitizenry's protection.              See Operating Eng'rs Health & Welfare\n\nTrust Fund v. JWJ Contracting Co., 135 F.3d 671, 678 (9th Cir.\n\n1998);    Romney     v.     Lin,    105     F.3d      806,    811    (2d     Cir.    1997).\n\nConsequently, we conclude that the Massachusetts bond statute\n\ndoes not have a sufficient \"connection with\" covered employee\n\nbenefit plans to warrant ERISA preemption.\n\n                                    B.    Reference.\n\n             Discerning no impermissible connection, we turn to the\n\nsecond branch of the ERISA preemption analysis and ask whether\n\nthe    Massachusetts        bond     statute         refers    to    covered    employee\n\nbenefit plans so directly as to justify preemption.                             Prior to\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fthe Supreme Court's decision in Travelers, this court answered\n\nthat query affirmatively, holding that the bond statute singled\n\nout ERISA plans and was therefore preempted.            See Williams, 45\n\nF.3d at 591.      In USF&G's view, that ought to be the end of the\n\nmatter.   Because special circumstances obtain here, we disagree.\n\n            We do not gainsay that the principle of stare decisis\n\nforms an integral part of our system of justice.            Withal, that\n\nsystem is not only precedent-based but also hierarchical.            When\n\nemergent Supreme Court case law calls into question a prior\n\nopinion of another court, that court should pause to consider\n\nits likely significance before giving effect to an earlier\n\ndecision.    See, e.g., Odum v. Boone, 62 F.3d 327, 332 n.2 (10th\n\nCir. 1995); Pritzker v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,\n\nInc., 7 F.3d 1110, 1115 (3d Cir. 1993).          Indeed, Williams itself\n\nacknowledged that there would be occasions, albeit \"relatively\n\nrare,\" on which a newly constituted panel should eschew prior\n\ncircuit precedent in deference to intervening authority.               45\n\nF.3d at 592.      Our task, then, is to determine whether Williams,\n\nthough not directly overruled or superseded, fairly can be said\n\nto have fallen by the wayside.          We conclude that it has.\n\n            Let   us   be   perfectly   clear.     We   value   finality,\n\nstability, and certainty in the law, particularly in the field\n\nof statutory construction.        See Hubbard v. United States, 514\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fU.S.   695,   711    (1995).        But    stare    decisis   is   neither   a\n\nstraightjacket nor an immutable rule; it leaves room for courts\n\nto balance their respect for precedent against insights gleaned\n\nfrom new developments, and to make informed judgments as to\n\nwhether earlier decisions retain preclusive force.                 See United\n\nStates v. Connor, 926 F.2d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 1991).                 We explain\n\nbelow why we believe that this case represents one of those\n\nuncommon instances in which intervening developments in the law\n\nmake reconsideration appropriate.\n\n            The place to begin such an odyssey normally would be\n\nwith Williams itself.        Here, however, we retreat further into\n\nthe past, cognizant that Williams relied heavily on an earlier\n\nprecedent, McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 950\n\nF.2d   13   (1st    Cir.   1991).         Given    that   symbiosis,   gaining\n\nperspective on Williams necessitates an appreciation of McCoy.\n\n            In McCoy, we ruled that ERISA preempted the operation\n\nof a Massachusetts mechanics' lien statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n254, because the language of the statute \"expressly single[d]\n\nout ERISA plans for special treatment.\"               McCoy, 950 F.2d at 19.\n\nWe noted that the mechanics' lien statute, by its terms, inured\n\nto the advantage of \"the trustee or trustees of any fund or\n\nfunds, established pursuant to section 302 of the Taft Hartley\n\nLaw (29 U.S.C. 186), providing coverage or benefits to [an\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\femployee].\"     Id. (quoting statute).   On that basis, we concluded\n\nthat:\n\n             [A]ny plan that grants benefits under 29\n             U.S.C. § 186, which is another way of\n             describing any plan that grants benefits\n             under section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act,\n             is by definition an ERISA plan.          Put\n             bluntly, by singling out \"section 302\" plans\n             for special treatment, the Massachusetts\n             mechanics' lien law, in the same stroke,\n             singles   out   ERISA  plans   for   special\n             treatment.   It is, therefore, preempted as\n             it applies to ERISA-regulated plans.\n\nId. at 19-20.      We attributed this conclusion in large part to\n\nwhat we termed \"considered dictum,\"        id. at 19, appearing in\n\nMackey v.     Lanier Collection Agency, 486 U.S. 825, 838 n.12\n\n(1988) (declaring that \"any state law which singles out ERISA\n\nplans, by express reference, for special treatment is pre-\n\nempted\").5\n\n             McCoy set the stage for Williams.   There, we harkened\n\nback to McCoy and depicted the mechanics' lien statute and the\n\nbond statute as \"sisters under the skin.\"      Williams, 45 F.3d at\n\n592.       Because we \"perceive[d] no rational basis on which to\n\ndistinguish between [them] for the purpose of gauging ERISA's\n\n\n\n       5\n     Footnote 12 of Mackey (and, thus, the McCoy rationale)\nlikely endures.     See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324.        The\nmechanics' lien statute does not; the Massachusetts legislature\namended it in 1996 to eliminate any mention of \"trustees\" and\n\"section 302 of the Taft Hartley Act.\" See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n254, § 1 (Supp. 2000).\n\n                                -14-\n\fpreemptive reach,\" we concluded that ERISA preempted the latter\n\nstatute.     Id. at 591.       It is this holding that we reexamine\n\ntoday.\n\n            The key precedents are the Supreme Court's subsequent\n\nopinions in Travelers and Dillingham.          The extent to which the\n\nanalytical shift chronicled in these opinions applies to the\n\n\"reference to\" aspect of the ERISA preemption inquiry is less\n\nthan   obvious.      The   Travelers   Court   quickly   ruled   out    any\n\npossibility that the state law it was called upon to consider\n\nmade reference to an ERISA plan and refined the ERISA preemption\n\nanalysis in the context of the \"connection with\" inquiry.               See\n\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 656.       The Dillingham Court recounted the\n\nreasoning    of    Travelers    without   explicitly     limiting      that\n\nreasoning to the \"connection with\" inquiry, but its actual\n\ntreatment of the \"reference to\" question relied entirely on pre-\n\nTravelers precedent and made only passing mention of ERISA's\n\nobjectives.       See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 325-28.        Thus, both\n\nopinions stop short of explicitly endorsing a new analytic\n\nmodality for the \"reference to\" inquiry.          See Prudential Ins.\n\nCo. v. National Park Med. Ctr., 154 F.3d 812, 820-22 (8th Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n            USF&G contends that, absent an outright endorsement,\n\nwe should disregard the reasoning of Travelers and Dillingham in\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fpursuing the \"reference to\" question.           We think not.     Although\n\nthe Travelers Court had no occasion to link its newly conceived\n\n\"objectives\" analysis to the \"reference to\" inquiry, the two\n\nbuilding blocks on which that analysis rests — the starting\n\npresumption that Congress did not intend to supplant state law\n\nand the requirement that no preemption be deemed to occur in\n\nareas of traditional state regulation except in accord with the\n\nclear and manifest purpose of Congress — logically undergird\n\nboth inquiries.     See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 654-56 (dealing with\n\nbaseline      presumptions     before      beginning    its     bifurcated\n\n\"connection with\" and \"reference to\" analyses).          We thus proceed\n\nto   apply   the   teachings   of   Travelers    and   Dillingham   as   we\n\nunderstand them.\n\n             To begin with, Dillingham makes clear that two types\n\nof state laws — those that impose requirements by reference to\n\nERISA plans and those that specifically exempt ERISA plans from\n\notherwise generally applicable provisions — as well as state\n\ncauses of action that are predicated on the existence of ERISA\n\nplans all refer to, and thus relate to, ERISA plans for purposes\n\nof 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).        See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324-25.\n\nPut another way, in the post-Travelers era the \"reference to\"\n\ninquiry will result in preemption \"[w]here a State's law acts\n\nimmediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans . . . or where the\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fexistence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation.\"\n\nId. at 325 (citations omitted).\n\n           Examining Williams through the prism of Travelers and\n\nDillingham, a rational distinction between the mechanics' lien\n\nstatute and the bond statute, not previously thought to be\n\nimportant, bubbles to the surface:        unlike the mechanics' lien\n\nstatute, the bond statute makes no direct reference to section\n\n302.    Instead, it states that bonds for public works projects\n\nshall cover, in addition to labor and materials,\n\n           any sums due trustees or other persons\n           authorized to collect such payments from the\n           contractor or subcontractors, based upon the\n           labor performed or furnished as aforesaid,\n           for health and welfare plans, supplementary\n           unemployment benefit plans and other fringe\n           benefits which are payable in cash and\n           provided   for  in   collective   bargaining\n           agreements between organized labor and the\n           contractor or subcontractors . . . .\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 29.    The language concerning trustees\n\nis not ERISA-specific, but stands at the end of a long list of\n\nitems that contractors are required to secure (e.g., amounts due\n\nfor    labor   performed,   materials    furnished,   transportation,\n\nequipment rental, and the like).        The diversity of this list is\n\ntelling (especially since most of these items have nothing\n\nwhatever to do with ERISA).        Furthermore, the bond statute\n\ntreats contributions to fringe benefit plans in exactly the same\n\nmanner as it treats the other (non-ERISA-related) elements that\n\n                                 -17-\n\ffall within the statutory sweep.     Given the Dillingham screen,\n\nthis combination of factors stretches any inference that the\n\nbond statute singles out ERISA plans for special treatment past\n\nthe breaking point.6   See Seaboard Sur., 137 F.3d at 429.\n\n          Dillingham confirms in another way that a reviewing\n\ncourt should differentiate between the mechanics' lien statute\n\nand the bond statute for purposes of the \"reference to\" inquiry.\n\nThe Supreme Court's approach there reflects a conservative view\n\nof the inquiry, suggesting that a reference must be patent\n\nbefore ERISA preemption looms.   See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324-\n\n25.   The precedents that Dillingham cites, see id., illustrate\n\nthis point.7   In each of those cases, an ERISA plan lay at the\n\n\n      6\n     Temporal    considerations bolster    this   conclusion.\nMassachusetts adopted the bond statute in 1957 — a quarter-\ncentury before Congress enacted ERISA.       This chronology\nundercuts any inference that the drafters of the statute\nintended to target ERISA plans. See JWJ Contracting, 135 F.3d\nat 679.\n      7\n     The Court listed three examples.     (1) The reference in\nMackey was too explicit to be construed any other way:       the\nstatute at issue there targeted \"[f]unds or benefits of a\npension, retirement, or employee benefit plan or program subject\nto the provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act . . . .\" Mackey, 486 U.S. at 828 n.2 (quoting Ga.\nCode Ann. § 18-4-22.1). (2) In Ingersoll-Rand, the plaintiff's\ncause of action was based on an allegation that his employer\ndischarged him to avoid making contributions to his pension\nfund, and, thus, \"in order to prevail, [the] plaintiff must\nplead, and the court must find, that an ERISA plan exists and\nthe employer had a pension-defeating motive in terminating the\nemployment.\"   Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 140.      (3) So too\nDistrict of Columbia v. Greater Washington Board of Trade, 506\n\n                              -18-\n\fcenter of the inquiry.    In contrast, the bond statute functions\n\nirrespective of the existence or non-existence of an ERISA plan.\n\n            The   sockdolager   is    that    emergent   Supreme   Court\n\nprecedent, by disavowing a strictly textual approach to the\n\ninterpretation of ERISA's preemption provision, encourages us\n\nfor the first time to conduct the \"reference to\" inquiry in\n\nlight of the actual operation of the challenged state statute.\n\nSee De Buono, 520 U.S. at 815; Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324-25.\n\nHere, that glimpse is revealing.             The bond statute neither\n\nimposes requirements on ERISA plans nor exempts such plans from\n\notherwise    applicable   statutory     provisions.      In   operation,\n\ntherefore, the statute comports fully with ERISA's objectives.\n\nFurthermore, it does not dictate the form that a covered plan\n\nmay take, specify the mode or manner of plan administration, or\n\njeopardize the sort of uniformity that Congress aspired to\n\nachieve.    Given these facts, the statutory reference to the term\n\n\"trustees\" seems too tenuous to trigger ERISA preemption.            See\n\nHowell, 126 F.3d at 68.     Indeed, the case at hand is, in this\n\nrespect, reminiscent of Dillingham, in which the Supreme Court\n\nheld that a statutory mention of an apprenticeship program was\n\n\n\nU.S. 125 (1992), in which the Court held preempted a state\nstatute that required employers to provide health insurance\ncoverage for eligible employees \"at the same benefit level\" as\nthat already provided by existing ERISA plans. Id. at 130.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fnot sufficient to cause preemption under the \"reference to\"\n\nprong.   See 519 U.S. at 325.\n\n          USF&G's argument that the bond statute singles out\n\nERISA plans because it is limited to public (as opposed to\n\nprivate) construction contracts lacks force.        It is common\n\nground that state laws of general application are safe from\n\nERISA preemption even if they impose some incidental burdens on\n\nthe administration of covered plans.     See Washington Physicians\n\nServ. Ass'n v. Gregoire, 147 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir. 1998),\n\ncert. denied, 525 U.S. 1141 (1999); Howell, 126 F.3d at 67; cf.\n\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 659-60 (explaining that the fact that a\n\nlaw has an indirect economic influence on ERISA plans does not,\n\nin and of itself, justify preemption).    USF&G's argument amounts\n\nto a claim that the bond statute is something other than a law\n\nof general application.\n\n          In our view, the concept of \"general application\"\n\ncannot be parsed that closely.     A state law that applies to a\n\nwide variety of situations, including an appreciable number that\n\nhave no specific linkage to ERISA plans, constitutes a law of\n\ngeneral application for purposes of 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).      See,\n\ne.g., Mackey, 486 U.S. at 838 n.12; Shea v. Esensten, 208 F.3d\n\n712, 717 (8th Cir. 2000); Arizona State Carpenters Pension Trust\n\nFund v. Citibank (Ariz.), 125 F.3d 715, 724 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fUnder this definition, the bond statute ranks as a law of\n\ngeneral application for ERISA preemption purposes because it\n\napplies    to    a    sufficiently     broad,    sufficiently      generalized\n\nuniverse of situations — all Massachusetts public works projects\n\n— without mentioning ERISA and without regard to whether any\n\naffected person is (or is not) involved with a covered plan.\n\nSee De Buono, 520 U.S. at 815; Howell, 126 F.3d at 67-68.\n\n           To sum up, the bond statute, gauged by the principles\n\nembodied in recent Supreme Court case law, neither singles out\n\nERISA plans for special treatment nor depends on their existence\n\nas an essential part of its operation.                Rather, the statute is\n\n\"indifferent to . . . ERISA coverage.\"                Dillingham, 519 U.S. at\n\n328.    It is properly classified, therefore, as \"one of 'myriad\n\nstate laws' of general applicability that impose some burdens on\n\nthe    administration     of   ERISA     plans   but    nevertheless     do   not\n\n'relate to' them within the meaning of the governing statute.\"\n\nDe    Buono,    520   U.S.   at   815.        Thus,    it   does   not   trigger\n\npreemption.      See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 656; JWJ Contracting,\n\n135 F.3d at 679; Howell, 126 F.3d at 68.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.         The issue here is whether ERISA\n\npreempts the appellants' state-law cause of action.                 Believing,\n\nas we do, that Williams no longer aids us in our consideration\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fof this issue, we abrogate its central holding.   See supra note\n\n1 & accompanying text.\n\n         Taking a fresh look at the Massachusetts bond statute\n\nand giving due weight to Travelers and its progeny, we conclude\n\nthat USF&G has not overcome the starting presumption against\n\npreemption.   Accordingly, the bond statute does not \"relate to\"\n\nany covered employee benefit plan within the meaning of 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1144(a).   It follows that the entry of judgment on the\n\npleadings must be reversed and the case remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.8\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n    8On remand, the lower court should consider whether any\nother basis for federal jurisdiction exists (and if it discerns\nnone, should restore the case to a state forum).\n\n                              -22-\n\f",

Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588 (1st Cir. 1995), ruled that the plaintiffs' action - brought to enforce claims under a labor and materials bond for wages and fringe benefit contributions allegedly due in respect to construction of a public works project in Peabody, Massachusetts - was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1001-1461, and in particular, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).

Consequently, we abrogate the central holding of Williams,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> reverse the judgment below, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual plaintiffs performed carpentry work on a public works project in Peabody, Massachusetts. All of them belonged to Carpenters Local No. 26 (the union). At the times relevant hereto, their employer, Henry Construction, Inc. (Henry), was a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the union that required contributions to various fringe benefit funds on the individual plaintiffs' behalf. Henry defaulted on this obligation before completing the Peabody job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts, a so-called bond statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 29, the pertinent text of which is set forth in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> requires the general contractor on a public works project to post a bond covering labor and materials (including indebtedness incurred by subcontractors and suppliers for wages and fringe benefits). The general contractor on the Peabody project obtained such a bond from defendant-appellee United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G). When Henry, a subcontractor, failed to make contributions in respect to fringe benefits, the union's collection agent, Massachusetts Carpenters Central Collection Agency (MCCCA), acting for the aggrieved employees, staked a claim on the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resolution of the controversy eluded the parties. The individual plaintiffs, the union, and MCCCA (hereinafter collectively the appellants) then sued USF&amp;G in the state superior court. The surety removed the action, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441, and immediately sought judgment on the pleadings. The appellants opposed this initiative and moved to remand the action to the state court. On November 3, 1998, the federal district court denied the motion to remand. Some seven months later, it granted USF&amp;G's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Relying on Williams, the court anchored both orders in ERISA preemption. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's preemption ruling de novo. See Demars v. Cigna Corp., 173 F.3d 443, 445 (1st Cir. 1999); Graham v. Balcor Co., 146 F.3d 1052, 1054 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA is a comprehensive statutory scheme that governs employee benefit plans. It was enacted in response to growing concerns about \"the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.\" Massachusetts v. Morash, 490 U.S. 107, 115 (1989). The statute brooks no interference; it contains an express preemption clause providing that it shall \"supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any [covered] employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a). Thus, when state-law claims \"relate to\" ERISA plans, those claims are transmuted into ERISA claims. See Whitt v. Sherman Int'l Corp., 147 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir. 1998); Parrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F.3d 699, 703 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1001 (1998). In that situation, \"any civil complaint raising [such] a state law claim... is of necessity so federal in character that it arises under federal law for purposes of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 and permits removal to federal court.\" Plumbing Indus. Bd. v. E.W. Howell Co., 126 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this prophylaxis, ERISA preemption is not inexorable. As the language of section 1144(a) makes plain, the incidence of ERISA preemption turns on the parameters of the phrase \"relate to.\" See California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., 519 U.S. 316, 324 (1997). That locution is not self-defining, and the Justices have been at least mildly schizophrenic in mapping its contours. The Court initially glossed the phrase by portraying the scope of ERISA preemption as \"deliberately expansive.\" Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Derdeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 46 (1987). As time passed, it grew more guarded, emphasizing the \"starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law,\" New York State Conf. of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 654 (1995); accord De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Med. &amp; Clin. Servs. Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 813 (1997), and warning that, unless congressional intent to preempt clearly appears, ERISA will not be deemed to supplant state law in areas traditionally regulated by the states, see Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 325; Travelers, 514 U.S. at 655.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, these variations in emphasis have led the Court to conclude in recent years that the phrase \"relate to,\" as used in ERISA's preemption provision, cannot be read literally. \"If 'relate to' were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes preemption would never run its course....\" Travelers, 514 U.S. at 655. To scale the phrase down to size, the Court has devised a disjunctive test: \"A law relate[s] to a covered employee benefit plan for purposes of &#167; 514(a) if it [1] has a connection with or [2] a reference to such a plan.\" Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original). We apply this test to the Massachusetts bond statute, mindful that a state law which comes within the compass of either branch of the test is subject to preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Connection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers plainly signaled a significant analytic shift in regard to the \"connection with\" portion of the ERISA preemption inquiry,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> abandoning strict textualism in favor of a more nuanced approach:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons that infinite relations cannot be the measure of pre-emption, neither can infinite connections. We simply must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers, 514 U.S. at 656; accord Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cataloguing the objectives of the ERISA statute is a fairly straightforward exercise. When Congress conceived the ERISA scheme, it made manifest its intention to \"protect... the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries... by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001(b). Achieving this end requires the avoidance of \"a multiplicity of regulation\" and, concomitantly, the creation of a climate that \"permit[s] the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\" Travelers, 514 U.S. at 657. Using this template, the Massachusetts bond statute, on its face, in no way inhibits the accomplishment of ERISA's overall goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well accepted, however, even under the new regime, that state laws which furnish alternative enforcement mechanisms threaten the uniformity that Congress labored to achieve and thus are preempted by ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See id.; see also Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 142-45 (1990). This category comes to mind because the most obvious tie between the Massachusetts bond statute and ERISA plans as a class concerns the former's role as a vehicle of enforcing funding obligations. The question, then, is whether the bond statute impermissibly supplies an alternative enforcement mechanism for ERISA plan benefits (and thereby triggers preemption). See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658; Parrino, 146 F.3d at 705; see also Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, Inc., 127 F.3d 196, 199 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We answer that question in the negative. ERISA preemption proscribes the type of alternative enforcement mechanism that purposes to provide a remedy for the violation of a right expressly guaranteed and exclusively enforced by the ERISA statute. See Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 145. Those state laws which touch upon enforcement but have no real bearing on the intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario (e.g., the plan, the administrators, the fiduciaries, the beneficiaries, and the employer) are not subject to preemption on this basis. See Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985, 990 (10th Cir. 1999). It follows that a state statute which only creates claims against a surety does not constitute an impermissible alternative enforcement mechanism as that term is used in ERISA jurisprudence. See Trustees for Mich. Laborers' Health Care Fund v. Seaboard Sur. Co., 137 F.3d 427, 429 (6th Cir. 1998); Bleiler v. Cristwood Constr., Inc., 72 F.3d 13, 15 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. The Massachusetts bond statute does not constitute a proscribed alternate enforcement mechanism. By the same token, it has no other meaningful nexus with ERISA; it does not, for example, interfere with the administration of covered employee benefit plans, purport to regulate plan benefits, or impose additional reporting requirements. Last - but far from least -it regulates an area of the law traditionally thought to be the states' preserve: enforcing contracts under state law for the citizenry's protection. See Operating Eng'rs Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund v. JWJ Contracting Co., 135 F.3d 671, 678 (9th Cir. 1998); Romney v. Lin, 105 F.3d 806, 811 (2d Cir. 1997). Consequently, we conclude that the Massachusetts bond statute does not have a sufficient \"connection with\" covered employee benefit plans to warrant ERISA preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discerning no impermissible connection, we turn to the second branch of the ERISA preemption analysis and ask whether the Massachusetts bond statute refers to covered employee benefit plans so directly as to justify preemption. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Travelers, this court answered that query affirmatively, holding that the bond statute singled out ERISA plans and was therefore preempted. See Williams, 45 F.3d at 591. In USF&amp;G's view, that ought to be the end of the matter. Because special circumstances obtain here, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not gainsay that the principle of stare decisis forms an integral part of our system of justice. Withal, that system is not only precedent-based but also hierarchical. When emergent Supreme Court case law calls into question a prior opinion of another court, that court should pause to consider its likely significance before giving effect to an earlier decision. See, e.g., Odum v. Boone, 62 F.3d 327, 332 n.2 (10th Cir. 1995); Pritzker v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 7 F.3d 1110, 1115 (3d Cir. 1993). Indeed, Williams itself acknowledged that there would be occasions, albeit \"relatively rare,\" on which a newly constituted panel should eschew prior circuit precedent in deference to intervening authority. 45 F.3d at 592. Our task, then, is to determine whether Williams, though not directly overruled or superseded, fairly can be said to have fallen by the wayside. We conclude that it has.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We value finality, stability, and certainty in the law, particularly in the field of statutory construction. See Hubbard v. United States, 514 U.S. 695, 711 (1995). But stare decisis is neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule; it leaves room for courts to balance their respect for precedent against insights gleaned from new developments, and to make informed judgments as to whether earlier decisions retain preclusive force. See United States v. Connor, 926 F.2d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 1991). We explain below why we believe that this case represents one of those uncommon instances in which intervening developments in the law make reconsideration appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The place to begin such an odyssey normally would be with Williams itself. Here, however, we retreat further into the past, cognizant that Williams relied heavily on an earlier precedent, McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 950 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1991). Given that symbiosis, gaining perspective on Williams necessitates an appreciation of McCoy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In McCoy, we ruled that ERISA preempted the operation of a Massachusetts mechanics' lien statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 254, because the language of the statute \"expressly single[d] out ERISA plans for special treatment.\" McCoy, 950 F.2d at 19. We noted that the mechanics' lien statute, by its terms, inured to the advantage of \"the trustee or trustees of any fund or funds, established pursuant to section 302 of the Taft Hartley Law (29 U.S.C. 186), providing coverage or benefits to [an employee].\" Id. (quoting statute). On that basis, we concluded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny plan that grants benefits under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 186, which is another way of describing any plan that grants benefits under section 302 of the Taft- Hartley Act, is by definition an ERISA plan. Put bluntly, by singling out \"section 302\" plans for special treatment, the Massachusetts mechanics' lien law, in the same stroke, singles out ERISA plans for special treatment. It is, therefore, preempted as it applies to ERISA-regulated plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 19-20. We attributed this conclusion in large part to what we termed \"considered dictum,\" id. at 19, appearing in Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency, 486 U.S. 825, 838 n.12 (1988) (declaring that \"any state law which singles out ERISA plans, by express reference, for special treatment is pre-empted\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCoy set the stage for Williams. There, we harkened back to McCoy and depicted the mechanics' lien statute and the bond statute as \"sisters under the skin.\" Williams, 45 F.3d at 592. Because we \"perceive[d] no rational basis on which to distinguish between [them] for the purpose of gauging ERISA's preemptive reach,\" we concluded that ERISA preempted the latter statute. Id. at 591. It is this holding that we re-examine today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key precedents are the Supreme Court's subsequent opinions in Travelers and Dillingham. The extent to which the analytical shift chronicled in these opinions applies to the \"reference to\" aspect of the ERISA preemption inquiry is less than obvious. The Travelers Court quickly ruled out any possibility that the state law it was called upon to consider made reference to an ERISA plan and refined the ERISA preemption analysis in the context of the \"connection with\" inquiry. See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 656. The Dillingham Court recounted the reasoning of Travelers without explicitly limiting that reasoning to the \"connection with\" inquiry, but its actual treatment of the \"reference to\" question relied entirely on pre-Travelers precedent and made only passing mention of ERISA's objectives. See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 325-28. Thus, both opinions stop short of explicitly endorsing a new analytic modality for the \"reference to\" inquiry. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. National Park Med. Ctr., 154 F.3d 812, 820-22 (8th Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USF&amp;G contends that, absent an outright endorsement, we should disregard the reasoning of Travelers and Dillingham in pursuing the \"reference to\" question. We think not. Although the Travelers Court had no occasion to link its newly conceived \"objectives\" analysis to the \"reference to\" inquiry, the two building blocks on which that analysis rests - the starting presumption that Congress did not intend to supplant state law and the requirement that no preemption be deemed to occur in areas of traditional state regulation except in accord with the clear and manifest purpose of Congress - logically undergird both inquiries. See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 654-56 (dealing with baseline presumptions before beginning its bifurcated \"connection with\" and \"reference to\" analyses). We thus proceed to apply the teachings of Travelers and Dillingham as we understand them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, Dillingham makes clear that two types of state laws - those that impose requirements by reference to ERISA plans and those that specifically exempt ERISA plans from otherwise generally applicable provisions - as well as state causes of action that are predicated on the existence of ERISA plans all refer to, and thus relate to, ERISA plans for purposes of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a). See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324-25. Put another way, in the post-Travelers era the \"reference to\" inquiry will result in preemption \"[w]here a State's law acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans... or where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation.\" Id. at 325 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Examining Williams through the prism of Travelers and Dillingham, a rational distinction between the mechanics' lien statute and the bond statute, not previously thought to be important, bubbles to the surface: unlike the mechanics' lien statute, the bond statute makes no direct reference to section 302. Instead, it states that bonds for public works projects shall cover, in addition to labor and materials,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any sums due trustees or other persons authorized to collect such payments from the contractor or subcontractors, based upon the labor performed or furnished as aforesaid, for health and welfare plans, supplementary unemployment benefit plans and other fringe benefits which are payable in cash and provided for in collective bargaining agreements between organized labor and the contractor or subcontractors....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 29. The language concerning trustees is not ERISA-specific, but stands at the end of a long list of items that contractors are required to secure (e.g., amounts due for labor performed, materials furnished, transportation, equipment rental, and the like). The diversity of this list is telling (especially since most of these items have nothing whatever to do with ERISA). Furthermore, the bond statute treats contributions to fringe benefit plans in exactly the same manner as it treats the other (non-ERISA-related) elements that fall within the statutory sweep. Given the Dillingham screen, this combination of factors stretches any inference that the bond statute singles out ERISA plans for special treatment past the breaking point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See Seaboard Sur., 137 F.3d at 429.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dillingham confirms in another way that a reviewing court should differentiate between the mechanics' lien statute and the bond statute for purposes of the \"reference to\" inquiry. The Supreme Court's approach there reflects a conservative view of the inquiry, suggesting that a reference must be patent before ERISA preemption looms. See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324-25. The precedents that Dillingham cites, see id., illustrate this point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In each of those cases, an ERISA plan lay at the center of the inquiry. In contrast, the bond statute functions irrespective of the existence or non-existence of an ERISA plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager is that emergent Supreme Court precedent, by disavowing a strictly textual approach to the interpretation of ERISA's preemption provision, encourages us for the first time to conduct the \"reference to\" inquiry in light of the actual operation of the challenged state statute. See De Buono, 520 U.S. at 815; Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 324-25. Here, that glimpse is revealing. The bond statute neither imposes requirements on ERISA plans nor exempts such plans from otherwise applicable statutory provisions. In operation, therefore, the statute comports fully with ERISA's objectives. Furthermore, it does not dictate the form that a covered plan may take, specify the mode or manner of plan administration, or jeopardize the sort of uniformity that Congress aspired to achieve. Given these facts, the statutory reference to the term \"trustees\" seems too tenuous to trigger ERISA preemption. See Howell, 126 F.3d at 68. Indeed, the case at hand is, in this respect, reminiscent of Dillingham, in which the Supreme Court held that a statutory mention of an apprenticeship program was not sufficient to cause preemption under the \"reference to\" prong. See 519 U.S. at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USF&amp;G's argument that the bond statute singles out ERISA plans because it is limited to public (as opposed to private) construction contracts lacks force. It is common ground that state laws of general application are safe from ERISA preemption even if they impose some incidental burdens on the administration of covered plans. See Washington Physicians Serv. Ass'n v. Gregoire, 147 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1141 (1999); Howell, 126 F.3d at 67; cf. Travelers, 514 U.S. at 659-60 (explaining that the fact that a law has an indirect economic influence on ERISA plans does not, in and of itself, justify preemption). USF&amp;G's argument amounts to a claim that the bond statute is something other than a law of general application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the concept of \"general application\" cannot be parsed that closely. A state law that applies to a wide variety of situations, including an appreciable number that have no specific linkage to ERISA plans, constitutes a law of general application for purposes of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a). See, e.g., Mackey, 486 U.S. at 838 n.12; Shea v. Esensten, 208 F.3d 712, 717 (8th Cir. 2000); Arizona State Carpenters Pension Trust Fund v. Citibank (Ariz.), 125 F.3d 715, 724 (9th Cir. 1997). Under this definition, the bond statute ranks as a law of general application for ERISA preemption purposes because it applies to a sufficiently broad, sufficiently generalized universe of situations - all Massachusetts public works projects - without mentioning ERISA and without regard to whether any affected person is (or is not) involved with a covered plan. See De Buono, 520 U.S. at 815; Howell, 126 F.3d at 67-68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the bond statute, gauged by the principles embodied in recent Supreme Court case law, neither singles out ERISA plans for special treatment nor depends on their existence as an essential part of its operation. Rather, the statute is \"indifferent to... ERISA coverage.\" Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 328. It is properly classified, therefore, as \"one of 'myriad state laws' of general applicability that impose some burdens on the administration of ERISA plans but nevertheless do not 'relate to' them within the meaning of the governing statute.\" De Buono, 520 U.S. at 815. Thus, it does not trigger preemption. See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 656; JWJ Contracting, 135 F.3d at 679; Howell, 126 F.3d at 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The issue here is whether ERISA preempts the appellants' state-law cause of action. Believing, as we do, that Williams no longer aids us in our consideration of this issue, we abrogate its central holding. See supra note 1 &amp; accompanying text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking a fresh look at the Massachusetts bond statute and giving due weight to Travelers and its progeny, we conclude that USF&amp;G has not overcome the starting presumption against preemption. Accordingly, the bond statute does not \"relate to\" any covered employee benefit plan within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a). It follows that the entry of judgment on the pleadings must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Following the procedure described in cases such as Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v.

In Travelers and its progeny, the Court has yet to state unequivocally where &#167; 502(a) preemption should be placed within the reshaped ERISA doctrine. The Second Circuit, however, has treated the alternative enforcement mechanism inquiry as a separate branch of ERISA preemption analysis. See Howell, 126 F.3d at 68. This is by no means inevitable. Conceivably, alternative enforcement mechanism preemption can be considered as part and parcel of a \"connection\" or \"reference\" analysis, or fit under &#167; 514(a) as a category like \"connection\" and \"reference,\" or (as Howell suggests) constitute a preemption prong independent of &#167; 514(a).

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual plaintiffs performed carpentry work on a public works project in Peabody, Massachusetts. All of them belonged to Carpenters Local No. 26 (the union). At the times relevant hereto, their employer, Henry Construction, Inc. (Henry), was a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the union that required contributions to various fringe benefit funds on the individual plaintiffs' behalf. Henry defaulted on this obligation before completing the Peabody job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts, a so-called bond statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 29, the pertinent text of which is set forth in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> requires the general contractor on a public works project to post a bond covering labor and materials (including indebtedness incurred by subcontractors and suppliers for wages and fringe benefits). The general contractor on the Peabody project obtained such a bond from defendant-appellee United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G). When Henry, a subcontractor, failed to make contributions in respect to fringe benefits, the union's collection agent, Massachusetts Carpenters Central Collection Agency (MCCCA), acting for the aggrieved employees, staked a claim on the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resolution of the controversy eluded the parties. The individual plaintiffs, the union, and MCCCA (hereinafter collectively the appellants) then sued USF&amp;G in the state superior court. The surety removed the action, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441, and immediately sought judgment on the pleadings. The appellants opposed this initiative and moved to remand the action to the state court. On November 3, 1998, the federal district court denied the motion to remand. Some seven months later, it granted USF&amp;G's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Relying on Williams, the court anchored both orders in ERISA preemption. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

The statute brooks no interference; it contains an express preemption clause providing that it shall \"supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any [covered] employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).

To scale the phrase down to size, the Court has devised a disjunctive test: \"A law relate[s] to a covered employee benefit plan for purposes of &#167; 514(a) if it [1] has a connection with or [2] a reference to such a plan.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dillingham,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">324</span> </a></span>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original).

When Congress conceived the ERISA scheme, it made manifest its intention to \"protect... the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries... by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001(b). Achieving this end requires the avoidance of \"a multiplicity of regulation\" and, concomitantly, the creation of a climate that \"permit[s] the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117928\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Travelers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/117928/new-york-state-conference-of-blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-v-travelers/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span>. Using this template, the Massachusetts bond statute, on its face, in no way inhibits the accomplishment of ERISA's overall goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well accepted, however, even under the new regime, that state laws which furnish alternative enforcement mechanisms threaten the uniformity that Congress labored to achieve and thus are preempted by ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See id.; see also Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112512\"><a href=\"/opinion/112512/ingersoll-rand-co-v-mcclendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 142-45 (1990). This category comes to mind because the most obvious tie between the Massachusetts bond statute and ERISA plans as a class concerns the former's role as a vehicle of enforcing funding obligations. The question, then, is whether the bond statute impermissibly supplies an alternative enforcement mechanism for ERISA plan benefits (and thereby triggers preemption). See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117928\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Travelers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/117928/new-york-state-conference-of-blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-v-travelers/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755238\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parrino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/755238/22-employee-benefits-cas-1707-98-cal-daily-op-serv-4491-98-cal-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>; see also Turner v.

ERISA preemption proscribes the type of alternative enforcement mechanism that purposes to provide a remedy for the violation of a right expressly guaranteed and exclusively enforced by the ERISA statute. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112512\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ingersoll-Rand,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112512/ingersoll-rand-co-v-mcclendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>. Those state laws which touch upon enforcement but have no real bearing on the intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario (e.g., the plan, the administrators, the fiduciaries, the beneficiaries, and the employer) are not subject to preemption on this basis. See Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157663\"><a href=\"/opinion/157663/woodworkers-supply-v-principal-mutual/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 990 (10th Cir. 1999). It follows that a state statute which only creates claims against a surety does not constitute an impermissible alternative enforcement mechanism as that term is used in ERISA jurisprudence. See Trustees for Mich. Laborers' Health Care Fund v. Seaboard Sur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751798\"><a href=\"/opinion/751798/trustees-for-michigan-laborers-health-care-fund-michigan-laborers-vc/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 429 (6th Cir. 1998); Bleiler v.

The Massachusetts bond statute does not constitute a proscribed alternate enforcement mechanism. By the same token, it has no other meaningful nexus with ERISA; it does not, for example, interfere with the administration of covered employee benefit plans, purport to regulate plan benefits, or impose additional reporting requirements. Last - but far from least -it regulates an area of the law traditionally thought to be the states' preserve: enforcing contracts under state law for the citizenry's protection. See Operating Eng'rs Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund v. JWJ Contracting Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751399\"><a href=\"/opinion/751399/operating-engineers-health-and-welfare-trust-fund-a-trust-operating/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 678 (9th Cir. 1998); Romney v.

Consequently, we conclude that the Massachusetts bond statute does not have a sufficient \"connection with\" covered employee benefit plans to warrant ERISA preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Travelers, this court answered that query affirmatively, holding that the bond statute singled out ERISA plans and was therefore preempted. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Williams,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>.

But stare decisis is neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule; it leaves room for courts to balance their respect for precedent against insights gleaned from new developments, and to make informed judgments as to whether earlier decisions retain preclusive force.

Here, however, we retreat further into the past, cognizant that Williams relied heavily on an earlier precedent, McCoy v.

We noted that the mechanics' lien statute, by its terms, inured to the advantage of \"the trustee or trustees of any fund or funds, established pursuant to section 302 of the Taft Hartley Law (29 U.S.C. 186), providing coverage or benefits to [an employee].\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (quoting statute). </a></span>On that basis, we concluded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny plan that grants benefits under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 186, which is another way of describing any plan that grants benefits under section 302 of the Taft- Hartley Act, is by definition an ERISA plan.

Because we \"perceive[d] no rational basis on which to distinguish between [them] for the purpose of gauging ERISA's preemptive reach,\" we concluded that ERISA preempted the latter statute. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 591. </a></span>It is this holding that we re-examine today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key precedents are the Supreme Court's subsequent opinions in Travelers and Dillingham. The extent to which the analytical shift chronicled in these opinions applies to the \"reference to\" aspect of the ERISA preemption inquiry is less than obvious. The Travelers Court quickly ruled out any possibility that the state law it was called upon to consider made reference to an ERISA plan and refined the ERISA preemption analysis in the context of the \"connection with\" inquiry. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117928\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Travelers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/117928/new-york-state-conference-of-blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-v-travelers/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>. The Dillingham Court recounted the reasoning of Travelers without explicitly limiting that reasoning to the \"connection with\" inquiry, but its actual treatment of the \"reference to\" question relied entirely on pre-Travelers precedent and made only passing mention of ERISA's objectives. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dillingham,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>-28. Thus, both opinions stop short of explicitly endorsing a new analytic modality for the \"reference to\" inquiry. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. National Park Med. Ctr., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757656\"><a href=\"/opinion/757656/the-prudential-insurance-company-of-america-prudential-health-care-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 820-22 (8th Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USF&amp;G contends that, absent an outright endorsement, we should disregard the reasoning of Travelers and Dillingham in pursuing the \"reference to\" question. We think not. Although the Travelers Court had no occasion to link its newly conceived \"objectives\" analysis to the \"reference to\" inquiry, the two building blocks on which that analysis rests - the starting presumption that Congress did not intend to supplant state law and the requirement that no preemption be deemed to occur in areas of traditional state regulation except in accord with the clear and manifest purpose of Congress - logically undergird both inquiries. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117928\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Travelers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/117928/new-york-state-conference-of-blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-v-travelers/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">654-56</span> </a></span>(dealing with baseline presumptions before beginning its bifurcated \"connection with\" and \"reference to\" analyses).

See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dillingham,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>-25. Put another way, in the post-Travelers era the \"reference to\" inquiry will result in preemption \"[w]here a State's law acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans... or where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 325 </a></span>(citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Examining Williams through the prism of Travelers and Dillingham, a rational distinction between the mechanics' lien statute and the bond statute, not previously thought to be important, bubbles to the surface: unlike the mechanics' lien statute, the bond statute makes no direct reference to section 302. Instead, it states that bonds for public works projects shall cover, in addition to labor and materials,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any sums due trustees or other persons authorized to collect such payments from the contractor or subcontractors, based upon the labor performed or furnished as aforesaid, for health and welfare plans, supplementary unemployment benefit plans and other fringe benefits which are payable in cash and provided for in collective bargaining agreements between organized labor and the contractor or subcontractors....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 29. The language concerning trustees is not ERISA-specific, but stands at the end of a long list of items that contractors are required to secure (e.g., amounts due for labor performed, materials furnished, transportation, equipment rental, and the like). The diversity of this list is telling (especially since most of these items have nothing whatever to do with ERISA). Furthermore, the bond statute treats contributions to fringe benefit plans in exactly the same manner as it treats the other (non-ERISA-related) elements that fall within the statutory sweep. Given the Dillingham screen, this combination of factors stretches any inference that the bond statute singles out ERISA plans for special treatment past the breaking point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See Seaboard <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751798\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sur.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/751798/trustees-for-michigan-laborers-health-care-fund-michigan-laborers-vc/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dillingham confirms in another way that a reviewing court should differentiate between the mechanics' lien statute and the bond statute for purposes of the \"reference to\" inquiry. The Supreme Court's approach there reflects a conservative view of the inquiry, suggesting that a reference must be patent before ERISA preemption looms. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dillingham,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>-25.

See De <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118119\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Buono,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118119/de-buono-v-nysa-ila-medical-and-clinical-services-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dillingham,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>-25. Here, that glimpse is revealing. The bond statute neither imposes requirements on ERISA plans nor exempts such plans from otherwise applicable statutory provisions. In operation, therefore, the statute comports fully with ERISA's objectives. Furthermore, it does not dictate the form that a covered plan may take, specify the mode or manner of plan administration, or jeopardize the sort of uniformity that Congress aspired to achieve. Given these facts, the statutory reference to the term \"trustees\" seems too tenuous to trigger ERISA preemption. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746828\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Howell,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/746828/plumbing-industry-board-plumbing-local-union-no-1-v-ew-howell-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>. Indeed, the case at hand is, in this respect, reminiscent of Dillingham, in which the Supreme Court held that a statutory mention of an apprenticeship program was not sufficient to cause preemption under the \"reference to\" prong. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USF&amp;G's argument that the bond statute singles out ERISA plans because it is limited to public (as opposed to private) construction contracts lacks force.

Under this definition, the bond statute ranks as a law of general application for ERISA preemption purposes because it applies to a sufficiently broad, sufficiently generalized universe of situations - all Massachusetts public works projects - without mentioning ERISA and without regard to whether any affected person is (or is not) involved with a covered plan.

We caution, however, that the use of this informal procedure does not convert this opinion into an opinion en banc, nor does it preclude a suggestion of rehearing en banc on any issue in the case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  The statute provides:</p>\n        <p>Officers or agents contracting in behalf of the commonwealth or in behalf of any county, city, town, district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth... for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or demolition of public buildings or other public works... shall obtain security by bond in an amount not less than one half of the total contract price, for payment by the contractor and subcontractors for labor performed or furnished and materials used or employed therein [subject to certain restrictions]; for payment of transportation charges for materials used or employed therein...; for payment by such contractor and subcontractors of any sums due for the rental or hire of vehicles... and other appliances and equipment...; for payment of transportation charges directly related to such rental or hire; and for payment by such contractor and subcontractors of any sums due trustees or other persons authorized to collect such payments from the contractor or subcontractors, based upon the labor performed or furnished as aforesaid, for health and welfare plans, supplementary unemployment benefit plans and other fringe benefits which are payable in cash and provided for in collective bargaining agreements between organized labor and the contractor or subcontractors. . . . .</p>\n        <p>Mass.

Our decision in Williams focused solely on the \"reference to\" furculum of ERISA preemption analysis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, and we will discuss it under that rubric. See infra Part II(B).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  In Ingersoll-Rand, the Supreme Court recognized that a state law can be preempted as an alternative enforcement mechanism to ERISA &#167; 502(a). See Ingersoll-Rand v. McClendon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112512\"><a href=\"/opinion/112512/ingersoll-rand-co-v-mcclendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 142-45 (1990). In Travelers and its progeny, the Court has yet to state unequivocally where &#167; 502(a) preemption should be placed within the reshaped ERISA doctrine. The Second Circuit, however, has treated the alternative enforcement mechanism inquiry as a separate branch of ERISA preemption analysis. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746828\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Howell,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/746828/plumbing-industry-board-plumbing-local-union-no-1-v-ew-howell-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>. This is by no means inevitable. Conceivably, alternative enforcement mechanism preemption can be considered as part and parcel of a \"connection\" or \"reference\" analysis, or fit under &#167; 514(a) as a category like \"connection\" and \"reference,\" or (as Howell suggests) constitute a preemption prong independent of &#167; 514(a). In this case, it makes no difference under which heading we place the inquiry, and so, while we discuss this subject under the \"connection\" rubric for the sake of convenience, we leave the question open.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Footnote 12 of Mackey (and, thus, the McCoy rationale) likely endures. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dillingham,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118081/california-div-of-labor-standards-enforcement-v-dillingham-constr-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>. The mechanics' lien statute does not; the Massachusetts legislature amended it in 1996 to eliminate any mention of \"trustees\" and \"section 302 of the Taft Hartley Act.\" See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 254, &#167; 1 (Supp. 2000).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Temporal considerations bolster this conclusion. Massachusetts adopted the bond statute in 1957 - a quarter-century before Congress enacted ERISA. This chronology undercuts any inference that the drafters of the statute intended to target ERISA plans. See JWJ <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751399\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Contracting,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/751399/operating-engineers-health-and-welfare-trust-fund-a-trust-operating/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  The Court listed three examples. (1) The reference in Mackey was too explicit to be construed any other way: the statute at issue there targeted \"[f]unds or benefits of a pension, retirement, or employee benefit plan or program subject to the provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act....\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112105\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mackey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112105/mackey-v-lanier-collection-agency-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">828</span> </a></span>n.2 (quoting Ga. Code Ann. &#167; 18-4-22.1). (2) In Ingersoll-Rand, the plaintiff's cause of action was based on an allegation that his employer discharged him to avoid making contributions to his pension fund, and, thus, \"in order to prevail, [the] plaintiff must plead, and the court must find, that an ERISA plan exists and the employer had a pension-defeating motive in terminating the employment.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112512\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ingersoll-Rand,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112512/ingersoll-rand-co-v-mcclendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>.
