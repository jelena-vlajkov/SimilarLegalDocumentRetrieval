Appellant, a state prisoner proceeding\n\nin forma pauperis, appeals the district court's dismissal of\n\nhis complaint as \"frivolous\" as well as the taxing of his\n\nprisoner account to satisfy the filing fee.         See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915.    Appellant does not deny that the complaint is an\n\nidentical copy of a complaint he had previously filed and is\n\npursuing   in   a   separate,   pending   action.    He   asserts,\n\nhowever, that he did not mail the duplicative complaint to\n\nthe district court.     He surmises that a copy may have been\n\ntransmitted to the court by someone who tampered with his\n\nmail.   The district court considered the argument and denied\n\nreconsideration of its order \"upon a review of the record.\"\n\n We perceive no clear error in the court's finding nor any\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\f",
