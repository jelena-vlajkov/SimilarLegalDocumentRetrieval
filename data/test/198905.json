This case involves a constitutional\n\nchallenge under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to a\n\nstate law and a town ordinance that prohibit municipal authorities from\n\nexcluding religious uses of property from any zoning area. It is\n\nbrought by a group of residents of Belmont, Massachusetts, against\n\nBelmont officials and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,\n\nchallenging the construction of a large temple on the edge of a\n\nresidential district in the town. The district court upheld both\n\nprovisions of law, granting summary judgment for defendants and\n\nallowing construction to proceed.      We affirm.\n\n\n                           I.   Background\n\n     The essential facts of this case are undisputed and were submitted\n\nto the district court with cross-motions for summary judgment. We draw\n\nour summary primarily from the district court’s opinion, supplementing\n\nwith details from the decision of the Belmont Zoning Board of Appeals\n\nand other pertinent record materials.\n\n     Defendant Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of\n\nJesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the \"Church\" or \"LDS\") acquired an\n\n8.9-acre parcel of land in the Town of Belmont in 1979. It constructed\n\na meeting house on the property, which is located entirely in a single\n\nresidential district, and has conducted religious services there since\n\nthe mid-1980s.\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f     The Church later decided to build a temple on the site. An LDS\n\ntemple is a large facility, of which there are fewer than 100\n\nworldwide, that is used solely for the Church’s most sacred ceremonies.\n\nAlthough Belmont’s zoning by-law permits religious uses as of right in\n\nresidential districts, see By-law § 3.3, the Church filed an\n\napplication for a special permit, as required, because it sought to\n\nexceed the allowable height limit.\n\n      After a series of public hearings in which opponents raised a\n\nvariety of concerns, the Zoning Board of Appeals in 1997 approved the\n\nspecial permit. The Church voluntarily made numerous design changes in\n\nresponse to neighborhood concerns and obtained unanimous approval of\n\nits new design from the Board before it began construction. The final\n\nplans call for the temple to occupy some 69,000 square feet and to\n\ninclude one 139-foot-tall spire and several smaller towers.1 The temple\n\nwill be set back from abutters by at least 165 feet, and in most\n\nlocations more than that, although plaintiffs are quick to point out\n\nthat the setback will consist largely of a parking lot for over two\n\nhundred vehicles.\n\n     The Belmont by-law allowing religious uses by right in the\n\nresidential zone where the Church’s property is located is in\n\naccordance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, § 3, known as the \"Dover\n\n\n\n1 The original plan called for six spires exceeding the standard\npermissible height limitation and a surface area of 94,100 square feet.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fAmendment.\" That law provides, in part, that a zoning regulation may\n\nnot restrict the use of land for religious or educational purposes when\n\nthe property is owned by the Commonwealth, a religious organization, or\n\na nonprofit educational corporation, except that \"reasonable\n\nregulations\" are permitted concerning such characteristics as the bulk\n\nand height of structures, open space, and parking.\n\n     Plaintiffs brought this suit challenging both Belmont’s by-law and\n\nthe Dover Amendment, claiming that they violate the Establishment\n\nClause of the First Amendment by favoring religious uses of property\n\nwithout a secular purpose. The district court granted summary judgment\n\nfor the defendants in May 1999, finding that neither of the laws\n\nconstitutes an impermissible \"establishment\" of religion. Plaintiffs\n\nthen filed this timely appeal.\n\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\n     The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that\n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\n\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" a proscription that has been\n\nextended to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. As the\n\nSupreme Court long has recognized, \"tension inevitably exists between\n\nthe Free Exercise and the Establishment Clauses,\" Committee for Pub.\n\nEduc. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 788 (1973) (citing\n\nEverson v. Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1 (1947) and Walz v. Tax Comm’n of\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fCity of New York, 397 U.S. 664 (1970)), and the Court has \"struggled to\n\nfind a neutral course between [them],\" Walz, 397 U.S. at 668. While\n\nthe Free Exercise Clause admonishes the government against impinging on\n\nthe religious beliefs and expression of its citizens, the Establishment\n\nClause cautions that the government may not adopt the cause of religion\n\nas its own. The Seventh Circuit has noted the challenge of reconciling\n\nthe two Religion Clauses:\n\n     The juxtaposition of the two clauses, and the internal\n     tension they create, makes total separation between religion\n     and government impossible. Lynch [v. Donnelly, 465 U.S.\n     668, 673 (1984)]; Lemon [v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 614\n     (1971)]. Indeed, \"[i]t has never been thought either\n     possible or desirable to enforce a regime of total\n     separation\" between religion and government. [Committee for\n     Pub. Educ. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 760\n     (1973).] Thus the Court has recognized that the First\n     Amendment \"affirmatively mandates accommodation,\" Lynch, 465\n     U.S. at 673, and \"that the government may (and sometimes\n     must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so\n     without violating the Establishment Clause.\" Hobbie v.\n     Unemployment Appeals Comm. of Florida, 480 U.S. 136, 144-45\n     (1987) (footnote omitted).\n\nCohen v. City of Des Plaines, 8 F.3d 484, 491 (7th Cir. 1993); see\n\nCorporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of\n\nLatter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334 (1987) (quoting Hobbie,\n\n480 U.S. at 144-45); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 312 (1952) (\"The\n\nFirst Amendment . . . does not say that in every and all respects there\n\nshall be a separation of Church and State.\"). Our task in navigating\n\nthe course between the opposing mandates of the Religion Clauses is\n\nthus to strike that appropriate balance referred to by the Court as a\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f\"benevolent neutrality,\" Walz, 397 U.S. at 669; see also Amos, 483 U.S.\n\nat 334.\n\n     As a practical framework for analysis in cases such as this, the\n\nSupreme Court has adopted the three-part test articulated in Lemon v.\n\nKurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971), which states that a law does not\n\nviolate the Establishment Clause if (1) it has a secular legislative\n\npurpose, (2) its principal or primary effect neither advances nor\n\ninhibits religion, and (3) the statute does not foster excessive\n\ngovernment entanglement with religion. See, e.g., Amos, 483 U.S. at\n\n335-39; Rojas v. Fitch, 127 F.3d 184, 187 (lst Cir. 1997). The parties\n\ngenerally agree that the third requirement is satisfied in this case,\n\nso we will focus, as the parties have done, on the purpose and effects\n\ninquiries. Because the state statute (the Dover Amendment) effectively\n\nrequires municipalities to enact by-laws like that adopted by Belmont,\n\nour conclusion that the Dover Amendment is constitutionally permissible\n\nlargely resolves the lawfulness of the ordinance as well. We therefore\n\ndiscuss the ordinance only briefly in section B, infra.\n\n     A. The Dover Amendment\n\n     Section 3 of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws limits\n\nthe zoning regulations that can be imposed on certain types of land\n\nuses, including agriculture, religious use of property owned by either\n\nthe Commonwealth or a religious group, nonprofit educational uses,\n\nchild care facilities, access for physically handicapped persons to\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fprivate property, solar energy systems, and antennas for federally\n\nlicensed amateur radio operators.       The zoning of religious and\n\neducational uses is addressed in the second paragraph of the section\n\nand reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n          No zoning ordinance or by-law shall . . . prohibit,\n     regulate or restrict the use of land or structures for\n     religious purposes or for educational purposes on land owned\n     or leased by the commonwealth or any of its agencies,\n     subdivisions or bodies politic or by a religious sect or\n     denomination, or by a nonprofit educational corporation;\n     provided, however, that such land or structures may be\n     subject to reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and\n     height of structures and determining yard sizes, lot area,\n     setbacks, open space, parking and building coverage\n     requirements.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, § 3.2 This provision is commonly known as the\n\nDover Amendment because its religion-focused component was enacted in\n\n1950 in response to a zoning by-law passed by the town of Dover,\n\nMassachusetts, prohibiting religious schools within that town’s\n\nresidential neighborhoods. See Trustees of Tufts College v. City of\n\nMedford, 415 Mass. 753, 757-58, 616 N.E.2d 433, 437-38 (1993); Attorney\n\nGeneral v. Dover, 327 Mass. 601, 603-04 (1951); The Bible Speaks v.\n\n\n2Other paragraphs of section 3 detail similar limitations on the zoning\nof other types of uses. The first paragraph, for example, bars\nunreasonable regulation of the use of land \"for the primary purpose of\nagriculture, horticulture, floriculture, or viticulture.\" The third\nparagraph prohibits local laws limiting the use of land or structures\nfor child care facilities, except for the same types of \"reasonable\nregulations\" permissible with respect to religious and educational\nuses. Also included in section 3 is a provision protecting congregate\nhomes for the disabled from discriminatory health and safety laws or\nland-use requirements and a prohibition against unreasonable regulation\nof solar energy systems. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, § 3.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fBoard of Appeals of Lenox, 8 Mass. App. Ct. 19, 28, 391 N.E.2d 279, 284\n\n(1979).3 The protections for other types of uses were added in later\n\nyears.\n\n     Plaintiffs maintain that giving religious organizations the\n\nadvantage of preferred zoning status constitutes an impermissible\n\nendorsement of religion, in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n\nUnder Lemon, our first step in evaluating the Dover Amendment’s\n\nconstitutionality is to ascertain whether it serves a \"secular\n\nlegislative purpose.\"     See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612.\n\n     This does not mean that the law’s purpose must be unrelated\n     to religion – that would amount to a requirement \"that the\n     government show a callous indifference to religious groups,\"\n     Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314 (1952).\n\nAmos, 483 U.S. at 335. We think the purpose of the Dover Amendment\n\nfits easily within the established boundaries of \"benevolent\n\nneutrality,\" see id. at 334, in which religious exercise is supported\n\nbut not promoted.\n\n     There is no dispute that the law was enacted to prevent religious\n\ndiscrimination of the sort embodied in the Dover by-law, which allowed\n\n\n\n3In 1950, the Massachusetts Legislature inserted the following language\ninto Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, § 25, a predecessor of the current ch.\n40A, § 3:\n\n     No by-law or ordinance which prohibits or limits the use of\n     land for any church or other religious purpose or which\n     prohibits or limits the use of land for any religious,\n     sectarian or denominational educational purpose shall be\n     valid.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fsecular educational institutions but barred sectarian ones in the\n\ntown’s residential areas. Indeed, the provision was originally titled\n\n\"An Act Prohibiting Discriminatory Zoning By-laws and Ordinances.\" See\n\nTufts College, 415 Mass. at 757, 616 N.E.2d at 437-38 (purpose of the\n\nAmendment was \"to strike a balance between preventing local\n\ndiscrimination against an educational [or religious] use . . . and\n\nhonoring legitimate municipal concerns that typically find expression\n\nin local zoning laws\"). Prohibition of religious discrimination is\n\nunquestionably an appropriate, secular legislative purpose. See, e.g.,\n\nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520,\n\n532 (1993) (\"Indeed, it was ‘historical instances of religious\n\npersecution and intolerance that gave concern to those who drafted the\n\nFree Exercise Clause.’\"); cf. Walz, 397 U.S. at 673 (noting, in case\n\nchallenging property tax exemption for religious uses of property, that\n\n\"[g]overnments have not always been tolerant of religious activity\" and\n\nthat \"[g]rants of exemption historically reflect the concern of authors\n\nof constitutions and statutes as to the latent dangers inherent in the\n\nimposition of property taxes\").\n\n     Appellants do not dispute the legitimacy of protecting religious\n\nentities from discrimination, but they argue that the Dover Amendment\n\ngoes unconstitutionally beyond such a purpose to endorse and benefit\n\nreligious uses by removing \"any type of real local zoning control of\n\nreligious sites\" (emphasis in appellants’ brief).       This argument\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fbrings us to the second Lemon prong, which examines whether,\n\nirrespective of the government’s actual purpose, the practice under\n\nreview has the \"principal or primary effect\" of endorsing or\n\ndisapproving religion, Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 55 (1985)\n\n(quoting Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612). Appellants maintain that the statute\n\nprovides such a substantial advantage to religious institutions that,\n\nin effect, it constitutes an advancement of religion in violation of\n\nthe Establishment Clause.\n\n     We note as an initial matter that a law that simply protects\n\nreligious organizations from unfair treatment certainly cannot be\n\nimpermissible as an unconstitutional endorsement of religious activity.\n\nSee generally Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 220-21 (1972) (The\n\nEstablishment Clause \"cannot be allowed to prevent any exception\" to\n\nlaws of general applicability which fosters the free exercise of\n\nreligion.). Yet, it is possible for government to extend itself so far\n\nin preventing unfairness that it crosses the line from acceptable\n\naccommodation to impermissible favoritism. See Amos, 483 U.S. at 334-\n\n35 (\"At some point, accommodation may devolve into `an unlawful\n\nfostering of religion . . . .’\") (quoting Hobbie, 480 U.S. at 145));\n\nYoder, 406 U.S. at 220-21.\n\n     Although the precise location of that threshold can be difficult\n\nto detect, we are confident that it has not been reached here.\n\nAppellants’ depiction of the statute as an impermissible legal hammer\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fwielded in favor of religion both grossly exaggerates the reach of the\n\nstatute and understates the recognition that religion may be given\n\nconsistent with the Establishment Clause. As for the statute’s scope,\n\nit does not exempt religious property uses from substantial standard\n\nzoning requirements that are designed to ensure compatible uses of\n\nland. As earlier noted, the statute explicitly states in a proviso\n\nthat limitations imposed on other property owners concerning such\n\nspecific features as the bulk and height of structures, lot area,\n\nsetbacks and required parking also may be imposed on religious\n\norganizations. See ch. 40A, § 3. Thus, a religious institution, no\n\nless than any other group, must comply with reasonable regulations\n\ndesigned to preserve a comfortable, desirable community. See Tufts\n\nCollege, 415 Mass. at 760, 616 N.E.2d at 439 (\"[T]he Dover Amendment is\n\nintended to encourage `a degree of accommodation between the protected\n\nuse . . . and matters of critical municipal concern . . . .’\").4\n\n     As for the statute’s assertedly improper focus on religion,\n\nplaintiffs err in two respects: the statute does not benefit only\n\n\n\n4We recognize that facially neutral restrictions imposed under the\nproviso may be subject to challenge as \"unreasonable\" if they\neffectively would nullify a religious or other permitted use. See\nTrustees of Tufts College v. City of Medford, 415 Mass. 753, 757-58 &\nn.6, 616 N.E.2d 433, 437-38 & n.6 (1993). The Massachusetts Supreme\nJudicial Court has stated that the question of reasonableness will\ndepend on the particular facts of each case, see 415 Mass. at 759, 616\nN.E.3d at 438, with the burden on the institution to \"prov[e] that the\nlocal requirements are unreasonable as applied to its proposed\nproject,\" 415 Mass. at 759, 616 N.E.2d at 439.\n\n                                 -12-\n\freligious uses and, even if it did, such unique treatment can withstand\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.\n\n      We look first at the statute’s coverage. While the original\n\nDover Amendment was directed solely at religious uses of property, the\n\nprovision now includes a variety of uses linked together by the\n\nlegislature’s apparent judgment that these uses, though important to\n\nall communities, would be at risk of exclusion from certain zoning\n\nareas because of local prejudice unrelated to their compatibility with\n\nthe essential nature of the existing community. Our task is to consider\n\nthe validity of the statute before us, not the one enacted fifty years\n\nago. See generally Walz, 397 U.S. at 688 n.8 (\"The only governmental\n\npurposes germane to the present inquiry . . . are those that now\n\nexist.\").\n\n     It has long been accepted that religious entities may be the\n\nbeneficiaries of laws that, for secular reasons, provide benefits to a\n\nvariety of groups. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1, 10-\n\n13 (1989) (plurality opinion); Rojas, 127 F.3d at 188-89. Among the\n\nmost prominent examples are the exemption from property taxes upheld by\n\nthe Supreme Court in Walz, 397 U.S. at 664, and the tax deduction for\n\nthe expenses of religious education allowed in Mueller v. Allen, 463\n\nU.S. 388 (1983). In his concurrence in Walz, Justice Brennan observed\n\nthat New York included churches within the exempted class \"not because\n\nit champions religion per se but because it values religion among a\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fvariety of private, nonprofit enterprises that contribute to the\n\ndiversity of the Nation.\"     Walz, 397 U.S. at 693.\n\n     We think an equivalent description applies to the state’s judgment\n\nhere. In protecting religious, educational, agricultural and the other\n\nlisted uses of property from exclusion -- whether resulting from\n\ndiscrimination or simply from a general aversion to change in the\n\nneighborhood -- Massachusetts evidences \"an affirmative policy that\n\nconsiders these groups as beneficial and stabilizing influences in\n\ncommunity life,\" wherever they are located, see id. at 673.        The\n\nSupreme Court has time and again made it clear that to include religion\n\nin such a category is not to advance religion in contravention of the\n\nEstablishment Clause. The collection of favored uses in the Dover\n\nAmendment is amply diverse in the context of zoning to support such a\n\ndetermination. See Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 15 (\"How expansive the\n\nclass of exempt organizations or activities must be to withstand\n\nconstitutional assault depends upon the State’s secular aim in granting\n\na tax exemption.\").\n\n     Turning to our second point regarding the statute’s focus on\n\nreligion, we note that even a special status granted exclusively to\n\nreligious organizations is not always impermissible. This conclusion\n\nis inevitably drawn from our analysis of three of the Supreme Court’s\n\nmore recent Establishment Clause cases. All address benefits that were\n\ngranted only to religious groups or solely on the basis of religion.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fOne upholds the benefit granted, while the other two invalidate the\n\nstatutes at issue. Their holdings are instructive, for we see this\n\ncase as governed by the former and easily distinguishable from the\n\nlatter.\n\n     In Amos, the Supreme Court upheld section 702 of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, which exempted religious organizations from Title VII’s\n\nprohibition against discrimination in employment on the basis of\n\nreligion.   See 483 U.S. at 327.    Noting the Court’s longstanding\n\nrecognition that \"`government may (and sometimes must) accommodate\n\nreligious practices and that it may do so without violating the\n\nEstablishment Clause,’\" id. at 334 (quoting Hobbie, 480 U.S. at 144-\n\n45), the Court endorsed state efforts \"to alleviate significant\n\ngovernmental interference with the ability of religious organizations\n\nto define and carry out their religious missions,\" id. at 335. The\n\nCourt declined to invalidate the exemption on the basis that it singled\n\nout religious groups for a benefit, stating that where \"government acts\n\nwith the proper purpose of lifting a regulation that burdens the\n\nexercise of religion, we see no reason to require that the exemption\n\ncomes packaged with benefits to secular entities.\"         Id. at 338.\n\n     Massachusetts’ effort to eliminate local zoning discrimination is\n\nfully in line with the Court’s approval of government actions aimed at\n\nlifting burdens from the exercise of religion. Not only was the Dover\n\nAmendment at its origin a defensible response to an actual incident of\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fdiscrimination, but protections against land use bias continue to be\n\nsupportable fifty years later.      Two recent law review articles\n\ncanvassing discrimination against religion in the land use context\n\nreport numerous instances of zoning actions that reflect local\n\nsentiments ranging from outright hostility to indifference to the needs\n\nof religious organizations, with minority religions particularly hard\n\nhit. See Douglas Laycock, \"State RFRAs [Religious Freedom Restoration\n\nActs] and Land Use Regulation,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 755, 771, 778-80\n\n(1999) [hereinafter \"State RFRAs\"]5; Von G. Keetch & Matthew K.\n\nRichards, \"The Need for Legislation to Enshrine Free Exercise in the\n\nLand Use Context,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 725, 729-30 (1999).\n\n     Of particular note is the phenomenon of churches being unwanted\n\neither in residential areas – because of increased traffic or noise, or\n\nimpact on aesthetics – or in business zones – because tax-exempt\n\nchurches dampen the vibrancy of commercial developments. See \"State\n\nRFRAs,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 761-62, 774-75; see also, e.g.,\n\nChristian Gospel Church v. San Francisco, 896 F.2d 1221, 1224 (9th Cir.\n\n1990) (upholding denial of permit for church to hold worship services\n\nin residential neighborhood, noting that zoning \"protects the zones’\n\ninhabitants from problems of traffic, noise and litter\") (citation\n\nomitted); Cornerstone Bible Church v. City of Hastings, 948 F.2d 464,\n\n5Indeed, Professor Laycock notes that churches are now facing more\ndifficulty in the land use context than in the past. See \"State\nRFRAs,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 764.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f467 ( 8th Cir. 1991) (quoting city council resolution excluding churches\n\nfrom the town’s central business district because \"no business or\n\nretail contribution or activity is generated\"). Certainly in the face\n\nof such evidence, the state’s decision to give religion an assist in\n\nthe local land-use planning process is consistent with the Supreme\n\nCourt’s holding in Amos that legislation isolating religious groups for\n\nspecial treatment is permissible when done for the \"proper purpose\" of\n\nalleviating a burden on the exercise of religion. See Amos, 483 U.S.\n\nat 337-38.\n\n     Neither of the Court’s two other cases, both of which struck down\n\nbenefits given exclusively for religious reasons, points to a contrary\n\nresult in this case. In Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703\n\n(1985), the Court invalidated a Connecticut statute guaranteeing\n\nemployees the right to take their chosen Sabbath day off from work.\n\nThe Court noted that the \"absolute and unqualified right\" given to\n\nSabbath observers required employers to conform their business\n\npractices    to   an   employee’s   religious   practices   without   any\n\n\"consideration as to whether the employer has made reasonable\n\naccommodation proposals,\" see id. at 709-10, conveying a message of\n\n\"endorsement of a particular religious belief, to the detriment of\n\nthose who do not share it,\" id. at 711 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n     As we have observed, the Dover Amendment does not give religious\n\norganizations an \"absolute and unqualified right\" to build whatever\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fstructures they desire in residential or other zones. The protection\n\ngiven religious uses is moderated by the community’s countervailing\n\ninterest in minimizing adverse impacts to communities, which is\n\nreflected in the requirement that religious uses conform to the\n\nstandard physical limitations imposed on all buildings located in that\n\nzone. Moreover, in a further distinction from the Connecticut statute,\n\nthe Dover Amendment does not protect one type of religious activity,\n\nbut \"extends . . . to all religious beliefs and practices,\" Thornton,\n\n472 U.S. at 712 (O’Connor, J., concurring).       We think it clear,\n\ntherefore, that \"an objective observer would perceive it as an anti-\n\ndiscrimination law rather than an endorsement of religion or a\n\nparticular religious practice.\"      Id.\n\n     Finally, in Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 1, five justices in two\n\nseparate opinions struck down a Texas statute exempting religious\n\nperiodicals, and no other publications, from state sales tax.6 In the\n\nview of this combined majority of the court, the statute failed for\n\nlack of a secular objective. See id. at 14-15; 28. In his concurring\n\nopinion joined by Justice O’Connor, Justice Blackmun observed that \"[a]\n\nstatutory preference for the dissemination of religious ideas offends\n\nour most basic understanding of what the Establishment Clause is all\n\n\n\n6The statute exempted \"`[p]eriodicals that are published or distributed\nby a religious faith and that consist wholly of writings promulgating\nthe teaching of the faith and books that consist wholly of writings\nsacred to a religious faith.’\" Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 5.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fabout and hence is constitutionally intolerable.\" Id. at 28.      Here,\n\nby contrast, the statute both has an express secular purpose and it\n\nembraces a variety of land uses likely to encounter similar local\n\nopposition.    As such, it does not suffer from the Texas Monthly\n\nconstitutional flaws.\n\n     In our view, the favorable attitude toward religion reflected in\n\nthe Dover Amendment does not constitute a fostering of, or favoritism\n\ntoward, religion over non-religion, but represents a secular judgment\n\nthat religious institutions, by their nature, are compatible with every\n\nother type of land use and thus will not detract from the quality of\n\nlife in any neighborhood.\n\n     An impressive body of case law and scholarly texts and articles\n\nsupports this conclusion. See Walz, 397 U.S. at 689 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring) (\"[G]overnment grants exemptions to religious organizations\n\nbecause they uniquely contribute to the pluralism of American society\n\nby their religious activities.\"); Concerned Citizens of Carderock v.\n\nHubbard, 84 F.

Md. 2000) (\"It is . . .\n\nreasonable to presume that `churches . . . and other places of worship’\n\n. . . belong [in the] category of uses [that are] wholly compatible\n\nwith single family home life.\" (citing E.C.

Young, Anderson’s American Law of Zoning § 12.22 at 578 ( 4th\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fed. 1996) (\"[R]eligious uses contribute to the general welfare of the\n\ncommunity, and can contribute most when located in residential\n\ndistricts . . . .\");7 Terry Rice, \"Re-Evaluating the Balance Between\n\nZoning Regulations and Religious and Educational Uses,\" 8 Pace L.

Texas Monthly,\n\n489 U.S. at 12 (property tax exemption for churches \"possessed the\n\nlegitimate secular purpose and effect of contributing to the\n\ncommunity’s moral and intellectual diversity\").\n\n      It is of some note, as well, that proximity to their houses of\n\nworship is for some groups a significant component of their religious\n\npractice. Orthodox Jews, for example, believe they are prohibited by\n\nthe Torah, the Jewish Bible, from using automobiles on their Sabbath.\n\nThey therefore must live within walking distance of a synagogue. See,\n\n7The authors of this treatise note that there are \"sound reasons\" for\nexcluding churches from residential districts, including the traffic\nassociated with large numbers of people attending services and\nmeetings, see § 12.22 at 578. They ultimately conclude, however, that\n\"an ordinance which excludes [religious] uses from residential zones\ndoes not further the public health, safety, morals, or general\nwelfare,\" id., observing:\n\n      Religious uses serve people best when they are accessible to\n      homes. Religious buildings provide convenient meeting\n      places for youth groups and civic associations. This need\n      can be filled best when the religious institution is\n      convenient to the residents who attend.\n\nId.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fe.g., LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 67 F.3d 412, 430 (2d Cir. 1995);\n\n\"State RFFAs,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 779-80. Although we do not\n\nsuggest that the Free Exercise Clause mandates the Dover Amendment,8 the\n\nfact that the law may serve to avoid a possible barrier to\n\nparticipation in communal worship highlights its effect as an\n\naccommodation, rather than a promotion, of religion. See Wallace v.\n\nJaffree, 472 U.S. at 83 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (\"[I]n determining\n\nwhether the statute conveys the message of endorsement of religion . .\n\n. courts should assume that the `objective observer’ . . . is\n\nacquainted with the Free Exercise Clause and the values it promotes.\");\n\ncf. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d\n\n260, 263 ( 4th Cir. 1988) (exempting religious child care centers from\n\nstate licensing requirements should be perceived as \"‘an accommodation\n\nof the exercise of religion rather than as a government endorsement of\n\nreligion’\" (quoting Amos, 483 U.S. at 349 (O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n     In sum, the law does not take any of the paths forbidden by the\n\nEstablishment Clause. It does not endorse an individual religious\n\nfaith, it does not provide a direct financial subsidy to any religious\n\norganization, it does not inject religious activity into a nonreligious\n\n\n8\"It is well established . . . that `[t]he limits of permissible state\naccommodation to religion are by no means co-extensive with the\nnoninterference mandated by the Free Exercise Clause. Amos, 483 U.S.\nat 334 (quoting Walz, 397 U.S. at 673). Some courts, however, have\nheld that it is unconstitutional to exclude churches from residential\nareas. See 2 William W. Bassett, Religious Organizations and the Law\n§ 10:15 (1997).\n\n                                 -21-\n\fcontext, and it does not \"place [the state’s] prestige, coercive\n\nauthority, or resources\" behind religious faith in general, see Texas\n\nMonthly, 489 U.S. at 9, other than to acknowledge its presence and\n\nvalue -- as does the Constitution -- as \"an element of our societal\n\nmosaic,\" Walz, 397 U.S. at 693 (Brennan, J., concurring). The concerns\n\nunderlying the Establishment Clause arise not when religion is allowed\n\nby government to exist or even flourish, but when government sets a\n\nreligious agenda or becomes actively involved in religious activity.\n\nSee Amos, 483 U.S. at 337. By protecting religious uses of land among\n\nothers that are favored by communities generally, but that may\n\nencounter particular neighborhood disfavor, the Dover Amendment does\n\nnot itself advance religion but clears the way so that churches\n\nthemselves may do so. This is a permissible effect under Lemon. See\n\nAmos, 483 U.S. at 337. (\"A law is not unconstitutional simply because\n\nit allows churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose.\n\nFor a law to have forbidden `effects’ under Lemon, it must be fair to\n\nsay that the government itself has advanced religion through its own\n\nactivities and influence.\" (emphasis in original)).\n\n     B. The Belmont By-law\n\n     As originally enacted in 1925, section 3 of Belmont’s zoning by-\n\nlaw stated:\n\n          In a single residence district,\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f          (a) No building or structure shall be erected, altered\n     or used for any other purpose than the following, including\n     customary incidental uses:\n          (1) Single-family detached dwelling;\n          (2) Clubhouse . . . ;\n          (3) Lodging or boarding house . . . ;\n          (4) Educational or religious use . . . .\n\n\nThe by-law was later amended to reflect the requirements of the Dover\n\nAmendment, and the Schedule of Use Regulations that now constitutes §\n\n3.3 permits in all zoning districts \"Religious or educational use\n\nexempted from prohibition by [the Dover Amendment].\"\n\n     The Belmont by-law reflects the same benevolent attitude toward\n\nreligious uses of land that is implicit in the Dover Amendment and, as\n\ndiscussed earlier, we think it a passive preference that is consistent\n\nwith constitutional principles. Among the by-law’s stated purposes are\n\n\"to encourage water supply, drainage, sewerage, schools, parks, open\n\nspace and other public requirements\" and \"to encourage the most\n\nappropriate use of land throughout the Town.\" See Belmont Zoning By-\n\nlaw § 1.2 (emphasis added). A legislative judgment that religious\n\nactivities are suitable in all neighborhoods, whether made on the state\n\nor local level, does not by itself promote the practice of religion.\n\nIt simply recognizes the widely valued role of religious entities\n\nwithin our communities by guaranteeing them a physical place.\n\n     Although the by-law lacks the state statute’s explicit anti-\n\ndiscrimination purpose, we do not consider that additional rationale\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fnecessary to validate a zoning scheme that gives wide range to\n\nreligious uses of property among other uses that are similarly\n\nimportant to all communities. Moreover, because the current version of\n\nthe by-law specifically incorporates the Dover Amendment, we think it\n\nfair to view it as implicitly incorporating its anti-discrimination\n\npurpose.\n\n     In short, the Belmont by-law, like the Dover Amendment, is\n\nsufficiently   secular   in   purpose   and   effect   to   fall   within\n\nconstitutional boundaries; it recognizes the value of religion without\n\nimpermissibly promoting its exercise.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f                          III. Conclusion\n\n     We therefore conclude that both the state statute and the town by-\n\nlaw pass constitutional scrutiny. Accordingly, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment for appellees.\n\n                             Dissent follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge (Dissenting).       I am largely in\n\nagreement with the majority as to the legal standards which--fuzzy as\n\nthey may be--apply to this case. However, my application of those\n\nstandards leads me to a different result than that reached by the\n\nmajority, and I must respectfully dissent.\n\n           My first principal disagreement with the majority is that I\n\ndo not understand the Dover Amendment to be an anti-discrimination\n\nstatute. Had the Commonwealth of Massachusetts intended to prohibit\n\ndiscrimination against religion and religious land uses, it easily\n\ncould have enacted a law saying \"No municipality may discriminate\n\nagainst a proposed use of land on the basis of the religious nature of\n\nthe use or the religious beliefs or affiliation of the user.\" Such a\n\ngenuine anti-discrimination law would be plainly permissible under the\n\nEstablishment Clause. However, Massachusetts has instead prohibited\n\nany zoning ordinance that \"prohibits, regulates or restricts\" religious\n\nuses. The effect of this broader language goes far beyond prohibiting\n\nreligious intolerance, by exempting religious users from the ordinary\n\nzoning process and by granting them a \"free pass\" with regard to\n\nperhaps the most important issue in zoning regulation--location.9 In\n\nmy view, either the Dover Amendment responds to a purpose substantially\n\n\n\n9While the Dover Amendment allows for \"reasonable regulation\" of certain\naspects of physical structures, there can be no dispute that the\nstatute requires that religious uses be permitted on each and every\nparcel of land in every zoning district in the Commonwealth.\n\n                                 -26-\n\fbroader than merely preventing religious intolerance, or the statute is\n\nsubstantially broader than its purpose. Either way, the statute should\n\nnot receive a \"free pass\" of its own as if it were merely an anti-\n\ndiscrimination measure.\n\n          Second, the Dover Amendment does not embody the \"benevolent\n\nneutrality\" deigned by the Supreme Court to be the proper balance\n\nbetween the competing mandates of the Religion Clauses. A \"neutral\"\n\nstatute, in any ordinary sense of that word, would permit (and require)\n\nreligious uses and religious users to operate on an even playing field\n\nwith other uses and users, without special hindrances and without\n\nspecial advantage.     The Dover Amendment, in contrast, eschews\n\nneutrality to place religion in an exalted position, exempt from the\n\nordinary land-use decision making process.\n\n          The majority justifies this special treatment by holding\n\nthat, here, religion is just one beneficiary of a law that provides\n\nbenefits to a variety of groups and that, even if the benefit were\n\nrestricted just to religion, the Dover Amendment would be justified as\n\nan attempt to remove an obstacle to the free exercise of religion.\n\nAlthough I would agree with either justification in principle, neither\n\nis applicable here.\n\n          The majority is of course correct to recognize that religious\n\nentities may be the beneficiaries of laws that, for secular reasons,\n\nbenefit a variety of groups. See Majority Op. at 11 (citing Walz v.\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fTax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664 (1970), and Mueller v.\n\nAllen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983)). The lesson that I draw from cases such as\n\nWalz and Mueller is that, when religion is logically a member of some\n\ncohesive group to which a benefit is granted for a secular purpose, the\n\nConstitution does not demand the strange result of denying an otherwise\n\navailable benefit to a group solely because of the group's religious\n\nnature. However, the uses protected by the various provisions of\n\nChapter 40A, § 3, of the Massachusetts General Laws do not comprise any\n\ncohesive scheme comparable to that in Walz and Mueller. It is hard to\n\nimagine what common secular purpose unites such apparently divergent\n\ninterests as religious land users, HAM radio operators, and residents\n\nwho choose to use solar power in their homes. The only common scheme\n\nthat the majority offers is that \"these uses, though important to all\n\ncommunities, would be at risk of exclusion from certain zoning areas\n\nbecause of local prejudice unrelated to their compatibility with the\n\nessential nature of the existing community.\" Majority Op. at 11. Even\n\nassuming arguendo that these uses are in fact \"important to all\n\ncommunities\" and that there is a real \"risk of exclusion,\" I submit\n\nthat neither the appellees nor the majority have shown that such\n\nexclusion would be \"unrelated to compatibility with the essential\n\nnature of the existing community.\" Other than outright discrimination,\n\nwhich I heartedly agree could be properly prohibited (by an appropriate\n\nanti-discrimination statute), the majority can only suggest vaguely\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fthat religious uses might be excluded based on a \"general aversion to\n\nchange in the neighborhood.\" See Majority Op. at 12. More telling,\n\nhowever, are the motivations noted by the majority in another section\n\nof its opinion--increased traffic and noise, aesthetic considerations,\n\nand impact on commercial development. See id. at 14. These concerns,\n\nof course, are directly related to the compatibility of a particular\n\nuse or user with the essential nature of the existing community. In\n\nfact, far from evidencing some kind of religious intolerance (none of\n\nwhich is alleged in this case, by the way), these are precisely the\n\nkinds of secular concerns which form the basis for all zoning\n\nregulation.\n\n            The Dover Amendment insulates religion, HAM radio operators,\n\nsolar energy users, et cetera, from these typical zoning concerns for\n\none simple reason, which the majority recognizes--the state considers\n\nthese uses \"beneficial.\" Although the state may generally be free to\n\nprotect a use or activity solely on the basis that the state likes it,\n\nthe Establishment Clause prohibits such bare favoritism where the\n\nbeneficiary is religion.\n\n            Nor do I think that the Dover Amendment can be justified as\n\na governmental action aimed at lifting burdens on the free exercise of\n\nreligion.     See Maj. Op. at 12-13 (relying on Corporation of the\n\nPresiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v.\n\nAmos, 483 U.S. 327 (1987)). The majority states broadly that religious\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fusers face local sentiments \"ranging from outright hostility to\n\nindifference to the needs of religious organizations.\" Maj. Op. at 14.\n\nApart from religious intolerance, however, (which, again, I fully agree\n\ncan and should be prohibited by a proper anti-discrimination measure),\n\nthe majority points only to routine zoning considerations such as\n\nconcern with traffic, noise, aesthetics, and commercial stimulus as\n\npresenting potential \"burdens\" on the free exercise of religion. It\n\nmay be true that religious users face these common obstacles in the\n\nzoning context, but only to the extent that all land users face them.\n\nFrankly, I cannot see that requiring religious users to participate in\n\nthe ordinary process by which local land-use decisions are made amounts\n\nto such a burden on the exercise of religion as to justify a blanket\n\npreference like the Dover Amendment.      Cf. Amos, 483 U.S. at 336\n\n(finding that uncertain threat of liability imposed a \"significant\n\nburden\" on religious groups). Nor can I agree that the Dover Amendment\n\nmerely \"allows religious groups to advance their own cause\" rather than\n\nconstituting state promotion of religion. Through the Dover Amendment,\n\nMassachusetts has enacted a bare preference for religious uses of land\n\nand has placed the entire weight of the Commonwealth behind that\n\npreference. \"Benevolent neutrality\" and appropriate accommodation of\n\nreligion are laudable and constitutional objectives, but the Dover\n\nAmendment simply goes too far, in my opinion. See Amos, 483 U.S. at\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f334-35 (\"At some point, accommodation may devolve into 'an unlawful\n\nfostering of religion . . . .'\").\n\n            Furthermore, just as I differ with the majority somewhat in\n\nmy reading of Walz, Mueller, and Amos, I also have difficulty accepting\n\nthe majority's distinction of other Supreme Court precedents. Unlike\n\nthe majority, I find the Supreme Court's decision in Estate of Thornton\n\nv. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 (1985), quite persuasive here.          In the\n\nfundamental zoning consideration of location, the Dover Amendment\n\nprovides religious users with precisely the kind of \"absolute and\n\nunqualified right\" rejected in Thornton.      Id. at 709.   Just as in\n\nThornton, the Dover Amendment makes \"no exception for special\n\ncircumstances, . . . no exception when honoring the dictates of\n\n[religious users] would cause . . . substantial economic burdens or\n\nwhen . . . compliance would require the imposition of significant\n\nburdens on other[s, and] . . . no consideration as to whether the\n\n[municipality] has made reasonable accommodation proposals.\" Id. at\n\n709-10.\n\n            Likewise, I read the Supreme Court's fractured decision in\n\nTexas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989), to support striking\n\nthe Dover Amendment. As Justice Brennan stressed on behalf of three\n\njustices:\n\n            [W]hen government directs a subsidy exclusively\n            to religious organizations that is not required\n            by the Free Exercise Clause and that either\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\f           burdens nonbeneficiaries markedly or cannot\n           reasonably be seen as removing a significant\n           state-imposed deterrent to the free exercise of\n           religion, . . . it \"provides unjustifiable awards\n           of assistance to religious organizations\" and\n           cannot but \"convey a message of endorsement\" to\n           slighted members of the community.\n\nTexas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 15. Justices Blackmun and O'Connor stated\n\nthat \"[a] statutory preference for the dissemination of religious ideas\n\noffends our most basic understanding of what the Establishment Clause\n\nis all about,\" id. at 28 (Blackmun, J., concurring), and I believe the\n\nsame is true of a statutory preference for religious users in zoning\n\nmatters.\n\n           In summary, I cannot agree with the majority's acceptance of\n\nthe Dover Amendment as a tolerable accommodation of religion. I would\n\nhold that the statute fails both the purpose and effects prongs of the\n\nLemon test, and I would declare the Dover Amendment unconstitutional.\n\n           I am slightly more troubled by the need to strike down the\n\nBelmont bylaw. Unlike the majority, I am not entirely persuaded that\n\nthe Dover Amendment and the Belmont bylaw must stand or fall together.\n\nAfter all, what troubles me about the Dover Amendment is largely the\n\nfact that it removes religious users from the ordinary land-use\n\ndecision making process and thus places them in a position of\n\nconsiderable advantage over nonreligious uses and users. The Belmont\n\nbylaw would not necessarily raise such concerns, because a local zoning\n\nbylaw merely represents the product of precisely that ordinary local\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\fdecision making process which, if done on a \"level playing field,\"\n\nproperly determines local land-use issues.      However, because the\n\nBelmont bylaw is so closely tied to the Dover Amendment, I would find\n\nthat it is incurably infected with the unconstitutionality of the state\n\nstatute and must be stricken. I do not suggest, however, that the\n\nEstablishment Clause would prohibit the Town of Belmont from enacting\n\na bylaw permitting religious uses in any or all of its zoning\n\ndistricts, so long as such bylaw were enacted through the ordinary\n\nland-use decision making procedures.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\f",

It is brought by a group of residents of Belmont, Massachusetts, against Belmont officials and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, challenging the construction of a large temple on the edge of a residential district in the town. The district court upheld both provisions of law, granting summary judgment for defendants and allowing construction to proceed.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts of this case are undisputed and were submitted to the district court with cross-motions for summary judgment.  We draw our summary primarily from the district court's opinion, supplementing with details from the decision of the Belmont Zoning Board of Appeals and other pertinent record materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the \"Church\" or \"LDS\") acquired an 8.9-acre parcel of land in the Town of Belmont in 1979.  It constructed a meeting house on the property, which is located entirely in a single residential district, and has conducted religious services there since the mid-1980s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church later decided to build a temple on the site.  An LDS temple is a large facility, of which there are fewer than 100 worldwide, that is used solely for the Church's most sacred ceremonies.  Although Belmont's zoning by-law permits religious uses as of right in residential districts, see By-law &#167; 3.3, the Church filed an application for a special permit, as required, because it sought to exceed the allowable height limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a series of public hearings in which opponents raised a variety of concerns, the Zoning Board of Appeals in 1997 approved the special permit.  The Church voluntarily made numerous design changes in response to neighborhood concerns and obtained unanimous approval of its new design from the Board before it began construction.  The final plans call for the temple to occupy some 69,000 square feet and to include one 139-foot-tall spire and several smaller towers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The temple will be set back from abutters by at least 165 feet, and in most locations more than that, although plaintiffs are quick to point out that the setback will consist largely of a parking lot for over two hundred vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Belmont by-law allowing religious uses by right in the residential zone where the Church's property is located is in accordance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 3, known as the \"Dover Amendment.\"  That law provides, in part, that a zoning regulation may not restrict the use of land for religious or educational purposes when the property is owned by the Commonwealth, a religious organization, or a nonprofit educational corporation, except that \"reasonable regulations\" are permitted concerning such characteristics as the bulk and height of structures, open space, and parking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought this suit challenging both Belmont's by-law and the Dover Amendment, claiming that they violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by favoring religious uses of property without a secular purpose.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants in May 1999, finding that neither of the laws constitutes an impermissible \"establishment\" of religion.  Plaintiffs then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" a proscription that has been extended to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.  As the Supreme Court long has recognized, \"tension inevitably exists between the Free Exercise and the Establishment Clauses,\" Committee for Pub. Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 788 (1973) (citing Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1 (1947) and Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664 (1970)), and the Court has \"struggled to find a neutral course between [them],\" Walz, 397 U.S. at 668.  While the Free Exercise Clause admonishes the government against impinging on the religious beliefs and expression of its citizens, the Establishment Clause cautions that the government may not adopt the cause of religion as its own.  The Seventh Circuit has noted the challenge of reconciling the two Religion Clauses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The juxtaposition of the two clauses, and the internal tension they create, makes total separation between religion and government impossible.  Lynch [v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 673 (1984)]; Lemon [v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 614 (1971)].  Indeed, \"[i]t has never been thought either possible or desirable to enforce a regime of total separation\" between religion and government.  [Committee for Pub. Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 760 (1973).] Thus the Court has recognized that the First Amendment \"affirmatively mandates accommodation,\"Lynch, 465 U.S. at 673, and \"that the government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the Establishment Clause.\" Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm. of Florida, 480 U.S. 136, 144-45 (1987) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cohen v. City of Des Plaines, 8 F.3d 484, 491 (7th Cir. 1993); see Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334 (1987) (quotingHobbie, 480 U.S. at 144-45); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 312 (1952) (\"The First Amendment . . . does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and State.\"). Our task in navigating the course between the opposing mandates of the Religion Clauses is thus to strike that appropriate balance referred to by the Court as a \"benevolent neutrality,\" Walz, 397 U.S. at 669; see also Amos, 483 U.S. at 334.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical framework for analysis in cases such as this, the Supreme Court has adopted the three-part test articulated inLemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971), which states that a law does not violate the Establishment Clause if (1) it has a secular legislative purpose, (2) its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) the statute does not foster excessive government entanglement with religion.  See,e.g., Amos, 483 U.S. at 335-39; Rojas v. Fitch, 127 F.3d 184, 187 (lst Cir. 1997).  The parties generally agree that the third requirement is satisfied in this case, so we will focus, as the parties have done, on the purpose and effects inquiries.  Because the state statute (the Dover Amendment) effectively requires municipalities to enact by-laws like that adopted by Belmont, our conclusion that the Dover Amendment is constitutionally permissible largely resolves the lawfulness of the ordinance as well.  We therefore discuss the ordinance only briefly in section B, infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Dover Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3 of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws limits the zoning regulations that can be imposed on certain types of land uses, including agriculture, religious use of property owned by either the Commonwealth or a religious group, nonprofit educational uses, child care facilities, access for physically handicapped persons to private property, solar energy systems, and antennas for federally licensed amateur radio operators.  The zoning of religious and educational uses is addressed in the second paragraph of the section and reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No zoning ordinance or by-law shall . . . prohibit, regulate or restrict the use of land or structures for religious purposes or for educational purposes on land owned or leased by the commonwealth or any of its agencies, subdivisions or bodies politic or by a religious sect or denomination, or by a nonprofit educational corporation; provided, however, that such land or structures may be subject to reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of structures and determining yard sizes, lot area, setbacks, open space, parking and building coverage requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This provision is commonly known as the Dover Amendment because its religion-focused component was enacted in 1950 in response to a zoning by-law passed by the town of Dover, Massachusetts, prohibiting religious schools within that town's residential neighborhoods.  See Trustees of Tufts College v.City of Medford, 415 Mass. 753, 757-58, 616 N.E.2d 433, 437-38 (1993); Attorney General v. Dover, 327 Mass. 601, 603-04 (1951);The Bible Speaks v. Board of Appeals of Lenox, 8 Mass. App. Ct. 19, 28, 391 N.E.2d 279, 284 (1979).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The protections for other types of uses were added in later years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs maintain that giving religious organizations the advantage of preferred zoning status constitutes an impermissible endorsement of religion, in violation of the Establishment Clause. Under Lemon, our first step in evaluating the Dover Amendment's constitutionality is to ascertain whether it serves a \"secular legislative purpose.\"  See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that the law's purpose must be unrelated to religion - that would amount to a requirement \"that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups,\" Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314 (1952).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amos, 483 U.S. at 335.  We think the purpose of the Dover Amendment fits easily within the established boundaries of \"benevolent neutrality,\" see id. at 334, in which religious exercise is supported but not promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that the law was enacted to prevent religious discrimination of the sort embodied in the Dover by-law, which allowed secular educational institutions but barred sectarian ones in the town's residential areas.  Indeed, the provision was originally titled \"An Act Prohibiting Discriminatory Zoning By-laws and Ordinances.\"  See Tufts College, 415 Mass. at 757, 616 N.E.2d at 437-38 (purpose of the Amendment was \"to strike a balance between preventing local discrimination against an educational [or religious] use . . . and honoring legitimate municipal concerns that typically find expression in local zoning laws\").  Prohibition of religious discrimination is unquestionably an appropriate, secular legislative purpose.  See, e.g., Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532 (1993) (\"Indeed, it was 'historical instances of religious persecution and intolerance that gave concern to those who drafted the Free Exercise Clause.'\"); cf. Walz, 397 U.S. at 673 (noting, in case challenging property tax exemption for religious uses of property, that \"[g]overnments have not always been tolerant of religious activity\" and that \"[g]rants of exemption historically reflect the concern of authors of constitutions and statutes as to the latent dangers inherent in the imposition of property taxes\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants do not dispute the legitimacy of protecting religious entities from discrimination, but they argue that the Dover Amendment goes unconstitutionally beyond such a purpose to endorse and benefit religious uses by removing \"any type of reallocal zoning control of religious sites\" (emphasis in appellants' brief).   This argument brings us to the second Lemon prong, which examines whether, irrespective of the government's actual purpose, the practice under review has the \"principal or primary effect\" of endorsing or disapproving religion, Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 55 (1985) (quoting Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612).  Appellants maintain that the statute provides such a substantial advantage to religious institutions that, in effect, it constitutes an advancement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note as an initial matter that a law that simply protects religious organizations from unfair treatment certainly cannot be impermissible as an unconstitutional endorsement of religious activity. See generally Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 220-21 (1972) (The Establishment Clause \"cannot be allowed to prevent any exception\" to laws of general applicability which fosters the free exercise of religion.). Yet, it is possible for government to extend itself so far in preventing unfairness that it crosses the line from acceptable accommodation to impermissible favoritism. See Amos, 483 U.S. at 334-35 (\"At some point, accommodation may devolve into `an unlawful fostering of religion . . . .'\") (quotingHobbie, 480 U.S. at 145)); Yoder, 406 U.S. at 220-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the precise location of that threshold can be difficult to detect, we are confident that it has not been reached here.  Appellants' depiction of the statute as an impermissible legal hammer wielded in favor of religion both grossly exaggerates the reach of the statute and understates the recognition that religion may be given consistent with the Establishment Clause.  As for the statute's scope, it does not exempt religious property uses from substantial standard zoning requirements that are designed to ensure compatible uses of land.  As earlier noted, the statute explicitly states in a proviso that limitations imposed on other property owners concerning such specific features as the bulk and height of structures, lot area, setbacks and required parking also may be imposed on religious organizations.  See ch. 40A, &#167; 3. Thus, a religious institution, no less than any other group, must comply with reasonable regulations designed to preserve a comfortable, desirable community.  See Tufts College, 415 Mass. at 760, 616 N.E.2d at 439 (\"[T]he Dover Amendment is intended to encourage `a degree of accommodation between the protected use . . . and matters of critical municipal concern . . . .'\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the statute's assertedly improper focus on religion, plaintiffs err in two respects: the statute does not benefit only religious uses and, even if it did, such unique treatment can withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look first at the statute's coverage.  While the original Dover Amendment was directed solely at religious uses of property, the provision now includes a variety of uses linked together by the legislature's apparent judgment that these uses, though important to all communities, would be at risk of exclusion from certain zoning areas because of local prejudice unrelated to their compatibility with the essential nature of the existing community. Our task is to consider the validity of the statute before us, not the one enacted fifty years ago.  See generally Walz, 397 U.S. at 688 n.8 (\"The only governmental purposes germane to the present inquiry . . . are those that now exist.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has long been accepted that religious entities may be the beneficiaries of laws that, for secular reasons, provide benefits to a variety of groups. See Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1, 10-13 (1989) (plurality opinion); Rojas, 127 F.3d at 188-89.  Among the most prominent examples are the exemption from property taxes upheld by the Supreme Court in Walz, 397 U.S. at 664, and the tax deduction for the expenses of religious education allowed in Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983).  In his concurrence in Walz, Justice Brennan observed that New York included churches within the exempted class \"not because it champions religion per se but because it values religion among a variety of private, nonprofit enterprises that contribute to the diversity of the Nation.\"  Walz, 397 U.S. at 693.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think an equivalent description applies to the state's judgment here.  In protecting religious, educational, agricultural and the other listed uses of property from exclusion -- whether resulting from discrimination or simply from a general aversion to change in the neighborhood -- Massachusetts evidences \"an affirmative policy that considers these groups as beneficial and stabilizing influences in community life,\" wherever they are located, see id. at 673.  The Supreme Court has time and again made it clear that to include religion in such a category is not to advance religion in contravention of the Establishment Clause.  The collection of favored uses in the Dover Amendment is amply diverse in the context of zoning to support such a determination.  See Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 15  (\"How expansive the class of exempt organizations or activities must be to withstand constitutional assault depends upon the State's secular aim in granting a tax exemption.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to our second point regarding the statute's focus on religion, we note that even a special status granted exclusively to religious organizations is not always impermissible.  This conclusion is inevitably drawn from our analysis of three of the Supreme Court's more recent Establishment Clause cases.  All address benefits that were granted only to religious groups or solely on the basis of religion.  One upholds the benefit granted, while the other two invalidate the statutes at issue.  Their holdings are instructive, for we see this case as governed by the former and easily distinguishable from the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Amos, the Supreme Court upheld section 702 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which exempted religious organizations from Title VII's prohibition against discrimination in employment on the basis of religion.  See 483 U.S. at 327.  Noting the Court's longstanding recognition that \"`government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the Establishment Clause,'\" id. at 334 (quoting Hobbie, 480 U.S. at 144-45), the Court endorsed state efforts \"to alleviate significant governmental interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious missions,\"id. at 335.  The Court declined to invalidate the exemption on the basis that it singled out religious groups for a benefit, stating that where \"government acts with the proper purpose of lifting a regulation that burdens the exercise of religion, we see no reason to require that the exemption comes packaged with benefits to secular entities.\"  Id. at 338.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts' effort to eliminate local zoning discrimination is fully in line with the Court's approval of government actions aimed at lifting burdens from the exercise of religion.  Not only was the Dover Amendment at its origin a defensible response to an actual incident of discrimination, but protections against land use bias continue to be supportable fifty years later.  Two recent law review articles canvassing discrimination against religion in the land use context report numerous instances of zoning actions that reflect local sentiments ranging from outright hostility to indifference to the needs of religious organizations, with minority religions particularly hard hit.  See Douglas Laycock, \"State RFRAs [Religious Freedom Restoration Acts] and Land Use Regulation,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 755, 771, 778-80 (1999) [hereinafter \"State RFRAs\"]<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>; Von G. Keetch &amp; Matthew K.

See \"State RFRAs,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 761-62, 774-75; seealso, e.g., Christian Gospel Church v. San Francisco, 896 F.2d 1221, 1224 (9th Cir. 1990) (upholding denial of permit for church to hold worship services in residential neighborhood, noting that zoning \"protects the zones' inhabitants from problems of traffic, noise and litter\") (citation omitted); Cornerstone Bible Church v.City of Hastings, 948 F.2d 464, 467 (8th Cir. 1991) (quoting city council resolution excluding churches from the town's central business district because \"no business or retail contribution or activity is generated\").  Certainly in the face of such evidence, the state's decision to give religion an assist in the local land-use planning process is consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Amos that legislation isolating religious groups for special treatment is permissible when done for the \"proper purpose\" of alleviating a burden on the exercise of religion.  See Amos, 483 U.S. at 337-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the Court's two other cases, both of which struck down benefits given exclusively for religious reasons, points to a contrary result in this case.  In Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 (1985), the Court invalidated a Connecticut statute guaranteeing employees the right to take their chosen Sabbath day off from work.  The Court noted that the \"absolute and unqualified right\" given to Sabbath observers required employers to conform their business practices to an employee's religious practices without any \"consideration as to whether the employer has made reasonable accommodation proposals,\"  see id. at 709-10, conveying a message of \"endorsement of a particular religious belief, to the detriment of those who do not share it,\" id. at 711 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have observed, the Dover Amendment does not give religious organizations an \"absolute and unqualified right\" to build whatever structures they desire in residential or other zones.  The protection given religious uses is moderated by the community's countervailing interest in minimizing adverse impacts to communities, which is reflected in the requirement that religious uses conform to the standard physical limitations imposed on all buildings located in that zone.  Moreover, in a further distinction from the Connecticut statute, the Dover Amendment does not protect one type of religious activity, but \"extends . . . to all religious beliefs and practices,\" Thornton, 472 U.S. at 712 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  We think it clear, therefore, that \"an objective observer would perceive it as an anti-discrimination law rather than an endorsement of religion or a particular religious practice.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 1,  five justices in two separate opinions struck down a Texas statute exempting religious periodicals, and no other publications, from state sales tax.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In the view of this combined majority of the court, the statute failed for lack of a secular objective.  See id. at 14-15; 28.  In his concurring opinion joined by Justice O'Connor, Justice Blackmun observed that \"[a] statutory preference for the dissemination of religious ideas offends our most basic understanding of what the Establishment Clause is all about and hence is constitutionally intolerable.\"  Id. at 28.   Here, by contrast, the statute both has an express secular purpose and it embraces a variety of land uses likely to encounter similar local opposition.  As such, it does not suffer from the Texas Monthly constitutional flaws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the favorable attitude toward religion reflected in the Dover Amendment does not constitute a fostering of, or favoritism toward, religion over non-religion, but represents a secular judgment that religious institutions, by their nature, are compatible with every other type of land use and thus will not detract from the quality of life in any neighborhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An impressive body of case law and scholarly texts and articles supports this conclusion.

Orthodox Jews, for example, believe they are prohibited by the Torah, the Jewish Bible, from using automobiles on their Sabbath.  They therefore must live within walking distance of a synagogue.  See, e.g., LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 67 F.3d 412, 430 (2d Cir. 1995); \"State RFFAs,\" 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 779-80.  Although we do not suggest that the Free Exercise Clause mandates the Dover Amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the fact that the law may serve to avoid a possible barrier to participation in communal worship highlights its effect as an accommodation, rather than a promotion, of religion.  See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. at 83 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"[I]n determining whether the statute conveys the message of endorsement of religion . . . courts should assume that the `objective observer' . . . is acquainted with the Free Exercise Clause and the values it promotes.\"); cf. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260, 263 (4th Cir. 1988) (exempting religious child care centers from state licensing requirements should be perceived as \"'an accommodation of the exercise of religion rather than as a government endorsement of religion'\" (quoting Amos, 483 U.S. at 349 (O'Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the law does not take any of the paths forbidden by the Establishment Clause.  It does not endorse an individual religious faith, it does not provide a direct financial subsidy to any religious organization, it does not inject religious activity into a nonreligious context, and it does not \"place [the state's] prestige, coercive authority, or resources\" behind religious faith in general, see Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 9, other than to acknowledge its presence and value -- as does the Constitution -- as \"an element of our societal mosaic,\" Walz, 397 U.S. at 693 (Brennan, J., concurring).  The concerns underlying the Establishment Clause arise not when religion is allowed by government to exist or even flourish, but when government sets a religious agenda or becomes actively involved in religious activity.  See Amos, 483 U.S. at 337.  By protecting religious uses of land among others that are favored by communities generally, but that may encounter particular neighborhood disfavor, the Dover Amendment does not itself advance religion but clears the way so that churches themselves may do so.  This is a permissible effect under Lemon.  See Amos, 483 U.S. at 337.  (\"A law is not unconstitutional simply because it allows churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose.  For a law to have forbidden `effects' under Lemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Belmont By-law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As originally enacted in 1925, section 3 of Belmont's zoning by-law stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a single residence district,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) No building or structure shall be erected, altered or used for any other purpose than the following, including customary incidental uses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Single-family detached dwelling;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Clubhouse . . . ;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Lodging or boarding house . . . ;(4) Educational or religious use . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The by-law was later amended to reflect the requirements of the Dover Amendment, and the Schedule of Use Regulations that now constitutes &#167; 3.3 permits in all zoning districts \"Religious or educational use exempted from prohibition by [the Dover Amendment].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Belmont by-law reflects the same benevolent attitude toward religious uses of land that is implicit in the Dover Amendment and, as discussed earlier, we think it a passive preference that is consistent with constitutional principles. Among the by-law's stated purposes are \"to encourage water supply, drainage, sewerage, schools, parks, open space and other public requirements\" and \"to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the Town.\"  See Belmont Zoning By-law &#167; 1.2 (emphasis added).  A legislative judgment that religious activities are suitable in all neighborhoods, whether made on the state or local level, does not by itself promote the practice of religion.  It simply recognizes the widely valued role of religious entities within our communities by guaranteeing them a physical place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the by-law lacks the state statute's explicit anti-discrimination purpose, we do not consider that additional rationale necessary to validate a zoning scheme that gives wide range to religious uses of property among other uses that are similarly important to all communities.  Moreover, because the current version of the by-law specifically incorporates the Dover Amendment, we think it fair to view it as implicitly incorporating its anti-discrimination purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the Belmont by-law, like the Dover Amendment, is sufficiently secular in purpose and effect to fall within constitutional boundaries; it recognizes the value of religion without impermissibly promoting its exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that both the state statute and the town by-law pass constitutional scrutiny.

Had the Commonwealth of Massachusetts intended to prohibit discrimination against religion and religious land uses, it easily could have enacted a law saying \"No municipality may discriminate against a proposed use of land on the basis of the religious nature of the use or the religious beliefs or affiliation of the user.\"  Such a genuine anti-discrimination law would be plainly permissible under the Establishment Clause. However, Massachusetts has instead prohibited any zoning ordinance that \"prohibits, regulates or restricts\" religious uses.  The effect of this broader language goes far beyond prohibiting religious intolerance, by exempting religious users from the ordinary zoning process and by granting them a \"free pass\" with regard to perhaps the most important issue in zoning regulation--location.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In my view, either the Dover Amendment responds to a purpose substantially broader than merely preventing religious intolerance, or the statute is substantially broader than its purpose.  Either way, the statute should not receive a \"free pass\" of its own as if it were merely an anti-discrimination measure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Dover Amendment does not embody the \"benevolent neutrality\" deigned by the Supreme Court to be the proper balance between the competing mandates of the Religion Clauses.  A \"neutral\" statute, in any ordinary sense of that word, would permit (and require) religious uses and religious users to operate on an even playing field with other uses and users, without special hindrances and without special advantage.  The Dover Amendment, in contrast, eschews neutrality to place religion in an exalted position, exempt from the ordinary land-use decision making process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority justifies this special treatment by holding that, here, religion is just one beneficiary of a law that provides benefits to a variety of groups and that, even if the benefit were restricted just to religion, the Dover Amendment would be justified as an attempt to remove an obstacle to the free exercise of religion.  Although I would agree with either justification in principle, neither is applicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is of course correct to recognize that religious entities may be the beneficiaries of laws that, for secular reasons, benefit a variety of groups.  See Majority Op. at 11 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664 (1970), and Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983)).  The lesson that I draw from cases such as Walzaand Mueller is that, when religion is logically a member of some cohesive group to which a benefit is granted for a secular purpose, the Constitution does not demand the strange result of denying an otherwise available benefit to a group solely because of the group's religious nature. However, the uses protected by the various provisions of Chapter 40A, &#167; 3, of the Massachusetts General Laws do not comprise any cohesive scheme comparable to that in Walz and Mueller.  It is hard to imagine what common secular purpose unites such apparently divergent interests as religious land users, HAM radio operators, and residents who choose to use solar power in their homes.  The only common scheme that the majority offers is that \"these uses, though important to all communities, would be at risk of exclusion from certain zoning areas because of local prejudice unrelated to their compatibility with the essential nature of the existing community.\"  Majority Op. at 11.  Even assuming arguendo that these uses are in fact \"important to all communities\" and that there is a real \"risk of exclusion,\" I submit that neither the appellees nor the majority have shown that such exclusion would be \"unrelated to compatibility with the essential nature of the existing community.\" Other than outright discrimination, which I heartedly agree could be properly prohibited (by an appropriate anti-discrimination statute), the majority can only suggest vaguely that religious uses might be excluded based on a \"general aversion to change in the neighborhood.\"  SeeaMajority Op. at 12.  More telling, however, are the motivations noted by the majority in another section of its opinion--increased traffic and noise, aesthetic considerations, and impact on commercial development.  See id. at 14.  These concerns, of course, are directly related to the compatibility of a particular use or user with the essential nature of the existing community.  In fact, far from evidencing some kind of religious intolerance (none of which is alleged in this case, by the way), these are precisely the kinds of secular concerns which form the basis for all zoning regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dover Amendment insulates religion, HAM radio operators, solar energy users, et cetera, from these typical zoning concerns for one simple reason, which the majority recognizes--the state considers these uses \"beneficial.\"  Although the state may generally be free to protect a use or activity solely on the basis that the state likes it, the Establishment Clause prohibits such bare favoritism where the beneficiary is religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do I think that the Dover Amendment can be  justified as a governmental action aimed at lifting burdens on the free exercise of religion.  See Maj. Op. at 12-13 (relying onCorporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327 (1987)).  The majority states broadly that religious users face local sentiments \"ranging from outright hostility to indifference to the needs of religious organizations.\"  Maj. Op. at 14.  Apart from religious intolerance, however, (which, again, I fully agree can and should be prohibited by a proper anti-discrimination measure), the majority points only to routine zoning considerations such as concern with traffic, noise, aesthetics, and commercial stimulus as presenting potential \"burdens\" on the free exercise of religion.  It may be true that religious users face these common obstacles in the zoning context, but only to the extent that allaland users face them.  Frankly, I cannot see that requiring religious users to participate in the ordinary process by which local land-use decisions are made amounts to such a burden on the exercise of religion as to justify a blanket preference like the Dover Amendment.  Cf. Amos, 483 U.S. at 336 (finding that uncertain threat of liability imposed a \"significant burden\" on religious groups).  Nor can I agree that the Dover Amendment merely \"allows religious groups to advance their own cause\" rather than constituting state promotion of religion.  Through the Dover Amendment, Massachusetts has enacted a bare preference for religious uses of land and has placed the entire weight of the Commonwealth behind that preference. \"Benevolent neutrality\" and appropriate accommodation of religion are laudable and constitutional objectives, but the Dover Amendment simply goes too far, in my opinion.  See Amos, 483 U.S. at 334-35 (\"At some point, accommodation may devolve into 'an unlawful fostering of religion . . . .'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, just as I differ with the majority somewhat in my reading of Walz, Mueller, and Amos, I also have difficulty accepting the majority's distinction of other Supreme Court precedents.  Unlike the majority, I find the Supreme Court's decision in Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 (1985), quite persuasive here.  In the fundamental zoning consideration of location, the Dover Amendment provides religious users with precisely the kind of \"absolute and unqualified right\" rejected inThornton.  Id. at 709.  Just as in Thornton, the Dover Amendment makes \"no exception for special circumstances, . . . no exception when honoring the dictates of [religious users] would cause . . . substantial economic burdens or when . . . compliance would require the imposition of significant burdens on other[s, and] . . . no consideration as to whether the [municipality] has made reasonable accommodation proposals.\"  Id. at 709-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, I read the Supreme Court's fractured decision in Texas Monthly, Inc. v.

Justices Blackmun and O'Connor stated that \"[a] statutory preference for the dissemination of religious ideas offends our most basic understanding of what the Establishment Clause is all about,\" id. at 28 (Blackmun, J., concurring), and I believe the same is true of a statutory preference for religious users in zoning matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, I cannot agree with the majority's acceptance of the Dover Amendment as a tolerable accommodation of religion. I would hold that the statute fails both the purpose and effects prongs of the Lemonatest, and I would declare the Dover Amendment unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am slightly more troubled by the need to strike down the Belmont bylaw.  Unlike the majority, I am not entirely persuaded that the Dover Amendment and the Belmont bylaw must stand or fall together.  After all, what troubles me about the Dover Amendment is largely the fact that it removes religious users from the ordinary land-use decision making process and thus places them in a position of considerable advantage over nonreligious uses and users.  The Belmont bylaw would not necessarily raise such concerns, because a local zoning bylaw merely represents the product of precisely that ordinary local decision making process which, if done on a \"level playing field,\" properly determines local land-use issues.  However, because the Belmont bylaw is so closely tied to the Dover Amendment, I would find that it is incurably infected with the unconstitutionality of the state statute and must be stricken.  I do not suggest, however, that the Establishment Clause would prohibit the Town of Belmont from enacting a bylaw permitting religious uses in any or all of its zoning districts, so long as such bylaw were enacted through the ordinary land-use decision making procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> While the Dover Amendment allows for \"reasonable regulation\" of certain aspects of physical structures, there can be no dispute that the statute requires that religious uses be permitted on each and every parcel of land in every zoning district in the Commonwealth.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

It is brought by a group of residents of Belmont, Massachusetts, against Belmont officials and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, challenging the construction of a large temple on the edge of a residential district in the town. The district court upheld both provisions of law, granting summary judgment for defendants and allowing construction to proceed.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts of this case are undisputed and were submitted to the district court with cross-motions for summary judgment.  We draw our summary primarily from the district court's opinion, supplementing with details from the decision of the Belmont Zoning Board of Appeals and other pertinent record materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the \"Church\" or \"LDS\") acquired an 8.9-acre parcel of land in the Town of Belmont in 1979.  It constructed a meeting house on the property, which is located entirely in a single residential district, and has conducted religious services there since the mid-1980s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church later decided to build a temple on the site.  An LDS temple is a large facility, of which there are fewer than 100 worldwide, that is used solely for the Church's most sacred ceremonies.  Although Belmont's zoning by-law permits religious uses as of right in residential districts, see By-law &#167; 3.3, the Church filed an application for a special permit, as required, because it sought to exceed the allowable height limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a series of public hearings in which opponents raised a variety of concerns, the Zoning Board of Appeals in 1997 approved the special permit.  The Church voluntarily made numerous design changes in response to neighborhood concerns and obtained unanimous approval of its new design from the Board before it began construction.  The final plans call for the temple to occupy some 69,000 square feet and to include one 139-foot-tall spire and several smaller towers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The temple will be set back from abutters by at least 165 feet, and in most locations more than that, although plaintiffs are quick to point out that the setback will consist largely of a parking lot for over two hundred vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Belmont by-law allowing religious uses by right in the residential zone where the Church's property is located is in accordance with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 3, known as the \"Dover Amendment.\"  That law provides, in part, that a zoning regulation may not restrict the use of land for religious or educational purposes when the property is owned by the Commonwealth, a religious organization, or a nonprofit educational corporation, except that \"reasonable regulations\" are permitted concerning such characteristics as the bulk and height of structures, open space, and parking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought this suit challenging both Belmont's by-law and the Dover Amendment, claiming that they violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by favoring religious uses of property without a secular purpose.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants in May 1999, finding that neither of the laws constitutes an impermissible \"establishment\" of religion.  Plaintiffs then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

While the Free Exercise Clause admonishes the government against impinging on the religious beliefs and expression of its citizens, the Establishment Clause cautions that the government may not adopt the cause of religion as its own.

The parties generally agree that the third requirement is satisfied in this case, so we will focus, as the parties have done, on the purpose and effects inquiries.  Because the state statute (the Dover Amendment) effectively requires municipalities to enact by-laws like that adopted by Belmont, our conclusion that the Dover Amendment is constitutionally permissible largely resolves the lawfulness of the ordinance as well.

Appellants' depiction of the statute as an impermissible legal hammer wielded in favor of religion both grossly exaggerates the reach of the statute and understates the recognition that religion may be given consistent with the Establishment Clause.  As for the statute's scope, it does not exempt religious property uses from substantial standard zoning requirements that are designed to ensure compatible uses of land.  As earlier noted, the statute explicitly states in a proviso that limitations imposed on other property owners concerning such specific features as the bulk and height of structures, lot area, setbacks and required parking also may be imposed on religious organizations.  See ch. 40A, &#167; 3. Thus, a religious institution, no less than any other group, must comply with reasonable regulations designed to preserve a comfortable, desirable community.

This conclusion is inevitably drawn from our analysis of three of the Supreme Court's more recent Establishment Clause cases.  All address benefits that were granted only to religious groups or solely on the basis of religion.  One upholds the benefit granted, while the other two invalidate the statutes at issue.

Two recent law review articles canvassing discrimination against religion in the land use context report numerous instances of zoning actions that reflect local sentiments ranging from outright hostility to indifference to the needs of religious organizations, with minority religions particularly hard hit.

Certainly in the face of such evidence, the state's decision to give religion an assist in the local land-use planning process is consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Amos that legislation isolating religious groups for special treatment is permissible when done for the \"proper purpose\" of alleviating a burden on the exercise of religion.

A legislative judgment that religious activities are suitable in all neighborhoods, whether made on the state or local level, does not by itself promote the practice of religion.

Moreover, because the current version of the by-law specifically incorporates the Dover Amendment, we think it fair to view it as implicitly incorporating its anti-discrimination purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the Belmont by-law, like the Dover Amendment, is sufficiently secular in purpose and effect to fall within constitutional boundaries; it recognizes the value of religion without impermissibly promoting its exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

However, my application of those standards leads me to a different result than that reached by the majority, and I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My first principal disagreement with the majority is that I do not understand the Dover Amendment to be an anti-discrimination statute.  Had the Commonwealth of Massachusetts intended to prohibit discrimination against religion and religious land uses, it easily could have enacted a law saying \"No municipality may discriminate against a proposed use of land on the basis of the religious nature of the use or the religious beliefs or affiliation of the user.\"  Such a genuine anti-discrimination law would be plainly permissible under the Establishment Clause. However, Massachusetts has instead prohibited any zoning ordinance that \"prohibits, regulates or restricts\" religious uses.  The effect of this broader language goes far beyond prohibiting religious intolerance, by exempting religious users from the ordinary zoning process and by granting them a \"free pass\" with regard to perhaps the most important issue in zoning regulation--location.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In my view, either the Dover Amendment responds to a purpose substantially broader than merely preventing religious intolerance, or the statute is substantially broader than its purpose.  Either way, the statute should not receive a \"free pass\" of its own as if it were merely an anti-discrimination measure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Dover Amendment does not embody the \"benevolent neutrality\" deigned by the Supreme Court to be the proper balance between the competing mandates of the Religion Clauses.  A \"neutral\" statute, in any ordinary sense of that word, would permit (and require) religious uses and religious users to operate on an even playing field with other uses and users, without special hindrances and without special advantage.  The Dover Amendment, in contrast, eschews neutrality to place religion in an exalted position, exempt from the ordinary land-use decision making process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority justifies this special treatment by holding that, here, religion is just one beneficiary of a law that provides benefits to a variety of groups and that, even if the benefit were restricted just to religion, the Dover Amendment would be justified as an attempt to remove an obstacle to the free exercise of religion.  Although I would agree with either justification in principle, neither is applicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is of course correct to recognize that religious entities may be the beneficiaries of laws that, for secular reasons, benefit a variety of groups.  See Majority Op. at 11 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108135\"><a href=\"/opinion/108135/walz-v-tax-commn-of-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span> </a></span>(1970), and Mueller v. Allen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111003\"><a href=\"/opinion/111003/mueller-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span> </a></span>(1983)).  The lesson that I draw from cases such as Walzaand Mueller is that, when religion is logically a member of some cohesive group to which a benefit is granted for a secular purpose, the Constitution does not demand the strange result of denying an otherwise available benefit to a group solely because of the group's religious nature. However, the uses protected by the various provisions of Chapter 40A, &#167; 3, of the Massachusetts General Laws do not comprise any cohesive scheme comparable to that in Walz and Mueller.  It is hard to imagine what common secular purpose unites such apparently divergent interests as religious land users, HAM radio operators, and residents who choose to use solar power in their homes.  The only common scheme that the majority offers is that \"these uses, though important to all communities, would be at risk of exclusion from certain zoning areas because of local prejudice unrelated to their compatibility with the essential nature of the existing community.\"  Majority Op. at 11.  Even assuming arguendo that these uses are in fact \"important to all communities\" and that there is a real \"risk of exclusion,\" I submit that neither the appellees nor the majority have shown that such exclusion would be \"unrelated to compatibility with the essential nature of the existing community.\" Other than outright discrimination, which I heartedly agree could be properly prohibited (by an appropriate anti-discrimination statute), the majority can only suggest vaguely that religious uses might be excluded based on a \"general aversion to change in the neighborhood.\"  SeeaMajority Op. at 12.  More telling, however, are the motivations noted by the majority in another section of its opinion--increased traffic and noise, aesthetic considerations, and impact on commercial development.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 14. </span> These concerns, of course, are directly related to the compatibility of a particular use or user with the essential nature of the existing community.  In fact, far from evidencing some kind of religious intolerance (none of which is alleged in this case, by the way), these are precisely the kinds of secular concerns which form the basis for all zoning regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dover Amendment insulates religion, HAM radio operators, solar energy users, et cetera, from these typical zoning concerns for one simple reason, which the majority recognizes--the state considers these uses \"beneficial.\"  Although the state may generally be free to protect a use or activity solely on the basis that the state likes it, the Establishment Clause prohibits such bare favoritism where the beneficiary is religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do I think that the Dover Amendment can be  justified as a governmental action aimed at lifting burdens on the free exercise of religion.  See Maj. Op. at 12-13 (relying onCorporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111944\"><a href=\"/opinion/111944/corporation-of-presiding-bishop-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span> </a></span>(1987)).  The majority states broadly that religious users face local sentiments \"ranging from outright hostility to indifference to the needs of religious organizations.\"  Maj. Op. at 14.  Apart from religious intolerance, however, (which, again, I fully agree can and should be prohibited by a proper anti-discrimination measure), the majority points only to routine zoning considerations such as concern with traffic, noise, aesthetics, and commercial stimulus as presenting potential \"burdens\" on the free exercise of religion.  It may be true that religious users face these common obstacles in the zoning context, but only to the extent that allaland users face them.  Frankly, I cannot see that requiring religious users to participate in the ordinary process by which local land-use decisions are made amounts to such a burden on the exercise of religion as to justify a blanket preference like the Dover Amendment.  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111944\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Amos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111944/corporation-of-presiding-bishop-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">336</span> </a></span>(finding that uncertain threat of liability imposed a \"significant burden\" on religious groups).  Nor can I agree that the Dover Amendment merely \"allows religious groups to advance their own cause\" rather than constituting state promotion of religion.  Through the Dover Amendment, Massachusetts has enacted a bare preference for religious uses of land and has placed the entire weight of the Commonwealth behind that preference. \"Benevolent neutrality\" and appropriate accommodation of religion are laudable and constitutional objectives, but the Dover Amendment simply goes too far, in my opinion.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111944\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Amos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111944/corporation-of-presiding-bishop-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span>-35 (\"At some point, accommodation may devolve into 'an unlawful fostering of religion . . . .'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, just as I differ with the majority somewhat in my reading of Walz, Mueller, and Amos, I also have difficulty accepting the majority's distinction of other Supreme Court precedents.

Unlike the majority, I am not entirely persuaded that the Dover Amendment and the Belmont bylaw must stand or fall together.  After all, what troubles me about the Dover Amendment is largely the fact that it removes religious users from the ordinary land-use decision making process and thus places them in a position of considerable advantage over nonreligious uses and users.  The Belmont bylaw would not necessarily raise such concerns, because a local zoning bylaw merely represents the product of precisely that ordinary local decision making process which, if done on a \"level playing field,\" properly determines local land-use issues.  However, because the Belmont bylaw is so closely tied to the Dover Amendment, I would find that it is incurably infected with the unconstitutionality of the state statute and must be stricken.  I do not suggest, however, that the Establishment Clause would prohibit the Town of Belmont from enacting a bylaw permitting religious uses in any or all of its zoning districts, so long as such bylaw were enacted through the ordinary land-use decision making procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> While the Dover Amendment allows for \"reasonable regulation\" of certain aspects of physical structures, there can be no dispute that the statute requires that religious uses be permitted on each and every parcel of land in every zoning district in the Commonwealth.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
