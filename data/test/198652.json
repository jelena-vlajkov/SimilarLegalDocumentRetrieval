GARGANO,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n         [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge. \r\n\n   Joan Oliveri on brief pro se.\r\n   Nancy L. Hall and Gargano &amp; Associates, P.C. on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nSeptember 27, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Pro se appellant Joan Oliveri filed a\r\ncivil action in the district court, claiming that her\r\nemployment had been terminated in violation of the Americans\r\nwith Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.  She appeals\r\nfrom the court's grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor\r\nof appellee Paul A. Gargano.  We affirm for the following\r\nreasons.\r\n          The district court granted judgment for the defendant\r\nafter a bench trial at which Oliveri testified and submitted\r\ndocuments into evidence.  On the basis of her testimony and the\r\ndocumentary evidence, the court concluded that she had filed\r\nher administrative claim against Gargano &amp; Associates, P.C., a\r\nprofessional corporation, as her employer.  Ruling that the\r\ndistinction between Gargano, the individual, and the\r\nprofessional corporation bearing his name applied even in the\r\nemployment discrimination context, the court concluded that\r\nOliveri could not bring the instant suit against Gargano\r\nbecause she had not filed her administrative charge against\r\nhim.  In so doing, the court adhered to the general rule that\r\nplaintiffs asserting employment discrimination claims in a\r\ncivil action must previously have pursued an administrative\r\ncharge against the defendant named in the lawsuit.  See Virgo\r\nv. Riviera Beach Assoc., Ltd., 30 F.3d 1350, 1358-59 (11th Cir.\r\n1994) (stating the general rule).  \r\n          On appeal, the appellant presents a single, very\r\nnarrow claim.  She contends that she filed her administrative\r\ncharge against Gargano individually, but that, without her\r\nknowledge, the investigating agency processed it as a charge\r\nagainst the corporation.  Significantly, she does not try to\r\nshow that, on the record before it, the court's contrary\r\nfactual finding that she named only the law firm was clearly\r\nerroneous, and the trial record provides an adequate basis for\r\nthat finding.  Nor does she challenge the validity of the\r\ncourt's legal rulings, effectively waiving her right to\r\nappellate review.  See Whyte v. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins.\r\nCo., 818 F.2d 1005, 1011 n.20 (1st Cir. 1987) (indicating that\r\nan appellate court will not address issues not raised by the\r\nparties except in instances where a gross miscarriage of\r\njustice would result).\r\n          As for her contention that she filed administrative\r\ncharges against Gargano, this appears to be a new claim which\r\nwas not argued to the district court.  For supporting evidence\r\nOliveri relies on a complaint intake form which she filled out\r\nbefore filing her administrative complaint and before bringing\r\nthe instant suit.  She did not submit the form to the district\r\ncourt at trial or in any post-trial motion to amend or alter\r\njudgment, although she knew of its existence.  According to\r\nestablished principles, this court will not review matters not\r\npreviously presented to the district court.  See United States\r\nv. Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"It is a\r\nbedrock principle in this circuit that issues must be squarely\r\nraised in the district court if they are to be preserved for\r\nappeal.\") (citations omitted).  Under the circumstances, we\r\naffirm the judgment below.\r\n          Affirmed.   \n",
