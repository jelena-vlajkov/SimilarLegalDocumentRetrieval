Bird, Jr. and Bird Bird &amp; Hestres on brief for\r\nappellants.\r\nJuan M. Masini-Soler and Law Offices of Jose A. Masini-\r\nSoler, Miguel F. Laffite and Dubon &amp; Dubon, and Jose Enrique\r\nOtero and Otero &amp; Lopez on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                     November 15, 1999\r\n                                          \r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  Plaintiffs are the parents of\r\nRufino Serrano-Rosado, who, it is alleged, was a mentally impaired\r\nindividual who was kidnapped and beaten by four police officers on\r\nMarch 30, hospitalized on March 31, and then died on April 10,\r\n1995.  Plaintiffs say his death was a result of the beatings and of\r\nthe malpractice of the hospital (and doctors) where he was brought\r\nfor treatment.  Plaintiffs brought suit in federal court against\r\nthe police under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and, asserting supplemental\r\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1367, against the medical defendants\r\nunder state law theories.  The medical defendants moved to dismiss\r\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), arguing that the claims against\r\nthem did not arise from a common nucleus of operative facts so that\r\nsupplemental jurisdiction was not available under  1367(a), and\r\nthat, even if it were, the court in its discretion should decline\r\nto exercise jurisdiction under  1367(c).\r\nThe district court found that the claims against the\r\nmedical defendants did not share a common nucleus of operative\r\nfacts with the claims against the police because the facts relevant\r\nto the civil rights claim were entirely separate from the facts\r\nrelevant to the malpractice claim, and because there was a temporal\r\nbreak between the two sets of facts.  The case against the medical\r\ndefendants was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\r\nwithout prejudice to refiling in the Commonwealth court.  The\r\ndistrict court ordered the entry of a separate judgment under Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 54(b).  \r\nOn appeal plaintiffs say the dismissal of the claims\r\nagainst the medical defendants was error.  Their primary argument\r\nis that each of the sets of defendants will point to the other as\r\nthe cause of death and that this creates a common nucleus of\r\noperative facts, or, in any event, that the claims are sufficiently\r\nrelated such that trying the case to one jury is the most economic\r\nuse of judicial resources.  This point suggests that there may\r\npossibly be related evidence as to damages, but plaintiffs do not\r\nexplain why this is necessarily so, and even the existence of such\r\na possibility, it strikes us, may vary with the facts.  A secondary\r\nargument is that the district court committed an error of law by\r\nputting too much emphasis on the lack of temporal proximity.  Of\r\ncourse, if plaintiffs are left to try their claim in the courts of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, they  will have no jury trial, but\r\nonly a bench trial.\r\nThe parties agree that review of the decision is for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See Vera-Lozano v. International Broad., 50\r\nF.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 1995).  These decisions turn on essentially\r\nfact-based assessments.  The district court plainly did not abuse\r\nits discretion here.  The facts and witnesses as to the two sets of\r\nclaims are essentially different, not common, as the district court\r\nfound.  That there may be finger-pointing defenses at the damages\r\nstage does not change this assessment, nor does the assessment\r\nchange whether the temporal proximity is little or great.  Whether\r\nor not the police violated Serrano-Rosado's civil rights has\r\nnothing to do with whether the hospital and doctors conformed to\r\nthe requisite standard of care; damages is a separate issue.\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.\n",
