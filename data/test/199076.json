This case arises from a will contest\n\nbetween plaintiff-appellant Robert W. Mangieri and defendant-appellee\n\nPaul Mangieri, who are, respectively, the only son and a nephew of the\n\nnow deceased Joseph F. Mangieri. The case was filed on August 31,\n\n1999.   The complaint alleges two claims:       first, a claim under\n\nMassachusetts General Laws Chapter 191 ยง 20, the omitted child statute;\n\nand second, a breach of fiduciary duty claim against appellee Paul\n\nMangieri based on his actions as executor of the estate of Joseph W.\n\nMangieri. The district court granted summary judgment for appellee on\n\nNovember 4, 1999.    For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n          The essential facts are as follows: On November 2, 1984,\n\nJoseph F. Mangieri executed a will in which he divided his estate\n\nbetween his brothers, Robert L. and Sal Mangieri, his sister-in-law,\n\nJosephine Mangieri, and other beneficiaries. The 1984 will contained\n\na clause stating that any children not provided for in the will were\n\nintentionally omitted from the will. The 1984 will made no provision\n\nfor decedent's son, Robert W. Mangieri. On February 12, 1987, Joseph\n\nexecuted a second will. The 1987 will did not make any provision for\n\nRobert; however, in contrast to the 1984 will, it did not expressly\n\nstate that this omission was intentional. The 1987 will left the\n\nentire estate to testator's nephew, Paul Mangieri. Paul Mangieri was\n\nalso named executor of the 1987 will. On May 28, 1997, Joseph directed\n\nhis attorney to draw up a new will, which, if executed, would have left\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe bulk of his estate to his son Robert. Joseph died on June 10, 1997\n\nwithout having signed the new will.\n\n           A trial ensued in the Massachusetts Probate Court. On April\n\n12, 1999, the probate court issued detailed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. For our purposes, it is only relevant that (1) the\n\ncourt explicitly found that testator-decedent had deliberately left his\n\nson Robert out of the 1987 will, and (2) the court admitted the 1987\n\nwill to probate as the Last Will and Testament of the Decedent. Robert\n\nMangieri neither filed a motion to amend the probate court's findings\n\nof fact nor appealed the court's judgment.\n\n           On August 31, 1999, appellant filed suit against Paul\n\nMangieri, as executor of the estate of Joseph F. Mangieri, in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. As\n\nindicated, the complaint alleges (1) a claim under Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Laws Chapter 191 ยง 20, the omitted child statute, and (2) that\n\nPaul Mangieri committed a breach of his fiduciary duty as executor of\n\nJoseph F. Mangieri's estate by failing to consider Robert's claim as an\n\nomitted child and thus failing to protect Robert's interest as one of\n\nthe testator's heirs. Appellant alleges that jurisdiction is proper\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332, the federal diversity of citizenship\n\nstatute.\n\n           At the time appellant filed his complaint in federal court,\n\nhe simultaneously filed a motion for an ex parte temporary restraining\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\forder. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion on\n\nSeptember 2, 1999. After notice to opposing counsel was provided, the\n\ncourt held a second hearing on September 8, 1999.      At that time,\n\nappellee filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court construed\n\nas a motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, on September 15th,\n\nappellant renewed his motion for a preliminary injunction. On November\n\n4, 1999, the district court issued an order granting appellee's motion\n\nto dismiss, denying appellant's motion for preliminary injunction, and\n\nentering judgment for appellee, Paul Mangieri. The court reasoned, in\n\npart, that:\n\n          The core issues that require dismissal of this\n          case in the view of this court are that (1) this\n          court lacks authority to hear and resolve this\n          case on the merits because this controversy is\n          within the jurisdiction of the Probate Court of\n          the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and that court\n          has taken jurisdiction and issued findings and\n          conclusions that preclude plaintiff's claim, and\n          (2) this court either lacks jurisdiction . . . or\n          in the exercise of discretion should not exercise\n          jurisdiction to make any order that would be\n          inconsistent with or otherwise impede completion\n          of proceedings in that court before it has\n          reached a final disposition.\n\nMangieri v. Mangieri, No. 99-11812, slip op. at 7 (D. Mass. Nov. 4,\n\n1999).\n\n          We believe that the district court's ruling in this case is\n\namply supported by both the record and the law and needs little\n\nanalysis. Under the probate exception to diversity jurisdiction, \"a\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffederal court may not probate a will, administer an estate, or\n\nentertain an action that would interfere with pending probate\n\nproceedings in a state court or with a state court's control of\n\nproperty in its custody.\" Ashton v. Josephine Bay Paul & C. Michael\n\nPaul Found., Inc., 918 F.2d 1065, 1071 (2d Cir. 1990) (citing Markham\n\nv. Allen, 326 U.S. 490, 494 (1946)). While \"[t]he precise scope of the\n\nprobate exception has not been clearly established,\" it is clear that\n\n\"[a]s a general matter, courts tend to view the probate exception as\n\nextending to all suits 'ancillary' to the probate of a will.\" Georges\n\nv. Glick, 856 F.2d 971, 973 (7th Cir. 1988) (citing Dragan v. Miller,\n\n679 F.2d 712, 715 (7th Cir. 1982)).        In this Circuit, we have\n\npreviously stated:\n\n          It is obvious that insofar as the complaint\n          requests the district court to order the\n          defendants to turn over to the plaintiff property\n          which they received in their capacity as\n          fiduciaries, and for which they are accountable\n          to the probate court, the federal district court\n          had no jurisdiction.\n\nKittredge v. Stevens, 126 F.2d 263, 266 (1st Cir. 1942). Against this\n\nbackground, it is clear that this case falls squarely within the\n\nprobate exception to the diversity jurisdiction of the district court.\n\n\n\n          First, appellant's claim is within the jurisdiction of the\n\nMassachusetts Probate Court. Second, as appellant concedes, the relief\n\nhe requests would require the district court to set aside the ruling of\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe probate court that appellant Robert was deliberately omitted from\n\nthe 1987 will and that the 1987 will must be admitted to probate as the\n\nLast Will and Testament of the Decedent.      In fact, the complaint\n\n\"demands that [the district court] find Plaintiff is an omitted child,\n\nis entitled to an intestate share of the testator-decedent, Joseph F.\n\nMangieri's estate, and order Paul Mangieri, as executor, to distribute\n\nthe estate accordingly.\" In our view, the district court correctly\n\ndeclined to do so on the ground that this would improperly interfere\n\nwith a probate proceeding currently pending before the Massachusetts\n\nState Probate Court.1\n\n          For the reasons stated, the decision of the district court\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n1 In light of our conclusion that the probate exception to federal\ndiversity jurisdiction applies to this case, we need not address the\ndistrict court's alternative holding that abstention is proper\npursuant to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.

As indicated, the complaint alleges (1) a claim under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 191 &#167; 20, the omitted child statute, and (2) that Paul Mangieri committed a breach of his fiduciary duty as executor of Joseph F. Mangieri's estate by failing to consider Robert's claim as an omitted child and thus failing to protect Robert's interest as one of the testator's heirs. Appellant alleges that jurisdiction is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, the federal diversity of citizenship statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time appellant filed his complaint in federal court, he simultaneously filed a motion for an ex parte temporary restraining order. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion on September 2, 1999. After notice to opposing counsel was provided, the court held a second hearing on September 8, 1999. At that time, appellee filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court construed as a motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, on September 15th, appellant renewed his motion for a preliminary injunction. On November 4, 1999, the district court issued an order granting appellee's motion to dismiss, denying appellant's motion for preliminary injunction, and entering judgment for appellee, Paul Mangieri. The court reasoned, in part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The core issues that require dismissal of this case in the view of this court are that (1) this court lacks authority to hear and resolve this case on the merits because this controversy is within the jurisdiction of the Probate Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and that court has taken jurisdiction and issued findings and conclusions that preclude plaintiff's claim, and (2) this court either lacks jurisdiction . . . or in the exercise of discretion should not exercise jurisdiction to make any order that would be inconsistent with or otherwise impede completion of proceedings in that court before it has reached a final disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangieri v. Mangieri, No. 99-11812, slip op. at 7 (D. Mass. Nov. 4, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the district court's ruling in this case is amply supported by both the record and the law and needs little analysis. Under the probate exception to diversity jurisdiction, \"a federal court may not probate a will, administer an estate, or entertain an action that would interfere with pending probate proceedings in a state court or with a state court's control of property in its custody.\" Ashton v.

While \"[t]he precise scope of the probate exception has not been clearly established,\" it is clear that \"[a]s a general matter, courts tend to view the probate exception as extending to all suits 'ancillary' to the probate of a will.\" Georges v.

In this Circuit, we have previously stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious that insofar as the complaint requests the district court to order the defendants to turn over to the plaintiff property which they received in their capacity as fiduciaries, and for which they are accountable to the probate court, the federal district court had no jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kittredge v.

Against this background, it is clear that this case falls squarely within the probate exception to the diversity jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellant's claim is within the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Probate Court. Second, as appellant concedes, the relief he requests would require the district court to set aside the ruling of the probate court that appellant Robert was deliberately omitted from the 1987 will and that the 1987 will must be admitted to probate as the Last Will and Testament of the Decedent. In fact, the complaint \"demands that [the district court] find Plaintiff is an omitted child, is entitled to an intestate share of the testator-decedent, Joseph F. Mangieri's estate, and order Paul Mangieri, as executor, to distribute the estate accordingly.\" In our view, the district court correctly declined to do so on the ground that this would improperly interfere with a probate proceeding currently pending before the Massachusetts State Probate Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In light of our conclusion that the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction applies to this case, we need not address the district court's alternative holding that abstention is proper pursuant to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.
