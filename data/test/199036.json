William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n\n                and Casellas,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Dina Michael Chaitowitz, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Donald K.

This appeal tests the boundaries\n\nof the district court's authority to depart from the prescribed\n\nguideline sentencing range (GSR).              Concluding, as we do, that\n\nthe court roamed too far afield, we vacate the imposed sentence\n\nand remand for resentencing.\n\n                                       I.\n\n                                   Background\n\n           The relevant facts are simple and straightforward.                  On\n\nMay 11, 1999, defendant-appellee Eugene Edward Martin pleaded\n\nguilty to a charge of distributing 119.6 grams of cocaine base.\n\nSee   21   U.S.C.     §    841.     The     district   court   convened       the\n\ndisposition hearing on September 8, 1999.              It applied the 1998\n\nedition    of   the       United   States    Sentencing   Guidelines      —     a\n\ndetermination with which no one quarrels, see United States v.\n\nHarotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990) — and arrived\n\nat a base offense level of thirty-two.             See USSG §2D1.1(c)(4).\n\nThe court proceeded to adjust downward by three levels for\n\nacceptance of responsibility.             See id. §3E1.1.      It then found\n\nthe \"safety valve\" to be applicable, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f);\n\nUSSG §§2D1.1(b)(6), 5C1.2, and effected a further two-level\n\nreduction, see generally United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211\n\nF.3d 146, 150-51 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining operation of the\n\nsafety valve).        These calculations yielded an adjusted offense\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\flevel of twenty-seven, which, when combined with Martin's lack\n\nof a prior criminal record, corresponded to a GSR of 70-87\n\nmonths.        See USSG Ch.5, Pt.A (sentencing table).\n\n               To this point, the district court's judgments were\n\nimpeccable.       The court, however, did not stop there; it snubbed\n\nthe GSR and departed downward sua sponte to impose a 64-month\n\nincarcerative term.            The judge premised this departure on a\n\ncombination of two factors.                First, he remarked \"the absence of\n\n[an active] Sentencing Commission.\"1                     This circumstance, he\n\nreasoned,       was   one   that     \"no    one   had   contemplated\"      and    that\n\npermitted him to depart \"if I think it reasonable that had there\n\nbeen       a   Commission      the    guidelines        would    in      fact    apply\n\ndifferently.\"          Judge    Young      then   referred      to   a   statistical\n\ncompilation that he had directed the chief probation officer to\n\nprepare.        These statistics purported to reflect all federal\n\nsentences imposed in fiscal year 1997 on persons whose primary\n\noffense was drug trafficking, regardless of the nature or amount\n\nof the substances involved.                 In Judge Young's view, the data\n\n\"show[ed] that nationally the median months in prison out of\n\n17,137 offenders sentenced was 57 months, and in the First\n\n\n\n       1\n     In fact, the Commission had no voting members from and\nafter October 31, 1998, having lost its quorum earlier that\nyear. This situation persisted until the Senate confirmed seven\nnew Commissioners on November 10, 1999.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fCircuit the mean was 67.8 months, with a median of 50 months out\n\nof 543 offenders.\"      Accordingly, sentencing Martin within the\n\nGSR would promote this disparity, whereas imposing a shorter\n\nterm of immurement would partially offset it (and was, in the\n\njudge's opinion, \"just and fair\").\n\n            The government appeals this downward departure.\n\n                                   II.\n\n                                 Analysis\n\n            We review departure decisions for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 96-100 (1996); United\n\nStates     v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1997).              Our\n\nprecedents     contemplate   a   trifurcated   approach.    \"First,    we\n\ndetermine as a theoretical matter whether the stated ground for\n\ndeparture is permissible under the guidelines.         If the ground is\n\ntheoretically appropriate, we next examine whether it finds\n\nadequate factual support in the record.          If so, we must probe\n\nthe   degree     of   the    departure   in    order   to   verify    its\n\nreasonableness.\"      United States v. Dethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 43-44\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (footnote and citations omitted).              In this\n\ninstance, we need not go beyond the first facet of the Dethlefs\n\ninquiry.\n\n                                    A\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f             Before proceeding to that point, however, we pause to\n\nconsider     the   defendant's    contention    that   the    government\n\nforfeited the argument that it advances on appeal by failing to\n\nraise it below.      On the surface, this contention seems potent —\n\nbut the surrounding circumstances dissipate its force.\n\n             A sentencing court has an obligation to give reasonable\n\nnotice that it is contemplating a departure.              See Burns v.\n\nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 138-39 (1991).            This obligation\n\napplies not only to upward departures, as was the case in Burns,\n\nbut   also    to   downward   departures.      See   United   States   v.\n\nPankhurst, 118 F.3d 345, 357 (5th Cir. 1997).          Here, the record\n\nreveals that the sentencing court neglected to provide the\n\ngovernment with adequate notice of its contemplated downward\n\ndeparture.\n\n             The defendant questions whether this is so, adverting\n\nto a pretrial conference held on December 21, 1998, in which\n\nJudge Young mentioned the dormancy of the Sentencing Commission,\n\nexpressed concern about the status of the guidelines, and told\n\nthe parties that he intended to obtain some sentencing data from\n\nthe chief probation officer.         We reject the suggestion that\n\nthese comments constituted adequate notice of a contemplated\n\ndeparture.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f             In the first place, the judge's remarks were made\n\nalmost five months before the defendant changed his plea and\n\nsome nine months before the disposition hearing.                                The record\n\nreveals no continuing dialogue during the interim.                               Moreover,\n\nthe presentence investigation report made no mention of this (or\n\nany other) possible basis for departure.                        On these facts, we do\n\nnot    think    that    the      prosecutor        reasonably       could       have       been\n\nexpected to divine an intention to depart despite the court's\n\nevident discomfiture with the Sentencing Commission's status.\n\nThe judge's ruminations at the pretrial conference — ruminations\n\nthat    he   himself       described        as     \"only       academic\"    —    may       have\n\nadumbrated,      but    certainly           did    not     articulate,      a        coherent\n\nrationale for departure.\n\n             If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\nstatistics upon which the judge rested the departure were not\n\nfurnished      to    the    prosecution            at    any     time   prior        to    the\n\ndisposition hearing.             This was too late:               a sentencing court\n\nmust give fair warning not only of the rationale for a possible\n\ndeparture      but   also       of   the    facts       that    undergird       it    in   the\n\nparticular instance.            See United States v. Morris, 204 F.3d 776,\n\n778 (7th Cir. 2000).                 Here, the court's introduction of a\n\nsubstantial      body      of    new       data    at    the     disposition          hearing\n\ncontravened its obligation to afford the parties reasonable\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fnotice of what it envisioned as departure-justifying facts.                  See\n\nid.       Given this chronology of events, we are constrained to\n\nconclude that the district court failed to comply with Burns.\n\n             Next, we turn to the question of remedy.                 In some\n\ncircumstances,       the   omission    of    a    departure     warning    might\n\nengender a remand for further proceedings.                Here, however, such\n\na course would unduly prolong matters without any corresponding\n\ngain.      The government's objection to the departure is purely\n\nlegal in nature, the parties have fully briefed the merits, and\n\nsupplementary factfinding is not indicated.               As long as fairness\n\nconcerns are not compromised, courts should try to be practical.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, it makes sense to treat the\n\nlower      court's   failure    to    give       notice    as   excusing     the\n\ngovernment's procedural default and rendering the departure\n\ndecision ripe for appellate review.2               Accord United States v.\n\nBartsma, 198 F.3d 1191, 1197-99 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                       B\n\n             Having vaulted this procedural hurdle, we repair to the\n\nfirst prong of the         Dethlefs inquiry.         A court may impose a\n\n\n\n      2\n     We hasten to add that the error of which the government\ncomplains is plain, and thus warrants correction whether or not\npreserved. See United States v. Mangone, 105 F.3d 29, 35 (1st\nCir. 1997); see also United States v. Torres-Rosa, 209 F.3d 4,\n8 (1st Cir. 2000) (confirming applicability of plain error\ndoctrine in sentencing appeals).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fsentence outside the GSR if \"the court finds that there exists\n\nan aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a\n\ndegree,    not      adequately      taken       into     consideration         by     the\n\nSentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should\n\nresult in a sentence different from that described.\"                          18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(b).      To determine whether a circumstance was adequately\n\nconsidered     by   the    Commission,       the   court      must    examine        \"the\n\nsentencing       guidelines,        policy       statements,         and      official\n\ncommentary of the Sentencing Commission.\"                   Id.      These precepts\n\nare   embedded,      virtually      word    for    word,      in   the       guidelines\n\nthemselves.      See USSG §5K2.0.\n\n              The departure power is intended to ameliorate the\n\nmechanistic rigidity of the guidelines and to import a modicum\n\nof    flexibility     into    the    sentencing        calculus.             Thus,    the\n\nCommission, generally speaking, did \"not intend to limit the\n\nkinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere in the\n\nguidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an\n\nunusual case.\"         USSG Ch.1, Pt.A, intro. comment. (n.4(b)).\n\nGiven   this     overall     philosophy,        courts    categorically         reject\n\npotential grounds for departure at their peril.\n\n              Most general rules admit of exceptions, however, and\n\nthere   are    several     exceptions      to    the   rule    that      a    departure\n\ntheoretically can be grounded on any differentiating factor.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fUnder these exceptions, sentencing courts are barred from basing\n\ndepartures on forbidden factors, factors adequately considered\n\nby the Commission, factors that lack relevance, and factors that\n\noffend the framework and purpose of the guidelines.\n\n          The    first   of   these   exceptions    refers      to   certain\n\nenumerated factors that the Commission has placed beyond the\n\npale, e.g., race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, and\n\nsocioeconomic status.       See USSG §5H1.10.    Forbidden factors can\n\nnever serve as the basis for a departure.        See Koon, 518 U.S. at\n\n95-96; United States v. Perez, 160 F.3d 87, 89 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nThe   second    exception     flows   directly     from   the    statutory\n\nrequirement that only an \"aggravating or mitigating circumstance\n\n. . . not adequately considered by the [Commission]\" can ground\n\na departure.    18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).      The third exception, which\n\nprecludes the use of irrelevant factors, can be considered a\n\nsubset of the second.          See, e.g., United States v. Clase-\n\nEspinal, 115 F.3d 1054, 1059-60 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that\n\nacceding to deportation was a circumstance adequately considered\n\nby the Commission and therefore irrelevant to the departure\n\ncalculus).     The fourth exception, which proscribes the use of\n\nconsiderations that are inconsistent with the structure and\n\ntheory of the guidelines, also bears a family resemblance to the\n\nsecond exception.        It is, after all, entirely plausible to\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fconclude that the Commission \"adequately\" considers such factors\n\nby disregarding them, and, indeed, the case law applies these\n\nlast three exceptions without much differentiation amongst them.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (precluding departures based on federal/state sentencing\n\ndisparities); Dethlefs, 123 F.3d at 47 (stating that considering\n\nan unconditional guilty plea as a factor supporting departure\n\n\"would intrude upon the Commission's prerogatives and undercut\n\nthe sentencing guidelines\"); United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d\n\n1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991) (precluding downward departures based\n\non a perceived need to equalize sentencing disparities between\n\nsimilarly situated codefendants); United States v. Aguilar-Pena,\n\n887   F.2d   347,   350-53   (1st   Cir.   1989)   (precluding   downward\n\ndepartures based on incidence of crime in different locales).\n\n             In this case, the lower court predicated its downward\n\ndeparture on the moribund status of the Sentencing Commission,\n\ntogether with the perceived disparity between the defendant's\n\nGSR and the national median sentence for persons convicted of\n\nfederal drug-trafficking offenses.         Neither element, singularly\n\nor in combination, can carry the weight of a downward departure.\n\n             The Sentencing Commission certainly did not anticipate\n\nbeing without sufficient members to muster a quorum.             See USSG\n\nCh.1, Pt.A, intro. comment. (n.4(b)) (explaining that \"[t]he\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fCommission is a permanent body\").             But the Commission's lack of\n\na quorum, standing alone, is simply irrelevant to an individual\n\nsentencing decision.       Nothing about vacancies on the Commission\n\nis   inherently    aggravating     or    mitigating       for    purposes      of   a\n\ndeparture assessment.         This circumstance therefore needs help to\n\nclear   the    relevancy   hurdle:        there    must    be    a   solid,    non-\n\nspeculative reason to believe that the guidelines would apply\n\ndifferently had the Commission been at full strength.                       In the\n\ncase at bar, the court's adjuvant reason was itself invalid as\n\na matter of law.       We explain briefly.\n\n              Under our jurisprudence, the fact that the national\n\nmedian for a broadly stated offense type may be above or below\n\na    particular   defendant's     GSR    cannot    be     used   to   justify       a\n\nsentencing departure.         See United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d\n\n1159,   1168    (1st   Cir.    1995)    (\"Absent    misapplication        of    the\n\nGuidelines, the mere fact of disparity is of no consequence.\");\n\nsee also United States v. Banuelos-Rodriguez, 215 F.3d 969, 973-\n\n78     (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (holding that inter-district\n\nsentencing disparities, arising from differing charging and\n\nplea-bargaining practices, do not constitute a valid ground for\n\ndeparture); Snyder, 136 F.3d at 70 (similar, in respect to\n\nfederal/state sentencing disparities); Wogan, 938 F.2d at 1449\n\n(similar, in respect to sentencing disparities between similarly\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fsituated codefendants).        Departures based on these kinds of\n\nperceived      inequities    \"would      contradict      hopelessly     the\n\nguidelines' structure and theory.\"         Snyder, 136 F.3d at 70.\n\n            The   district     court's     statistical      foray     aptly\n\nillustrates the wisdom of this point.          The base offense level\n\nfor drug trafficking varies from six (for, e.g., less than 250\n\ngrams of marijuana) to thirty-eight (for, e.g., 30,000 kilograms\n\nof marijuana).     See USSG §2D1.1(c).      For defendants who are in\n\ncriminal history category I, an offense level of six translates\n\ninto a GSR of 0-6 months of imprisonment, whereas an offense\n\nlevel of thirty-eight produces a GSR of 235-293 months.                 See\n\nUSSG Ch.5, Pt.A (sentencing table).         This graduated sentencing\n\nstructure reflects the Commission's view that not all drug-\n\ntrafficking offenses are equivalent; some deserve much longer\n\nsentences than others.        To bring the illustration closer to\n\nhome,   this   structure    strongly   suggests   that    the   Commission\n\nintended an individual responsible for distributing 119.6 grams\n\nof cocaine base — like Martin — to serve more time than the\n\naverage drug-trafficking offender.          Using the median sentence\n\nimposed as a lodestar for routine departures would effectively\n\noverrule that considered judgment.         Accordingly, this factor is\n\nineligible for inclusion in the departure calculus.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f            Since it is clear that the district court would not\n\nhave departed absent reliance on this impermissible datum, we\n\ncould end the analysis here.                Cf. Brewster, 127 F.3d at 30\n\n(suggesting that departure based on combination of valid and\n\ninvalid grounds must be vacated when \"the exclusion of the\n\ninvalid    ground   .     .   .   undermine[s]    the    departure     rationale\n\narticulated by the sentencing court\").                  We continue, however,\n\nbecause    we    think    that    identifying     the    deeper   flaw    in   the\n\ndistrict court's approach may prove worthwhile for future cases.\n\n            The structure and purpose of the guidelines do not\n\npermit departures based on counterfactual reasoning of the type\n\nemployed    by    the    court     below.      Courts    must   deal    with   the\n\nguidelines as they stand, without speculation about how the\n\nCommission might (or might not) choose to modify them at some\n\nfuture     date.3        Just     as   statutes   outlive       the    particular\n\nlegislators who enact them (whether or not the legislative body\n\nis in session), so too the enforceability of the guidelines does\n\nnot depend on the continued functioning of the Commission.                      To\n\nthe contrary, sentencing guidelines, once promulgated, have the\n\n\n\n    3At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we note that\nthere is not so much as a hint in the record that the\nCommission, had it been velivolant, would have reacted to the\nstatistics cited by the district court by reducing the penalties\nfor crack cocaine — or that, had the Commission done so,\nCongress would have let the revision become law.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fforce of law, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b); USSG Ch.1, Pt.A, intro.\n\ncomment. (n.2), and that circumstance obtains even when the\n\nCommission is empty.         Thus, departures (up or down) based on the\n\ninherently speculative possibility that the guidelines might\n\nunder other circumstances be modified are impermissible.\n\n           Martin offers a variation on this theme.                    He suggests\n\nthat the moribund status of the Sentencing Commission left a\n\nvacuum and permitted the trial judge to fill it.                 We reject this\n\nsurmise.\n\n           In     the    pre-guidelines       era,    judges   made    sentencing\n\nchoices    with    few    restrictions.         But    the     adoption    of    the\n\nguidelines reined in that largely unbridled discretion.                         From\n\nthat   point      forward,    judges     no    longer     were    permitted       to\n\nsubstitute their personal brand of justice for the collective\n\nwisdom of the Sentencing Commission.                    See United States v.\n\nJackson, 30 F.3d 199, 203 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining that,\n\n\"absent    specific       circumstances       independently       justifying       a\n\ndeparture, a judge cannot sentence outside a properly computed\n\nsentencing range merely because he believes that the guidelines\n\nwork too severe a sanction in a particular case\"); United States\n\nv. Norflett, 922 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1990) (similar); Aguilar-\n\nPena, 887 F.2d at 353 (similar).                The Commission's lack of a\n\nquorum,    without       more,   does    not     override       this    important\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fprinciple.     Consequently, a departure based on the district\n\ncourt's substitution of its own judgment for that of the missing\n\nCommissioners cannot stand.\n\n            There is one more leg to our journey.             In a last-ditch\n\neffort to salvage the sentence, Martin strives to convince us\n\nthat   we   should    overlook    any   error     because     the   degree    of\n\ndeparture was modest (he uses the phrase \"de minimis\").                We are\n\nnot persuaded.        The first — and most basic — question in a\n\ndeparture inquiry is whether the stated ground for departure is\n\npermissible.       See Dethlefs, 123 F.3d at 43.            If the answer to\n\nthat question is in the negative — as it is here — the extent of\n\nthe departure is immaterial.\n\n                                     III.\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n            We need go no further.          Because it was a clear abuse\n\nof discretion for the district court to depart downward on\n\naccount of Commission vacancies, unrefined summary statistics,\n\nor a combination of the two, the judgment must be vacated.\n\n            The government's appeal is sustained, the sentence\n\nappealed    from     is   vacated,   and    the   case   is    remanded      for\n\nresentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

On\n\nMay 11, 1999, defendant-appellee Eugene Edward Martin pleaded\n\nguilty to a charge of distributing 119.6 grams of cocaine base.\n\nSee   21   U.S.C.     §    841.     The     district   court   convened       the\n\ndisposition hearing on September 8, 1999.              It applied the 1998\n\nedition    of   the       United   States    Sentencing   Guidelines      —     a\n\ndetermination with which no one quarrels, see United States v.\n\nHarotunian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990) — and arrived\n\nat a base offense level of thirty-two.

These calculations yielded an adjusted offense\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\flevel of twenty-seven, which, when combined with Martin's lack\n\nof a prior criminal record, corresponded to a GSR of 70-87\n\nmonths.        See USSG Ch.5, Pt.A (sentencing table).\n\n               To this point, the district court's judgments were\n\nimpeccable.       The court, however, did not stop there; it snubbed\n\nthe GSR and departed downward sua sponte to impose a 64-month\n\nincarcerative term.            The judge premised this departure on a\n\ncombination of two factors.                First, he remarked \"the absence of\n\n[an active] Sentencing Commission.\"1                     This circumstance, he\n\nreasoned,       was   one   that     \"no    one   had   contemplated\"      and    that\n\npermitted him to depart \"if I think it reasonable that had there\n\nbeen       a   Commission      the    guidelines        would    in      fact    apply\n\ndifferently.\"          Judge    Young      then   referred      to   a   statistical\n\ncompilation that he had directed the chief probation officer to\n\nprepare.        These statistics purported to reflect all federal\n\nsentences imposed in fiscal year 1997 on persons whose primary\n\noffense was drug trafficking, regardless of the nature or amount\n\nof the substances involved.                 In Judge Young's view, the data\n\n\"show[ed] that nationally the median months in prison out of\n\n17,137 offenders sentenced was 57 months, and in the First\n\n\n\n       1\n     In fact, the Commission had no voting members from and\nafter October 31, 1998, having lost its quorum earlier that\nyear. This situation persisted until the Senate confirmed seven\nnew Commissioners on November 10, 1999.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fCircuit the mean was 67.8 months, with a median of 50 months out\n\nof 543 offenders.\"      Accordingly, sentencing Martin within the\n\nGSR would promote this disparity, whereas imposing a shorter\n\nterm of immurement would partially offset it (and was, in the\n\njudge's opinion, \"just and fair\").\n\n            The government appeals this downward departure.\n\n                                   II.\n\n                                 Analysis\n\n            We review departure decisions for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Koon v.

In this\n\ninstance, we need not go beyond the first facet of the Dethlefs\n\ninquiry.\n\n                                    A\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f             Before proceeding to that point, however, we pause to\n\nconsider     the   defendant's    contention    that   the    government\n\nforfeited the argument that it advances on appeal by failing to\n\nraise it below.      On the surface, this contention seems potent —\n\nbut the surrounding circumstances dissipate its force.\n\n             A sentencing court has an obligation to give reasonable\n\nnotice that it is contemplating a departure.              See Burns v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138-39 (1991).            This obligation\n\napplies not only to upward departures, as was the case in Burns,\n\nbut   also    to   downward   departures.      See   United   States   v.\n\nPankhurst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743513\"><a href=\"/opinion/743513/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357 (5th Cir. 1997).          Here, the record\n\nreveals that the sentencing court neglected to provide the\n\ngovernment with adequate notice of its contemplated downward\n\ndeparture.\n\n             The defendant questions whether this is so, adverting\n\nto a pretrial conference held on December 21, 1998, in which\n\nJudge Young mentioned the dormancy of the Sentencing Commission,\n\nexpressed concern about the status of the guidelines, and told\n\nthe parties that he intended to obtain some sentencing data from\n\nthe chief probation officer.         We reject the suggestion that\n\nthese comments constituted adequate notice of a contemplated\n\ndeparture.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f             In the first place, the judge's remarks were made\n\nalmost five months before the defendant changed his plea and\n\nsome nine months before the disposition hearing.                                The record\n\nreveals no continuing dialogue during the interim.                               Moreover,\n\nthe presentence investigation report made no mention of this (or\n\nany other) possible basis for departure.                        On these facts, we do\n\nnot    think    that    the      prosecutor        reasonably       could       have       been\n\nexpected to divine an intention to depart despite the court's\n\nevident discomfiture with the Sentencing Commission's status.\n\nThe judge's ruminations at the pretrial conference — ruminations\n\nthat    he   himself       described        as     \"only       academic\"    —    may       have\n\nadumbrated,      but    certainly           did    not     articulate,      a        coherent\n\nrationale for departure.\n\n             If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\nstatistics upon which the judge rested the departure were not\n\nfurnished      to    the    prosecution            at    any     time   prior        to    the\n\ndisposition hearing.             This was too late:               a sentencing court\n\nmust give fair warning not only of the rationale for a possible\n\ndeparture      but   also       of   the    facts       that    undergird       it    in   the\n\nparticular instance.

In some\n\ncircumstances,       the   omission    of    a    departure     warning    might\n\nengender a remand for further proceedings.                Here, however, such\n\na course would unduly prolong matters without any corresponding\n\ngain.      The government's objection to the departure is purely\n\nlegal in nature, the parties have fully briefed the merits, and\n\nsupplementary factfinding is not indicated.               As long as fairness\n\nconcerns are not compromised, courts should try to be practical.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, it makes sense to treat the\n\nlower      court's   failure    to    give       notice    as   excusing     the\n\ngovernment's procedural default and rendering the departure\n\ndecision ripe for appellate review.2               Accord United States v.\n\nBartsma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158815\"><a href=\"/opinion/158815/united-states-v-bartsma/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1197-99 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                       B\n\n             Having vaulted this procedural hurdle, we repair to the\n\nfirst prong of the         Dethlefs inquiry.

Neither element, singularly\n\nor in combination, can carry the weight of a downward departure.\n\n             The Sentencing Commission certainly did not anticipate\n\nbeing without sufficient members to muster a quorum.             See USSG\n\nCh.1, Pt.A, intro. comment. (n.4(b)) (explaining that \"[t]he\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fCommission is a permanent body\").             But the Commission's lack of\n\na quorum, standing alone, is simply irrelevant to an individual\n\nsentencing decision.       Nothing about vacancies on the Commission\n\nis   inherently    aggravating     or    mitigating       for    purposes      of   a\n\ndeparture assessment.         This circumstance therefore needs help to\n\nclear   the    relevancy   hurdle:        there    must    be    a   solid,    non-\n\nspeculative reason to believe that the guidelines would apply\n\ndifferently had the Commission been at full strength.                       In the\n\ncase at bar, the court's adjuvant reason was itself invalid as\n\na matter of law.       We explain briefly.\n\n              Under our jurisprudence, the fact that the national\n\nmedian for a broadly stated offense type may be above or below\n\na    particular   defendant's     GSR    cannot    be     used   to   justify       a\n\nsentencing departure.

The base offense level\n\nfor drug trafficking varies from six (for, e.g., less than 250\n\ngrams of marijuana) to thirty-eight (for, e.g., 30,000 kilograms\n\nof marijuana).     See USSG §2D1.1(c).      For defendants who are in\n\ncriminal history category I, an offense level of six translates\n\ninto a GSR of 0-6 months of imprisonment, whereas an offense\n\nlevel of thirty-eight produces a GSR of 235-293 months.                 See\n\nUSSG Ch.5, Pt.A (sentencing table).         This graduated sentencing\n\nstructure reflects the Commission's view that not all drug-\n\ntrafficking offenses are equivalent; some deserve much longer\n\nsentences than others.        To bring the illustration closer to\n\nhome,   this   structure    strongly   suggests   that    the   Commission\n\nintended an individual responsible for distributing 119.6 grams\n\nof cocaine base — like Martin — to serve more time than the\n\naverage drug-trafficking offender.          Using the median sentence\n\nimposed as a lodestar for routine departures would effectively\n\noverrule that considered judgment.         Accordingly, this factor is\n\nineligible for inclusion in the departure calculus.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f            Since it is clear that the district court would not\n\nhave departed absent reliance on this impermissible datum, we\n\ncould end the analysis here.                Cf. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brewster,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">30</span>\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(suggesting that departure based on combination of valid and\n\ninvalid grounds must be vacated when \"the exclusion of the\n\ninvalid    ground   .     .   .   undermine[s]    the    departure     rationale\n\narticulated by the sentencing court\").                  We continue, however,\n\nbecause    we    think    that    identifying     the    deeper   flaw    in   the\n\ndistrict court's approach may prove worthwhile for future cases.\n\n            The structure and purpose of the guidelines do not\n\npermit departures based on counterfactual reasoning of the type\n\nemployed    by    the    court     below.      Courts    must   deal    with   the\n\nguidelines as they stand, without speculation about how the\n\nCommission might (or might not) choose to modify them at some\n\nfuture     date.3        Just     as   statutes   outlive       the    particular\n\nlegislators who enact them (whether or not the legislative body\n\nis in session), so too the enforceability of the guidelines does\n\nnot depend on the continued functioning of the Commission.                      To\n\nthe contrary, sentencing guidelines, once promulgated, have the\n\n\n\n    3At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we note that\nthere is not so much as a hint in the record that the\nCommission, had it been velivolant, would have reacted to the\nstatistics cited by the district court by reducing the penalties\nfor crack cocaine — or that, had the Commission done so,\nCongress would have let the revision become law.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fforce of law, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b); USSG Ch.1, Pt.A, intro.\n\ncomment. (n.2), and that circumstance obtains even when the\n\nCommission is empty.         Thus, departures (up or down) based on the\n\ninherently speculative possibility that the guidelines might\n\nunder other circumstances be modified are impermissible.\n\n           Martin offers a variation on this theme.                    He suggests\n\nthat the moribund status of the Sentencing Commission left a\n\nvacuum and permitted the trial judge to fill it.                 We reject this\n\nsurmise.\n\n           In     the    pre-guidelines       era,    judges   made    sentencing\n\nchoices    with    few    restrictions.         But    the     adoption    of    the\n\nguidelines reined in that largely unbridled discretion.                         From\n\nthat   point      forward,    judges     no    longer     were    permitted       to\n\nsubstitute their personal brand of justice for the collective\n\nwisdom of the Sentencing Commission.

The Commission's lack of a\n\nquorum,    without       more,   does    not     override       this    important\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fprinciple.     Consequently, a departure based on the district\n\ncourt's substitution of its own judgment for that of the missing\n\nCommissioners cannot stand.\n\n            There is one more leg to our journey.             In a last-ditch\n\neffort to salvage the sentence, Martin strives to convince us\n\nthat   we   should    overlook    any   error     because     the   degree    of\n\ndeparture was modest (he uses the phrase \"de minimis\").                We are\n\nnot persuaded.        The first — and most basic — question in a\n\ndeparture inquiry is whether the stated ground for departure is\n\npermissible.

Because it was a clear abuse\n\nof discretion for the district court to depart downward on\n\naccount of Commission vacancies, unrefined summary statistics,\n\nor a combination of the two, the judgment must be vacated.\n\n            The government's appeal is sustained, the sentence\n\nappealed    from     is   vacated,   and    the   case   is    remanded      for\n\nresentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f</pre>",
