William G.

After carefully considering the briefs\n\nand record on appeal, we affirm the decision of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n            To the extent that the appellant’s arguments are\n\naddressed to the underlying judgment, they are unavailing\n\nbecause   he    did    not    effect    a    timely   appeal    from   that\n\njudgment.      Although his appeal from the last, three, post-\n\njudgment motions is timely, those repetitive motions do not\n\nraise for review the merits of the underlying judgment.                 See\n\nAybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10 (1st Cir 1997); Acevedo-\n\nVillalobos     v.

See United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).
