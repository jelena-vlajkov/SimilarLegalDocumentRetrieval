FITHIAN, SR., ET AL.,\r\n\n                   Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n                 EDWARD REED AND MARTHA REED,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n      [Hon. George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Thomas J. Callahan, with whom James J. McGovern and McGovern\r\n&amp; Sullivan were on brief, for appellants.\r\n    David M. O'Connor, with whom John E. Matosky and O'Connor &amp;\r\nAssociates were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\nFebruary 29, 2000\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  In this case, the district court\r\nconcluded as a matter of law that the risk of a neighbor's\r\nsnowblower discharging snow and ice against a dining room window\r\nand breaking it, injuring a toddler standing inside, was\r\nunforeseeable, and that the homeowners therefore did not breach\r\ntheir duty of reasonable care.  The plaintiffs appeal.  Finding no\r\nevidence of any precaution that either defendant could or should\r\nhave taken to avoid this unfortunate accident, we affirm.\r\nAs the summary judgment standard requires, we recount the\r\nfacts in the light most hospitable to the non-movants (here, the\r\nplaintiffs).  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).  In January 1996, Lisa Fithian and her two young\r\nchildren, Floridians all, were visiting her parents, Edward and\r\nMartha Reed, in Hingham, Massachusetts.  On an inclement morning,\r\nJohn Zofchak, the Reeds' neighbor, trying to be helpful, undertook\r\nto clear their driveway with his snowblower (despite the fact that\r\ntwo cars were parked in the area).  Snow was a novelty to the\r\nyoungsters, so Mrs. Reed (while Mrs. Fithian was upstairs)\r\nencouraged them to join her at the family room window and watch the\r\nsnowblower in operation.\r\nAfter Mrs. Fithian returned, Mrs. Reed went outside in\r\nhopes of thanking Mr. Zofchak for the unsolicited favor.  Not\r\nwanting to approach the snowblower too closely for fear of injury,\r\nMrs. Reed stood in front of the house for roughly fifteen minutes\r\nand vainly attempted to catch Mr. Zofchak's attention.  Meanwhile,\r\nMrs. Fithian, desiring to give the fascinated children a better\r\nview of the snowblowing activity, brought them into the dining room\r\n(where the windows were closer to the driveway).\r\nMr. Reed entered the dining room shortly thereafter.  At\r\nthat point, Mr. Zofchak had begun to clear a narrow strip of\r\ndriveway between the parked cars and the residence.  Since the\r\npresence of the vehicles prevented him from directing the discharge\r\nto the left, he angled it to the right (i.e., toward the house). \r\nA few seconds later, the dining room window shattered and flying\r\nglass struck and severely injured three-year-old Stephen Fithian,\r\nJr.\r\nInvoking diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C.  1332(a),\r\nStephen and his parents sued the Reeds in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Following\r\npretrial discovery, the defendants moved successfully for summary\r\njudgment.  This appeal ensued.\r\nWe review orders granting or denying summary judgment de\r\nnovo.  See Garside, 895 F.2d at 48.  Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate if, after marshaling the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the non-movant, no genuine issue of material fact\r\nexists and the record reveals that the movant is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law.  See Woods-Leber v. Hyatt Hotels of\r\nP.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 47, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1997); Garside, 895 F.2d\r\nat 48; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  State law supplies the\r\nsubstantive rules of decision in diversity cases, see Erie R.R. Co.\r\nv. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938); Woods-Leber, 124 F.3d at 50,\r\nand the parties agree that Massachusetts law governs in this\r\ninstance.\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, a tort plaintiff must show that\r\n(1) the defendant owed him a duty, (2) the defendant breached that\r\nduty, (3) the breach constituted a proximate cause of the ensuing\r\nharm, and (4) the breach caused actual injury.  See Jorgensen v.\r\nMassachusetts Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 522 (1st Cir. 1990); Swift\r\nv. United States, 866 F.2d 507, 508-09 (1st Cir. 1989).  Although\r\nsuch matters most often comprise grist for the jury's mill, they\r\nmay be resolved on summary judgment when the facts lead ineluctably\r\nto a particular outcome.  See Woods-Leber, 124 F.3d at 51; see also\r\nMullins v. Pine Manor College, 449 N.E.2d 331, 338 (Mass. 1983);\r\nRoderick v. Brandy Hill Co., 631 N.E.2d 559, 560 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1994).  This is such a case:  as the district court ruled, there is\r\nno way in which a rational factfinder, on this record, supportably\r\ncould conclude that the defendants breached an actionable duty to\r\nthe plaintiffs.  We explain briefly.\r\nAs homeowners and hosts, the defendants had a duty to\r\ntake into account the extant circumstances (including those known\r\nto them and those of which they should have known) and to maintain\r\ntheir property in a reasonably safe condition.  See Mounsey v.\r\nEllard, 297 N.E.2d 43, 52 (Mass. 1973); Polak v. Whitney, 487\r\nN.E.2d 213, 215 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985).  It was, therefore,\r\nincumbent upon them to act reasonably in regard to factors such as \r\nthe likelihood of injury to persons foreseeably upon the premises,\r\nthe seriousness of any potential injury, and the burdens associated\r\nwith risk avoidance.\r\nThis standard   reasonable care under all the\r\ncircumstances   is a flexible one.  As the plaintiffs suggest, it\r\nmay at times involve a duty to prevent foreseeable injury caused by\r\na third person who has come upon a defendant's premises.  See Flood\r\nv. Southland Corp., 616 N.E.2d 1068, 1075 (Mass. 1993); Jesionek v.\r\nMassachusetts Port Auth., 378 N.E.2d 995, 997 (Mass. 1978).  On\r\nother occasions, it may impose an obligation to warn guests of an\r\nunreasonable, nonobvious danger of which the host is aware.  See\r\nPolak, 487 N.E.2d at 215-16.  The standard does not, however, bind\r\nhomeowners to anticipate and guard against \"what is unusual and\r\nunlikely to happen, or what, as is sometimes said, is only remotely\r\nand slightly probable.\"  Zompanti v. Ferguson, 142 N.E.2d 903, 904\r\n(Mass. 1957) (quoting Falk v. Finkelman, 168 N.E. 89, 90 (Mass.\r\n1929)).  In fine, the standard does not make a homeowner an insurer\r\nof a guest's safety, nor does it require her to exercise extreme\r\nprudence, employ heroic measures, or display utter prescience.  See\r\nToubiana v. Priestly, 520 N.E.2d 1307, 1310 (Mass. 1988).\r\nThe touchstone, then, is ordinary prudence   and the\r\ncritical question becomes \"whether the jury reasonably could have\r\nconcluded that, in view of all the circumstances, an ordinarily\r\nprudent person in the defendant's position would have taken steps,\r\nnot taken by the defendant, to prevent the accident that occurred.\" \r\nId.  In most cases (though not always), this question correlates\r\nwith the foreseeability of the risk of harm, for the more\r\nforeseeable the injury, the higher society's expectations that\r\nreasonable people will take precautions.  See Whittaker v.\r\nSaraceno, 635 N.E.2d 1185, 1188-89 (Mass. 1994)  (holding that\r\nsociety should not place the burden of preventing a violent crime\r\non a property owner without proof that the owner knew or should\r\nhave known of danger and possible preventive steps, even though\r\ncrime is always possible and to a certain extent foreseeable);\r\nMounsey, 297 N.E.2d at 52 (explaining that the duty of care is\r\ndefined in part by the likelihood of injury).\r\nIn this case, our canvass of the record convinces us that\r\nno reasonable jury could have determined that the defendants failed\r\nto take any precaution that ordinary prudence demanded.  To be\r\nsure, the plaintiffs assert conclusorily that Mr. Reed should have\r\nmonitored the use of a dangerous instrumentality on his property  \r\nbut the record does not disclose either that Mr. Reed had advance\r\nnotice of Mr. Zofchak's intentions or that he had any practical\r\nopportunity to stop Mr. Zofchak in the act.  Even on the\r\nplaintiffs' version of the facts, Mr. Reed became aware that\r\nsnowblowing was in progress only moments before the accident\r\noccurred.\r\nMrs. Reed likewise lacked both notice and any realistic\r\nopportunity to alter the course of events.  In all events, the\r\nrecord is uncontradicted that she tried without success to hail Mr.\r\nZofchak.  Given the swirling snow, the noise made by the machinery,\r\nand the danger inherent in approaching the running snowblower, this\r\nlack of success is entirely understandable.  And the plaintiffs\r\nhave been unable to suggest any other way that Mrs. Reed\r\nrewardingly could have intervened   there is, for example, no\r\nevidence to suggest that she had the vocal capacity to be heard\r\nfrom a distance over the noise of the machinery.\r\nIn an effort to deflect the force of these points, the\r\nplaintiffs argue that the defendants should have removed the cars\r\nfrom the driveway, thus enabling the snowblower to maneuver more\r\nfreely and to discharge the accumulation away from the house, or\r\nthat they should have warned the Fithians not to go near the dining\r\nroom window.  These arguments do not withstand scrutiny.  In the\r\nfirst place, nothing in the record indicates that either defendant\r\nknew that snow was being discharged against the house in time to\r\ntake any effective action.  In the second place, the nisi prius\r\nroll is barren of any evidence that the parked vehicles presented\r\na realistic danger.\r\nThe fact that the Reeds lacked the opportunity to take\r\nprecautions pertains here as well.  Given Mr. Zofchak's unsolicited\r\nappearance, moving the cars necessarily would have entailed\r\napproaching a man operating a concededly dangerous instrumentality\r\nand asking him to halt work while the vehicles were moved.  Mrs.\r\nReed considered making such an approach (albeit for another\r\nreason), and nothing in the record serves to cast doubt upon the\r\nvalidity of her conclusion that approaching the running snowblower\r\nwould have been so perilous as to fall outside the realm of\r\nordinary prudence.  Finally, it was Mrs. Fithian, not the Reeds,\r\nwho brought the children into the dining room, and as the only\r\nadult near the side of the house for any length of time, she was in\r\nthe best position to anticipate any looming danger.  The Reeds,\r\ntherefore, would not be expected to warn her (or those in her\r\ncharge).  See Polak, 487 N.E.2d at 215-16.\r\nThe case law confirms the appropriateness of brevis\r\ndisposition here.  To overcome summary judgment in a tort suit\r\nagainst an owner or occupant of real property, a plaintiff must put\r\nforth evidence of negligence, i.e., evidence of the defendant's\r\nfailure to exercise due care.  See Toubiana, 520 N.E.2d at 1310. \r\nEvidence that a precaution feasibly could have been taken to\r\nprevent a foreseeable injury sometimes may suffice to create a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact as to negligence.  See, e.g.,\r\nCollins v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 64, 67-68 (D.\r\nMass. 1995) (holding that airline's ongoing opportunity to enforce\r\na policy against children entering baggage room created genuine\r\nissue of material fact as to negligence).  Conversely, when an\r\naccident happens so quickly that those in the vicinity simply do\r\nnot have time to react constructively, their failure to prevent the\r\naccident is not evidence of negligence.  See id. (holding, as a\r\nmatter of law, that airline employees did not act negligently in\r\nfailing to prevent an accident occurring seconds after child\r\narrived in restricted area).  It follows inexorably that where, as\r\nhere, a landowner had no feasible opportunity to remove the\r\ninstrument of injury that was brought into a child's zone of\r\nexposure by a third party, she cannot be held liable for an ensuing\r\ninjury.  See Roderick, 631 N.E.2d at 560; see also Bandanza v. Town\r\nof Norwood, 277 N.E.2d 300, 301 (Mass. 1971).\r\nIf more were needed   and we doubt that it is   we note\r\nthat the record does not contain a shred of evidence that\r\ndischarges from snowblowers often break windows.  This lacuna\r\nrenders the case at hand analogous to Ted's Master Service, Inc. v.\r\nFarina Bros., 178 N.E.2d 268, 270 (Mass. 1961), in which the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court approved a directed verdict in favor of an\r\nexcavating company whose drilling was alleged to have damaged\r\nbuildings (by vibration) well outside the radius of a standard\r\nsurvey.  There, as here, the defendant had no forewarning, and the\r\ninjury that occurred simply was not foreseeable.\r\nWe need go no further.  Once their good-hearted neighbor\r\ntook it upon himself to start snowblowing, there was nothing the\r\nReeds reasonably could have been expected to do to prevent the\r\nbroken window.  Moreover, absent good reason to know that\r\nsnowblowers were likely to smash windows, the Reeds had no reason\r\nto keep their grandchildren away from the dining room window during\r\nthe snowblowing operation.  Because the plaintiffs have not\r\nproposed any feasible precaution, much less any precaution required\r\nby ordinary prudence, that would have averted this freak accident,\r\nthe district court appropriately entered summary judgment.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

Mrs. Reed considered making such an approach (albeit for another reason), and nothing in the record serves to cast doubt upon the validity of her conclusion that approaching the running snowblower would have been so perilous as to fall outside the realm of ordinary prudence. Finally, it was Mrs. Fithian, not the Reeds, who brought the children into the dining room, and as the only adult near the side of the house for any length of time, she was in the best position to anticipate any looming danger. The Reeds, therefore, would not be expected to warn her (or those in her charge).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See Polak, 487 N.E.2d at 215-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law confirms the appropriateness of brevis disposition here. To overcome summary judgment in a tort suit against an owner or occupant of real property, a plaintiff must put forth evidence of negligence, i.e., evidence of the defendant's failure to exercise due care. See Toubiana, 520 N.E.2d at 1310. Evidence that a precaution feasibly could have been taken to prevent a foreseeable injury sometimes may suffice to create a genuine issue of material fact as to negligence. See, e.g., Collins v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 64, 67-68 (D. Mass. 1995) (holding that airline's ongoing opportunity to enforce a policy against children entering baggage room created genuine issue of material fact as to negligence). Conversely, when an accident happens so quickly that those in the vicinity simply do not have time to react constructively, their failure to prevent the accident is not evidence of negligence. See id. (holding, as a matter of law, that airline employees did not act negligently in failing to prevent an accident occurring seconds after child arrived in restricted area). It follows inexorably that where, as here, a landowner had no feasible opportunity to remove the instrument of injury that was brought into a child's zone of exposure by a third party, she cannot be held liable for an ensuing injury. See Roderick, 631 N.E.2d at 560; see also Bandanza v.

This lacuna renders the case at hand analogous to Ted's Master Service, Inc. v. Farina Bros., 178 N.E.2d 268, 270 (Mass. 1961), in which the Supreme Judicial Court approved a directed verdict in favor of an excavating company whose drilling was alleged to have damaged buildings (by vibration) well outside the radius of a standard survey.

In January 1996, Lisa Fithian and her two young children, Floridians all, were visiting her parents, Edward and Martha Reed, in Hingham, Massachusetts. On an inclement morning, John Zofchak, the Reeds' neighbor, trying to be helpful, undertook to clear their driveway with his snowblower (despite the fact that two cars were parked in the area). Snow was a novelty to the youngsters, so Mrs. Reed (while Mrs. Fithian was upstairs) encouraged them to join her at the family room window and watch the snowblower in operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Mrs. Fithian returned, Mrs. Reed went outside in hopes of thanking Mr. Zofchak for the unsolicited favor. Not wanting to approach the snowblower too closely for fear of injury, Mrs. Reed stood in front of the house for roughly fifteen minutes and vainly attempted to catch Mr. Zofchak's attention. Meanwhile, Mrs. Fithian, desiring to give the fascinated children a better view of the snowblowing activity, brought them into the dining room (where the windows were closer to the driveway).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Reed entered the dining room shortly thereafter. At that point, Mr. Zofchak had begun to clear a narrow strip of driveway between the parked cars and the residence. Since the presence of the vehicles prevented him from directing the discharge to the left, he angled it to the right (i.e., toward the house). A few seconds later, the dining room window shattered and flying glass struck and severely injured three-year-old Stephen Fithian, Jr.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), Stephen and his parents sued the Reeds in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following pretrial discovery, the defendants moved successfully for summary judgment.

This is such a case: as the district court ruled, there is no way in which a rational factfinder, on this record, supportably could conclude that the defendants breached an actionable duty to the plaintiffs. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As homeowners and hosts, the defendants had a duty to take into account the extant circumstances (including those known to them and those of which they should have known) and to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition. See Mounsey v. Ellard, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span>, 52 (Mass. 1973); Polak v.

App. Ct. 1985). It was, therefore, incumbent upon them to act reasonably in regard to factors such as the likelihood of injury to persons foreseeably upon the premises, the seriousness of any potential injury, and the burdens associated with risk avoidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard -- reasonable care under all the circumstances -- is a flexible one. As the plaintiffs suggest, it may at times involve a duty to prevent foreseeable injury caused by a third person who has come upon a defendant's premises. See Flood v. Southland Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></span>, 1075 (Mass. 1993); Jesionek v.

On other occasions, it may impose an obligation to warn guests of an unreasonable, nonobvious danger of which the host is aware. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017447\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Polak,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2017447/polak-v-whitney/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">215-16</span></a></span>. The standard does not, however, bind homeowners to anticipate and guard against \"what is unusual and unlikely to happen, or what, as is sometimes said, is only remotely and slightly probable.\" Zompanti v. Ferguson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></span>, 904 (Mass. 1957) (quoting Falk v. Finkelman, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 90 (Mass. 1929)). In fine, the standard does not make a homeowner an insurer of a guest's safety, nor does it require her to exercise extreme prudence, employ heroic measures, or display utter prescience. See Toubiana v. Priestly, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></span>, 1310 (Mass. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The touchstone, then, is ordinary prudence -- and the critical question becomes \"whether the jury reasonably could have concluded that, in view of all the circumstances, an ordinarily prudent person in the defendant's position would have taken steps, not taken by the defendant, to prevent the accident that occurred.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> In most </span>cases (though not always), this question correlates with the foreseeability of the risk of harm, for the more foreseeable the injury, the higher society's expectations that reasonable people will take precautions. See Whittaker v. Saraceno, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1185</span></span>, 1188-89 (Mass. 1994) (holding that society should not place the burden of preventing a violent crime on a property owner without proof that the owner knew or should have known of danger and possible preventive steps, even though crime is always possible and to a certain extent foreseeable); <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mounsey,</span> <span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">52</span> </span>(explaining that the duty of care is defined in part by the likelihood of injury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, our canvass of the record convinces us that no reasonable jury could have determined that the defendants failed to take any precaution that ordinary prudence demanded. To be sure, the plaintiffs assert conclusorily that Mr. Reed should have monitored the use of a dangerous instrumentality on his property -- but the record does not disclose either that Mr. Reed had advance notice of Mr. Zofchak's intentions or that he had any practical opportunity to stop Mr. Zofchak in the act. Even on the plaintiffs' version of the facts, Mr. Reed became aware thatsnowblowing was in progress only moments before the accident occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Reed likewise lacked both notice and any realistic opportunity to alter the course of events. In all events, the record is uncontradicted that she tried without success to hail Mr. Zofchak. Given the swirling snow, the noise made by the machinery, and the danger inherent in approaching the running snowblower, this lack of success is entirely understandable. And the plaintiffs have been unable to suggest any other way that Mrs. Reed rewardingly could have intervened -- there is, for example, no evidence to suggest that she had the vocal capacity to be heard from a distance over the noise of the machinery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to deflect the force of these points, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants should have removed the cars from the driveway, thus enabling the snowblower to maneuver more freely and to discharge the accumulation away from the house, or that they should have warned the Fithians not to go near the dining room window. These arguments do not withstand scrutiny. In the first place, nothing in the record indicates that either defendant knew that snow was being discharged against the house in time to take any effective action. In the second place, the nisi prius roll is barren of any evidence that the parked vehicles presented a realistic danger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the Reeds lacked the opportunity to take precautions pertains here as well. Given Mr. Zofchak's unsolicited appearance, moving the cars necessarily would have entailed approaching a man operating a concededly dangerous instrumentality and asking him to halt work while the vehicles were moved. Mrs. Reed considered making such an approach (albeit for another reason), and nothing in the record serves to cast doubt upon the validity of her conclusion that approaching the running snowblower would have been so perilous as to fall outside the realm of ordinary prudence. Finally, it was Mrs. Fithian, not the Reeds, who brought the children into the dining room, and as the only adult near the side of the house for any length of time, she was in the best position to anticipate any looming danger. The Reeds, therefore, would not be expected to warn her (or those in her charge).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017447\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Polak,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2017447/polak-v-whitney/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">215-16</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law confirms the appropriateness of brevis disposition here.

Mosley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1664684\"><a href=\"/opinion/1664684/baldwin-by-baldwin-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 147 (Ark. 1988).
