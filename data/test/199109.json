The    Clorox   Company   Puerto     Rico    cried    foul,\n\ncomplaining that no detergent brings out the white like its\n\nchlorine bleach when used with a detergent.               Proctor & Gamble\n\nmodified   its    pitch,    inviting    consumers   to    \"Compare       con   su\n\ndetergente . . . Más blanco no se puede\" (Compare with your\n\ndetergent . . . Whiter is not possible).              Unimpressed by this\n\nchange,    Clorox     sued,     alleging,     inter      alia,     that        the\n\nadvertisements were false and misleading in violation of Section\n\n43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).                   After Clorox\n\nmoved for a preliminary injunction, the district court dismissed\n\nthe false advertising claim sua sponte.          Concluding that Clorox\n\nhas stated a claim under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, we vacate\n\nthe dismissal and remand to the district court for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           We present the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nClorox, the party opposing the dismissal of the complaint.                     See\n\nLangadinos v. American Airlines, Inc., 199 F.3d 68, 69 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    In 1989, Proctor & Gamble introduced in Puerto Rico Ace\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcon Blanqueador, a powdered laundry detergent that contains a\n\nnon-chlorine whitening agent described as a \"color-safe oxygen\n\nbleach\" with a patented \"activator,\" the same formula used in\n\npowdered Tide with Bleach marketed in the continental United\n\nStates.     In 1997, Proctor & Gamble introduced a liquid version\n\nof Ace containing a \"compound of high levels of sulfactants and\n\nenzymes which function as a whitener and a color enhancer,\" the\n\nsame formula used in liquid Tide with Bleach Alternative.\n\n                   The Original Doorstep Challenge Campaign\n\n               Proctor & Gamble conducted some consumer studies in\n\n1997 and determined that an obstacle to obtaining an enhanced\n\nmarket share for Ace con Blanqueador was the public's perception\n\nthat chlorine bleach was necessary to get clothes white.                    Using\n\nthis     new       information,   Proctor       &    Gamble   implemented      an\n\nadvertising campaign to counter the perception of consumers that\n\nchlorine bleach was necessary, and to convince them that Ace was\n\na     superior      option   to   using    a    lower-priced    detergent      in\n\nconjunction with chlorine bleach. This \"Doorstep Challenge\"\n\nincluded       a    series   of   television        advertisements     in   which\n\nFrancisco Zamora, a television celebrity in Puerto Rico, visited\n\nwomen in their homes to ask them about their laundry practices\n\nand    to   elicit     their   praise     for   Ace.     In   the    commercials\n\ndepicting powdered Ace, the overriding theme was that chlorine\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fbleach was not necessary to get clothes white if washed with\n\nAce.   The commercials pitching liquid Ace also emphasized its\n\nenhanced whitening capacity, but did not specifically mention\n\nchlorine bleach.     Each commercial closed with the tag line,\n\n\"Whiter is not possible,\" a slogan Proctor & Gamble had been\n\nusing since powdered Ace arrived on the market in 1989.\n\n          For instance, the \"Evelyn\" commercial for powdered Ace\n\nwent as follows:\n\n          Francisco: Do you use Ace?\n\n          She:     No . . .\n\n          Fco:     What is your laundry routine?\n\n          She:     I put in the three detergents I use,\n                   I throw in a bit of chlorine and I\n                   let it soak until the next day.    I\n                   waste a lot of time . . . but to\n                   accomplish what I want I have to do\n                   it that way.\n\n          Fco:     I dare you to wash your white\n                   garments with Ace and nothing else!\n\n          She:     Without chlorine?\n\n                   . . . .\n\n          Fco:     Without chlorine . . . we're going to\n                   wash all these.\n\n          She:     I don't think so . . .\n\n          She:     The truth is . . . that's whiteness, that's\n                   whiteness!  So now I'm going to save money,\n                   time . . .\n\n                   . . . .\n\n                                -4-\n\f                        [VISUAL: Whiter is not possible.]\n\nCertified Translation.\n\n                       The Promotional Mailing\n\n           As part of its campaign to sell Ace, Proctor & Gamble\n\nsent a promotional brochure and product sample to consumers in\n\nPuerto Rico.    The first page of the brochure depicted a bowling\n\nball imprinted with the word \"Ace\" standing in front of several\n\nbowling pins that resembled Clorox bottles.           The caption read:\n\n\"Da en el blanco con una sola tirada,\" (hit the [white] spot\n\nwith just one shot).    The second and third pages of the brochure\n\ncontained additional pictures surrounded by punchy statements in\n\nSpanish like, \"Dare to pass the test.     Wash with Ace and nothing\n\nelse,\" \"Say goodbye to the complications of chlorine and other\n\ncleaners,\" and \"Resist the 'bombs.'1 Put your ACE con Blanqueador\n\nto the test.\"     Like the television commercials, the brochure\n\nended with the tag line, \"Whiter is not possible!\"\n\n                        The Modified Campaign\n\n           In January 1998, the Clorox Company, which markets in\n\nPuerto Rico a brand of chlorine-based liquid bleach called\n\nClorox, sent a letter to Proctor & Gamble complaining that the\n\nDoorstep   Challenge   campaign   was   false   and    misleading,   and\n\n\n     1    The combination of detergent and chlorine bleach is\ncalled \"la bomba\" in Puerto Rico.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdemanding that Proctor & Gamble stop running the television\n\nadvertisements.    Although Proctor & Gamble would not alter the\n\ntheme of its advertising, it agreed to soften the tag line by\n\nadding the qualification, \"compare with your detergent,\" before\n\nthe phrase \"whiter is not possible.\"2\n\n           The qualification did not satisfy Clorox.          In March\n\n1998, Clorox filed this lawsuit, alleging in its complaint\n\nviolations of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1125(a),   the   Federal   Trademark   Dilution   Act,   15   U.S.C.   §\n\n1125(c), the Federal Trade Commission Act and regulations, 15\n\nU.S.C. § 45(a), Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31 § 5141, and regulations issued by the Puerto\n\nRico Department of Consumer Affairs (\"DACO\").            Clorox later\n\namended the complaint by dropping the claims pled under the FTC\n\nAct and the FTC and DACO regulations, and adding a claim under\n\nArticle 1802 predicated solely on Proctor & Gamble's alleged\n\nviolations of those laws and regulations.3         Proctor & Gamble\n\nmoved to dismiss all of the claims except the Lanham Act claim.\n\n\n\n     2    For advertisements depicting liquid detergent, the new\ntag line read, \"Compare con su detergente líquido . . . Más\nblanco no se puede.\" (Compare with your liquid detergent . . .\nWhiter is not possible).\n     3    Presumably, Clorox did this because it worried that the\nFTC Act and FTC and DACO regulations do not authorize private\nrights of action.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fClorox then sought leave to amend the complaint again to add\n\nProctor          &    Gamble's   alleged      violation    of   the   Lanham   Act    as\n\nanother predicate for its Article 1802 claim.4\n\n                     Clorox sought to permanently enjoin Proctor & Gamble\n\nfrom \"making any claims that Ace gets clothes 'the whitest\n\npossible,' without the use of Clorox.\" (Emphasis in original).\n\nAdditionally, Clorox sought damages and attorneys' fees under §\n\n43(a)       of        the   Lanham   Act. 5     Finally,    Clorox     moved    for    a\n\npreliminary injunction on its Lanham Act claim.                        In connection\n\nwith       the       motion   for    a   preliminary   injunction,      the    parties\n\nconducted document production and depositions and submitted to\n\nthe court relevant evidentiary materials, including consumer\n\nsurveys, statements of experts, and the testimony of various\n\nwitnesses.             The district court did not hear oral argument.\n\n                     In March 1999, while Clorox's motion to amend its\n\namended complaint and its motion for preliminary injunction were\n\npending, the district court granted Proctor & Gamble's motion to\n\n\n       4  This Second Amended Complaint also assailed a new\nseries of advertisements, first aired by Proctor & Gamble in\nSeptember 1998, depicting the celebrity interviewer Zamora\nwrapped in chains and exclaiming, \"Free yourself from chlorine\nbleach!\"\n       5  Section 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a),\nallows for the recovery of damages and attorney's fees for false\nadvertising in violation of § 43(a). See 4 J. Thomas McCarthy,\nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 27:40 (4th ed.\n1997).\n\n                                              -7-\n\fdismiss      both     the    Dilution   Act   and   Article    1802    claims.\n\nAdditionally, the district court dismissed the Lanham Act claim\n\nsua sponte.         This appeal followed, limited to the dismissal of\n\nthe Lanham Act and Article 1802 claims.\n\n                                        II.\n\n                        A.    The Sua Sponte Dismissal\n\n             We review de novo the district court's dismissal of\n\nClorox's Lanham Act claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\nSee Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).         We will affirm the dismissal of the complaint if,\n\nand   only    if,    accepting    all   well-pleaded   facts   as     true   and\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the\n\ncomplaint \"fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).         That is, the complaint is\n\nproperly dismissed only when the allegations are such that \"the\n\nplaintiff can prove no set of facts to support [the] claim for\n\nrelief.\"     Rockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n             Courts must move cautiously when dismissing a complaint\n\nsua sponte.         See, e.g., Baker v. Cuomo, 58 F.3d 814, 818 (2d\n\nCir. 1995).          Although it is occasionally appropriate for a\n\ndistrict court to \"note the inadequacy of the complaint and, on\n\nits own initiative, dismiss the complaint[,] a court may not do\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fso without at least giving plaintiffs notice of the proposed\n\naction and affording them an opportunity to address the issue.\"\n\nWyatt v.    City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(quoting Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, 482 F.2d 372, 374 (1st Cir.\n\n1973)).    See also Perez v. Ortiz, 849 F.2d 793, 797 (2d Cir.\n\n1988) (noting that \"the general rule is that a 'district court\n\nhas no authority to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a\n\nclaim    upon   which   relief   can    be   granted   without   giving    the\n\nplaintiff an opportunity to be heard'\").               Clorox was given no\n\nopportunity to argue the validity of its claim to the district\n\ncourt.    Moreover, the court's dismissal was done in the face of\n\nProctor & Gamble's acknowledgment that \"the complaint states a\n\nclaim under the federal false advertising statute[--]Section\n\n43(a) of the Lanham Act.\"           Clorox had no reason to suspect,\n\ntherefore, that its Lanham Act claim was in danger of dismissal.\n\n\n\n            There   are   limited      exceptions   to   the   general    rule\n\nbarring dismissal without notice, applicable to frivolous claims\n\nor to claims whose defects could not be cured by amendment.                See\n\nWyatt, 35 F.3d at 15 n.1 (noting that reversal of a sua sponte\n\ndismissal without notice may not be \"mandated if amendment [of\n\nthe complaint] would be futile or if it is patently obvious that\n\nthe plaintiff could not prevail\"); Street v. Fair, 918 F.2d 269,\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f272   (1st    Cir.     1990)   (per    curiam)   (noting      that     procedural\n\nprotections may be unnecessary when the court dismisses in forma\n\npauperis      actions    as    frivolous).       As   our    discussion     infra\n\nindicates, Clorox's Lanham Act claim does not fall within any of\n\nthese exceptions.\n\n             Recognizing the procedural vulnerability of the court's\n\ndismissal, Proctor & Gamble points out that Clorox submitted\n\nsubstantial evidence in conjunction with its complaint and its\n\npreliminary injunction motion--evidence that the district court\n\npresumably could have used to convert, sua sponte, a motion to\n\ndismiss into a motion for summary judgment.                 See 5A Charles Alan\n\nWright & Arthur R. Miller,             Federal Practice and Procedure §\n\n1366, at 470 (West Supp. 2000)                (explaining that it may be\n\nappropriate for a court to convert a motion to dismiss into one\n\nfor summary judgment sua sponte when parties offer material\n\noutside    of    the    pleadings     in   conjunction      with   a   motion   to\n\ndismiss).       Proctor & Gamble now urges us to treat the district\n\ncourt's ruling as a summary judgment, inviting us to affirm on\n\nany alternative ground supported by a full examination of the\n\nrecord.      See Frillz, Inc. v. Lader, 104 F.3d 515, 516 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (stating that we may \"affirm an entry of summary judgment\n\non any alternative ground made manifest by the record\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          There are several problems with this approach.         Even\n\nif we were to agree that it would have been appropriate for the\n\ndistrict court to consider material outside the pleadings in\n\nconnection with its sua sponte dismissal of the Lanham Act\n\nclaim, this is not what the district court did.          The court's\n\nopinion and order sets forth its analysis in a section entitled\n\n\"Motion to Dismiss,\" which it prefaces with a discussion of the\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss standards.           The court expressly\n\ngrants \"Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\"         More significantly, the\n\ndistrict court did not conduct the searching review of the\n\nrecord necessary to rule on summary judgment.       See Garita Hotel\n\nLtd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15, 18-19\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (stating that the test for deciding whether a\n\ndistrict court's ruling is a 12(b)(6) dismissal or an entry of\n\nsummary judgment is \"whether the court actually took cognizance\n\nof\" supplementary materials).       The district court looked only to\n\nthe face of the complaint.          It did not purport to dismiss\n\nClorox's Lanham Act claim based on an evaluation of the record\n\nas a whole.\n\n          Moreover,   Proctor   &    Gamble's   suggestion   fails   to\n\naddress   the fundamental problem with the district court's sua\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fsponte    actions:      the    failure     to    give    Clorox    notice       and    an\n\nopportunity      to    be   heard.        Even   if   the     district    court       had\n\nconverted      the    motion   to    dismiss     into    a    motion   for      summary\n\njudgment--which it did not--such conversion usually requires\n\nthat \"all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to\n\npresent all material made pertinent to such a motion.\"                          Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b).         Although we do not \"mechanically enforce the\n\nrequirement of express notice of a district court's intention to\n\nconvert    a   Rule     12(b)(6)     motion      into    a    motion   for      summary\n\njudgment,\" we do guard against allowing such a conversion where\n\nit would come as a \"surprise\" or be \"unfair\" to the party\n\nagainst     whom      judgment       is    rendered.           Chaparro-Febus          v.\n\nInternational Longshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575, 983 F.2d 325, 332\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).        In light of Proctor & Gamble's acknowledgment\n\nthat the complaint stated a claim under § 43(a) of the Lanham\n\nAct, the district court's conversion without notice would have\n\nbeen both surprising and unfair.\n\n            It would only compound the unfairness to Clorox if we\n\naccepted the invitation of Proctor & Gamble to indulge the\n\nfiction that the district court's ruling was a summary judgment\n\ndetermination         and   then     affirm      on     any    basis     that    seems\n\nappropriate.         Clorox has now tailored its appellate advocacy to\n\naddress the legal standards that it reasonably expected would\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fgovern this appeal--i.e., the standards governing review of a\n\n12(b)(6)    dismissal.            Clorox          has   never    had    an    adequate\n\nopportunity      to     argue    the       relationship       between      the   record\n\nevidence and its Lanham Act claim.                  Also, it would be imprudent\n\nto evaluate the voluminous filings in this case in light of the\n\nsummary judgment standard without advocacy from both parties on\n\nthe relationship between this evidence and the legal standards\n\ngoverning liability under the Lanham Act.\n\n           Our refusal to review the entire record based upon\n\nsummary judgment standards does not mean, however, that we will\n\nnot examine any of the filings in this case.                               The record\n\nincludes hundreds of pages of exhibits appended to the various\n\ncomplaints and submitted in support of motions to dismiss and\n\nmotions    for    and    against       a    preliminary       injunction.         These\n\nexhibits include the full text of the advertising copy, internal\n\ncompany memoranda, letters exchanged between the parties, market\n\nresearch    and       consumer     survey         data,   and    declarations       and\n\ndeposition testimony of experts and other witnesses.                           Although\n\nmuch of the evidence contained in the record is out-of-bounds in\n\nreviewing a 12(b)(6) dismissal, it is well-established that in\n\nreviewing the complaint, we \"may properly consider the relevant\n\nentirety of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in\n\nthe   complaint,       even     though      not    attached     to   the     complaint,\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fwithout converting the motion into one for summary judgment.\"\n\nShaw v.

We limit our evaluation of material\n\noutside the complaint to the advertisement copy because that is\n\nthe   only    material           we   deem   \"integral\"     to     assessing    the\n\nsufficiency of the allegations in the complaint.\n\n             In closing our discussion of the sua sponte dismissal,\n\nwe must reiterate that basic fairness and sound prudential\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\freasons   underlie       our    insistence      on    the   involvement    of   the\n\nparties in any dismissal.             \"[A]dequate notice helps the court\n\nsecure a just determination, by giving parties moved against the\n\nopportunity to present their best arguments in opposition.\"\n\nPerez,    849   F.2d    at     797   (internal       citations    and   quotations\n\nomitted).       This    case     aptly   illustrates        the   wisdom   of   that\n\ninsistence.      The relationship between the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint and the Lanham Act false advertising claim is complex\n\nand contested.     By dismissing Clorox's Lanham Act claim without\n\nthe benefit of the parties' advocacy in addressing these complex\n\nissues,   the    district        court    misunderstood       the    relationship\n\nbetween the allegations in Clorox's complaint and the relevant\n\nlegal standards.        We turn now to those standards.\n\n            B. The Lanham Act False Advertising Claims\n\n            The false advertising prong of the Lanham Act provides:\n\n            (1) Any person who, on or in connection with\n            any goods or services, or any container for\n            goods, uses in commerce any word, term,\n            name, symbol, or device, or any combination\n            thereof, or any false designation of origin,\n            false or misleading description of fact, or\n            false or misleading representation of fact,\n            which--\n\n                       . . . .\n\n                       (B) in commercial advertising or\n                       promotion, misrepresents the nature,\n                       characteristics,    qualities,    or\n                       geographic origin of his or her or\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f                   another person's goods, services, or\n                   commercial activities,\n\n            shall be liable in a civil action by any\n            person who believes that he or she is or is\n            likely to be damaged by such act.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).6      A plaintiff can succeed on a false\n\nadvertising claim by proving either that an advertisement is\n\nfalse on its face or that the advertisement is literally true or\n\nambiguous but likely to mislead and confuse consumers.        See\n\nSouthland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th\n\nCir. 1997); Castrol, Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., 987 F.2d 939, 943 (3d\n\nCir. 1993); Abbott Labs. v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6, 13\n\n(7th Cir. 1992).    If the advertisement is literally false, the\n\ncourt may grant relief without considering evidence of consumer\n\nreaction.    See United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co., 140 F.3d 1175,\n\n\n\n    6     The elements of a false advertising claim under the\nLanham Act are: (1) a false or misleading description of fact or\nrepresentation of fact by the defendant in a commercial\nadvertisement about its own or another's product; (2) the\nstatement actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a\nsubstantial segment of its audience; (3) the deception is\nmaterial, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing\ndecision; (4) the defendant placed the false or misleading\nstatement in interstate commerce; and (5) the plaintiff has been\nor is likely to be injured as a result of the false or\nmisleading statement, either by direct diversion of sales from\nitself to defendant or by a lessening of goodwill associated\nwith its products. See Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co.,\n108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Johnson & Johnson-\nMerck Consumer Pharms. Co. v. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharms., Inc.,\n19 F.3d 125, 129 (3d Cir. 1994); 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy\non Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 27:24 (4th ed. 1997).\n\n                               -16-\n\f1180 (8th Cir. 1998).   In the absence of such literal falsity,\n\nan additional burden is placed upon the plaintiff to show that\n\nthe advertisement, though explicitly true, nonetheless conveys\n\na misleading message to the viewing public.     See Sandoz Pharms.\n\nCorp. v. Richardson-Vicks, Inc., 902 F.2d 222, 228-29 (3d Cir.\n\n1990).   To satisfy its burden, the plaintiff must show how\n\nconsumers have actually reacted to the challenged advertisement\n\nrather than merely demonstrating how they could have reacted.\n\nSee id. at 229.\n\n         Clorox's   amended   complaint   alleged   that   Proctor   &\n\nGamble's original and modified Doorstep Challenge television\n\ncampaigns, as well as the promotional brochure, were false and\n\nmisleading.   Specifically, Clorox alleged that the Doorstep\n\nChallenge advertisements and promotions conveyed the false and\n\nmisleading message to the Puerto Rican public that Ace con\n\nBlanqueador gets clothes as white or whiter than a detergent\n\nused with chlorine bleach.7    Clorox also alleged that the name\n\n\n    7     Significantly, the Lanham Act false advertising claim\nwas directed at the alleged comparison between Ace and chlorine\nbleach.   Unlike the Dilution Act claim, therefore, the false\nadvertising claim is not directed at a dilution, disparagement,\ntarnishment, or diminishment of Clorox's brand name. That is,\nClorox alleged that it was false and misleading to claim the\nsuperiority of Ace over chlorine bleach, generically, not Clorox\nbleach, in particular.       To the extent that such false\nadvertising would lead to a reduction in market share for Clorox\nas the leading producer of chlorine-based \"cleansing bleach\" in\nPuerto Rico (Clorox alleged that it controls 74% of the Puerto\n\n                               -17-\n\f\"Ace con Blanqueador\" is literally false with respect to Ace\n\nliquid detergent.\n\n                 The district court's analysis of the Lanham Act claim\n\nconsisted of two paragraphs in which it reasoned that Clorox\n\n\"has failed to state a claim\" under the Lanham Act because it\n\ncould      not    establish       that    Proctor       &   Gamble's      advertisements\n\ncontained false or misleading statements.                           In particular, it\n\nfound that the tag line appearing in the modified campaign\n\ncommercials, \"Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not\n\npossible,\" was not false because it compared Ace only to other\n\ndetergents, not to detergents used with chlorine bleach.                                 The\n\ncourt      also        stated    that,    \"Ace's       comparison        claim\"   was    not\n\nactionable under the Lanham Act because it was \"mere puffing.\"\n\n\n\n                 The    district     court's      dismissal        was    erroneous      for\n\nseveral reasons.              First, it ignored many of the allegations on\n\nthe   face       of     the     complaint.        It    did   not    address      Clorox's\n\nallegations            directed    at    the    advertisements       in    the    original\n\nDoorstep Challenge campaign, or the promotional brochure, nor\n\ndid   it    address        Clorox's      allegation         that   the    name    \"Ace   con\n\nBlanqueador\" as applied to the liquid detergent is literally\n\n\nRican market), Clorox may be in a position to show that it was\nsignificantly damaged by false claims of superiority with\nrespect to chlorine bleach.\n\n                                               -18-\n\ffalse.    Second, it applied an overly-restrictive view of the\n\nrequirements for pleading a false advertising claim under the\n\nLanham Act, dismissing the allegation that the modified campaign\n\nwas not false or misleading simply because it found the tag\n\nline, read in isolation, to be literally true.                  Finally, the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that Clorox's allegations\n\nwere directed at non-actionable puffery.              We analyze Clorox's\n\nvarious   allegations       de   novo,   see   Beddall,   137   F.3d   at   16,\n\nfocusing on (1) the allegations of literal falsity, (2) the\n\nallegations of misleading advertising, and (3) the concept of\n\n\"puffery.\"\n\n                     1.     Claims of Literal Falsity\n\n           Clorox challenged two features of Proctor & Gamble's\n\nadvertising campaign as literally false.             First, Clorox alleged\n\nthat the television commercials that aired in the original and\n\nmodified campaign claimed that Ace gets clothes as white or\n\nwhiter than chlorine bleach.         According to Clorox, that claim is\n\nliterally false because tests prove that chlorine bleach whitens\n\nbetter than detergent used alone.              Second, Clorox alleged that\n\nthe name, \"Ace con Blanqueador,\" is literally false with respect\n\nto Ace liquid detergent because it falsely suggests that Ace\n\nliquid contains whitener or bleach.\n\n                a.        The Television Advertisements\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f           Whether      an   advertisement     is    literally   false     is\n\ntypically an issue of fact.         See Mead Johnson & Co. v. Abbott\n\nLabs., 209 F.3d 1032, 1034 (7th Cir. 2000) (denying petition for\n\nrehearing and amending prior panel opinion).                 At least two\n\nfactual questions must be answered in evaluating the accuracy of\n\nany   particular     advertisement.        First,     a   factfinder     must\n\ndetermine the claim conveyed by the advertisement.               See United\n\nIndus. Corp., 140 F.3d at 1181 (applying clearly erroneous\n\nstandard to review of district court's factual determination\n\nregarding the claim conveyed by an advertisement for roach\n\nbait); Johnson & Johnson v. GAC Int'l, Inc., 862 F.2d 975, 979\n\n(2d Cir. 1988).      Once the claim made by the advertisement has\n\nbeen determined, the factfinder must then evaluate whether that\n\nclaim is false.      See Castrol, 987 F.2d at 944.\n\n           In the case at hand, the parties focus their attention\n\nsolely upon the first of these factual determinations.                   The\n\ncomplaint asserts that in head-to-head whitening tests, Clorox\n\nachieved   \"by   far,    superior   results\"    to    Ace.    Clorox     also\n\nemphasizes that \"Ace's own boxes\" state that in certain cases,\n\nfor better results, the consumers must use chlorine bleach.                In\n\nreviewing the motion to dismiss, we therefore assume as true\n\nthat chlorine bleach whitens better than Ace and that a contrary\n\nclaim would be literally false.       The primary dispute between the\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fparties is not which product whitens better,8 but rather whether\n\nany    of       Proctor   &    Gamble's     advertisements          make       a   claim    of\n\nwhitening superiority over chlorine bleach.\n\n                 Although      factfinders       usually     base    literal        falsity\n\ndeterminations            upon      the     explicit        claims        made       by     an\n\nadvertisement,            they     may     also        consider     any     claims         the\n\nadvertisement conveys by \"necessary implication.\"                          See Southland\n\nSod Farms, 108 F.3d at 1139; Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at\n\n129.        A    claim    is     conveyed    by    necessary       implication           when,\n\nconsidering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience\n\nwould       recognize       the    claim    as     readily    as    if     it      had    been\n\nexplicitly stated.                For instance, a factfinder found that an\n\nadvertisement that claimed a motor oil provided \"longer engine\n\nlife and better engine protection\" without explicitly mentioning\n\ncompetitors          nonetheless          drew     a    comparison        by       necessary\n\nimplication vis à vis those competitors.                     See Castrol, 987 F.2d\n\nat 941, 946.          This is not to say, however, that all messages\n\nimplied by an advertisement will support a finding of literal\n\nfalsity by a factfinder:\n\n                 The greater the degree to which a message\n                 relies upon the viewer or consumer to\n                 integrate its components and draw the\n\n\n       8  Indeed, Proctor & Gamble does not challenge on appeal\nClorox's assertion that chlorine bleach in combination with a\ndetergent gets clothes whiter than its Ace detergent.\n\n                                            -21-\n\f           apparent conclusion, however, the less\n           likely it is that a finding of literal\n           falsity will be supported.        Commercial\n           claims that are implicit, attenuated, or\n           merely suggestive usually cannot fairly be\n           characterized as literally false.\n\nUnited Indus. Corp., 140 F.3d at 1181.                   Similarly, a factfinder\n\nmight   conclude       that      the   message     conveyed     by    a     particular\n\nadvertisement remains so balanced between several plausible\n\nmeanings   that       the    claim     made   by   the    advertisement        is   too\n\nuncertain to serve as the basis of a literal falsity claim,\n\nthough even in that case it could still form the basis for a\n\nclaim that the advertisement is misleading.                     See id. at 1182;\n\nAbbott Labs., 971 F.2d at 14.\n\n           In    reviewing        the    dismissal       in   the    present    case,\n\nhowever,   we    are       not   required     to   determine        what    claim   was\n\nactually conveyed by the advertisements because we are not\n\nfactfinders.         Instead, we must evaluate whether the complaint,\n\nas supplemented by the advertising copy, alleges facts that\n\nwould allow a rational factfinder to conclude that Proctor &\n\nGamble's     advertisements            make   a    superiority        claim    either\n\nexplicitly      or    by    necessary    implication.         We     must    draw   all\n\nreasonable inferences as to the claim made in the advertisements\n\nin favor of Clorox.           See Southland Sod Farms, 108 F.3d at 1139;\n\nsee also Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 129; U.S. Healthcare,\n\nInc. v. Blue Cross, 898 F.2d 914, 922 (3d Cir. 1990).                        Dismissal\n\n                                         -22-\n\fwould only be proper if no reasonable factfinder could conclude\n\nthat the advertisements, viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nClorox, make a claim of whitening superiority for Proctor &\n\nGamble's product.\n\n            We conclude that Clorox has stated a claim that Proctor\n\n& Gamble's original Doorstep Challenge commercials are literally\n\nfalse.     These commercials juxtapose a tag line, \"Whiter is not\n\npossible,\" with images of consumers who normally used bleach to\n\nachieve white clothes and who are favorably impressed by the\n\nresults obtained from using Ace alone.               The overall theme of the\n\ncommercials is that bleach is unnecessary if clothes are washed\n\nwith Ace, and, in fact, many of the consumers visited by Zamora\n\nare congratulated at the end of the commercials for passing \"the\n\nAce   whiteness      challenge   without        chlorine.\"         Some    of     the\n\ncommercials also suggest that eliminating chlorine from the\n\nlaundry process will save consumers time or money, or curtail\n\nthe negative side effects of washing clothes with chlorine.                         A\n\nfactfinder    could    reasonably   conclude         that,   viewed       in    their\n\nentirety,    these    advertisements   claim         that    Ace   is     equal    or\n\nsuperior    in   whitening   ability       to    a    detergent     and        bleach\n\ncombination.\n\n            The modified Doorstep Challenge campaign continued the\n\nsame visual comparisons, as well as the congratulatory comments\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\ffor passing the \"Ace whiteness challenge without chlorine,\" but\n\nadded the words \"Compare your detergent\" to the \"Whiter is not\n\npossible\" tag line shown at the bottom of the screen at the end\n\nof   the    commercials.        Although      this    change     may   render   the\n\ncomparative     claim    of    the    advertisements      more    ambiguous,     we\n\nnonetheless conclude that it remains reasonable to interpret\n\nthese      advertisements      as    making   by     necessary    implication     a\n\nsuperiority claim for Ace over chlorine bleach.                    Consequently,\n\nthe court erred in dismissing Clorox's literal falsity claims\n\nwith respect to both Doorstep Challenge campaigns.\n\n                  b.    The Name \"Ace con Blanqueador\"\n\n             Clorox     also    alleged       that     the     name,    \"Ace    con\n\nBlanqueador,\" as applied to liquid Ace, is literally false.\n\nAccording to Clorox, the word \"blanqueador\" implies that liquid\n\nAce has whitening capabilities like bleach.                  Clorox alleged that\n\nthis is literally false because in its liquid form Ace does not\n\ncontain bleach or whitening agents.                Instead, it contains only\n\na \"color enhancer.\"         Clorox emphasizes that liquid Ace uses the\n\nsame formula as \"Tide with Bleach Alternative\" whose name,\n\nunlike \"blanqueador,\" clearly signifies the absence of bleach.\n\nProctor & Gamble responds that \"blanqueador\" means \"whitener,\"\n\nand that the name cannot be literally false because tests show\n\n\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fthat the agents added to liquid Ace produce greater whiteness\n\nthan detergents without those agents.\n\n           Clorox's allegations about the use of the name \"Ace con\n\nBlanqueador\" for the liquid detergent state a claim for literal\n\nfalsity.   Although \"blanqueador,\" meaning \"whitener,\" is broad\n\nenough to encompass both bleach and non-bleach whitening agents,\n\nthe question remains whether liquid Ace is properly described as\n\ncontaining \"whitening agents\" of any sort.       Clorox has alleged\n\nthat it is not, insisting that Ace's ingredients are properly\n\ntermed \"color enhancers.\"      Although the distinction between a\n\n\"whitening agent\" and a \"color enhancer\" eludes us, we must\n\ncredit that allegation in this appeal from a 12(b)(6) dismissal.\n\nIf Clorox succeeds in proving that liquid Ace contains only an\n\n\"enhancer,\"   rather   than   a   \"whitener,\"   and   if   it   further\n\nestablishes the other elements of a false advertising claim, see\n\nsupra note 6, it will be entitled to relief under the Lanham Act\n\nbecause Proctor & Gamble's designation of Ace liquid detergent\n\nas \"Ace con Blanqueador\" would be literally false.\n\n               2. Claims of Misleading Advertising\n\n           In addition to its claims of literal falsity, Clorox\n\nhas alleged in its complaint that the Ace advertising campaign,\n\neven if true or ambiguous, makes an implied claim that is\n\nmisleading to consumers.      This second theory of recovery under\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fthe Lanham Act is independent of a literal falsity theory. See,\n\ne.g., Coca-Cola, Co. v. Tropicana Prods., Inc., 690 F.2d 312,\n\n317 (2d Cir. 1982).     Unlike the requirements of a claim of\n\nliteral   falsity,    the   plaintiff   alleging   a   misleading\n\nadvertisement has the burden of proving that a substantial\n\nportion of the audience for that advertisement was actually\n\nmisled.   See Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 134 (citing U.S.\n\nHealthcare v. Blue Cross, 898 F.2d 914, 922 (3d Cir. 1990)).   An\n\nadvertisement's propensity to deceive the viewing public is most\n\noften proven by consumer survey data.       See id. at 129-30.9\n\nClorox appended to the amended complaint a consumer survey\n\nprepared by David Whitehouse of Gaither International/Puerto\n\nRico, Inc.10   The survey consisted of a series of open-ended\n\n\n\n\n     9    In some circuits, if the defendant \"intentionally set\nout to deceive the public,\" using \"deliberate conduct\" of an\n\"egregious nature\" in light of the advertising culture of the\nmarketplace in which the defendant competes, a presumption\narises that customers were, in fact, deceived, dispensing with\nthe need for the plaintiff to commission a consumer survey. See\nRhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 131-32; Johnson & Johnson*Merck\nConsumer Pharms. Co. v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 960 F.2d 294,\n298-99 (2d Cir. 1992); McCarthy § 27:58.     Because Clorox has\nproffered a consumer survey, we need not decide whether Clorox's\nallegations that Proctor & Gamble intentionally acted in bad\nfaith creates a presumption of consumer deception.\n     10   In addition to its own survey, Clorox contends that\nProctor & Gamble's market research, commissioned three months\ninto the Doorstep Challenge campaign, demonstrates that\nconsumers have been misled.\n\n                               -26-\n\fquestions followed by several follow-up probes.                In reliance on\n\nthe survey, the complaint alleges that:\n\n            In open-ended questions, 35% of respondents\n            of its scientifically valid survey responded\n            that the main message of the Doorstep\n            Challenge Campaign was that, with ACE, there\n            is no need to use other products for maximum\n            whitening performance.    In addition, when\n            the respondents were asked if 'the Detergent\n            in the Ad (ACE) Leaves Clothes as White or\n            Whiter than If One Uses Bleach,' 47% totally\n            agreed and 20% somewhat agreed with that\n            statement. Plainly, the Doorstep Challenge\n            Campaign has been amply shown to be likely\n            to cause consumer deception.\n\nClorox     has   also    alleged   in      its    complaint    that     \"in     its\n\npromotional activities and advertisements,\" Proctor & Gamble\n\n\"deceiv[ed] and confus[ed] the public, causing consumers to\n\nwrongly believe they are buying a detergent that possesses the\n\nsame qualities and characteristics as a detergent used with\n\nCLOROX.\"\n\n            The court was required to credit Clorox's allegations.\n\nIt could not conduct its own evaluation of the advertising copy\n\nbecause    whether      advertising   is     misleading    depends      on    \"what\n\nmessage    was   actually     conveyed       to   the    viewing      audience.\"\n\nSmithkline Beecham Corp., 960 F.2d at 298;                    see also Rhone-\n\nPoulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 129.          In deciding whether a message is\n\n\"misleading,\"     the    message   conveyed       is   discerned   by    \"public\n\nreaction,\" not by judicial evaluation.                 McCarthy § 27:56; see\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\falso Castrol, 987 F.2d at 947 (\"[I]n cases where the issue is\n\nwhether a statement . . . has a tendency to mislead, confuse, or\n\ndeceive     .   .   .   [,]    the    court's      reaction   is   at    best   not\n\ndeterminative and at worst irrelevant.\") (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).         That is, absent some other defect in its proof\n\nof the elements of a false advertising claim, see supra note 6,\n\nif Clorox's consumer survey data (or Proctor & Gamble's own\n\nmarket research data) shows that the advertisements \"deceive[d]\n\na     substantial       portion      of    the     intended   audience,\"        U.S.\n\nHealthcare, 898 F.2d at 922, Clorox is entitled to relief under\n\nthe    Lanham   Act.11        Hence,      the    claims   asserting     misleading\n\nadvertising were improperly dismissed.12\n\n\n       11 Although we have quoted Clorox's allegations relying\non the results of its own consumer survey, we do not mean to\nsuggest that a Lanham Act plaintiff must identify the particular\nconsumer survey that will be used to support its allegations to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss. For the purposes of a motion to\ndismiss, a court must credit the type of allegations of\nmisleading advertising set forth here. Obviously, if confronted\nwith a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff can no longer\nrest on the allegations in the complaint.\n       12 Proctor & Gamble vigorously disputes the validity of\nClorox's survey.   In opposing Clorox's motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, Proctor & Gamble supplied its own expert, Dr.\nMichael Rappeport, who testified that the responses to the open-\nended questions in Clorox's survey do not \"by any stretch of the\nimagination\" show that the commercial's message was that there\nis no need to use products other than Ace con Blanqueador for\nmaximum whitening performance.       Dr. Rappeport concluded,\nmoreover, that the methodology used to conduct the survey was\n\"so biased as to have no value whatsoever.\" Proctor & Gamble\nalso argues that Clorox's own expert, Whitehouse, failed to\n\n                                          -28-\n\f         Proctor & Gamble offers one last defense of the court's\n\nruling, pointing to Mead Johnson & Co. v. Abbott Labs., 201 F.3d\n\n883, modified by, 209 F.3d 1032 (7th Cir. 2000) as a case that\n\nstands for the proposition that \"a consumer survey could not be\n\nused to show that an advertisement that is clear and unequivocal\n\non its face otherwise conveyed a misleading message.\"   According\n\nto Proctor & Gamble, its tag line in the modified campaign\n\n\"clearly and unequivocally\" does not compare Ace with Clorox\n\nand, therefore, Mead Johnson prevents Clorox from using a survey\n\nto prove that a comparison was made.   We need not decide whether\n\nwe would agree with Mead Johnson in a factually similar case.\n\nThis case is of a different order.\n\n         Mead Johnson addressed whether a label was misleading\n\nin claiming its product to be the \"1st Choice of Doctors.\"    See\n\n201 F.3d at 883-84.    The plaintiff argued that its surveys\n\ndemonstrated that consumers interpreted \"first\" to mean that\n\n\"more than 50%\" of doctors preferred that brand rather than\n\n\n\n\nvouch for the survey results when asked about it in his\ndeposition. Finally, Proctor & Gamble insists that even if the\nsurvey were valid, it tests only one advertisement, and\ntherefore could not support Clorox's claim that the whole\nadvertising campaign was misleading. We express no view on the\nmerits of Proctor & Gamble's arguments. The \"probative value of\na consumer survey is a highly fact-specific determination,\"\nRhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 134 (quotations omitted). It is\nnot the type of determination that we may make as a matter of\nlaw upon review of a motion to dismiss.\n\n                             -29-\n\finterpreting    \"first\"   to    mean     that    a    plurality   of     doctors\n\npreferred the brand.      See id. at 884-85.              These distinctions\n\nwere important because, though the latter interpretation of the\n\nlabel was true, the former was false.                See id. at 884.\n\n          After first finding the plaintiff's survey \"misleading\n\nif not meaningless,\" the court identified a \"deeper problem: the\n\nuse of a survey in the first place.\"                  Id. at 885.       Although\n\nagreeing that surveys are \"accepted ways to probe for things\n\nsuch as confusion about the source of goods, for confusion\n\ndepends   on   the   effect    of   a   phrase   or     trade   dress    on   the\n\nconsumer,\" the court reasoned that surveys should not be used\n\n\"to determine the meaning of words, or to set the standard to\n\nwhich objectively verifiable claims must be held.\"                Id. at 886.\n\nBased upon these objections, the court held that the survey\n\ncould not \"support a conclusion . . . that [the message conveyed\n\nby the advertisement] either was false or implied a falsehood.\"\n\nMead Johnson, 209 F.3d at 1034.\n\n          Procedurally, Mead Johnson is different than this case.\n\nThat court's evaluation of the merits of the survey was based on\n\na record established during a three day hearing on a motion for\n\na preliminary injunction, which was granted.               See Mead Johnson,\n\n201 F.3d at 884.      As noted, see supra note 12, it would not be\n\nappropriate to undertake a similar analysis of the Clorox survey\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fon    the   limited    record       subject    to       review   after     a   12(b)(6)\n\ndismissal.\n\n             Also, the advertising slogan in Mead Johnson was a\n\nsingle phrase printed on the label of a can of infant formula.\n\nProctor      &   Gamble   points      us    to      a     similar   phrase      in      its\n\nadvertising, the tag line \"Compare with your detergent . . .\n\nWhiter      is   not   possible,\"      as     though       the   two     slogans     were\n\ncomparable.        Proctor      &   Gamble's        tag    line,    however,       is    an\n\nintegral part of a television commercial with substantial text\n\nand images.       There is a fundamental difference between a slogan\n\non a can label that communicates its meaning to consumers solely\n\nthrough the printed text, and a tag line shown on the screen at\n\nthe end of a television commercial that communicates its message\n\nto consumers through a combination of audio-visual and textual\n\nmedia.      Because we decline to read Proctor & Gamble's tag line\n\nseparately from the entirety of the commercials, Mead Johnson is\n\nfactually inapplicable to the present case.\n\n                                     3. Puffery\n\n             Finally, the statements, \"Compare with your detergent\n\n. . . Whiter is not possible,\" and \"Whiter is not possible,\" are\n\nnot    non-actionable        puffing.            \"'Puffing'         is    exaggerated\n\nadvertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no reasonable\n\nbuyer would rely . . . .\"             McCarthy § 27:38.             \"A specific and\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fmeasurable advertisement claim of product superiority . . . is\n\nnot puffery.\"     Southland Sod Farms, 108 F.3d at 1145 (claim that\n\nturfgrass seed requires \"50% less mowing\" was not puffery); see\n\nalso Castrol, Inc., 987 F.2d at 946 (claim that motor oil\n\nprovides \"longer engine life and better engine protection\" was\n\nnot puffery).     Whether the \"Doorstep Challenge\" campaign conveys\n\nthe message that Ace gets clothes whiter than chlorine bleach,\n\nor compares Ace with other detergents without implying that it\n\nwhitens better than chlorine bleach, the claim is specific and\n\nmeasurable, not the kind of vague or subjective statement that\n\ncharacterizes puffery.       Indeed, Proctor & Gamble concedes in its\n\nbrief that its claim in its modified campaign, \"Compare with\n\nyour detergent . . . Whiter is not possible,\" is not puffery.\n\nIt contends that it is a true statement supported by its studies\n\ncomparing Ace con Blanqueador with other detergents.\n\n           The    original    campaign        tag    line,   \"Whiter      is   not\n\npossible,\" is a closer call on the puffing issue.                        Standing\n\nalone,    that   statement    might    well    constitute       an   unspecified\n\nboast, and hence puffing.        In context, however, the statement\n\ninvites   consumers    to    compare    Ace's       whitening    power    against\n\neither other detergents acting alone or detergents used with\n\nchlorine bleach.      Despite this ambiguity, it is a specific,\n\nmeasurable claim, and hence not puffing.\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\f          Proctor & Gamble's promotional brochure, on the other\n\nhand, contained statements like, \"hit the white spot with just\n\none shot,\" \"Dare to pass the test.           Wash with Ace and nothing\n\nelse,\" \"Say goodbye to the complications of cloro and other\n\ncleaners,\" and \"Resist the 'bombs.' Put your ACE con Blanqueador\n\nto the test.\"   We agree with Proctor & Gamble that each of these\n\nstatements, viewed in isolation, is precisely the type of vague,\n\nunspecified boasting that typifies puffery.            Nonetheless, the\n\npromotional brochure also states, \"Whiter is not possible,\" the\n\nsame statement that appears as the tag line on the original\n\nDoorstep Challenge television commercials.          As in the television\n\ncommercials,    that   statement       may     be    literally    false.\n\nAccordingly, the brochure cannot be dismissed as mere puffery.\n\n                                III.\n\n          Pursuant to § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, Clorox has\n\nstated a claim for literal falsity relating to the name of the\n\nAce liquid detergent, \"Ace con Blanqueador.\"            Clorox has also\n\nstated claims for literal falsity and for misleading advertising\n\nwith respect to the commercials aired in both the original and\n\nmodified Doorstep Challenge advertising campaigns, as well as\n\nthe   promotional   brochure.      The   district      court   erred   by\n\ndismissing these claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).               We must\n\nvacate its judgment and remand the Lanham Act claims to the\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fdistrict court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\ndecision.13\n\n           Clorox has also appealed the dismissal of its claim\n\npursuant   to   Article   1802   of   the   Puerto   Rico   Civil   Code.\n\nAlthough Clorox in its Second Amended Complaint sought to have\n\nthe alleged violation of the Lanham Act added as a predicate for\n\nliability under Article 1802, the motion for leave to file the\n\nsecond amended complaint was still pending at the time Clorox's\n\ncase was dismissed.    Accordingly, the district court never ruled\n\non that motion, and hence Clorox's Article 1802 claim predicated\n\non a violation of the Lanham Act is not properly before us at\n\nthis time.14    On remand, Clorox should be given the opportunity\n\nto resubmit its motion for leave to amend.\n\n           Vacated and remanded to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n     13   We did not deal with every statement alleged by Clorox\nto be false and misleading. The effect of the district court's\ndecision was to dismiss the Lanham Act claim in its entirety.\nIf any specific allegation in the complaint does not justify\nthat outcome, we must vacate. We have chosen to focus in this\nappeal on what seem to be the most important of Clorox's\nallegations. That focus does not mean that we are deciding the\nmerits of any of the allegations by Clorox not addressed in this\ndecision.\n     14   For the same reason, we also decline to express any\nopinion on the validity of Clorox's claims in its Second Amended\nComplaint relating to Proctor & Gamble's September 1998 Ace con\nBlanqueador advertising campaign.\n\n                                 -34-\n\f",

The Clorox Company Puerto Rico cried foul, complaining that no detergent brings out the white like its chlorine bleach when used with a detergent. Proctor &amp; Gamble modified its pitch, inviting consumers to \"Compare con su detergente . . . Mas blanco no se puede\" (Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible). Unimpressed by this change, Clorox sued, alleging, inter alia, that the advertisements were false and misleading in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).

See Langadinos v. American Airlines, Inc., 199 F.3d 68, 69 (1st Cir. 2000). In 1989, Proctor &amp; Gamble introduced in Puerto Rico Ace con Blanqueador, a powdered laundry detergent that contains a non-chlorine whitening agent described as a \"color-safe oxygen bleach\" with a patented \"activator,\" the same formula used in powdered Tide with Bleach marketed in the continental United States. In 1997, Proctor &amp; Gamble introduced a liquid version of Ace containing a \"compound of high levels of sulfactants and enzymes which function as a whitener and a color enhancer,\" the same formula used in liquid Tide with Bleach Alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Original Doorstep Challenge Campaign</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proctor &amp; Gamble conducted some consumer studies in 1997 and determined that an obstacle to obtaining an enhanced market share for Ace con Blanqueador was the public's perception that chlorine bleach was necessary to get clothes white. Using this new information, Proctor &amp; Gamble implemented an advertising campaign to counter the perception of consumers that chlorine bleach was necessary, and to convince them that Ace was a superior option to using a lower-priced detergent in conjunction with chlorine bleach. This \"Doorstep Challenge\" included a series of television advertisements in which Francisco Zamora, a television celebrity in Puerto Rico, visited women in their homes to ask them about their laundry practices and to elicit their praise for Ace. In the commercials depicting powdered Ace, the overriding theme was that chlorine bleach was not necessary to get clothes white if washed with Ace. The commercials pitching liquid Ace also emphasized its enhanced whitening capacity, but did not specifically mention chlorine bleach. Each commercial closed with the tag line, \"Whiter is not possible,\" a slogan Proctor &amp; Gamble had been using since powdered Ace arrived on the market in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For instance, the \"Evelyn\" commercial for powdered Ace went as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Francisco: Do you use Ace?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She: No . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fco: What is your laundry routine?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She: I put in the three detergents I use, I throw in a bit of chlorine and I let it soak until the next day.

The first page of the brochure depicted a bowling ball imprinted with the word \"Ace\" standing in front of several bowling pins that resembled Clorox bottles. The caption read: \"Da en el blanco con una sola tirada,\" (hit the [white] spot with just one shot). The second and third pages of the brochure contained additional pictures surrounded by punchy statements in Spanish like, \"Dare to pass the test. Wash with Ace and nothing else,\" \"Say goodbye to the complications of chlorine and other cleaners,\" and \"Resist the 'bombs.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Put your ACE con Blanqueador to the test.\" Like the television commercials, the brochure ended with the tag line, \"Whiter is not possible!\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Modified Campaign</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1998, the Clorox Company, which markets in Puerto Rico a brand of chlorine-based liquid bleach called Clorox, sent a letter to Proctor &amp; Gamble complaining that the Doorstep Challenge campaign was false and misleading, and demanding that Proctor &amp; Gamble stop running the television advertisements. Although Proctor &amp; Gamble would not alter the theme of its advertising, it agreed to soften the tag line by adding the qualification, \"compare with your detergent,\" before the phrase \"whiter is not possible.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The qualification did not satisfy Clorox. In March 1998, Clorox filed this lawsuit, alleging in its complaint violations of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a), the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c), the Federal Trade Commission Act and regulations, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 45(a), Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31 &#167; 5141, and regulations issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs (\"DACO\"). Clorox later amended the complaint by dropping the claims pled under the FTC Act and the FTC and DACO regulations, and adding a claim under Article 1802 predicated solely on Proctor &amp; Gamble's alleged violations of those laws and regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Proctor &amp; Gamble moved to dismiss all of the claims except the Lanham Act claim. Clorox then sought leave to amend the complaint again to add Proctor &amp; Gamble's alleged violation of the Lanham Act as another predicate for its Article 1802 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox sought to permanently enjoin Proctor &amp; Gamble from \"making any claims that Ace gets clothes 'the whitest possible,' without the use of Clorox.\" (Emphasis in original). Additionally, Clorox sought damages and attorneys' fees under &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Finally, Clorox moved for a preliminary injunction on its Lanham Act claim. In connection with the motion for a preliminary injunction, the parties conducted document production and depositions and submitted to the court relevant evidentiary materials, including consumer surveys, statements of experts, and the testimony of various witnesses. The district court did not hear oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, while Clorox's motion to amend its amended complaint and its motion for preliminary injunction were pending, the district court granted Proctor &amp; Gamble's motion to dismiss both the Dilution Act and Article 1802 claims. Additionally, the district court dismissed the Lanham Act claim sua sponte. This appeal followed, limited to the dismissal of the Lanham Act and Article 1802 claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Sua Sponte Dismissal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's dismissal of Clorox's Lanham Act claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). See Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998). We will affirm the dismissal of the complaint if, and only if, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the complaint \"fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). That is, the complaint is properly dismissed only when the allegations are such that \"the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to support [the] claim for relief.\" Rockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts must move cautiously when dismissing a complaint sua sponte. See, e.g., Baker v. Cuomo, 58 F.3d 814, 818 (2d Cir. 1995). Although it is occasionally appropriate for a district court to \"note the inadequacy of the complaint and, on its own initiative, dismiss the complaint[,] a court may not do so without at least giving plaintiffs notice of the proposed action and affording them an opportunity to address the issue.\" Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, 482 F.2d 372, 374 (1st Cir. 1973)). See also Perez v. Ortiz, 849 F.2d 793, 797 (2d Cir. 1988) (noting that \"the general rule is that a 'district court has no authority to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard'\"). Clorox was given no opportunity to argue the validity of its claim to the district court. Moreover, the court's dismissal was done in the face of Proctor &amp; Gamble's acknowledgment that \"the complaint states a claim under the federal false advertising statute[--]Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.\" Clorox had no reason to suspect, therefore, that its Lanham Act claim was in danger of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are limited exceptions to the general rule barring dismissal without notice, applicable to frivolous claims or to claims whose defects could not be cured by amendment. See Wyatt, 35 F.3d at 15 n.1 (noting that reversal of a sua sponte dismissal without notice may not be \"mandated if amendment [of the complaint] would be futile or if it is patently obvious that the plaintiff could not prevail\"); Street v. Fair, 918 F.2d 269, 272 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam) (noting that procedural protections may be unnecessary when the court dismisses in forma pauperis actions as frivolous). As our discussion infra indicates, Clorox's Lanham Act claim does not fall within any of these exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing the procedural vulnerability of the court's dismissal, Proctor &amp; Gamble points out that Clorox submitted substantial evidence in conjunction with its complaint and its preliminary injunction motion--evidence that the district court presumably could have used to convert, sua sponte, a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See 5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1366, at 470 (West Supp. 2000) (explaining that it may be appropriate for a court to convert a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment sua sponte when parties offer material outside of the pleadings in conjunction with a motion to dismiss). Proctor &amp; Gamble now urges us to treat the district court's ruling as a summary judgment, inviting us to affirm on any alternative ground supported by a full examination of the record. See Frillz, Inc. v. Lader, 104 F.3d 515, 516 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that we may \"affirm an entry of summary judgment on any alternative ground made manifest by the record\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several problems with this approach. Even if we were to agree that it would have been appropriate for the district court to consider material outside the pleadings in connection with its sua sponte dismissal of the Lanham Act claim, this is not what the district court did. The court's opinion and order sets forth its analysis in a section entitled \"Motion to Dismiss,\" which it prefaces with a discussion of the 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss standards. The court expressly grants \"Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\" More significantly, the district court did not conduct the searching review of the record necessary to rule on summary judgment. See Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that the test for deciding whether a district court's ruling is a 12(b)(6) dismissal or an entry of summary judgment is \"whether the court actually took cognizance of\" supplementary materials). The district court looked only to the face of the complaint. It did not purport to dismiss Clorox's Lanham Act claim based on an evaluation of the record as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Proctor &amp; Gamble's suggestion fails to address the fundamental problem with the district court's sua sponte actions: the failure to give Clorox notice and an opportunity to be heard. Even if the district court had converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment--which it did not--such conversion usually requires that \"all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). Although we do not \"mechanically enforce the requirement of express notice of a district court's intention to convert a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment,\" we do guard against allowing such a conversion where it would come as a \"surprise\" or be \"unfair\" to the party against whom judgment is rendered. Chaparro-Febus v. International Longshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575, 983 F.2d 325, 332 (1st Cir. 1992). In light of Proctor &amp; Gamble's acknowledgment that the complaint stated a claim under &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act, the district court's conversion without notice would have been both surprising and unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would only compound the unfairness to Clorox if we accepted the invitation of Proctor &amp; Gamble to indulge the fiction that the district court's ruling was a summary judgment determination and then affirm on any basis that seems appropriate. Clorox has now tailored its appellate advocacy to address the legal standards that it reasonably expected would govern this appeal--i.e., the standards governing review of a 12(b)(6) dismissal. Clorox has never had an adequate opportunity to argue the relationship between the record evidence and its Lanham Act claim. Also, it would be imprudent to evaluate the voluminous filings in this case in light of the summary judgment standard without advocacy from both parties on the relationship between this evidence and the legal standards governing liability under the Lanham Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our refusal to review the entire record based upon summary judgment standards does not mean, however, that we will not examine any of the filings in this case. The record includes hundreds of pages of exhibits appended to the various complaints and submitted in support of motions to dismiss and motions for and against a preliminary injunction. These exhibits include the full text of the advertising copy, internal company memoranda, letters exchanged between the parties, market research and consumer survey data, and declarations and deposition testimony of experts and other witnesses. Although much of the evidence contained in the record is out-of-bounds in reviewing a 12(b)(6) dismissal, it is well-established that in reviewing the complaint, we \"may properly consider the relevant entirety of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint, even though not attached to the complaint, without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.\" Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1220 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that the main problem of looking to documents outside the complaint--lack of notice to plaintiff--is dissipated \"[w]here plaintiff has actual notice . . . and has relied upon these documents in framing the complaint\")). \"Were the rule otherwise, a plaintiff could maintain a claim . . . by excising an isolated statement from a document and importing it into the complaint . . . .\" Id.; see also Northern Indiana Gun &amp; Outdoor Shows, Inc. v. City of South Bend, 163 F.3d 449, 454 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"It is a well-settled rule that when a written instrument contradicts allegations in the complaint to which it is attached, the exhibit trumps the allegations.\"). Accordingly, in determining whether Clorox has stated a claim for relief for false advertising, we read the allegations in the complaint in light of the full text of the advertising copy contained in the record. We limit our evaluation of material outside the complaint to the advertisement copy because that is the only material we deem \"integral\" to assessing the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing our discussion of the sua sponte dismissal, we must reiterate that basic fairness and sound prudential reasons underlie our insistence on the involvement of the parties in any dismissal. \"[A]dequate notice helps the court secure a just determination, by giving parties moved against the opportunity to present their best arguments in opposition.\" Perez, 849 F.2d at 797 (internal citations and quotations omitted). This case aptly illustrates the wisdom of that insistence. The relationship between the allegations in the complaint and the Lanham Act false advertising claim is complex and contested. By dismissing Clorox's Lanham Act claim without the benefit of the parties' advocacy in addressing these complex issues, the district court misunderstood the relationship between the allegations in Clorox's complaint and the relevant legal standards. We turn now to those standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Lanham Act False Advertising Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The false advertising prong of the Lanham Act provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> A plaintiff can succeed on a false advertising claim by proving either that an advertisement is false on its face or that the advertisement is literally true or ambiguous but likely to mislead and confuse consumers. See Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 1997); Castrol, Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., 987 F.2d 939, 943 (3d Cir. 1993); Abbott Labs. v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co., 971 F.2d 6, 13 (7th Cir. 1992). If the advertisement is literally false, the court may grant relief without considering evidence of consumer reaction. See United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co., 140 F.3d 1175, 1180 (8th Cir. 1998). In the absence of such literal falsity, an additional burden is placed upon the plaintiff to show that the advertisement, though explicitly true, nonetheless conveys a misleading message to the viewing public. See Sandoz Pharms. Corp. v. Richardson- Vicks, Inc., 902 F.2d 222, 228-29 (3d Cir. 1990). To satisfy its burden, the plaintiff must show how consumers have actually reacted to the challenged advertisement rather than merely demonstrating how they could have reacted. See id. at 229.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox's amended complaint alleged that Proctor &amp; Gamble's original and modified Doorstep Challenge television campaigns, as well as the promotional brochure, were false and misleading. Specifically, Clorox alleged that the Doorstep Challenge advertisements and promotions conveyed the false and misleading message to the Puerto Rican public that Ace con Blanqueador gets clothes as white or whiter than a detergent used with chlorine bleach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Clorox also alleged that the name \"Ace con Blanqueador\" is literally false with respect to Ace liquid detergent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis of the Lanham Act claim consisted of two paragraphs in which it reasoned that Clorox \"has failed to state a claim\" under the Lanham Act because it could not establish that Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertisements contained false or misleading statements. In particular, it found that the tag line appearing in the modified campaign commercials, \"Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible,\" was not false because it compared Ace only to other detergents, not to detergents used with chlorine bleach. The court also stated that, \"Ace's comparison claim\" was not actionable under the Lanham Act because it was \"mere puffing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's dismissal was erroneous for several reasons. First, it ignored many of the allegations on the face of the complaint. It did not address Clorox's allegations directed at the advertisements in the original Doorstep Challenge campaign, or the promotional brochure, nor did it address Clorox's allegation that the name \"Ace con Blanqueador\" as applied to the liquid detergent is literally false. Second, it applied an overly-restrictive view of the requirements for pleading a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act, dismissing the allegation that the modified campaign was not false or misleading simply because it found the tag line, read in isolation, to be literally true. Finally, the district court erred in concluding that Clorox's allegations were directed at non-actionable puffery. We analyze Clorox's various allegations de novo, see Beddall, 137 F.3d at 16, focusing on (1) the allegations of literal falsity, (2) the allegations of misleading advertising, and (3) the concept of \"puffery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Claims of Literal Falsity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox challenged two features of Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertising campaign as literally false. First, Clorox alleged that the television commercials that aired in the original and modified campaign claimed that Ace gets clothes as white or whiter than chlorine bleach. According to Clorox, that claim is literally false because tests prove that chlorine bleach whitens better than detergent used alone. Second, Clorox alleged that the name, \"Ace con Blanqueador,\" is literally false with respect to Ace liquid detergent because it falsely suggests that Ace liquid contains whitener or bleach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The Television Advertisements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether an advertisement is literally false is typically an issue of fact. See Mead Johnson &amp; Co. v. Abbott Labs., 209 F.3d 1032, 1034 (7th Cir. 2000) (denying petition for rehearing and amending prior panel opinion). At least two factual questions must be answered in evaluating the accuracy of any particular advertisement. First, a factfinder must determine the claim conveyed by the advertisement. See United Indus. Corp., 140 F.3d at 1181 (applying clearly erroneous standard to review of district court's factual determination regarding the claim conveyed by an advertisement for roach bait); Johnson &amp; Johnson v. GAC Int'l, Inc., 862 F.2d 975, 979 (2d Cir. 1988). Once the claim made by the advertisement has been determined, the factfinder must then evaluate whether that claim is false. See Castrol, 987 F.2d at 944.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the parties focus their attention solely upon the first of these factual determinations. The complaint asserts that in head-to-head whitening tests, Clorox achieved \"by far, superior results\" to Ace. Clorox also emphasizes that \"Ace's own boxes\" state that in certain cases, for better results, the consumers must use chlorine bleach. In reviewing the motion to dismiss, we therefore assume as true that chlorine bleach whitens better than Ace and that a contrary claim would be literally false. The primary dispute between the parties is not which product whitens better,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> but rather whether any of Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertisements make a claim of whitening superiority over chlorine bleach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although factfinders usually base literal falsity determinations upon the explicit claims made by an advertisement, they may also consider any claims the advertisement conveys by \"necessary implication.\" See Southland Sod Farms, 108 F.3d at 1139; Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 129. A claim is conveyed by necessary implication when, considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated. For instance, a factfinder found that an advertisement that claimed a motor oil provided \"longer engine life and better engine protection\" without explicitly mentioning competitors nonetheless drew a comparison by necessary implication vis aa vis those competitors. See Castrol, 987 F.2d at 941, 946. This is not to say, however, that all messages implied by an advertisement will support a finding of literal falsity by a factfinder:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The greater the degree to which a message relies upon the viewer or consumer to integrate its components and draw the apparent conclusion, however, the less likely it is that a finding of literal falsity will be supported. Commercial claims that are implicit, attenuated, or merely suggestive usually cannot fairly be characterized as literally false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United Indus. Corp., 140 F.3d at 1181. Similarly, a factfinder might conclude that the message conveyed by a particular advertisement remains so balanced between several plausible meanings that the claim made by the advertisement is too uncertain to serve as the basis of a literal falsity claim, though even in that case it could still form the basis for a claim that the advertisement is misleading. See id. at 1182; Abbott Labs., 971 F.2d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the dismissal in the present case, however, we are not required to determine what claim was actually conveyed by the advertisements because we are not factfinders. Instead, we must evaluate whether the complaint, as supplemented by the advertising copy, alleges facts that would allow a rational factfinder to conclude that Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertisements make a superiority claim either explicitly or by necessary implication. We must draw all reasonable inferences as to the claim made in the advertisements in favor of Clorox. See Southland Sod Farms, 108 F.3d at 1139; see also Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 129; U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Blue Cross, 898 F.2d 914, 922 (3d Cir. 1990). Dismissal would only be proper if no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the advertisements, viewed in the light most favorable to Clorox, make a claim of whitening superiority for Proctor &amp; Gamble's product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Clorox has stated a claim that Proctor &amp; Gamble's original Doorstep Challenge commercials are literally false. These commercials juxtapose a tag line, \"Whiter is not possible,\" with images of consumers who normally used bleach to achieve white clothes and who are favorably impressed by the results obtained from using Ace alone. The overall theme of the commercials is that bleach is unnecessary if clothes are washed with Ace, and, in fact, many of the consumers visited by Zamora are congratulated at the end of the commercials for passing \"the Ace whiteness challenge without chlorine.\" Some of the commercials also suggest that eliminating chlorine from the laundry process will save consumers time or money, or curtail the negative side effects of washing clothes with chlorine. A factfinder could reasonably conclude that, viewed in their entirety, these advertisements claim that Ace is equal or superior in whitening ability to a detergent and bleach combination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The modified Doorstep Challenge campaign continued the same visual comparisons, as well as the congratulatory comments for passing the \"Ace whiteness challenge without chlorine,\" but added the words \"Compare your detergent\" to the \"Whiter is not possible\" tag line shown at the bottom of the screen at the end of the commercials. Although this change may render the comparative claim of the advertisements more ambiguous, we nonetheless conclude that it remains reasonable to interpret these advertisements as making by necessary implication a superiority claim for Ace over chlorine bleach. Consequently, the court erred in dismissing Clorox's literal falsity claims with respect to both Doorstep Challenge campaigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The Name \"Ace con Blanqueador\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox also alleged that the name, \"Ace con Blanqueador,\" as applied to liquid Ace, is literally false. According to Clorox, the word \"blanqueador\" implies that liquid Ace has whitening capabilities like bleach. Clorox alleged that this is literally false because in its liquid form Ace does not contain bleach or whitening agents. Instead, it contains only a \"color enhancer.\" Clorox emphasizes that liquid Ace uses the same formula as \"Tide with Bleach Alternative\" whose name, unlike \"blanqueador,\" clearly signifies the absence of bleach. Proctor &amp; Gamble responds that \"blanqueador\" means \"whitener,\" and that the name cannot be literally false because tests show that the agents added to liquid Ace produce greater whiteness than detergents without those agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox's allegations about the use of the name \"Ace con Blanqueador\" for the liquid detergent state a claim for literal falsity. Although \"blanqueador,\" meaning \"whitener,\" is broad enough to encompass both bleach and non-bleach whitening agents, the question remains whether liquid Ace is properly described as containing \"whitening agents\" of any sort. Clorox has alleged that it is not, insisting that Ace's ingredients are properly termed \"color enhancers.\" Although the distinction between a \"whitening agent\" and a \"color enhancer\" eludes us, we must credit that allegation in this appeal from a 12(b)(6) dismissal. If Clorox succeeds in proving that liquid Ace contains only an \"enhancer,\" rather than a \"whitener,\" and if it further establishes the other elements of a false advertising claim, see supra note 6, it will be entitled to relief under the Lanham Act because Proctor &amp; Gamble's designation of Ace liquid detergent as \"Ace con Blanqueador\" would be literally false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Claims of Misleading Advertising</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to its claims of literal falsity, Clorox has alleged in its complaint that the Ace advertising campaign, even if true or ambiguous, makes an implied claim that is misleading to consumers. This second theory of recovery under the Lanham Act is independent of a literal falsity theory. See, e.g., Coca-Cola, Co. v. Tropicana Prods., Inc., 690 F.2d 312, 317 (2d Cir. 1982). Unlike the requirements of a claim of literal falsity, the plaintiff alleging a misleading advertisement has the burden of proving that a substantial portion of the audience for that advertisement was actually misled. See Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 134 (citing U.S. Healthcare v. Blue Cross, 898 F.2d 914, 922 (3d Cir. 1990)). An advertisement's propensity to deceive the viewing public is most often proven by consumer survey data. See id. at 129-30.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Clorox appended to the amended complaint a consumer survey prepared by David Whitehouse of Gaither International/Puerto Rico, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The survey consisted of a series of open-ended questions followed by several follow-up probes. In reliance on the survey, the complaint alleges that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In open-ended questions, 35% of respondents of its scientifically valid survey responded that the main message of the Doorstep Challenge Campaign was that, with ACE, there is no need to use other products for maximum whitening performance. In addition, when the respondents were asked if 'the Detergent in the Ad (ACE) Leaves Clothes as White or Whiter than If One Uses Bleach,' 47% totally agreed and 20% somewhat agreed with that statement. Plainly, the Doorstep Challenge Campaign has been amply shown to be likely to cause consumer deception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox has also alleged in its complaint that \"in its promotional activities and advertisements,\" Proctor &amp; Gamble \"deceiv[ed] and confus[ed] the public, causing consumers to wrongly believe they are buying a detergent that possesses the same qualities and characteristics as a detergent used with CLOROX.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was required to credit Clorox's allegations. It could not conduct its own evaluation of the advertising copy because whether advertising is misleading depends on \"what message was actually conveyed to the viewing audience.\" Smithkline Beecham Corp., 960 F.2d at 298; see also Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 129. In deciding whether a message is \"misleading,\" the message conveyed is discerned by \"public reaction,\" not by judicial evaluation. McCarthy &#167; 27:56; see also Castrol, 987 F.2d at 947 (\"[I]n cases where the issue is whether a statement . . . has a tendency to mislead, confuse, or deceive . . . [,] the court's reaction is at best not determinative and at worst irrelevant.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). That is, absent some other defect in its proof of the elements of a false advertising claim, see supra note 6, if Clorox's consumer survey data (or Proctor &amp; Gamble's own market research data) shows that the advertisements \"deceive[d] a substantial portion of the intended audience,\" U.S. Healthcare, 898 F.2d at 922, Clorox is entitled to relief under the Lanham Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Hence, the claims asserting misleading advertising were improperly dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proctor &amp; Gamble offers one last defense of the court's ruling, pointing to Mead Johnson &amp; Co. v. Abbott Labs., 201 F.3d 883, modified by, 209 F.3d 1032 (7th Cir. 2000) as a case that stands for the proposition that \"a consumer survey could not be used to show that an advertisement that is clear and unequivocal on its face otherwise conveyed a misleading message.\" According to Proctor &amp; Gamble, its tag line in the modified campaign \"clearly and unequivocally\" does not compare Ace with Clorox and, therefore, Mead Johnson prevents Clorox from using a survey to prove that a comparison was made. We need not decide whether we would agree with Mead Johnson in a factually similar case. This case is of a different order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mead Johnson addressed whether a label was misleading in claiming its product to be the \"1st Choice of Doctors.\" See 201 F.3d at 883-84. The plaintiff argued that its surveys demonstrated that consumers interpreted \"first\" to mean that \"more than 50%\" of doctors preferred that brand rather than interpreting \"first\" to mean that a plurality of doctors preferred the brand. See id. at 884-85. These distinctions were important because, though the latter interpretation of the label was true, the former was false. See id. at 884.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After first finding the plaintiff's survey \"misleading if not meaningless,\" the court identified a \"deeper problem: the use of a survey in the first place.\" Id. at 885. Although agreeing that surveys are \"accepted ways to probe for things such as confusion about the source of goods, for confusion depends on the effect of a phrase or trade dress on the consumer,\" the court reasoned that surveys should not be used \"to determine the meaning of words, or to set the standard to which objectively verifiable claims must be held.\" Id. at 886. Based upon these objections, the court held that the survey could not \"support a conclusion . . . that [the message conveyed by the advertisement] either was false or implied a falsehood.\" Mead Johnson, 209 F.3d at 1034.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Procedurally, Mead Johnson is different than this case. That court's evaluation of the merits of the survey was based on a record established during a three day hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, which was granted. See Mead Johnson, 201 F.3d at 884. As noted, see supra note 12, it would not be appropriate to undertake a similar analysis of the Clorox survey on the limited record subject to review after a 12(b)(6) dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, the advertising slogan in Mead Johnson was a single phrase printed on the label of a can of infant formula. Proctor &amp; Gamble points us to a similar phrase in its advertising, the tag line \"Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible,\" as though the two slogans were comparable. Proctor &amp; Gamble's tag line, however, is an integral part of a television commercial with substantial text and images. There is a fundamental difference between a slogan on a can label that communicates its meaning to consumers solely through the printed text, and a tag line shown on the screen at the end of a television commercial that communicates its message to consumers through a combination of audio-visual and textual media. Because we decline to read Proctor &amp; Gamble's tag line separately from the entirety of the commercials, Mead Johnson is factually inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Puffery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the statements, \"Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible,\" and \"Whiter is not possible,\" are not non-actionable puffing. \"'Puffing' is exaggerated advertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no reasonable buyer would rely . . . .\" McCarthy &#167; 27:38. \"A specific and measurable advertisement claim of product superiority . . . is not puffery.\" Southland Sod Farms, 108 F.3d at 1145 (claim that turfgrass seed requires \"50% less mowing\" was not puffery); see also Castrol, Inc., 987 F.2d at 946 (claim that motor oil provides \"longer engine life and better engine protection\" was not puffery). Whether the \"Doorstep Challenge\" campaign conveys the message that Ace gets clothes whiter than chlorine bleach, or compares Ace with other detergents without implying that it whitens better than chlorine bleach, the claim is specific and measurable, not the kind of vague or subjective statement that characterizes puffery. Indeed, Proctor &amp; Gamble concedes in its brief that its claim in its modified campaign, \"Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible,\" is not puffery. It contends that it is a true statement supported by its studies comparing Ace con Blanqueador with other detergents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original campaign tag line, \"Whiter is not possible,\" is a closer call on the puffing issue. Standing alone, that statement might well constitute an unspecified boast, and hence puffing. In context, however, the statement invites consumers to compare Ace's whitening power against either other detergents acting alone or detergents used with chlorine bleach. Despite this ambiguity, it is a specific, measurable claim, and hence not puffing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proctor &amp; Gamble's promotional brochure, on the other hand, contained statements like, \"hit the white spot with just one shot,\" \"Dare to pass the test. Wash with Ace and nothing else,\" \"Say goodbye to the complications of cloro and other cleaners,\" and \"Resist the 'bombs.' Put your ACE con Blanqueador to the test.\" We agree with Proctor &amp; Gamble that each of these statements, viewed in isolation, is precisely the type of vague, unspecified boasting that typifies puffery. Nonetheless, the promotional brochure also states, \"Whiter is not possible,\" the same statement that appears as the tag line on the original Doorstep Challenge television commercials. As in the television commercials, that statement may be literally false. Accordingly, the brochure cannot be dismissed as mere puffery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act, Clorox has stated a claim for literal falsity relating to the name of the Ace liquid detergent, \"Ace con Blanqueador.\" Clorox has also stated claims for literal falsity and for misleading advertising with respect to the commercials aired in both the original and modified Doorstep Challenge advertising campaigns, as well as the promotional brochure. The district court erred by dismissing these claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). We must vacate its judgment and remand the Lanham Act claims to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox has also appealed the dismissal of its claim pursuant to Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code. Although Clorox in its Second Amended Complaint sought to have the alleged violation of the Lanham Act added as a predicate for liability under Article 1802, the motion for leave to file the second amended complaint was still pending at the time Clorox's case was dismissed. Accordingly, the district court never ruled on that motion, and hence Clorox's Article 1802 claim predicated on a violation of the Lanham Act is not properly before us at this time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> On remand, Clorox should be given the opportunity to resubmit its motion for leave to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The combination of detergent and chlorine bleach is called \"la bomba\" in Puerto Rico.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For advertisements depicting liquid detergent, the new tag line read, \"Compare con su detergente liquido . . .

See Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co. v.

Unlike the Dilution Act claim, therefore, the false advertising claim is not directed at a dilution, disparagement, tarnishment, or diminishment of Clorox's brand name. That is, Clorox alleged that it was false and misleading to claim the superiority of Ace over chlorine bleach, generically, not Clorox bleach, in particular. To the extent that such false advertising would lead to a reduction in market share for Clorox as the leading producer of chlorine-based \"cleansing bleach\" in Puerto Rico (Clorox alleged that it controls 74% of the Puerto Rican market), Clorox may be in a position to show that it was significantly damaged by false claims of superiority with respect to chlorine bleach.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Proctor &amp; Gamble does not challenge on appeal Clorox's assertion that chlorine bleach in combination with a detergent gets clothes whiter than its Ace detergent.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In some circuits, if the defendant \"intentionally set out to deceive the public,\" using \"deliberate conduct\" of an \"egregious nature\" in light of the advertising culture of the marketplace in which the defendant competes, a presumption arises that customers were, in fact, deceived, dispensing with the need for the plaintiff to commission a consumer survey. See Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 131-32; Johnson &amp; Johnson*Merck Consumer Pharms. Co. v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 960 F.2d 294, 298-99 (2d Cir. 1992); McCarthy &#167; 27:58. Because Clorox has proffered a consumer survey, we need not decide whether Clorox's allegations that Proctor &amp; Gamble intentionally acted in bad faith creates a presumption of consumer deception.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In addition to its own survey, Clorox contends that Proctor &amp; Gamble's market research, commissioned three months into the Doorstep Challenge campaign, demonstrates that consumers have been misled.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Although we have quoted Clorox's allegations relying on the results of its own consumer survey, we do not mean to suggest that a Lanham Act plaintiff must identify the particular consumer survey that will be used to support its allegations to survive a motion to dismiss. For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, a court must credit the type of allegations of misleading advertising set forth here. Obviously, if confronted with a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff can no longer rest on the allegations in the complaint.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Proctor &amp; Gamble vigorously disputes the validity of Clorox's survey. In opposing Clorox's motion for a preliminary injunction, Proctor &amp; Gamble supplied its own expert, Dr. Michael Rappeport, who testified that the responses to the open-ended questions in Clorox's survey do not \"by any stretch of the imagination\" show that the commercial's message was that there is no need to use products other than Ace con Blanqueador for maximum whitening performance. Dr. Rappeport concluded, moreover, that the methodology used to conduct the survey was \"so biased as to have no value whatsoever.\" Proctor &amp; Gamble also argues that Clorox's own expert, Whitehouse, failed to vouch for the survey results when asked about it in his deposition. Finally, Proctor &amp; Gamble insists that even if the survey were valid, it tests only one advertisement, and therefore could not support Clorox's claim that the whole advertising campaign was misleading. We express no view on the merits of Proctor &amp; Gamble's arguments. The \"probative value of a consumer survey is a highly fact-specific determination,\" Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 19 F.3d at 134 (quotations omitted).

The Clorox Company Puerto Rico cried foul, complaining that no detergent brings out the white like its chlorine bleach when used with a detergent. Proctor &amp; Gamble modified its pitch, inviting consumers to \"Compare con su detergente . . . Mas blanco no se puede\" (Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible).

In 1989, Proctor &amp; Gamble introduced in Puerto Rico Ace con Blanqueador, a powdered laundry detergent that contains a non-chlorine whitening agent described as a \"color-safe oxygen bleach\" with a patented \"activator,\" the same formula used in powdered Tide with Bleach marketed in the continental United States. In 1997, Proctor &amp; Gamble introduced a liquid version of Ace containing a \"compound of high levels of sulfactants and enzymes which function as a whitener and a color enhancer,\" the same formula used in liquid Tide with Bleach Alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Original Doorstep Challenge Campaign</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proctor &amp; Gamble conducted some consumer studies in 1997 and determined that an obstacle to obtaining an enhanced market share for Ace con Blanqueador was the public's perception that chlorine bleach was necessary to get clothes white. Using this new information, Proctor &amp; Gamble implemented an advertising campaign to counter the perception of consumers that chlorine bleach was necessary, and to convince them that Ace was a superior option to using a lower-priced detergent in conjunction with chlorine bleach. This \"Doorstep Challenge\" included a series of television advertisements in which Francisco Zamora, a television celebrity in Puerto Rico, visited women in their homes to ask them about their laundry practices and to elicit their praise for Ace. In the commercials depicting powdered Ace, the overriding theme was that chlorine bleach was not necessary to get clothes white if washed with Ace. The commercials pitching liquid Ace also emphasized its enhanced whitening capacity, but did not specifically mention chlorine bleach. Each commercial closed with the tag line, \"Whiter is not possible,\" a slogan Proctor &amp; Gamble had been using since powdered Ace arrived on the market in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For instance, the \"Evelyn\" commercial for powdered Ace went as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Francisco: Do you use Ace?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She: No . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fco: What is your laundry routine?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She: I put in the three detergents I use, I throw in a bit of chlorine and I let it soak until the next day.

The first page of the brochure depicted a bowling ball imprinted with the word \"Ace\" standing in front of several bowling pins that resembled Clorox bottles. The caption read: \"Da en el blanco con una sola tirada,\" (hit the [white] spot with just one shot). The second and third pages of the brochure contained additional pictures surrounded by punchy statements in Spanish like, \"Dare to pass the test. Wash with Ace and nothing else,\" \"Say goodbye to the complications of chlorine and other cleaners,\" and \"Resist the 'bombs.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Put your ACE con Blanqueador to the test.\" Like the television commercials, the brochure ended with the tag line, \"Whiter is not possible!\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Modified Campaign</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1998, the Clorox Company, which markets in Puerto Rico a brand of chlorine-based liquid bleach called Clorox, sent a letter to Proctor &amp; Gamble complaining that the Doorstep Challenge campaign was false and misleading, and demanding that Proctor &amp; Gamble stop running the television advertisements. Although Proctor &amp; Gamble would not alter the theme of its advertising, it agreed to soften the tag line by adding the qualification, \"compare with your detergent,\" before the phrase \"whiter is not possible.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The qualification did not satisfy Clorox. In March 1998, Clorox filed this lawsuit, alleging in its complaint violations of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a), the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c), the Federal Trade Commission Act and regulations, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 45(a), Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31 &#167; 5141, and regulations issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs (\"DACO\"). Clorox later amended the complaint by dropping the claims pled under the FTC Act and the FTC and DACO regulations, and adding a claim under Article 1802 predicated solely on Proctor &amp; Gamble's alleged violations of those laws and regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Proctor &amp; Gamble moved to dismiss all of the claims except the Lanham Act claim. Clorox then sought leave to amend the complaint again to add Proctor &amp; Gamble's alleged violation of the Lanham Act as another predicate for its Article 1802 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox sought to permanently enjoin Proctor &amp; Gamble from \"making any claims that Ace gets clothes 'the whitest possible,' without the use of Clorox.\" (Emphasis in original). Additionally, Clorox sought damages and attorneys' fees under &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Finally, Clorox moved for a preliminary injunction on its Lanham Act claim. In connection with the motion for a preliminary injunction, the parties conducted document production and depositions and submitted to the court relevant evidentiary materials, including consumer surveys, statements of experts, and the testimony of various witnesses. The district court did not hear oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, while Clorox's motion to amend its amended complaint and its motion for preliminary injunction were pending, the district court granted Proctor &amp; Gamble's motion to dismiss both the Dilution Act and Article 1802 claims. Additionally, the district court dismissed the Lanham Act claim sua sponte. This appeal followed, limited to the dismissal of the Lanham Act and Article 1802 claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

We will affirm the dismissal of the complaint if, and only if, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the complaint \"fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

Clorox was given no opportunity to argue the validity of its claim to the district court. Moreover, the court's dismissal was done in the face of Proctor &amp; Gamble's acknowledgment that \"the complaint states a claim under the federal false advertising statute[--]Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.\" Clorox had no reason to suspect, therefore, that its Lanham Act claim was in danger of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are limited exceptions to the general rule barring dismissal without notice, applicable to frivolous claims or to claims whose defects could not be cured by amendment.

As our discussion infra indicates, Clorox's Lanham Act claim does not fall within any of these exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing the procedural vulnerability of the court's dismissal, Proctor &amp; Gamble points out that Clorox submitted substantial evidence in conjunction with its complaint and its preliminary injunction motion--evidence that the district court presumably could have used to convert, sua sponte, a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See 5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1366, at 470 (West Supp. 2000) (explaining that it may be appropriate for a court to convert a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment sua sponte when parties offer material outside of the pleadings in conjunction with a motion to dismiss). Proctor &amp; Gamble now urges us to treat the district court's ruling as a summary judgment, inviting us to affirm on any alternative ground supported by a full examination of the record. See Frillz, Inc. v. Lader, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197166\"><a href=\"/opinion/197166/frillz-v-lader/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 516 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that we may \"affirm an entry of summary judgment on any alternative ground made manifest by the record\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several problems with this approach. Even if we were to agree that it would have been appropriate for the district court to consider material outside the pleadings in connection with its sua sponte dismissal of the Lanham Act claim, this is not what the district court did. The court's opinion and order sets forth its analysis in a section entitled \"Motion to Dismiss,\" which it prefaces with a discussion of the 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss standards. The court expressly grants \"Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\" More significantly, the district court did not conduct the searching review of the record necessary to rule on summary judgment. See Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578672\"><a href=\"/opinion/578672/garita-hotel-limited-partnership-etc-v-ponce-federal-bank-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that the test for deciding whether a district court's ruling is a 12(b)(6) dismissal or an entry of summary judgment is \"whether the court actually took cognizance of\" supplementary materials). The district court looked only to the face of the complaint. It did not purport to dismiss Clorox's Lanham Act claim based on an evaluation of the record as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Proctor &amp; Gamble's suggestion fails to address the fundamental problem with the district court's sua sponte actions: the failure to give Clorox notice and an opportunity to be heard. Even if the district court had converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment--which it did not--such conversion usually requires that \"all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). Although we do not \"mechanically enforce the requirement of express notice of a district court's intention to convert a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment,\" we do guard against allowing such a conversion where it would come as a \"surprise\" or be \"unfair\" to the party against whom judgment is rendered. Chaparro-Febus v. International Longshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></span>, 332 (1st Cir. 1992). In light of Proctor &amp; Gamble's acknowledgment that the complaint stated a claim under &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act, the district court's conversion without notice would have been both surprising and unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would only compound the unfairness to Clorox if we accepted the invitation of Proctor &amp; Gamble to indulge the fiction that the district court's ruling was a summary judgment determination and then affirm on any basis that seems appropriate. Clorox has now tailored its appellate advocacy to address the legal standards that it reasonably expected would govern this appeal--i.e., the standards governing review of a 12(b)(6) dismissal. Clorox has never had an adequate opportunity to argue the relationship between the record evidence and its Lanham Act claim. Also, it would be imprudent to evaluate the voluminous filings in this case in light of the summary judgment standard without advocacy from both parties on the relationship between this evidence and the legal standards governing liability under the Lanham Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our refusal to review the entire record based upon summary judgment standards does not mean, however, that we will not examine any of the filings in this case. The record includes hundreds of pages of exhibits appended to the various complaints and submitted in support of motions to dismiss and motions for and against a preliminary injunction. These exhibits include the full text of the advertising copy, internal company memoranda, letters exchanged between the parties, market research and consumer survey data, and declarations and deposition testimony of experts and other witnesses. Although much of the evidence contained in the record is out-of-bounds in reviewing a 12(b)(6) dismissal, it is well-established that in reviewing the complaint, we \"may properly consider the relevant entirety of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint, even though not attached to the complaint, without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.\" Shaw v.

Accordingly, in determining whether Clorox has stated a claim for relief for false advertising, we read the allegations in the complaint in light of the full text of the advertising copy contained in the record. We limit our evaluation of material outside the complaint to the advertisement copy because that is the only material we deem \"integral\" to assessing the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing our discussion of the sua sponte dismissal, we must reiterate that basic fairness and sound prudential reasons underlie our insistence on the involvement of the parties in any dismissal. \"[A]dequate notice helps the court secure a just determination, by giving parties moved against the opportunity to present their best arguments in opposition.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507775\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Perez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/507775/gloria-perez-elizabeth-agosto-v-jesus-ortiz-philomena-lula-and-theodore/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">797</span> </a></span>(internal citations and quotations omitted). This case aptly illustrates the wisdom of that insistence. The relationship between the allegations in the complaint and the Lanham Act false advertising claim is complex and contested. By dismissing Clorox's Lanham Act claim without the benefit of the parties' advocacy in addressing these complex issues, the district court misunderstood the relationship between the allegations in Clorox's complaint and the relevant legal standards.

Specifically, Clorox alleged that the Doorstep Challenge advertisements and promotions conveyed the false and misleading message to the Puerto Rican public that Ace con Blanqueador gets clothes as white or whiter than a detergent used with chlorine bleach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Clorox also alleged that the name \"Ace con Blanqueador\" is literally false with respect to Ace liquid detergent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis of the Lanham Act claim consisted of two paragraphs in which it reasoned that Clorox \"has failed to state a claim\" under the Lanham Act because it could not establish that Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertisements contained false or misleading statements. In particular, it found that the tag line appearing in the modified campaign commercials, \"Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible,\" was not false because it compared Ace only to other detergents, not to detergents used with chlorine bleach. The court also stated that, \"Ace's comparison claim\" was not actionable under the Lanham Act because it was \"mere puffing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's dismissal was erroneous for several reasons. First, it ignored many of the allegations on the face of the complaint. It did not address Clorox's allegations directed at the advertisements in the original Doorstep Challenge campaign, or the promotional brochure, nor did it address Clorox's allegation that the name \"Ace con Blanqueador\" as applied to the liquid detergent is literally false. Second, it applied an overly-restrictive view of the requirements for pleading a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act, dismissing the allegation that the modified campaign was not false or misleading simply because it found the tag line, read in isolation, to be literally true. Finally, the district court erred in concluding that Clorox's allegations were directed at non-actionable puffery. We analyze Clorox's various allegations de novo, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197817\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Beddall,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197817/beddall-v-state-street-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, focusing on (1) the allegations of literal falsity, (2) the allegations of misleading advertising, and (3) the concept of \"puffery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Claims of Literal Falsity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox challenged two features of Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertising campaign as literally false. First, Clorox alleged that the television commercials that aired in the original and modified campaign claimed that Ace gets clothes as white or whiter than chlorine bleach. According to Clorox, that claim is literally false because tests prove that chlorine bleach whitens better than detergent used alone. Second, Clorox alleged that the name, \"Ace con Blanqueador,\" is literally false with respect to Ace liquid detergent because it falsely suggests that Ace liquid contains whitener or bleach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

See Mead Johnson &amp; Co. v. Abbott Labs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768395\"><a href=\"/opinion/768395/mead-johnson-co-v-abbott-laboratories/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span>, 1034 (7th Cir. 2000) (denying petition for rehearing and amending prior panel opinion). At least two factual questions must be answered in evaluating the accuracy of any particular advertisement. First, a factfinder must determine the claim conveyed by the advertisement. See United Indus. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1181</span> </span>(applying clearly erroneous standard to review of district court's factual determination regarding the claim conveyed by an advertisement for roach bait); Johnson &amp; Johnson v.

Once the claim made by the advertisement has been determined, the factfinder must then evaluate whether that claim is false. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601792\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Castrol,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/601792/castrol-inc-v-pennzoil-company-and-pennzoil-products-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the parties focus their attention solely upon the first of these factual determinations. The complaint asserts that in head-to-head whitening tests, Clorox achieved \"by far, superior results\" to Ace. Clorox also emphasizes that \"Ace's own boxes\" state that in certain cases, for better results, the consumers must use chlorine bleach. In reviewing the motion to dismiss, we therefore assume as true that chlorine bleach whitens better than Ace and that a contrary claim would be literally false. The primary dispute between the parties is not which product whitens better,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> but rather whether any of Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertisements make a claim of whitening superiority over chlorine bleach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although factfinders usually base literal falsity determinations upon the explicit claims made by an advertisement, they may also consider any claims the advertisement conveys by \"necessary implication.\" See Southland Sod <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737494\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Farms,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/737494/southland-sod-farms-pickseed-west-inc-v-stover-seed-co-warrens-turf/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1139</span></a></span>; Rhone-Poulenc <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rorer,</span> <span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">129</span></span>. A claim is conveyed by necessary implication when, considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated. For instance, a factfinder found that an advertisement that claimed a motor oil provided \"longer engine life and better engine protection\" without explicitly mentioning competitors nonetheless drew a comparison by necessary implication vis aa vis those competitors. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601792\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Castrol,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/601792/castrol-inc-v-pennzoil-company-and-pennzoil-products-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span>, 946. This is not to say, however, that all messages implied by an advertisement will support a finding of literal falsity by a factfinder:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The greater the degree to which a message relies upon the viewer or consumer to integrate its components and draw the apparent conclusion, however, the less likely it is that a finding of literal falsity will be supported. Commercial claims that are implicit, attenuated, or merely suggestive usually cannot fairly be characterized as literally false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United Indus. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span>. Similarly, a factfinder might conclude that the message conveyed by a particular advertisement remains so balanced between several plausible meanings that the claim made by the advertisement is too uncertain to serve as the basis of a literal falsity claim, though even in that case it could still form the basis for a claim that the advertisement is misleading. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1182; </span>Abbott <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587653\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Labs.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/587653/abbott-laboratories-v-mead-johnson-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the dismissal in the present case, however, we are not required to determine what claim was actually conveyed by the advertisements because we are not factfinders. Instead, we must evaluate whether the complaint, as supplemented by the advertising copy, alleges facts that would allow a rational factfinder to conclude that Proctor &amp; Gamble's advertisements make a superiority claim either explicitly or by necessary implication. We must draw all reasonable inferences as to the claim made in the advertisements in favor of Clorox.

Dismissal would only be proper if no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the advertisements, viewed in the light most favorable to Clorox, make a claim of whitening superiority for Proctor &amp; Gamble's product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Clorox has stated a claim that Proctor &amp; Gamble's original Doorstep Challenge commercials are literally false. These commercials juxtapose a tag line, \"Whiter is not possible,\" with images of consumers who normally used bleach to achieve white clothes and who are favorably impressed by the results obtained from using Ace alone. The overall theme of the commercials is that bleach is unnecessary if clothes are washed with Ace, and, in fact, many of the consumers visited by Zamora are congratulated at the end of the commercials for passing \"the Ace whiteness challenge without chlorine.\" Some of the commercials also suggest that eliminating chlorine from the laundry process will save consumers time or money, or curtail the negative side effects of washing clothes with chlorine. A factfinder could reasonably conclude that, viewed in their entirety, these advertisements claim that Ace is equal or superior in whitening ability to a detergent and bleach combination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The modified Doorstep Challenge campaign continued the same visual comparisons, as well as the congratulatory comments for passing the \"Ace whiteness challenge without chlorine,\" but added the words \"Compare your detergent\" to the \"Whiter is not possible\" tag line shown at the bottom of the screen at the end of the commercials. Although this change may render the comparative claim of the advertisements more ambiguous, we nonetheless conclude that it remains reasonable to interpret these advertisements as making by necessary implication a superiority claim for Ace over chlorine bleach. Consequently, the court erred in dismissing Clorox's literal falsity claims with respect to both Doorstep Challenge campaigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The Name \"Ace con Blanqueador\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox also alleged that the name, \"Ace con Blanqueador,\" as applied to liquid Ace, is literally false. According to Clorox, the word \"blanqueador\" implies that liquid Ace has whitening capabilities like bleach. Clorox alleged that this is literally false because in its liquid form Ace does not contain bleach or whitening agents. Instead, it contains only a \"color enhancer.\" Clorox emphasizes that liquid Ace uses the same formula as \"Tide with Bleach Alternative\" whose name, unlike \"blanqueador,\" clearly signifies the absence of bleach. Proctor &amp; Gamble responds that \"blanqueador\" means \"whitener,\" and that the name cannot be literally false because tests show that the agents added to liquid Ace produce greater whiteness than detergents without those agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox's allegations about the use of the name \"Ace con Blanqueador\" for the liquid detergent state a claim for literal falsity. Although \"blanqueador,\" meaning \"whitener,\" is broad enough to encompass both bleach and non-bleach whitening agents, the question remains whether liquid Ace is properly described as containing \"whitening agents\" of any sort. Clorox has alleged that it is not, insisting that Ace's ingredients are properly termed \"color enhancers.\" Although the distinction between a \"whitening agent\" and a \"color enhancer\" eludes us, we must credit that allegation in this appeal from a 12(b)(6) dismissal. If Clorox succeeds in proving that liquid Ace contains only an \"enhancer,\" rather than a \"whitener,\" and if it further establishes the other elements of a false advertising claim, see supra note 6, it will be entitled to relief under the Lanham Act because Proctor &amp; Gamble's designation of Ace liquid detergent as \"Ace con Blanqueador\" would be literally false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Claims of Misleading Advertising</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to its claims of literal falsity, Clorox has alleged in its complaint that the Ace advertising campaign, even if true or ambiguous, makes an implied claim that is misleading to consumers. This second theory of recovery under the Lanham Act is independent of a literal falsity theory. See, e.g., Coca-Cola, Co. v. Tropicana Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409416\"><a href=\"/opinion/409416/the-coca-cola-company-v-tropicana-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 317 (2d Cir. 1982). Unlike the requirements of a claim of literal falsity, the plaintiff alleging a misleading advertisement has the burden of proving that a substantial portion of the audience for that advertisement was actually misled. See Rhone-Poulenc <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rorer,</span> <span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">134</span> </span>(citing U.S. Healthcare v.

Whether the \"Doorstep Challenge\" campaign conveys the message that Ace gets clothes whiter than chlorine bleach, or compares Ace with other detergents without implying that it whitens better than chlorine bleach, the claim is specific and measurable, not the kind of vague or subjective statement that characterizes puffery. Indeed, Proctor &amp; Gamble concedes in its brief that its claim in its modified campaign, \"Compare with your detergent . . . Whiter is not possible,\" is not puffery. It contends that it is a true statement supported by its studies comparing Ace con Blanqueador with other detergents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original campaign tag line, \"Whiter is not possible,\" is a closer call on the puffing issue. Standing alone, that statement might well constitute an unspecified boast, and hence puffing. In context, however, the statement invites consumers to compare Ace's whitening power against either other detergents acting alone or detergents used with chlorine bleach. Despite this ambiguity, it is a specific, measurable claim, and hence not puffing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proctor &amp; Gamble's promotional brochure, on the other hand, contained statements like, \"hit the white spot with just one shot,\" \"Dare to pass the test. Wash with Ace and nothing else,\" \"Say goodbye to the complications of cloro and other cleaners,\" and \"Resist the 'bombs.' Put your ACE con Blanqueador to the test.\" We agree with Proctor &amp; Gamble that each of these statements, viewed in isolation, is precisely the type of vague, unspecified boasting that typifies puffery. Nonetheless, the promotional brochure also states, \"Whiter is not possible,\" the same statement that appears as the tag line on the original Doorstep Challenge television commercials. As in the television commercials, that statement may be literally false. Accordingly, the brochure cannot be dismissed as mere puffery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act, Clorox has stated a claim for literal falsity relating to the name of the Ace liquid detergent, \"Ace con Blanqueador.\" Clorox has also stated claims for literal falsity and for misleading advertising with respect to the commercials aired in both the original and modified Doorstep Challenge advertising campaigns, as well as the promotional brochure. The district court erred by dismissing these claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). We must vacate its judgment and remand the Lanham Act claims to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clorox has also appealed the dismissal of its claim pursuant to Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code. Although Clorox in its Second Amended Complaint sought to have the alleged violation of the Lanham Act added as a predicate for liability under Article 1802, the motion for leave to file the second amended complaint was still pending at the time Clorox's case was dismissed. Accordingly, the district court never ruled on that motion, and hence Clorox's Article 1802 claim predicated on a violation of the Lanham Act is not properly before us at this time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> On remand, Clorox should be given the opportunity to resubmit its motion for leave to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The combination of detergent and chlorine bleach is called \"la bomba\" in Puerto Rico.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For advertisements depicting liquid detergent, the new tag line read, \"Compare con su detergente liquido . . .

Unlike the Dilution Act claim, therefore, the false advertising claim is not directed at a dilution, disparagement, tarnishment, or diminishment of Clorox's brand name. That is, Clorox alleged that it was false and misleading to claim the superiority of Ace over chlorine bleach, generically, not Clorox bleach, in particular. To the extent that such false advertising would lead to a reduction in market share for Clorox as the leading producer of chlorine-based \"cleansing bleach\" in Puerto Rico (Clorox alleged that it controls 74% of the Puerto Rican market), Clorox may be in a position to show that it was significantly damaged by false claims of superiority with respect to chlorine bleach.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Proctor &amp; Gamble does not challenge on appeal Clorox's assertion that chlorine bleach in combination with a detergent gets clothes whiter than its Ace detergent.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In some circuits, if the defendant \"intentionally set out to deceive the public,\" using \"deliberate conduct\" of an \"egregious nature\" in light of the advertising culture of the marketplace in which the defendant competes, a presumption arises that customers were, in fact, deceived, dispensing with the need for the plaintiff to commission a consumer survey.

Because Clorox has proffered a consumer survey, we need not decide whether Clorox's allegations that Proctor &amp; Gamble intentionally acted in bad faith creates a presumption of consumer deception.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In addition to its own survey, Clorox contends that Proctor &amp; Gamble's market research, commissioned three months into the Doorstep Challenge campaign, demonstrates that consumers have been misled.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Although we have quoted Clorox's allegations relying on the results of its own consumer survey, we do not mean to suggest that a Lanham Act plaintiff must identify the particular consumer survey that will be used to support its allegations to survive a motion to dismiss. For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, a court must credit the type of allegations of misleading advertising set forth here. Obviously, if confronted with a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff can no longer rest on the allegations in the complaint.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Proctor &amp; Gamble vigorously disputes the validity of Clorox's survey. In opposing Clorox's motion for a preliminary injunction, Proctor &amp; Gamble supplied its own expert, Dr. Michael Rappeport, who testified that the responses to the open-ended questions in Clorox's survey do not \"by any stretch of the imagination\" show that the commercial's message was that there is no need to use products other than Ace con Blanqueador for maximum whitening performance. Dr. Rappeport concluded, moreover, that the methodology used to conduct the survey was \"so biased as to have no value whatsoever.\" Proctor &amp; Gamble also argues that Clorox's own expert, Whitehouse, failed to vouch for the survey results when asked about it in his deposition. Finally, Proctor &amp; Gamble insists that even if the survey were valid, it tests only one advertisement, and therefore could not support Clorox's claim that the whole advertising campaign was misleading. We express no view on the merits of Proctor &amp; Gamble's arguments. The \"probative value of a consumer survey is a highly fact-specific determination,\" Rhone-Poulenc <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rorer,</span> <span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">134</span> </span>(quotations omitted).

The effect of the district court's decision was to dismiss the Lanham Act claim in its entirety. If any specific allegation in the complaint does not justify that outcome, we must vacate. We have chosen to focus in this appeal on what seem to be the most important of Clorox's allegations. That focus does not mean that we are deciding the merits of any of the allegations by Clorox not addressed in this decision.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> For the same reason, we also decline to express any opinion on the validity of Clorox's claims in its Second Amended Complaint relating to Proctor &amp; Gamble's September 1998 Ace con Blanqueador advertising campaign.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
