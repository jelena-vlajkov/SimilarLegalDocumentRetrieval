We granted Juan Antonio\n\nMorales' petition for rehearing because in our original opinion,\n\nissued on October 19, 1999, we misstated in part the burden of\n\nproof required to prove a well-founded fear of persecution by\n\napplicants if they are deported to their homeland.    We stated:\n\n\n          To prove a well-founded fear of persecution,\n          the “applicant's fear must be both genuine\n          and objectively reasonable.” [Aguilar-Solis\n          v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999)]\n          (citing Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 5\n          (1st Cir. 1990)). The applicants must prove\n          that “it is more likely than not that they\n          will be persecuted if deported.”      INS v.\n          Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 450, 107\n          S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). “The BIA\n          and many courts of appeals (including this\n          court) narrow the relevant inquiry to\n          whether a reasonable person in the asylum\n          applicant's    circumstances    would   fear\n          persecution on account of a statutorily\n          protected ground.” Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d\n          at 572.\n\n\nMorales v. INS, 1999 WL 897658, at *6 (1st. Cir., Oct. 19, 1999)\n\n(withdrawn) (emphasis added).\n\n          We agree with the petitioner that in INS v. Cardoza-\n\nFonseca, the Court held the contrary of what we said it did.   It\n\nstated:\n\n          Whether or not a “refugee” is eventually\n          granted asylum is a matter which Congress\n          has left for the Attorney General to decide.\n          But it is clear that Congress did not intend\n          to restrict eligibility for that relief to\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            those who could prove that it is more likely\n            than not that they will be persecuted if\n            deported.\n\n480 U.S. at 450 (emphasis added).     Two issues were addressed in\n\nthe rehearing briefs: the burden of proof required for showing\n\na well-founded fear of persecution; and the application of the\n\ndoctrine of imputed political opinion.\n\n            At oral argument, petitioner argued the same issues he\n\nhad raised and argued the first time around and the government\n\nreplied in kind.     We think it advisable, therefore, to revisit\n\nall of the issues raised originally because they bear on the two\n\nissues before us.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Before we address the issues, we recount the background\n\nfacts.     Morales, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the\n\nUnited States without inspection on May 10, 1992.     On April 11,\n\n1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) issued\n\nan Order to Show Cause why Morales should not be deported.\n\nSubsequently, Morales filed a petition for political asylum.\n\nThe Immigration Judge (“IJ”) considered Morales' petition for\n\npolitical asylum to be a request for withholding of deportation\n\nas well.\n\n            In his affidavit in support of his application for\n\npolitical asylum, Morales alleged that he was persecuted in\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fGuatemala      because     of    his    association      with     a   labor    union.\n\nMorales   worked      as   a    machine     operator     for     Industria    Centro\n\nAmericana Debedrio, S.A. (“Cavisa”), in Guatemala City from 1980\n\nuntil 1990.      In 1990, the ownership of the company changed and\n\nthe   representatives           of   the   union      demanded    better      working\n\nconditions and higher pay.              When the demands were refused, the\n\nunion leaders declared a strike and the gates to the factory\n\nwere locked.     Morales was detained in the factory with the other\n\n700 workers until “[t]he gates were finally unlocked, and [he]\n\nmanaged to escape.”        The record reveals that although the strike\n\nlasted for at least several weeks, Morales was able to flee the\n\nfactory after he was there one week.\n\n            Although Morales never returned to the company, he\n\nclaimed that for the next two years, he “encountered problems\n\nbecause of [his] involvement in the labor dispute.”                     As already\n\nnoted, Morales left Guatemala and arrived in the United States\n\non May 10, 1992.         In his affidavit, Morales claimed that if he\n\nwere forced to return to Guatemala, he would be “persecuted\n\nbecause   of    the   mistaken         belief    by   Guatemalan      military   and\n\ngovernment authorities that [he] supported the labor unrest at\n\n[his] former job.”\n\n            After a hearing, the Immigration Judge determined that\n\nMorales was “only barely associated with the union” and his\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f“minimal involvement in the union” would not impute to him a\n\npolitical opinion that would be the basis for persecution.              The\n\nIJ also determined that “[i]f indeed the security forces of\n\nGuatemala wished to persecute or punish this gentleman, they\n\ncould have easily done so.”    The IJ denied Morales' application\n\nfor political asylum and withholding of deportation, but granted\n\nvoluntary departure in lieu of deportation.\n\n          Morales appealed the IJ's decision to the Board of\n\nImmigration   Appeals   (“BIA”),    arguing   that   the   IJ   erred   by\n\nconcluding that Morales did not establish eligibility for asylum\n\nand withholding of deportation.      Morales also argued that the IJ\n\ndenied him a fair trial, violating his right to due process.\n\nThe BIA dismissed the appeal, finding that Morales had not met\n\nhis burden of proving his eligibility for asylum and withholding\n\nof deportation and that his hearing met due process standards.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\nII.   DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS\n\n          Morales claims that he was denied his Fifth Amendment\n\nright to a full and fair hearing1 and his statutory right to a\n\nreasonable opportunity to defend himself in his deportation\n\n\n\n\n      1\n     Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993) (“It is well\nestablished that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due\nprocess of law in deportation proceedings.”).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fhearing2 because the IJ precluded him from testifying and ignored\n\nsubstantial     documentary    and      testimonial    evidence    which\n\ncorroborates his claims for asylum.\n\n            Morales argues that the IJ violated his Fifth Amendment\n\nrights when he “cut short” Morales' direct examination, cross-\n\nexamination and redirect examination, and precluded him from\n\naddressing fundamental elements of his claim for asylum.                We\n\nreview the question of whether an administrative law judge\n\nviolated a party's due process rights de novo.            See Aguilar-\n\nSolis, 168 F.3d at 568.\n\n            After   careful   evaluation    of   the   record,    we   are\n\nconvinced that Morales received a fair hearing and was not\n\ndeprived of his due process rights.         The record reflects that,\n\nalthough the IJ may have been somewhat impatient, he did not\n\ndeny Morales a full and fair hearing on his asylum application.\n\nSee Iliev v. INS, 127 F.3d 638, 643 (7th Cir. 1997) (“Although\n\nthe Immigration Judge may have been 'brusque,' and perhaps could\n\nhave achieved his objective in a more courteous manner, it is\n\ndifficult to say on the cold record that his approach warrants\n\ncriticism; certainly, he did not deny a fair trial.”) (footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n     28 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B) (Supp. II 1996).\n\n                                  -7-\n\f           A party is entitled to a fair trial and nothing more.\n\nSee Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir. 1997) (finding\n\nthat the petitioner “received a fair trial, albeit not a perfect\n\nor an unblemished one”).      The Supreme Court has held that\n\n“expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even\n\nanger . . . are within the bounds of what imperfect men and\n\nwomen . . . sometimes display.       A judge's ordinary efforts at\n\ncourtroom administration –     even a stern and short-tempered\n\njudge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration – remain\n\nimmune.”   Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-56 (1994).\n\n\n\n           Morales argues that “he was not permitted a reasonable\n\nopportunity to present evidence on his own behalf. . . . [and\n\nh]is hearing, therefore, did not constitute a 'full and fair'\n\nhearing within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.”       (Pet'r's\n\nBr. at 14.) Morales contends that the IJ “cut short” his direct\n\nexamination and directed that cross-examination begin.         The\n\nrecord contradicts this contention.\n\n           The record reveals that the IJ allowed Morales to\n\ntestify on direct examination without interruption.        Morales\n\ntestified to the date and place of his birth, as well as his\n\nentrance into the United States.     He testified about his work in\n\nGuatemala and his association with the union.      Morales further\n\n\n                               -8-\n\ftestified that he left Guatemala because he was afraid of being\n\nharmed as a result of his association with the union.                 Morales\n\ntestified    to    the   relationship       between   the    union   and   the\n\nGuatemalan military and government.\n\n            After this testimony concluded, the IJ said, “I think\n\nI understand the fact pattern.              Why are you afraid to go back\n\nnow?”   Morales then testified that he feared, because of his\n\nparticipation in the union, that the government authorities\n\nwould harm him.        When Morales finished testifying about why he\n\nwas afraid to return to Guatemala, the IJ asked for cross-\n\nexamination.      There was no objection by Morales' attorney which\n\nwould have indicated to the IJ that Morales was not through with\n\nhis testimony or that he was being “cut short.”                      Morales'\n\nattorney did not indicate that there was additional testimony to\n\ncorroborate his client's claim for asylum.                 At oral argument,\n\nthe argument was made by Morales that his attorney intended to\n\ndevelop the facts more fully on redirect examination.                This was\n\na strategic choice that cannot now be erased.                 Moreover, the\n\nrecord discloses that Morales' attorney was given an opportunity\n\nafter cross examination to augment the evidence, which was done\n\nby offers of proof.\n\n            Morales claims that “[h]e was not . . . provided an\n\nopportunity       to   testify   as   to     his   union    membership,    the\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fpersecution of his fellow union members, or the relationship\n\nbetween the factory owners and the Guatemalan government.                         Nor\n\nwas he able to provide a full, detailed description of the many\n\ninstances of harassment and violence which form the basis for\n\nhis asylum claim.” (Pet'r's Br. at 17.)                The record discloses,\n\nhowever,      that   Morales     did   testify    to   all   of    those   things.\n\nMorales testified about his association with the union and about\n\nthe persecution of the members of the labor union.                         He also\n\ntestified about the relationship between the factory owners and\n\nthe Guatemalan government and he detailed instances when he\n\nclaimed he was personally harassed.              Morales' attorney also made\n\noffers   of    proof   as   to    those   same    circumstances       which      were\n\naccepted as true by the IJ.\n\n              The only instance of the IJ “cutting short” Morales'\n\ntestimony      was   during      cross-examination.          The    IJ     cut    off\n\nquestioning of Morales by the INS attorney, saying “[y]ou're\n\ndone. . . . I've heard enough.”               But the IJ then gave Morales'\n\nattorney an opportunity to present additional evidence, turning\n\nto him asking “What did you want to bring out now?                    We have to\n\ndo it quickly.”         Thereupon, Morales' attorney dictated those\n\nfacts which he wanted to present to the IJ, who accepted this\n\noffer of proof as true.           Morales' attorney made no objection to\n\nthis procedure.\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          Morales further contends that his due process rights\n\nwere violated when the IJ ignored substantial documentary and\n\ntestimonial   evidence     which   supported    his    claim    for   asylum.\n\nMorales argues that the IJ “was remarkably unresponsive. . . .\n\n[and d]espite repeated attempts [his attorney] was unable to\n\ndirect the Judge's attention to the first page of the supporting\n\ndocumentation.”    (Pet'r's Br. at 21.)        Our review of the record,\n\nhowever, shows that there is no indication that the IJ ignored\n\nsubstantial evidence.      In fact, after Morales' attorney directed\n\nthe IJ's attention to the documentation, the IJ responded, “I'm\n\nlooking at [it] - it's Amnesty International 1996.”\n\n          This court has held that each piece of evidence need\n\nnot be discussed in a decision.         “Where, as here, the Board has\n\ngiven reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate\n\nfindings, we will not require that it address specifically each\n\nclaim   the   petitioner    made   or   each   piece    of     evidence   the\n\npetitioner presented.”      Martinez v. INS, 970 F.2d 973, 976 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).   Morales' claim that the IJ and the BIA violated his\n\ndue process rights when they ignored substantial documentary and\n\ntestimonial evidence is without foundation.\n\n          We find that the IJ provided Morales with a full and\n\nfair hearing on his asylum petition.            As we held in Aguilar-\n\nSolis, “the IJ's neutrality cannot seriously be doubted.                  Even\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fif viewed through a jaundiced eye, the transcript reflects\n\nnothing more sinister than a modicum of impatience.             This is not\n\nthe stuff from which a due process violation can be fashioned.”\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 569.              Though the IJ may have been\n\nsomewhat impatient during the hearing, there is no evidence of\n\nbias or unfairness.       The record reflects that Morales had the\n\nopportunity,     on    direct   and    cross    examination    and   by   his\n\nattorney's offers of proof, to present fully his claim for\n\nasylum.    Morales argues that it is insufficient “to satisfy due\n\nprocess that Mr. Morales' attorney was permitted to introduce\n\nportions   of    the   excluded   testimony     into   the   administrative\n\nrecord as offers of proof.”            (Pet'r's Br. at 19 n.6) (citing\n\nVissian v.      INS, 548 F.2d 325, 330 (10th Cir. 1977)).                 That\n\nargument fails because Vissian is fundamentally distinct from\n\nthe instant case.       In Vissian, the “isolated offer of proof . .\n\n. was summarily rejected in the immigration judge's decision.”\n\nVissian, 548 F.2d at 330 (emphasis added).             Here, the offers of\n\nproof made by Morales' attorney were explicitly accepted as\n\ntrue.\n\nIII.    POLITICAL ASYLUM\n\n           Morales claims that the BIA erred when it held that\n\nMorales was not eligible for political asylum or withholding of\n\ndeportation.     To be eligible for political asylum, an alien must\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fdemonstrate that he is a refugee.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)\n\n(Supp. II 1996); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13 (a) (1997).               A “refugee” is\n\ndefined as:\n\n    any person who is outside any country of such person's\n    nationality or . . . is outside any country in which\n    such person last habitually resided, and who is unable\n    or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling\n    to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that\n    country because of persecution or a well-founded fear\n    of   persecution  on   account   of  race,   religion,\n    nationality, membership in a particular social group,\n    or political opinion.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (Supp. II 1996).\n\n            “[T]o    obtain     judicial   reversal     of      the   BIA's\n\ndetermination,      [Morales]    must   show   that    the    evidence   he\n\npresented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\n\nfail to find the requisite fear of persecution.”              INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483-84 (1992).\n\n    We review the Board's findings directly, mindful that\n    in contemplation of law [the findings of the IJ] have\n    become the [Board's]. We review a Board decision to\n    deny an application for asylum deferentially. We will\n    affirm if the Board's conclusion is supported by\n    reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the\n    record considered as a whole.\n\nVasquez v. INS, 177 F.3d 62, 64 (1st Cir. 1999) (alterations in\n\noriginal)    (citation   and    internal   quotation    marks     omitted).\n\n“[I]f the petitioner is to prevail, the administrative record,\n\nviewed in its entirety, must compel the conclusion that he is\n\nasylum-eligible.”     Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 569.\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f            Asylum eligibility may be established by demonstrating\n\neither   past     persecution       or    a   well-founded          fear   of    future\n\npersecution.       See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.                 The BIA held\n\nthat Morales “was not a victim of persecution prior to his\n\ndeparture    from       Guatemala   years       ago.    .   .   .    [and]      did   not\n\nadequately demonstrate before the Immigration Judge that he\n\npresently    has     a    well-founded        fear     of   persecution         in    his\n\nhomeland.”       To reverse the BIA, this court must find that the\n\nevidence    presented       by   Morales        was    so   compelling        that    “no\n\nreasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of\n\npersecution.”       Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 484.                 Morales failed\n\nto meet this burden.\n\nPast Persecution\n\n            In    his    application      for     political         asylum,     Morales\n\nclaimed that he was persecuted in Guatemala because of his\n\nassociation with the Cavisa labor union.                    Morales claimed that\n\nhe “was often followed by soldiers as [he] commuted in [his] car\n\n. . . and [he] received several anonymous notes and telephone\n\ncalls that accused [him] of being a subversive and threatened\n\nharm to [his] family.”              He also claimed that “a car with\n\nblackened windows pulled up next to [him] and stopped. . . . and\n\na uniformed man pointed a rifle at [him].”\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\f            At the hearing before the IJ, Morales testified that\n\n“some unknown people followed [him]”, and he “[thought] those\n\npeople were in the army because of the type or class of weapons\n\nthey carried, and they attempted [to enter the place where he\n\nparked his car.]”       Morales testified that he was never arrested\n\nor imprisoned, but claimed that he was shot at by unknown men.\n\nHe claims that this evidence requires a determination that “he\n\nsuffered     past      persecution      at     the   hands       of    Guatemalan\n\ngovernmental agents on account of his union membership and\n\nimputed political opinion.” (Pet'r's Br. at 55.)                        We do not\n\nagree.     After review of the record, we find that the evidence\n\ndoes not compel a finding that Morales was persecuted on account\n\nof his association with the labor union.\n\n            There is some confusion in the record as to whether\n\nMorales was a union member or was merely associated with the\n\nunion    simply     because    of     his     employment    at    the    factory.\n\nNonetheless,      it   is   evident    that    Morales     was   not    an   active\n\nparticipant in union activities.                Though union meetings were\n\nheld twice a week, Morales only attended two meetings per year.\n\nMorales held no official position in the union and was not a\n\nleader or organizer of the union strike at the factory.\n\n            After Morales fled the factory during the strike, he\n\nleft his job, and therefore his association with the union, and\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fmoved to a farm outside Guatemala City, leaving his wife and\n\nchildren behind.         For the next two years, Morales worked on a\n\nfarm which was located over an hour away from the factory.\n\nMorales testified that while he was working on the farm, he “was\n\nfollowed by some men that allegedly . . . belonged to the army\n\nbecause of the types of weapons they carried.”                        At that time,\n\nMorales was no longer working at the factory and was no longer\n\nassociated with the labor union.\n\n            The      documentary     evidence        submitted        by     Morales,\n\nconsisted       of    human     rights    reports,      U.S.    State      Department\n\ndocuments and other authoritative reports.                     It does not compel\n\nthe finding that Morales suffered past persecution on the basis\n\nof   political       opinion.     Arguably,      these    documents         undermine\n\nMorales' claim for asylum.               They indicate that the unionists\n\nharmed were primarily leaders or active members of the union.\n\nMorales   was     neither     a   leader    of    the    union    nor      an   active\n\nparticipant in its activities.                  The IJ doubted whether the\n\nevents alleged by Morales actually occurred “because of the\n\nimplausibility of the contentions. . . . If indeed the security\n\nforces    of    Guatemala       wished     to    persecute       or    punish     this\n\ngentleman, they could have easily done so.”\n\n            Morales claimed that he was persecuted in Guatemala\n\nbecause of his association with the union.                 Morales claims that\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f“it is only logical to infer that [his] persecution stemmed from\n\nhis involvement with Cavisa's union.”                    (Pet'r's Br. at 58.)\n\nWhile the IJ might have drawn that inference, he “chose to draw\n\na contrary, equally plausible inference.                   Such choices are a\n\nfactfinder's prerogative.            Where, as here the constellation of\n\nfacts and circumstances alleged by an asylum applicant, together\n\nwith the other record evidence, supports two or more competing\n\ninferences, the IJ's choice among those inferences cannot be\n\ndeemed erroneous.”            Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 571.              Although\n\nMorales' association with the union may have played a part in\n\nthe incidents alleged, the record does not compel that finding.\n\nThe contrary, equally plausible inference is that Morales was\n\nnot persecuted in Guatemala and his reason for stating that he\n\nwas persecuted is his desire to remain in the United States.\n\n            The IJ ultimately determined that Morales failed to\n\ndemonstrate      that    he    was   targeted     because      of    his   “minimal\n\ninvolvement” with the union and denied his application for\n\nasylum.     Substantial         evidence     in   the    record     supports   this\n\nfinding and we must decline Morales' invitation to overturn that\n\ndecision.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n            To   prove    a    well-founded       fear    of   persecution,     the\n\n“applicant's      fear    must       be    both   genuine      and    objectively\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\freasonable.”       Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572 (citing Alvarez-\n\nFlores, 909 F.2d at 5).           But the applicants need not prove “that\n\nit is more likely than not that they will be persecuted if\n\ndeported.”    Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 450.             “The BIA and many\n\ncourts of appeals (including this court) narrow the relevant\n\ninquiry to whether a reasonable person in the asylum applicant's\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily\n\nprotected ground.”         Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.               Applying\n\nthis standard, Morales fails to demonstrate a well-founded fear\n\nof   persecution.         The   BIA   determined    that    Morales      “did    not\n\nadequately demonstrate before the Immigration Judge that he\n\npresently    has    a     well-founded     fear    of   persecution       in     his\n\nhomeland.”     Substantial evidence in the record supports that\n\nconclusion.\n\n            Morales     explained     that    he   is   afraid     to   return    to\n\nGuatemala because he believes that the government and military\n\nauthorities will harm him because he was a member of the union.\n\n\n\nThe documentary evidence indicates, however, that although some\n\nunion   members     may    have    been   persecuted,      those    harmed      were\n\nprimarily union leaders or active members.               There is no evidence\n\nwhich corroborates Morales' allegations that he was personally\n\nfollowed, harassed or threatened, or would be in the future.\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f             The BIA determined that Morales had not suffered past\n\npersecution by reason of his association with the labor union.\n\nit also found that Morales did not have a reasonable well-\n\nfounded     fear   of   future    persecution      if   he   were     returned    to\n\nGuatemala.     In order to reverse we must find that the evidence\n\npresented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could\n\nfail   to   find    that   Morales      was    persecuted     on    the   basis   of\n\npolitical     opinion      or    had     a     well-founded        fear   of   such\n\npersecution.       See Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483-84; Ravindran\n\nv. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992).                   Morales has failed\n\nto meet this burden.             Morales has failed to establish that\n\nGuatemalan authorities were aware that he had once belonged to\n\nthe Cavisa union member or that he was even marginally involved\n\nin the union's 1990 strike.            Even if Guatemalan authorities knew\n\nMorales had been a Cavisa union member who was involved in the\n\n1990 strike, the evidence does not suggest that they would\n\npunish him today.\n\nIV.    IMPUTED POLITICAL OPINION\n\n             “'[A]n imputed political opinion, whether correctly or\n\nincorrectly attributed, may constitute a reason for political\n\npersecution within the meaning of the Act.'”                  Vasquez, 177 F.3d\n\nat 65) (quoting Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 760); see also Alvarez-\n\nFlores, 909 F.2d at 4.           There is no doubt that asylum can be\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fgranted if the applicant has been persecuted or has a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution because he is erroneously thought to\n\nhold a particular political opinion.                   The question is whether\n\nthe   evidence    shows    that   an    anti-government,        or      subversive,\n\npolitical opinion was attributed to Morales because of his\n\ninvolvement with the Cavisa labor union.                    The same evidence\n\nalready   discussed       is   void    of    any   suggestion      or    reasonable\n\ninference    that     Guatemalan       authorities       imputed     a    political\n\nopinion to Morales.       Morales argues that his brief participation\n\nin the union strike is a basis for an inference from which it\n\ncould be found that the government authorities thought he was a\n\nsubversive.\n\n            In addition to Morales' testimony about being followed\n\nby    persons    he   thought,    or        assumed,    were   members      of   the\n\nGuatemalan Army there are only two other pieces of evidence\n\nbearing on this issue.         Both are Amnesty International reports.\n\nThe first, dated February 9, 1990, states, inter alia: “Amnesty\n\nInternational has received reports that leaflets warning that\n\nthe leadership of the [Cavisa] union would be held responsible\n\nif any damage were caused to the plant.” (Emphasis added).                        As\n\nwe have already noted, Morales was not a leader of the union in\n\nany sense of the word and could not reasonably be thought to be\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fone.   Indeed, Morales himself denied that he was an active union\n\nmember.\n\n            The second Amnesty International report is dated July\n\n2, 1990.    It states that the Cavisa Union members occupied the\n\nfactory for over four months.           It goes on to state that at the\n\nend of this period, the union members were “violently dislodged\n\nfrom the factory by regular and anti-riot police units” and that\n\nmany of the workers were photographed while leaving the plant,\n\nand “made to fill in a form giving personal details, and then\n\nthey were kicked and beaten with truncheons by the police.”                 The\n\nreport also states that the workers continued to protest outside\n\nthe factory and reportedly were further threatened.\n\n            There is no doubt that the Guatemalan government was,\n\nto say the least, hostile to the union.             The evidence is clear,\n\nhowever,    that   Morales     was     not    in   the    factory    when   the\n\nauthorities dislodged the union workers.                 It is not reasonable\n\nto conclude that somehow he was tarred by the same anti-union\n\nbrush that the government used against the workers that actively\n\nparticipated in the four month takeover of the factory.                         No\n\nmatter how generously we interpret the evidence in favor of\n\nMorales,    it   cannot   be   held    to    contribute     any   basis   for    a\n\npolitical    opinion   imputed    by    the    Guatemalan     authorities       to\n\nMorales.\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f         We understand and sympathize with Morales' desire to\n\nremain in the United States.    The evidence and the applicable\n\nlaw in this case, however, compel us to rule otherwise.   After\n\ncareful review of the record, we find that there is substantial\n\nevidence to support the findings and rulings of the BIA and the\n\nevidence does not compel us to hold otherwise.    Petition for\n\nreview is denied.   The BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without inspection on May 10, 1992. On April 11, 1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause why Morales should not be deported. Subsequently, Morales filed a petition for political asylum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his affidavit in support of his application for political asylum, Morales alleged that he was persecuted in Guatemala because of his association with a labor union. Morales worked as a machine operator for Industria Centro Americana Debedrio, S.A. (Cavisa), in Guatemala City from 1980 until 1990. In 1990, the ownership of the company changed and the representatives of the union demanded better working conditions and higher pay. When the demands were refused, the union leaders declared a strike and the gates to the factory were locked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Morales was detained with the other 700 workers in the factory until \"[t]he gates were finally unlocked, and [he] managed to escape.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Morales never returned to the company, he claimed that for the next two years, he \"encountered problems because of [his] involvement in the labor dispute.\" Morales left Guatemala and arrived in the United States on May 10, 1992. In his affidavit, Morales claimed that if he were forced to return to Guatemala, he would be \"persecuted because of the mistaken belief by Guatemalan military and government authorities that [he] supported the labor unrest at [his] former job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing, the IJ determined that Morales was \"only barely associated with the union\" and his \"minimal involvement in the union\" would not impute to him a political opinion that would be the basis for persecution. The IJ also determined that \"[i]f indeed the security forces of Guatemala wished to persecute or punish this gentleman, they could have easily done so.\" Therefore, the IJ denied Morales' application for political asylum and withholding of deportation, but granted voluntary departure in lieu of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred by concluding that Morales did not establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation. Morales also argued that the IJ denied him a fair trial. The BIA dismissed the appeal, finding that Morales had not met his burden of proving his eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation and that his hearing met due process standards. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that he was denied his Fifth Amendment right to a full and fair hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>, and his statutory right to a reasonable opportunity to defend himself in his deportation hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>because the IJ precluded him from testifying and ignored substantial documentary and testimonial evidence which corroborates his claims for asylum. Morales further claims that the BIA erred in implicitly adopting the IJ's credibility determination. Finally, Morales asserts that the BIA erred when it held that Morales was not eligible for political asylum or withholding of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Fairness of the Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales argues that the IJ violated his Fifth Amendment rights when he \"cut short\" Morales' direct examination, cross-examination and redirect examination, and precluded him from addressing fundamental elements of his claim for asylum. We review the question of whether an administrative law judge violated a party's due process rights de novo. See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful evaluation of the record, we are convinced that Morales received a fair hearing and was not deprived of his due process rights. The record reflects that, although the IJ may have been somewhat impatient, he did not deny Morales a full and fair hearing on his asylum application. See Iliev v. INS, 127 F.3d 638, 643 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"Although the Immigration Judge may have been 'brusque,' and perhaps could have achieved his objective in a more courteous manner, it is difficult to say on the cold record that his approach warrants criticism; certainly, he did not deny a fair trial.\") (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is entitled to a fair trial and nothing more. See Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st. Cir. 1997) (finding that the petitioner \"received a fair trial, albeit not a perfect or an unblemished one\"). The Supreme Court has held that \"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger . . . are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women . . . sometimes display. A judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration - even a stern and short-tempered judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration - remain immune.\" Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-56 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales argues that \"he was not permitted a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf. . . . [and h]is hearing, therefore, did not constitute a 'full and fair' hearing within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 14.) Morales argues that the IJ \"cut short\" his direct examination and asked for cross-examination to begin. The record contradicts this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that the IJ allowed Morales to testify on direct examination without interruption. Morales testified to the date and place of his birth, as well as his entrance into the United States. He testified about his work in Guatemala and his association with the union. Morales further testified that he left Guatemala because he was afraid of being harmed as a result of his association with the union. Morales testified to the relationship between the union and the Guatemalan military and government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this testimony concluded, the IJ said, \"I think I understand the fact pattern. Why are you afraid to go back now?\" Morales then testified that he feared, because of his participation in the union, that the government authorities want to harm him. When Morales finished testifying about why he was afraid to return to Guatemala, the IJ asked for cross-examination. There was no objection by Morales' attorney which would have indicated to the IJ that perhaps Morales was not through with his testimony or that he was being \"cut short.\" Morales' attorney did not indicate that there was additional testimony to corroborate his client's claim for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that \"[h]e was not . . . provided an opportunity to testify as to his union membership, the persecution of his fellow union members, or the relationship between the factory owners and the Guatemalan government. Nor was he able to provide a full, detailed description of the many instances of harassment and violence which form the basis for his asylum claim.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 17.) The record discloses, however, that Morales did testify to all of those things. Morales testified about his association with the union and about the persecution of the members of the labor union. He also testified about the relationship between the factory owners and the Guatemalan government and he detailed instances when he was personally harassed. Morales' attorney also made offers of proof as to those same circumstances and the offers of proof were accepted as true by the IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the only instance of the IJ \"cutting short\" Morales' testimony was during cross-examination. At that point, it was the INS' attorney who objected, not Morales' attorney. In fact, when the IJ indicated that cross-examination was finished, he turned to Morales' attorney and asked, \"What did you want to bring out now? We have to do it quickly.\" Thereupon, Morales' attorney dictated those facts which he wanted to present to the IJ. This offer of proof was accepted as true by the IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales further contends that his due process rights were violated when the IJ ignored substantial documentary and testimonial evidence which supported his claim for asylum. Morales argues that the IJ \"was remarkably unresponsive. . . . [and d]espite repeated attempts [his attorney] was unable to direct the Judge's attention to the first page of the supporting documentation[.]\" (Pet'r's Br. at 21.) Our review of the record, however, shows that there is no indication that the IJ ignored substantial evidence. In fact, after Morales' attorney directed the IJ's attention to the documentation, the IJ responded, \"I'm looking at [it] - it's Amnesty International 1996.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, this court has held that each piece of evidence need not be discussed in a decision. \"Where, as here, the Board has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\" Martinez v. INS, 970 F.2d 973, 976 (1st Cir. 1992). Morales' claim that the IJ and the BIA violated his due process rights when they ignored substantial documentary and testimonial evidence is without foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the IJ provided Morales with a full and fair hearing on his asylum petition. As we held in Aguilar-Solis, \"the IJ's neutrality cannot seriously be doubted. Even if viewed through a jaundiced eye, the transcript reflects nothing more sinister than a modicum of impatience. This is not the stuff from which a due process violation can be fashioned.\" Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 569. Though the IJ may have been somewhat impatient during the hearing, his neutrality cannot be questioned. The record reflects that Morales had the opportunity, albeit through counsel, to present his claim for asylum. Morales argues that it is insufficient \"to satisfy due process that Mr. Morales' attorney was permitted to introduce portions of the excluded testimony into the administrative record as offers of proof.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 19 n.6) (citing Vissian v. INS, 548 F.2d 325, 330 (10th Cir. 1977)). That argument fails because Vissian is fundamentally distinct from the instant case. In Vissian, the \"isolated offer of proof . . . was summarily rejected in the immigration judge's decision . . . .\" Vissian, 548 F.2d at 330 (emphasis added). Here, the offers of proof made by Morales' attorney were accepted as true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Witness Credibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales further claims that the BIA erred when it implicitly adopted the IJ's determination that Morales was not a credible witness. The BIA did not, itself, make a credibility finding; it adopted, as it had a right to do, the credibility finding of the IJ. The BIA held that \"even if we were to credit his testimony and assume that he had a well-founded fear of persecution when he left Guatemala in 1992, the respondent did not adequately demonstrate before the Immigration Judge that he presently has a well-founded fear of persecution in his homeland.\" Finding that Morales did not meet his burden of proving his eligibility for asylum, the BIA dismissed his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Asylum</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that the BIA erred when it held that Morales was not eligible for political asylum or withholding of deportation. To be eligible for political asylum, an alien must demonstrate that he is a refugee. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1) (1996); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13 (a) (1997).

Morales failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Past Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his application for political asylum, Morales claimed that he was persecuted in Guatemala because of his association with the Cavisa labor union. Morales claimed that he \"was often followed by soldiers as [he] commuted in [his] car . . . and [he] received several anonymous notes and telephone calls that accused [him] of being a subversive and threatened harm to [his] family.\" He also claimed that \"a car with blackened windows pulled up next to [him] and stopped. . . . and a uniformed man pointed a rifle at [him].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing before the IJ, Morales testified that \"some unknown people followed [him]\", and he \"[thought] those people were in the army because of the type or class of weapons they carried, and they attempted [to enter the place where he parked his car.]\" Morales testified that he was never arrested or imprisoned, but claimed that he was shot at by unknown men. He claims that this evidence requires a determination that \"he suffered past persecution at the hands of Guatemalan governmental agents on account of his union membership and imputed political opinion.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 55.) We do not agree. After review of the record, we find that the evidence does not compel a finding that Morales was persecuted on account of his association with the labor union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some confusion in the record as to whether Morales was a union member or was merely associated with the union simply because of his employment at the factory. Nonetheless, it is evident that Morales was not an active participant in union activities. Though union meetings were held twice a week, Morales only attended two meetings per year. Morales held no official position in the union and was not a leader or organizer of the union strike at the factory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Morales fled the factory during the strike, he left his job, and therefore his association with the union, and moved to a farm outside Guatemala City, leaving his wife and children behind. For the next two years, Morales worked on the farm which was located over an hour away from the factory. Morales testified that while he was working on the farm, he \"was followed by some men that allegedly . . . belonged to the army because of the types of weapons they carried.\" At that time, Morales was no longer working at the factory and was no longer associated with the labor union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documentary evidence submitted by Morales, consisting of human rights reports and the like, does not compel the finding that Morales suffered past persecution. Arguably, these documents undermine Morales' claim for asylum. They indicate that the unionists harmed were primarily leaders or active members of the union. Morales, however, was neither a leader of the union nor an active participant in its activities. The IJ doubted whether the events alleged by Morales actually occurred \"because of the implausibility of the contentions.\" \"If indeed the security forces of Guatemala wished to persecute or punish this gentleman, they could have easily done so.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claimed that he was persecuted in Guatemala because of his association with the union. Morales claims that \"it is only logical to infer that [his] persecution stemmed from his involvement with Cavisa's union.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 58.) While the IJ might possibly have drawn that inference, he \"chose to draw a contrary, equally plausible inference. Such choices are a factfinder's prerogative. Where, as here the constellation of facts and circumstances alleged by an asylum applicant, together with the other record evidence, supports two or more competing inferences, the IJ's choice among those inferences cannot be deemed erroneous.\" Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 571. Although Morales' association with the union may have played a part in the incidents alleged, the record does not compel that finding. The contrary, equally plausible inference is that Morales was not persecuted in Guatemala and his reason for stating that he was persecuted is his desire to remain in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ ultimately determined that Morales failed to demonstrate that he was targeted because of his \"minimal involvement\" with the union and denied his application for asylum. Substantial evidence in the record supports this finding and we must decline Morales' invitation to overturn that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a well-founded fear of persecution, the \"applicant's fear must be both genuine and objectively reasonable.\" Aguilar-Solis, 168 F. 3d at 572 (citing Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1990)). The applicants must prove that \"it is more likely than not that they will be persecuted if deported.\" INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 450 (1987). \"The BIA and many courts of appeals (including this court) narrow the relevant inquiry to whether a reasonable person in the asylum applicant's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572. Applying this standard, Morales fails to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. The BIA determined that Morales \"did not adequately demonstrate before the Immigration Judge that he presently has a well-founded fear of persecution in his homeland.\" Substantial evidence in the record supports that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales explained that he is afraid to return to Guatemala because he believes that the government and military authorities will harm him because he was a member of the union. There is no evidence, however, to support this uncorroborated testimony of the applicant. The documentary evidence indicates that although some union members may have been persecuted, those harmed were primarily union leaders or active members. There is no evidence which corroborates Morales' allegations that he was personally followed, harassed or threatened, or would be in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA determined that Morales suffered from neither past persecution on account of his association with the labor union nor a well-founded fear of future persecution if he were returned to Guatemala. After careful review of the record, we find that there is substantial evidence to support such determinations and the evidence does not compel us to hold differently. Accordingly, the petition for review is denied and the BIA's order is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Immigration Judge considered Morales' petition for political asylum to be a request for withholding of deportation as well.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record reveals that although the strike lasted for at least several weeks, Morales was only detained in the factory for one week.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Reno v.

Morales claims that the IJ violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law when he precluded the petitioner from fully testifying as to his asylum petition. Morales also asserts that the IJ ignored substantial documentary and testimonial evidence which corroborated his claim for asylum. Morales further claims that the BIA failed to rectify those violations when it dismissed his appeal. Finding those arguments unpersuasive, we affirm the BIA's order and deny Morales' petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without inspection on May 10, 1992. On April 11, 1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause why Morales should not be deported. Subsequently, Morales filed a petition for political asylum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his affidavit in support of his application for political asylum, Morales alleged that he was persecuted in Guatemala because of his association with a labor union. Morales worked as a machine operator for Industria Centro Americana Debedrio, S.A. (Cavisa), in Guatemala City from 1980 until 1990. In 1990, the ownership of the company changed and the representatives of the union demanded better working conditions and higher pay. When the demands were refused, the union leaders declared a strike and the gates to the factory were locked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Morales was detained with the other 700 workers in the factory until \"[t]he gates were finally unlocked, and [he] managed to escape.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Morales never returned to the company, he claimed that for the next two years, he \"encountered problems because of [his] involvement in the labor dispute.\" Morales left Guatemala and arrived in the United States on May 10, 1992. In his affidavit, Morales claimed that if he were forced to return to Guatemala, he would be \"persecuted because of the mistaken belief by Guatemalan military and government authorities that [he] supported the labor unrest at [his] former job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing, the IJ determined that Morales was \"only barely associated with the union\" and his \"minimal involvement in the union\" would not impute to him a political opinion that would be the basis for persecution. The IJ also determined that \"[i]f indeed the security forces of Guatemala wished to persecute or punish this gentleman, they could have easily done so.\" Therefore, the IJ denied Morales' application for political asylum and withholding of deportation, but granted voluntary departure in lieu of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred by concluding that Morales did not establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation. Morales also argued that the IJ denied him a fair trial. The BIA dismissed the appeal, finding that Morales had not met his burden of proving his eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation and that his hearing met due process standards. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that he was denied his Fifth Amendment right to a full and fair hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>, and his statutory right to a reasonable opportunity to defend himself in his deportation hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>because the IJ precluded him from testifying and ignored substantial documentary and testimonial evidence which corroborates his claims for asylum. Morales further claims that the BIA erred in implicitly adopting the IJ's credibility determination. Finally, Morales asserts that the BIA erred when it held that Morales was not eligible for political asylum or withholding of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Fairness of the Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales argues that the IJ violated his Fifth Amendment rights when he \"cut short\" Morales' direct examination, cross-examination and redirect examination, and precluded him from addressing fundamental elements of his claim for asylum. We review the question of whether an administrative law judge violated a party's due process rights de novo. See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful evaluation of the record, we are convinced that Morales received a fair hearing and was not deprived of his due process rights. The record reflects that, although the IJ may have been somewhat impatient, he did not deny Morales a full and fair hearing on his asylum application. See Iliev v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747203\"><a href=\"/opinion/747203/anguel-iliev-and-elena-iliev-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 643 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"Although the Immigration Judge may have been 'brusque,' and perhaps could have achieved his objective in a more courteous manner, it is difficult to say on the cold record that his approach warrants criticism; certainly, he did not deny a fair trial.\") (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is entitled to a fair trial and nothing more.

Cir. 1997) (finding that the petitioner \"received a fair trial, albeit not a perfect or an unblemished one\"). The Supreme Court has held that \"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger . . . are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women . . . sometimes display. A judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration - even a stern and short-tempered judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration - remain immune.\" Liteky v.

[and h]is hearing, therefore, did not constitute a 'full and fair' hearing within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 14.) Morales argues that the IJ \"cut short\" his direct examination and asked for cross-examination to begin. The record contradicts this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that the IJ allowed Morales to testify on direct examination without interruption. Morales testified to the date and place of his birth, as well as his entrance into the United States. He testified about his work in Guatemala and his association with the union. Morales further testified that he left Guatemala because he was afraid of being harmed as a result of his association with the union. Morales testified to the relationship between the union and the Guatemalan military and government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this testimony concluded, the IJ said, \"I think I understand the fact pattern. Why are you afraid to go back now?\" Morales then testified that he feared, because of his participation in the union, that the government authorities want to harm him. When Morales finished testifying about why he was afraid to return to Guatemala, the IJ asked for cross-examination. There was no objection by Morales' attorney which would have indicated to the IJ that perhaps Morales was not through with his testimony or that he was being \"cut short.\" Morales' attorney did not indicate that there was additional testimony to corroborate his client's claim for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claims that \"[h]e was not . . . provided an opportunity to testify as to his union membership, the persecution of his fellow union members, or the relationship between the factory owners and the Guatemalan government. Nor was he able to provide a full, detailed description of the many instances of harassment and violence which form the basis for his asylum claim.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 17.) The record discloses, however, that Morales did testify to all of those things. Morales testified about his association with the union and about the persecution of the members of the labor union. He also testified about the relationship between the factory owners and the Guatemalan government and he detailed instances when he was personally harassed. Morales' attorney also made offers of proof as to those same circumstances and the offers of proof were accepted as true by the IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the only instance of the IJ \"cutting short\" Morales' testimony was during cross-examination. At that point, it was the INS' attorney who objected, not Morales' attorney. In fact, when the IJ indicated that cross-examination was finished, he turned to Morales' attorney and asked, \"What did you want to bring out now? We have to do it quickly.\" Thereupon, Morales' attorney dictated those facts which he wanted to present to the IJ. This offer of proof was accepted as true by the IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales further contends that his due process rights were violated when the IJ ignored substantial documentary and testimonial evidence which supported his claim for asylum. Morales argues that the IJ \"was remarkably unresponsive. . . . [and d]espite repeated attempts [his attorney] was unable to direct the Judge's attention to the first page of the supporting documentation[.]\" (Pet'r's Br. at 21.) Our review of the record, however, shows that there is no indication that the IJ ignored substantial evidence. In fact, after Morales' attorney directed the IJ's attention to the documentation, the IJ responded, \"I'm looking at [it] - it's Amnesty International 1996.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, this court has held that each piece of evidence need not be discussed in a decision. \"Where, as here, the Board has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\" Martinez v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587571\"><a href=\"/opinion/587571/javier-a-martinez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>, 976 (1st Cir. 1992). Morales' claim that the IJ and the BIA violated his due process rights when they ignored substantial documentary and testimonial evidence is without foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the IJ provided Morales with a full and fair hearing on his asylum petition. As we held in Aguilar-Solis, \"the IJ's neutrality cannot seriously be doubted. Even if viewed through a jaundiced eye, the transcript reflects nothing more sinister than a modicum of impatience. This is not the stuff from which a due process violation can be fashioned.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Aguilar-Solis,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>. Though the IJ may have been somewhat impatient during the hearing, his neutrality cannot be questioned. The record reflects that Morales had the opportunity, albeit through counsel, to present his claim for asylum. Morales argues that it is insufficient \"to satisfy due process that Mr. Morales' attorney was permitted to introduce portions of the excluded testimony into the administrative record as offers of proof.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 19 n.6) (citing Vissian v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342347\"><a href=\"/opinion/342347/anthony-philip-vissian-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 330 (10th Cir. 1977)). That argument fails because Vissian is fundamentally distinct from the instant case. In Vissian, the \"isolated offer of proof . . . was summarily rejected in the immigration judge's decision . . . .\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342347\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vissian,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/342347/anthony-philip-vissian-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">330</span> </a></span>(emphasis added).

Witness Credibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales further claims that the BIA erred when it implicitly adopted the IJ's determination that Morales was not a credible witness. The BIA did not, itself, make a credibility finding; it adopted, as it had a right to do, the credibility finding of the IJ. The BIA held that \"even if we were to credit his testimony and assume that he had a well-founded fear of persecution when he left Guatemala in 1992, the respondent did not adequately demonstrate before the Immigration Judge that he presently has a well-founded fear of persecution in his homeland.\" Finding that Morales did not meet his burden of proving his eligibility for asylum, the BIA dismissed his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Morales failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Past Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his application for political asylum, Morales claimed that he was persecuted in Guatemala because of his association with the Cavisa labor union. Morales claimed that he \"was often followed by soldiers as [he] commuted in [his] car . . . and [he] received several anonymous notes and telephone calls that accused [him] of being a subversive and threatened harm to [his] family.\" He also claimed that \"a car with blackened windows pulled up next to [him] and stopped. . . . and a uniformed man pointed a rifle at [him].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing before the IJ, Morales testified that \"some unknown people followed [him]\", and he \"[thought] those people were in the army because of the type or class of weapons they carried, and they attempted [to enter the place where he parked his car.]\" Morales testified that he was never arrested or imprisoned, but claimed that he was shot at by unknown men. He claims that this evidence requires a determination that \"he suffered past persecution at the hands of Guatemalan governmental agents on account of his union membership and imputed political opinion.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 55.) We do not agree. After review of the record, we find that the evidence does not compel a finding that Morales was persecuted on account of his association with the labor union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some confusion in the record as to whether Morales was a union member or was merely associated with the union simply because of his employment at the factory. Nonetheless, it is evident that Morales was not an active participant in union activities. Though union meetings were held twice a week, Morales only attended two meetings per year. Morales held no official position in the union and was not a leader or organizer of the union strike at the factory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Morales fled the factory during the strike, he left his job, and therefore his association with the union, and moved to a farm outside Guatemala City, leaving his wife and children behind. For the next two years, Morales worked on the farm which was located over an hour away from the factory. Morales testified that while he was working on the farm, he \"was followed by some men that allegedly . . . belonged to the army because of the types of weapons they carried.\" At that time, Morales was no longer working at the factory and was no longer associated with the labor union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documentary evidence submitted by Morales, consisting of human rights reports and the like, does not compel the finding that Morales suffered past persecution. Arguably, these documents undermine Morales' claim for asylum. They indicate that the unionists harmed were primarily leaders or active members of the union. Morales, however, was neither a leader of the union nor an active participant in its activities. The IJ doubted whether the events alleged by Morales actually occurred \"because of the implausibility of the contentions.\" \"If indeed the security forces of Guatemala wished to persecute or punish this gentleman, they could have easily done so.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales claimed that he was persecuted in Guatemala because of his association with the union. Morales claims that \"it is only logical to infer that [his] persecution stemmed from his involvement with Cavisa's union.\" (Pet'r's Br. at 58.) While the IJ might possibly have drawn that inference, he \"chose to draw a contrary, equally plausible inference. Such choices are a factfinder's prerogative. Where, as here the constellation of facts and circumstances alleged by an asylum applicant, together with the other record evidence, supports two or more competing inferences, the IJ's choice among those inferences cannot be deemed erroneous.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Aguilar-Solis,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>. Although Morales' association with the union may have played a part in the incidents alleged, the record does not compel that finding. The contrary, equally plausible inference is that Morales was not persecuted in Guatemala and his reason for stating that he was persecuted is his desire to remain in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ ultimately determined that Morales failed to demonstrate that he was targeted because of his \"minimal involvement\" with the union and denied his application for asylum. Substantial evidence in the record supports this finding and we must decline Morales' invitation to overturn that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a well-founded fear of persecution, the \"applicant's fear must be both genuine and objectively reasonable.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Aguilar-Solis,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">572</span> </a></span>(citing Alvarez-Flores v.

Applying this standard, Morales fails to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. The BIA determined that Morales \"did not adequately demonstrate before the Immigration Judge that he presently has a well-founded fear of persecution in his homeland.\" Substantial evidence in the record supports that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales explained that he is afraid to return to Guatemala because he believes that the government and military authorities will harm him because he was a member of the union. There is no evidence, however, to support this uncorroborated testimony of the applicant. The documentary evidence indicates that although some union members may have been persecuted, those harmed were primarily union leaders or active members. There is no evidence which corroborates Morales' allegations that he was personally followed, harassed or threatened, or would be in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA determined that Morales suffered from neither past persecution on account of his association with the labor union nor a well-founded fear of future persecution if he were returned to Guatemala. After careful review of the record, we find that there is substantial evidence to support such determinations and the evidence does not compel us to hold differently.
