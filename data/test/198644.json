Petitioner-appellee Wilton K.\r\nAlmon is a native and citizen of Jamaica who entered the United\r\nStates as an immigrant on March 29, 1980, at the age of nine.  On\r\nOctober 24, 1996, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\r\n(\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause, charging Almon with\r\ndeportability as an aggravated felon pursuant to\r\n241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\r\n8 U.S.C.  1251(a)(2)(A)(iii).  The basis of the charges of\r\ndeportability were three separate criminal convictions: (1) a\r\nSeptember 16, 1996 conviction for entering a dwelling with intent\r\nto commit larceny; (2) a January 9, 1995 conviction for possession\r\nof a stolen motor vehicle; and (3) a January 9, 1995 conviction for\r\nassault with a dangerous weapon.\r\nOn June 25, 1997, an immigration judge found Almon\r\ndeportable and ineligible for a  212(c) waiver of deportation by\r\noperation of  440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\r\nPenalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\").  Almon was ordered deported to\r\nJamaica.  The BIA affirmed the deportation order on May 1, 1997.\r\nPrior to April 24, 1996,  Almon would have been able to\r\napply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under  212(c) of\r\nthe INA.  See 8 U.S.C.  1182(c) (1995).  However, effective\r\nApril 24, 1996,  440(d) of the AEDPA amended  212(c) and rendered\r\nAlmon ineligible for such a waiver.  See AEDPA, Pub. L. No. 104-\r\n132, Title IV,  440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1277 (1996).\r\nAlmon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\r\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\r\nalleging that  440(d) of the AEDPA violates his right to equal\r\nprotection by irrationally denying eligibility for  212(c) relief\r\nto aliens who, like himself, are in deportation proceedings, while\r\npreserving such relief for aliens in exclusion proceedings.  The\r\ndistrict court agreed with Almon, granting his petition, and\r\nremanding his case to the BIA for a discretionary determination of\r\nthe merits of Almon's application for relief under the old INA\r\n212(c).  This appeal followed.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nIn order to better understand Almon's equal protection\r\nclaim, some background information is necessary.  Deportable aliens\r\nare aliens presently residing in the United States, but who are\r\nsubject to deportation on various grounds.  See 8 U.S.C.  1251(a)\r\n(1996).  Excludable aliens are those who seek to enter the United\r\nStates to set up residence, and whom the Attorney General has the\r\npower to exclude.  See 8 U.S.C.  1182(a) (1996).  Prior to the\r\npassage of the AEDPA,  212(c) of the INA provided that excludable\r\naliens who were legal permanent residents of the United States for\r\nseven consecutive years and who traveled abroad voluntarily and\r\ntemporarily could be re-admitted at the discretion of the Attorney\r\nGeneral.  See supra note 2.  By its terms,  212(c) discretionary\r\nrelief applied specifically and exclusively to excludable aliens\r\nseeking readmission, and not to aliens in deportation proceedings. \r\nSee id.\r\nHowever, in 1956, in Matter of G.A., 7 I. &amp; N. Dec. 274\r\n(BIA 1956), the BIA permitted a criminal alien in deportation\r\nproceedings to apply for a  212(c) waiver.  See Matter of G.A., 7\r\nI. &amp; N. at 275.  The petitioner in that case was convicted of a\r\ndrug offense in 1947.  See id. at 274.  In 1952, he briefly left\r\nthe United States, and upon his return was readmitted.  See id. \r\nThe INS did not initiate deportation proceedings against G.A. until\r\n1956.  See id.  From 1947, the date of his drug conviction, to\r\n1956, G.A. did not suffer any additional convictions.  See id. at\r\n274-75. In holding that G.A. was eligible to apply for\r\ndiscretionary relief under  212(c), the BIA reasoned that if the\r\nAttorney General exercised his discretion under  212(c) and waived\r\nthe ground of excludability based upon G.A.'s 1947 criminal\r\nconviction when G.A. sought readmission to the United States in\r\n1952, a deportation proceeding based upon the same criminal\r\nconviction could not thereafter be initiated.  See Matter of G.A.,\r\n7 I. &amp; N. at 275-76.\r\nAfter the BIA's holding in Matter of G.A., resident\r\ncriminal aliens were routinely considered eligible for\r\ndiscretionary relief under  212(c) if, at some point after their\r\nconvictions, they had temporarily departed the United States, been\r\nreadmitted, and were in deportation proceedings.  See, e.g., Matter\r\nof Tanori, 15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 566, 568 (BIA 1976) (\"Under section\r\n212(c) of the Act, a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility may be\r\ngranted in a deportation proceeding when, at the time of the\r\nalien's last entry, he was inadmissible because of the same facts\r\nwhich form the basis of his deportability.\"); Matter of Edwards, 10\r\nI. &amp; N. Dec. 506 (BIA 1963) (holding that the fact that a resident\r\ncriminal alien's status may have changed from excludable to\r\ndeportable does not preclude the exercise of discretionary relief\r\ncontained in  212(c)).  At the same time, the BIA declined to\r\nextend  212(c) relief to otherwise eligible resident criminal\r\naliens in deportation proceedings who had not departed the country\r\nafter being convicted.  See, e.g., Matter of Arias-Uribe, 13 I. &amp;\r\nN. Dec. 696 (BIA 1971).  In this way, the BIA distinguished between\r\ntwo classes of deportable aliens: those who had traveled abroad\r\nafter their convictions, and those who had never left the country.\r\nThis distinction did not go unnoticed.  In 1976, in\r\nFrancis v. INS, 532 F.2d 268 (2d Cir. 1976), the Second Circuit\r\nheld that the BIA's distinction between these two classes of\r\ndeportable aliens violated equal protection.  See 532 F.2d at 273. \r\nLike G.A., the petitioner in Francis was in deportation proceedings\r\nbut, unlike G.A., had never left the United States at any time\r\nafter his conviction.  See id. at 269.  For this reason, the BIA\r\ndeemed Francis ineligible for  212(c) relief and ordered him\r\ndeported.  In granting Francis's request for a declaration of his\r\neligibility for  212(c) relief, the Second Circuit explained that\r\nthe government had failed to suggest any reason why a deportable\r\nalien's failure to travel abroad after a conviction should be a\r\ncrucial factor in determining his eligibility for a  212(c)\r\nwaiver.  See  id. at 273.  Therefore, the Francis court concluded\r\nthat distinguishing between different categories of deportable\r\naliens based on whether they had departed and returned to the\r\nUnited States was \"wholly unrelated to any legitimate government\r\ninterest.\"  Id.  The remedy for this constitutional violation was\r\na remand to the BIA for a determination of the merits of Francis'\r\napplication for a  212(c) waiver.\r\nPrior to the passage of the AEDPA, Almon, like the\r\npetitioner in Francis, would have been eligible for  212(c)\r\nrelief.  See Matter of Silva, 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26 (BIA 1976)\r\n(holding that, after Francis,  212(c) relief may be granted to \r\npermanent resident aliens in deportation proceedings).  However,\r\neffective April 24, 1996,  440(d) of the AEDPA amended the last\r\nsentence of  212(c) to read: \"[t]his section shall not apply to an\r\nalien who is deportable by reason of having committed [various\r\nenumerated criminal offenses].\"  AEDPA  440(d), 110 Stat. 1214,\r\n1277 (emphasis added).  Although immigration judges initially\r\napplied this exclusion from  212(c) eligibility to both excludable\r\nand deportable criminal aliens, the BIA in In re Fuentes-Campos,\r\nInt. Dec. 3318 (BIA 1997), interpreted  440(d) as excluding only\r\naliens in deportation proceedings from eligibility for  212(c)\r\nrelief.  It is this interpretation of  440(d), limiting\r\neligibility for  212(c) relief to criminal aliens in exclusion\r\nproceedings only, that Almon claims violates his right to equal\r\nprotection.  Specifically, Almon contends that there is no\r\nrational basis for treating two aliens convicted of exactly the\r\nsame crime differently simply because one has chosen to leave the\r\ncountry while the other has not.  We disagree.\r\nAlmon first argues that the Second Circuit's holding in\r\nFrancis compels us to find the BIA's interpretation of  440(d)\r\nviolative of equal protection guarantees.  However, Almon's equal\r\nprotection claim is very different from that litigated in Francis. \r\nFirst, Almon challenges a different statutory classification:\r\nnamely, the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens. \r\nSecond, even assuming arguendo that excludable aliens and\r\ndeportable aliens are similarly situated with respect to  440(d),\r\nthe government in this case has advanced a rational and legitimate\r\nreason for the statute's disparate treatment of excludable and\r\ndeportable aliens.  We therefore reject Almon's argument to the\r\nextent it is based on the Second Circuit's decision in Francis.\r\nWe turn next to the merits of Almon's equal protection\r\nclaim.  It is well established that a challenged classification\r\nthat does not involve a suspect class or impinge upon fundamental\r\nrights is accorded a strong presumption of validity.  See Heller v.\r\nDoe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993).  Such a classification must be\r\nupheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental\r\npurpose.  See id. at 320.  Moreover, under this minimal standard of\r\nreview, the government need not actually articulate at any time the\r\npurpose or rationale supporting its classification.  See id. at\r\n320.  Instead, a classification must be upheld against an equal\r\nprotection challenge \"if there is any reasonably conceivable set of\r\nfacts that could provide a rational basis for the classification\"\r\nwhether the basis has a foundation in the legislative record or\r\nnot.  Heller, 509 U.S. at 320 (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications\r\nInc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)).  Under this standard of review, we\r\nconclude that there exists a rational basis for the disparate\r\ntreatment of excludable and deportable aliens under  440(d) of the\r\nAEDPA.\r\nWe conclude that in limiting  440(d)'s restrictions to\r\ncriminal aliens in deportation proceedings, Congress advanced the\r\nlegitimate legislative goal of expediting the deportation of\r\ncriminal aliens currently residing within our borders.  See\r\nLaGuerre v. Reno, 164 F.3d 1035, 1041 (7th Cir. 1998); Mattis v.\r\nReno, 44 F. Supp. 2d 379, 385-86 (D. Mass. 1999).  But see Wallace\r\nv. Reno, 39 F. Supp. 2d 101, 106-08 (D. Mass. 1999).  The\r\nCongressional record leading up to the enactment of the AEDPA\r\nindicates that the number of deportable criminal aliens greatly\r\nexceeds the number of excludable criminal aliens.  See H.R. Rep.\r\nNo. 104-469(I) (1996) (1996 WL 168955 at *384-85) (reporting that\r\nin 1995 the INS deported approximately 29,255 criminal aliens and\r\nexcluded approximately 2,738).  Given these figures, the more\r\nlenient treatment of excludable criminal aliens under  440(d)\r\nmakes rational sense.  With the passage of  440(d), Congress\r\ncreated an incentive for deportable criminal aliens to leave the\r\ncountry without their having to be ordered to leave at the\r\ngovernment's expense.  See LaGuerre, 164 F.3d at 1041.  As the\r\nSeventh Circuit explained: \"To induce their voluntary departure, a\r\nlittle carrot is dangled before them consisting of the opportunity\r\nto seek a waiver should they seek to return to the country and by\r\ndoing so trigger exclusion proceedings.\"  LaGuerre, 164 F.3d at\r\n1041.  Section 440(d) clearly accomplishes this legitimate\r\ngovernmental purpose, and therefore must be upheld.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the decision of\r\nthe district court.\r\n",

First, Almon challenges a different statutory classification: namely, the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens. Second, even assuming arguendo that excludable aliens and deportable aliens are similarly situated with respect to &#167; 440(d), the government in this case has advanced a rational and legitimate reason for the statute's disparate treatment of excludable and deportable aliens.

Moreover, under this minimal standard of review, the government need not actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification. See id. at 320. Instead, a classification must be upheld against an equal protection challenge \"if there is any reasonably conceivable set of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification\" whether the basis has a foundation in the legislative record or not. Heller, 509 U.S. at 320 (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)).

Given these figures, the more lenient treatment of excludable criminal aliens under &#167; 440(d) makes rational sense.

Almon is a native and citizen of Jamaica who entered the United States as an immigrant on March 29, 1980, at the age of nine. On October 24, 1996, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an Order to Show Cause, charging Almon with deportability as an aggravated felon pursuant to &#167; 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The basis of the charges of deportability were three separate criminal convictions: (1) a September 16, 1996 conviction for entering a dwelling with intent to commit larceny; (2) a January 9, 1995 conviction for possession of a stolen motor vehicle; and (3) a January 9, 1995 conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 1997, an immigration judge found Almon deportable and ineligible for a &#167; 212(c) waiver of deportation by operation of &#167; 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"). Almon was ordered deported to Jamaica. The BIA affirmed the deportation order on May 1, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to April 24, 1996, Almon would have been able to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under &#167; 212(c) of the INA. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, effective April 24, 1996, &#167; 440(d) of the AEDPA amended &#167; 212(c) and rendered Almon ineligible for such a waiver. See AEDPA, Pub. L. No. 104-132, Title IV, &#167; 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1277 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that &#167; 440(d) of the AEDPA violates his right to equal protection by irrationally denying eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief to aliens who, like himself, are in deportation proceedings, while preserving such relief for aliens in exclusion proceedings. The district court agreed with Almon, granting his petition, and remanding his case to the BIA for a discretionary determination of the merits of Almon's application for relief under the old INA &#167; 212(c). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to better understand Almon's equal protection claim, some background information is necessary. Deportable aliens are aliens presently residing in the United States, but who are subject to deportation on various grounds. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a) (1996). Excludable aliens are those who seek to enter the United States to set up residence, and whom the Attorney General has the power to exclude. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a) (1996). Prior to the passage of the AEDPA, &#167; 212(c) of the INA provided that excludable aliens who were legal permanent residents of the United States for seven consecutive years and who traveled abroad voluntarily and temporarily could be re-admitted at the discretion of the Attorney General. See supra note 2. By its terms, &#167; 212(c) discretionary relief applied specifically and exclusively to excludable aliens seeking readmission, and not to aliens in deportation proceedings. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in 1956, in Matter of G.A., 7 I. &amp; N. Dec. 274 (BIA 1956), the BIA permitted a criminal alien in deportation proceedings to apply for a &#167; 212(c) waiver. See Matter of G.A., 7 I. &amp; N. at 275. The petitioner in that case was convicted of a drug offense in 1947. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 274. </span>In 1952, he briefly left the United States, and upon his return was readmitted. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> The INS </span>did not initiate deportation proceedings against G.A. until 1956. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> From 1947, </span>the date of his drug conviction, to 1956, G.A. did not suffer any additional convictions. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 274-75. </span>In holding that G.A. was eligible to apply for discretionary relief under &#167; 212(c), the BIA reasoned that if the Attorney General exercised his discretion under &#167; 212(c) and waived the ground of excludability based upon G.A.'s 1947 criminal conviction when G.A. sought readmission to the United States in 1952, a deportation proceeding based upon the same criminal conviction could not thereafter be initiated. See Matter of G.A., 7 I. &amp; N. at 275-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the BIA's holding in Matter of G.A., resident criminal aliens were routinely considered eligible for discretionary relief under &#167; 212(c) if, at some point after their convictions, they had temporarily departed the United States, been readmitted, and were in deportation proceedings. See, e.g., Matter of Tanori, 15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 566, 568 (BIA 1976) (\"Under section 212(c) of the Act, a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility may be granted in a deportation proceeding when, at the time of the alien's last entry, he was inadmissible because of the same facts which form the basis of his deportability.\"); Matter of Edwards, 10 I. &amp; N. Dec. 506 (BIA 1963) (holding that the fact that a resident criminal alien's status may have changed from excludable to deportable does not preclude the exercise of discretionary relief contained in &#167; 212(c)). At the same time, the BIA declined to extend &#167; 212(c) relief to otherwise eligible resident criminal aliens in deportation proceedings who had not departed the country after being convicted. See, e.g., Matter of Arias-Uribe, 13 I. &amp; N. Dec. 696 (BIA 1971). In this way, the BIA distinguished between two classes of deportable aliens: those who had traveled abroad after their convictions, and those who had never left the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distinction did not go unnoticed. In 1976, in Francis v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334136\"><a href=\"/opinion/334136/ernest-francis-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span> </a></span>(2d Cir. 1976), the Second Circuit held that the BIA's distinction between these two classes of deportable aliens violated equal protection. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334136\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/334136/ernest-francis-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>. Like G.A., the petitioner in Francis was in deportation proceedings but, unlike G.A., had never left the United States at any time after his conviction. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334136\"><a href=\"/opinion/334136/ernest-francis-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 269. </a></span>For this reason, the BIA deemed Francis ineligible for &#167; 212(c) relief and ordered him deported. In granting Francis's request for a declaration of his eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief, the Second Circuit explained that the government had failed to suggest any reason why a deportable alien's failure to travel abroad after a conviction should be a crucial factor in determining his eligibility for a &#167; 212(c) waiver. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 273. </span>Therefore, the Francis court concluded that distinguishing between different categories of deportable aliens based on whether they had departed and returned to the United States was \"wholly unrelated to any legitimate government interest.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> The remedy </span>for this constitutional violation was a remand to the BIA for a determination of the merits of Francis' application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the passage of the AEDPA, Almon, like the petitioner in Francis, would have been eligible for &#167; 212(c) relief. See Matter of Silva, 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26 (BIA 1976) (holding that, after Francis, &#167; 212(c) relief may be granted to permanent resident aliens in deportation proceedings). However, effective April 24, 1996, &#167; 440(d) of the AEDPA amended the last sentence of &#167; 212(c) to read: \"[t]his section shall not apply to an alien who is deportable by reason of having committed [various enumerated criminal offenses].\" AEDPA &#167; 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1277 (emphasis added). Although immigration judges initially applied this exclusion from &#167; 212(c) eligibility to both excludable and deportable criminal aliens, the BIA in In re Fuentes-Campos, Int. Dec. 3318 (BIA 1997), interpreted &#167; 440(d) as excluding only aliens in deportation proceedings from eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief. It is this interpretation of &#167; 440(d), limiting eligibility for &#167; 212(c) relief to criminal aliens in exclusion proceedings only, that Almon claims violates his right to equal protection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Specifically, Almon contends that there is no rational basis for treating two aliens convicted of exactly the same crime differently simply because one has chosen to leave the country while the other has not.

Among other things, this Act expressly repealed &#167; 212(c) of the INA as amended by &#167; 440(d) of the AEDPA, thus barring any discretionary relief for either deportable or excludable aliens. See IIRIRA &#167; 304(b), Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009. However, the IIRIRA did not take effect until April 1, 1997 and therefore did not affect deportation proceedings pending before that date. See IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1). In this case, the INS issued its Order to Show Cause on October 24, 1996. Therefore, the IIRIRA amendments do not apply to Almon's deportation proceedings.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
