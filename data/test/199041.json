After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submission, we affirm the order of\n\ndetention based on dangerousness and risk of flight, for the\n\nreasons stated by the magistrate judge and district judge\n\nbelow.   We add only that the presumption in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3142(e) applied here, and we see virtually no evidence\n\npresented    by   appellant   Jose   Padilla-Galarza   (“Padilla”)\n\nwhich would rebut the presumption of dangerousness.            The\n\nonly evidence tending to show Padilla might not return to\n\ndrug trafficking if released – the commendations he received\n\nas a police officer – are wholly unconvincing, given the\n\ngovernment’s proffer that he engaged in drug trafficking\n\nwhile still a member of the force.\n\n            Affirmed.     1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\f",
