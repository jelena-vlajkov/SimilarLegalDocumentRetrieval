PIERLUISI and LYDIA MORALES,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellants.\r\n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n       [Hon. Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                and O'Toole, District Judge.\r\n\n   Roberto Mrquez-Snchez and Law Offices of Benjamin Acosta,\r\nJr. on brief for appellants.\r\n   Irma R. Valldejuli on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                     November 19, 1999\r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  This appeal arises from a  1983\r\nsuit filed by Amilcar Guilloty-Perez in which he alleged that he\r\nwas subjected to adverse employment actions in retaliation for\r\nexercising his First Amendment rights to complain about public\r\nmismanagement and corruption.  Guilloty-Perez claimed that various\r\nindividuals at the Special Investigations Bureau of the Puerto Rico\r\nDepartment of Justice (SIB), where he was employed as a special\r\nagent, responded to his reports of operational irregularities\r\n(including his being a source for news articles about the SIB's\r\npoor handling of a drug investigation) by retaliating and punishing\r\nhim.  They did this by issuing negative performance evaluations,\r\nlodging disciplinary complaints against him, refusing to give him\r\nstatus as a permanent employee, and taking other actions.  Three of\r\nthe defendants, Jos Fuentes-Agostini, Lydia Morales, and Pedro\r\nPierluisi, filed a motion for summary judgment on qualified\r\nimmunity and other grounds.  Morales is the former director of the\r\nSIB; Pierluisi is the former Secretary of Justice.  The district\r\ncourt granted the motion as to Fuentes-Agostini, the Commonwealth's\r\npresent Secretary of Justice, but denied it as to the other\r\ndefendants.  Morales and Pierluisi appeal the qualified immunity\r\nportion of the district court's denial of summary judgment.\r\n      We have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  The\r\ndistrict court denied summary judgment on qualified immunity\r\ngrounds because there were material \"factual issues both as to the\r\nnature of the involvement of Morales and Pierluisi, as well as\r\ntheir motivations for their involvement.\"  At least facially, this\r\nbrings the appeal within the rule that \"a district court's pretrial\r\nrejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately\r\nappealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact\r\nor an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact.\" \r\nStella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1995).  In this case, \r\nthe district court's decision was based on the existence of genuine\r\nissues of material fact concerning the actions and motives of the\r\ndefendants, what government interests were served by how the SIB\r\nhandled these matters, and whether the SIB would have taken the\r\nsame actions irrespective of plaintiff's speech.  Further, the\r\ncourt found the evidence sufficient to raise an inference as to\r\ndefendants' personal involvement or at least acquiescence in\r\nretaliatory activities.  These issues are relevant to a First\r\nAmendment retaliation claim.  See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd.\r\nof Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977); Stella, 63 F.3d at 74-\r\n                            75.\r\n   The defendants' argument that Behrens v. Pelletier, 516\r\nU.S. 299 (1996), authorizes this appeal is to no avail.  Behrens\r\nallowed for interlocutory appeals from denials of summary judgment\r\nonly where the district court \"determines that certain conduct\r\nattributed to a defendant, if proven, will suffice to show a\r\nviolation of clearly established law.\"  Daz v. Daz Martnez, 112\r\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997).  That was clearly not the basis for the\r\n holding of the district court in denying summary judgment.\r\n    Because we have no jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\n",
