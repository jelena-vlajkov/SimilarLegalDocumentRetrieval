This case requires us for the\r\nfirst time to interpret the provisions of the Private Securities\r\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C.  78u-4.  Plaintiffs,\r\npurchasers of FTP Software stock from July 14, 1995 to January 3,\r\n1996, brought suit under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities\r\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.  78j(b), 78t(a).  During the\r\nperiod of plaintiffs' purchases, the stock reached a high of\r\n$38.875 per share.  On January 4, 1996, the company announced that\r\nsales growth had declined and that it would have lower earnings. \r\nThat same day, the stock price fell 52% on heavy trading, from\r\n$25.25 to $11.875 per share.  By August 9, 1996, the stock price\r\nwas $8 per share.  Plaintiffs' suit was filed on March 3, 1996.  It\r\nwas dismissed on September 24, 1998.  See Greebel v. FTP Software,\r\nInc., 182 F.R.D. 370, 376 (D. Mass. 1998).\r\nWe affirm the dismissal of the complaint under the\r\nstandards we now adopt:\r\n1. The PSLRA imposes requirements for pleading with particularity\r\nthat are consistent with this circuit's prior rigorous requirements\r\nfor pleading fraud with particularity under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\r\n2. The PSLRA mandates neither the adoption nor the rejection of\r\nparticular patterns of evidence to prove fraud and scienter, and\r\nthus does not alter this circuit's prior law on these points.\r\n3. The PSLRA does, significantly, impose a requirement that\r\npleadings raise a \"strong\" inference of scienter rather than a\r\nmerely \"reasonable\" inference of scienter.\r\n4. The PSLRA does not alter the previous definition of scienter,\r\none that in this circuit includes a narrowly defined concept of\r\nrecklessness which does not include ordinary negligence, but is\r\ncloser to being a lesser form of intent.\r\n                              I\r\nThe district court denied defendants' first motion to\r\ndismiss largely on the basis of the complaint's allegations that\r\ndefendants had routinely \"whited out\" the contingency terms\r\ninserted by customers into purchase orders; this was allegedly done\r\nin furtherance of a scheme to inflate revenues by improperly\r\nbooking contingent transactions as final sales.  After limited\r\ndiscovery, the district court concluded that plaintiffs could not\r\nprove the white-out claims and entered judgment on those claims. \r\nThe defendants renewed their motion to dismiss the complaint, and\r\nthe plaintiffs, in response, sought to make their allegations of\r\nfraud more specific by referring to discovered documents, but did\r\nnot formally move to amend.  The district court dismissed the\r\ncomplaint with prejudice, thus effectively denying the plaintiffs\r\nan opportunity to amend their complaint.  The court did so without\r\ndeciding whether, in light of the new evidence and allegations, the\r\ncomplaint was adequate to survive.\r\nPlaintiffs appeal saying that summary judgment on the\r\nwhite-out allegations was inappropriate; that they are given refuge\r\nby Rule 56(f); that the dismissal of the remaining allegations was\r\nimproper; and that they were entitled to amend their complaint.\r\n                              II\r\n The complaint alleges the following.  FTP Software, Inc.\r\ndevelops, markets, and supports Internet and Intranet software for\r\npersonal computers and networks.  By the beginning of the Class\r\nPeriod (from July 14, 1995 to January 3, 1996), the demand for\r\nFTP's software was diminishing because many of FTP's clients were\r\neither developing the technology themselves or acquiring competing\r\nsystems from other manufacturers, such as Microsoft and Netscape. \r\nMicrosoft, for example, was incorporating networking capabilities\r\ninto its new Windows 95 software, free of additional charge.  In\r\naddition, FTP was struggling to keep pace with \"revolutionary\"\r\ntechnological developments that threatened to render its software\r\nobsolete.  In response, FTP and several of its directors and\r\nofficers through fraudulent schemes inflated FTP's stock price and\r\nthen made various false statements and material omissions.  \r\nPlaintiffs allege that FTP failed to disclose the threats\r\nto its continued success, as well as several \"questionable\" sales\r\npractices.  These included the making of \"warehouse shipments\" --\r\nthat is, booking a fictitious sale of a product to a non-existent\r\nbuyer, shipping that product to a warehouse for storage, and then\r\neventually returning it to FTP.  According to plaintiffs, one FTP\r\nemployee who complained about these shipments, and who refused (in\r\nat least one instance) to sign for the product return, was\r\ndismissed as a result of his protest, all before the Class Period. \r\nOther objectionable sales practices included excessively discounted\r\nsales (as high as 90%) and \"channel stuffing\" activity that\r\ncompressed sales and orders into the final weeks of a fiscal\r\nquarter, with the intention of \"cosmetically\" improving the\r\nreported results for that quarter.  Finally, plaintiffs say that\r\nFTP failed to disclose its practice of inducing distributors to\r\npurchase more product than they needed by promising that the\r\ndistributors could return the unsold product.  Distributors would\r\nsend their orders to FTP with a notation that they were entitled to\r\nreturn any unsold product.  FTP then booked these sales as revenue,\r\nbut because FTP understood that recognizing such sales as revenue\r\nwas improper (because of a right of return existed), it allegedly\r\ninstructed the sales force to white-out these right-of-return\r\nnotations on the distributors' order forms. \r\nFTP also made several statements that the plaintiffs\r\ncharacterize as false or materially misleading.  On July 14, 1995,\r\nthe first day of the Class Period, David Zirkle, FTP's President\r\nand Chief Executive Officer, reported FTP's financial performance\r\nresults for the second fiscal quarter of 1995.  Zirkle declared:\r\n\"We are pleased with our performance for the second quarter.  Sales\r\ncontinue to be strong in both our U.S. and international channels.\" \r\nZirkle also touted the release of several new products, stating\r\nthat \"[t]hese products should help us achieve our revenue objective\r\nfor the second half of 1995.\"  Plaintiffs argue that these comments\r\n\"falsely convey[ed] the impression that sales were, and would\r\ncontinue to be, healthy and strong\" and that this false impression\r\nwas deliberately aided by FTP's failure to disclose that in or\r\naround January 1995, the French Post Office canceled its planned\r\npurchase of $10 million of FTP products \"due to the impending\r\nrelease of 'Windows '95.'\"\r\nOn the same day, Zirkle discussed FTP's impending\r\ncorporate \"reconfiguration\" into two business units.  He predicted\r\nthat \"FTP Software [would] lead the market in providing\r\napplications and support that make it possible to share information\r\nand access resources across workgroups, LAN's, enterprise networks\r\nand the global Internet.\"   After this announcement, FTP's stock\r\nfell from $31.75 to $28.25.  Zirkle dismissed this decline as\r\nmerely \"a 'knee-jerk' reaction to the short-term impact of the\r\nrestructuring on earnings,\" and on the next trading day, the stock\r\nrecovered, closing at $30.875.  Plaintiffs argue that these\r\ncomments were misleading because Zirkle did not disclose that FTP's\r\ncostly investments in its reorganization would have to be continued\r\nover the long term.\r\nFTP's management team next met with \"the investment\r\ncommunity and with securities analysts\" to promote the company's\r\nproducts and stock.  One securities firm rated FTP as a \"long-term\r\nbuy.\"  Plaintiffs assert that this report \"and the estimates\r\ncontained therein were based upon communications with the\r\nmanagement of FTP and were of a nature that could only have been\r\nprovided (or be based on specific information provided) by [FTP]\r\nand its management.\"\r\nMeanwhile, several of the individual defendants sold some\r\nof their FTP stock.  In total, the six individual defendants sold\r\nover $23 million in stock during the Class Period.  \r\nZirkle made another false statement, plaintiffs say, on\r\nOctober 25, 1995, when he reported FTP's financial results for the\r\nthird quarter of fiscal year 1995:\r\n  This was another excellent quarter for FTP.  Sales\r\ncontinue to grow both in our U.S. and international\r\nchannels . . . .  Our new ventures are also off to a good\r\nstart with revenues of $2.7 million. . . .  These new\r\nproducts have been well received by our channel partners\r\nand customers and will help us in our efforts to achieve\r\nfourth quarter revenue objectives.\r\n\nPlaintiffs assert that the \"new ventures\" Zirkle referred to were\r\nfailing to generate the expected new business.\r\nOn November 15, 1995, FTP filed its Form 10-Q report for\r\nthe third quarter of 1995 with the SEC.  The report revealed a\r\ndramatic increase in accounts receivable for the fiscal year ending\r\non December 31, 1994.  FTP explained that:\r\n  Such an increase is primarily attributable to increased\r\nunit sales and a relative increase, during the third\r\nquarter of 1995, in the number of units shipped during\r\nthe last month of such quarter compared to prior\r\nquarters.  The Company believes that it may continue to\r\nexperience such a relative increase as it continues to\r\ngrow, as is typical in the software industry.\r\n\nPlaintiffs claim that the 10-Q report, and these statements, were\r\nfalse and misleading because the increased unit sales were subject\r\nto the purchasers' right to return unsold merchandise and were not\r\nthe result of FTP's growth. \r\nFTP continued the \"drumbeat\" of misleading positive\r\nstatements, according to plaintiffs, when Zirkle, speaking in an\r\ninterview published in the November 27 - December 3, 1995 issue of\r\nMass High Tech, said that \"[t]he networking business (TCP/IP) is a\r\ncash cow that is feeding the development of other businesses, which\r\nare feeding back new technology that makes the core business even\r\nbetter.\"  In December 1995, two other securities firms issued\r\npositive reports on FTP; after these statements, FTP's stock rose.\r\nFinally, the complaint alleges, the \"truth [began] to\r\nemerge\" on January 4, 1996, when FTP announced that its earnings\r\nfor the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995 would be less than the same\r\nperiod in 1994.  FTP stated that this decline reflected, in part,\r\nthe company's investment in its New Ventures Business Unit, but,\r\nnonetheless, the company's stock fell $13.375 per share to close at\r\n$11.875 per share (a one-day decline of 52%).  Plaintiffs emphasize\r\nthat this decline represented a $27 drop in market value (an\r\napproximately 70% decrease) from a Class Period high of $38.875 per\r\nshare.\r\n                             III\r\nOn March 3, 1996, plaintiffs brought suit against FTP and\r\nthe individual defendants for violations of sections 10(b) and\r\n20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The defendants moved\r\nto dismiss.  The procedural history was recited above.  The\r\ndistrict court ultimately granted summary judgment on the white-out\r\nallegations because plaintiffs' only witness, Ms. Trudy Nichols,\r\nwas unavailable and her testimony was potentially inadmissible (as\r\nhearsay).  Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish that the\r\ndefendants had ordered the alteration of any documents.\r\nThe district court also granted the defendants' renewed\r\nmotion to dismiss.  The court found that the complaint failed to\r\nplead the circumstances of fraud with specificity, and could not\r\neven meet the pleading standards required to establish scienter\r\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\r\n                              IV\r\n                Interpretation of the PSLRA\r\nThe enactment of the PSLRA in 1995 marked a bipartisan\r\neffort to curb abuse in private securities lawsuits, particularly\r\nthe filing of strike suits.  See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, at\r\n32 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 731.\r\nThe PSLRA restated the requirements for securities fraud\r\nactions at subsections 21D(b)(1) and (2), codified at 15 U.S.C. \r\n78u-4(b)(1)-(2).  Those provisions, involved here, read as follows:\r\n  (b) Requirements for securities fraud actions\r\n  (1) Misleading statements and omissions\r\n    In any private action arising under this chapter in\r\nwhich the plaintiff alleges that the defendant  -\r\n\n      (A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or\r\n\n      (B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in\r\n    order to make the statements made, in the light of\r\n    the circumstances in which they were made, not\r\n    misleading;\r\n\n  the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to\r\nhave been misleading, the reason or reasons why the\r\nstatement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding\r\nthe statement or omission is made on information and\r\nbelief, the complaint shall state with particularity all\r\nfacts on which that belief is formed.\r\n\n  (2)  Required state of mind\r\n\n    In any private action arising under this chapter in\r\nwhich the plaintiff may recover money damages only on\r\nproof that the defendant acted with a particular state of\r\nmind, the complaint shall, with respect to each act or\r\nomission alleged to violate this chapter, state with\r\nparticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference\r\nthat the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\r\n\n15 U.S.C.  78u-4(b)(1)-(2).\r\nThe parties and the SEC as amicus have framed different\r\npossible interpretations of these provisions.  Essentially, these\r\nquestions are raised:\r\nFirst, did the PSLRA alter the standards for pleading fraud with\r\nparticularity previously adhered to by this circuit?\r\nSecond, did the PSLRA restrict the characteristic patterns of facts\r\nthat may be pleaded in order to establish a \"strong inference\" of\r\nscienter?  Specifically, are the two methods of showing scienter\r\nendorsed earlier by the Second Circuit -- motive and opportunity or\r\ncircumstantial evidence of reckless or conscious behavior\r\nsufficient to raise a \"'strong inference' of fraudulent intent,\"\r\nsee, e.g., In re Time Warner Inc. Sec. Litig., 9 F.3d 259, 268-69\r\n(2d Cir. 1993) (quoting  O'Brien v. National Property Analysts\r\nPartners, 936 F.2d 674, 676 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted)) -- now available?  \r\nThird, did the PSLRA alter the scienter requirement for actions\r\nunder section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R.  240.10b-5? \r\nSpecifically, is some form of recklessness sufficient to satisfy\r\nthe scienter requirement? \r\nThe parties and amicus all rely heavily on competing\r\nexcerpts from the congressional history of the Act and on the pre-\r\nAct case law from the Second Circuit.\r\nThe words of the statute are the first guide to any\r\ninterpretation of the meaning of the statute.  The usual maxim is\r\nthat courts do not go beyond the text of the statute if the meaning\r\nis plain.  See United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 328 v.\r\nAlmac's Inc., 90 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996).  But that maxim has\r\ninherent flexibility.  Even seemingly straightforward text should\r\nbe informed by the purpose and context of the statute.  See\r\nStafford v. Briggs, 444 U.S. 527, 535 (1980); Puerto Rico Tel. Co.\r\nv. Telecommunications Regulatory Bd., No. 98-2228, 1999 WL 618061,\r\nat *6 (1st Cir. Aug. 19, 1999).  Both this court and the Supreme\r\nCourt have checked a sense of a statute's plain meaning against\r\nundisputed legislative history as a guard against judicial error. \r\nSee, e.g., Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 586\r\n(1983) (\"It is a well-established canon of statutory construction\r\nthat a court should go beyond the literal language of a statute if\r\nreliance on that language would defeat the plain purpose of the\r\nstatute . . . .\"); Cablevision of Boston v. Public Improvement\r\nComm'n, 184 F.3d 88, 101 (1st Cir. 1999).  If the meaning is not\r\nplain from the words of the statute, then resort to legislative\r\nhistory is required.  See Akins v. Penobscot Nation, 130 F.3d 482,\r\n488 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nOn some of the points neither text nor history is\r\nindisputably clear.  The legislative history is irretrievably\r\nconflicted as to the second issue -- which characteristic patterns\r\nof facts may be pleaded in order to establish a \"strong inference\"\r\nof scienter -- with all sides finding some support for their\r\npositions.  About all that can be said with confidence on that\r\nissue is that Congress agreed on the need to curb abuses, that it\r\nattempted to do so in the guise of what are articulated as\r\nprocedural requirements, and that there was agreement on the words\r\nof the statute and on little else.  And so we return to the text of\r\nthe statute and its purpose.\r\nA.  Pleading Standards for Fraud Allegations\r\nThe text of the Act requires now that any complaint\r\nalleging that a statement or omission is misleading must:\r\n         1.     specify each statement alleged to have been\r\n       misleading,\r\n         2.     [specify] the reason or reasons why the statement\r\n       is misleading,\r\n         3.     and, if an allegation regarding the statement or\r\n       omission is made on information and belief, . . .\r\n       state with particularity all facts on which that\r\n       belief is formed. \r\n\n15 U.S.C.  78u-4(b)(1).  The effect of this is to embody in the\r\nAct itself at least the standards of Rule 9(b), Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\nBefore the PSLRA, a securities fraud claim had to meet\r\nthe standards set by Rule 9(b).  See Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard,\r\nInc., 754 F.2d 430, 439 (1st Cir. 1985).  Rule 9(b) provides that\r\n\"[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances\r\nconstituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. \r\nMalice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person\r\nmay be averred generally.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  This circuit has\r\ninterpreted Rule 9(b) to require \"specification of the time, place,\r\nand content of an alleged false representation.\"  McGinty v.\r\nBeranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir. 1980). \r\n\"Even where allegations are based on information and belief,\r\nsupporting facts on which the belief is founded must be set forth\r\nin the complaint.  And this holds true even when the fraud relates\r\nto matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the opposing party.\" \r\nHayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 444 (1st Cir. 1985) (internal\r\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\r\nThe PSLRA's pleading standard is congruent and consistent\r\nwith the pre-existing standards of this circuit.  This circuit has\r\nbeen notably strict and rigorous in applying the Rule 9(b) standard\r\nin securities fraud actions.  See Maldonado v. Domnguez, 137 F.3d\r\n1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"This court has been especially rigorous in\r\napplying Rule 9(b) in securities fraud actions . . . .\") (quotation\r\nmarks omitted); Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1223\r\n(1st Cir. 1996) (similar); Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929\r\nF.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"We have been especially rigorous in\r\ndemanding . . . factual support in the securities context . . .\r\n.\").\r\nThe requirements of the PSLRA's new pleading standard in\r\n78u-4(b)(1) were largely imposed under First Circuit law,\r\nalthough this court has not used the same precise terminology. \r\nFirst, this court had already required a fraud plaintiff to specify\r\neach allegedly misleading statement or omission.  See, e.g.,\r\nRomani, 929 F.2d at 878 (plaintiffs' isolation of the offering\r\nmaterials as the source of the alleged fraud was \"sufficient to\r\nidentify the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations\");\r\nNew England Data Servs., 829 F.2d at 292 (rejecting plaintiffs'\r\nclaims as merely \"conclusory allegations of mail and wire fraud .\r\n. . with no description of any time, place or content of the\r\ncommunication\").\r\nSecond, this court has required a securities fraud\r\nplaintiff to explain why the challenged statement or omission is\r\nmisleading by requiring that \"the complaint . . . provide some\r\nfactual support for the allegations of fraud.\"  Romani, 929 F.2d at\r\n878 (citation omitted).  This means that the plaintiff must not\r\nonly allege the time, place, and content of the alleged\r\nmisrepresentations with specificity, but also the \"factual\r\nallegations that would support a reasonable inference that adverse\r\ncircumstances existed at the time of the offering, and were known\r\nand deliberately or recklessly disregarded by defendants.\"  Id.\r\nFinally, this court has required plaintiffs who bring\r\ntheir claims on information and belief to \"set forth the source of\r\nthe information and the reasons for the belief.\"  Romani, 929 F.2d\r\nat 878; see also New England Data Servs., 829 F.2d at 288; Hayduk,\r\n775 F.2d at 444-45; Wayne Inv., Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d\r\n11, 13 (1st Cir. 1984).\r\nOur previous strict pleading requirements under Rule 9(b)\r\nare, in our view, consistent with the PSLRA.  See Maldonado, 137\r\nF.3d at 10 n.6.\r\nB.  Pleading Required State of Mind: Characteristic Fact Patterns\r\nWhere a plaintiff can recover money damages on proof that\r\na defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the PSLRA now\r\nrequires a complaint to \"state with particularity facts giving rise\r\nto a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required\r\nstate of mind.\"  15 U.S.C.  78u-4(b)(2).  The \"required state of\r\nmind\" for liability under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is referred\r\nto as scienter, which the Supreme Court has defined as \"a mental\r\nstate embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\"  Ernst\r\n&amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976).\r\nThe debate between the plaintiffs and the defendants is\r\nlargely over whether Congress intended to embody, as the SEC says,\r\nthe prior Second Circuit methods for proving scienter (i.e., by\r\nshowing motive and opportunity or evidence of reckless or conscious\r\nbehavior sufficient to raise a strong inference) or, as the\r\ndefendants say, to prohibit use of at least the motive and\r\nopportunity method.  This focus of the parties is not surprising,\r\nas there was much debate in Congress on these points.\r\nThe plaintiffs and the SEC argue that the PSLRA does not\r\nprohibit use of the Second Circuit's methods for proving scienter. \r\nThey refer to the bill reported out of the Senate Committee on\r\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, see S. 240, 104th Cong. \r\n104(b) (1995), reprinted in 141 Cong. Rec. S9222 (daily ed. June\r\n28, 1995), and to the Senate Report, which states, in part, that:\r\n  The Committee does not adopt a new and untested pleading\r\nstandard that would generate additional litigation. \r\nInstead, the Committee chose a uniform standard modeled\r\nupon the pleading standard of the Second Circuit. . . .\r\n[T]he Second Circuit requires that the plaintiff plead\r\nfacts that give rise to a \"strong inference\" of\r\ndefendant's fraudulent intent.  The Committee does not\r\nintend to codify the Second Circuit's caselaw\r\ninterpreting this pleading standard, although courts may\r\nfind this body of law instructive.\r\n\nS. Res. 98, 104th Cong., at 15 (1995), reprinted in 1995\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 694 (footnotes omitted).  They also rely on the\r\ncomments of Senator Dodd, co-sponsor of the PSLRA, explaining that\r\nCongress intended to codify the Second Circuit's \"pleading\r\nstandards.\"  141 Cong. Rec. S17960 (daily ed. Dec. 5, 1995). \r\nFinally, they argue that their position is bolstered by the\r\nStatement of Managers of the Securities Litigation Uniform\r\nStandards Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-353, 112 Stat. 3227, which\r\ndeclared that \"the managers again emphasize that the clear intent\r\nin 1995 and our continuing intent in this legislation is that\r\nneither the Reform Act nor [the Standards Act] in any way alters\r\nthe scienter standard in Federal securities fraud suits.\"  Joint\r\nExplanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference, Conference\r\nReport to Accompany S. 1260, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-803 (\"1998\r\nConf. Rep.\"), at 15 (1998).\r\nThe defendants argue that allegations of the existence of\r\nmotive and opportunity to commit fraud (or simple recklessness) do\r\nnot satisfy the scienter requirement.  To support their view, they\r\nnote Congress' statement that \"[t]he Conference Committee language\r\nis based in part on the pleading standard of the Second Circuit,\"\r\n(emphasis added) and that \"[b]ecause the Conference Committee\r\nintends to strengthen existing pleading requirements, it does not\r\nintend to codify the Second Circuit's case law interpreting this\r\npleading standard.\"  H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-369, at 41 (1995),\r\nreprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 740.  Defendants also rely\r\nheavily on the footnote associated with this sentence, which\r\nstates: \"For this reason, the Conference Report chose not to\r\ninclude in the pleading standard certain language relating to\r\nmotive, opportunity, or recklessness.\"  Id. at 41 n.23, reprinted\r\nin 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 747.  Further, the defendants emphasize\r\nthat although the Senate Bill (S. 240) included an amendment that\r\nwould codify Second Circuit law, the Conference Committee\r\neliminated that amendment.  See Amend. 1485, S. 240, 104th Cong.,\r\n1st Sess. (1995), 141 Cong. Rec. S9170 (daily ed. June 27, 1995). \r\nFinally, the defendants place considerable weight on\r\nCongress' decision to override President Clinton's veto, in light\r\nof the President's statement that in the Act Congress \"intended to\r\n'strengthen' the existing pleading requirements of the Second\r\nCircuit . . . [and] to erect a higher barrier to bringing suit than\r\nany now existing[.]\"  H.R. Doc. No. 104-150, 104th Cong., 1st Sess.\r\n(1995), 141 Cong. Rec. H15214 (Dec. 20, 1995).  Counsel for\r\ndefendant FTP candidly admitted before the district court that the\r\nlegislative history standing alone could be read either way, but\r\nargued that the President's veto -- based on his reading of the Act\r\nas overruling the Second Circuit motive and opportunity test --\r\nadministered the coup de grace.  While the President's view of what\r\nCongress meant has some informational value, we give that view\r\nlittle weight: the real issue is what the intent was of the\r\nCongress, not the President. \r\nThe legislative history is inconclusive on whether the\r\nAct was meant to either embody or to reject the Second Circuit's\r\npleading standards.  As the Third Circuit has noted, \"[t]he Reform\r\nAct's legislative history on this point is ambiguous and even\r\ncontradictory.\"  In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 531\r\n(3d Cir. 1999).  The history and text show no agreement to restrict\r\nthe types of evidence which may be used to show a strong inference\r\nof scienter.  Indeed, it would be unusual for Congress to legislate\r\non what fact patterns could or could not prove fraud or scienter. \r\nAt best, there appears to have been an agreement to disagree on the\r\nissue of Second Circuit standards (other than the strong inference\r\nstandard), and perhaps, as is common, to leave such matters for\r\ncourts to resolve.  See, e.g., Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,\r\n118 S. Ct. 2257, 2264 (1998).\r\nFrom the words of the Act, certain conclusions can be\r\ndrawn.  First, Congress plainly contemplated that scienter could be\r\nproven by inference, thus acknowledging the role of indirect and\r\ncircumstantial evidence.  See 15 U.S.C.  78u-4(b)(2) (requiring\r\nthat \"the complaint . . . state with particularity facts giving\r\nrise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the\r\nrequired state of mind\") (emphasis added).  Second, the words of\r\nthe Act neither mandate nor prohibit the use of any particular\r\nmethod to establish an inference of scienter.  Third, Congress has\r\neffectively mandated a special standard for measuring whether\r\nallegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss.  While under\r\nRule 12(b)(6) all inferences must be drawn in plaintiffs' favor,\r\ninferences of scienter do not survive if they are merely\r\nreasonable, as is true when pleadings for other causes of action\r\nare tested by motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Conley v.\r\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  Rather, inferences of scienter\r\nsurvive a motion to dismiss only if they are both reasonable and\r\n\"strong\" inferences.\r\nIndeed, the debate about adoption or rejection of prior\r\nSecond Circuit standards strikes us as somewhat beside the point. \r\nThe categorization of patterns of facts as acceptable or\r\nunacceptable to prove scienter or to prove fraud has never been the\r\napproach this circuit has taken to securities fraud.  As stated in\r\nMaldonado, 137 F.3d at 10 n.6, this court has never adopted the\r\nSecond Circuit test.  Instead we have analyzed the particular facts\r\nalleged in each individual case to determine whether the\r\nallegations were sufficient to support scienter.  See, e.g., Shaw\r\nv. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1209 (1st Cir. 1996).  In\r\nthis, the approach of this circuit has been like that taken by the\r\nSupreme Court as to the issue of materiality in Basic Inc. v.\r\nLevinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988).  \r\nThis court has considered many different types of\r\nevidence as relevant to show scienter.  Examples include: insider\r\ntrading (discussed below); divergence between internal reports and\r\nexternal statements on the same subject (see Serabian  v. Amoskeag\r\nBank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir. 1994)); closeness in\r\ntime of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later\r\ndisclosure of inconsistent information (see Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1224-\r\n25); evidence of bribery by a top company official (see Greenstone\r\nv. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992)); existence of an\r\nancillary lawsuit charging fraud by a company and the company's\r\nquick settlement of that suit (see id.); disregard of the most\r\ncurrent factual information before making statements (see Glassman\r\nv. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 627 (1st Cir. 1996));\r\ndisclosure of accrual basis information in a way which could only\r\nbe understood by a sophisticated person with a high degree of\r\naccounting skill (see Holmes v. Bateson, 583 F.2d 542, 552 (1st\r\nCir. 1978)); the personal interest of certain directors in not\r\ninforming disinterested directors of impending sale of stock (see\r\nEstate of Soler v. Rodrguez, 63 F.3d 45, 54 (1st Cir. 1995)); and\r\nthe self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving\r\ntheir salaries or jobs (see Serabian, 24 F.3d at 368).  While a\r\nnumber of these cases could be thought of as falling into motive\r\nand opportunity patterns, this court continues to prefer a more\r\nfact-specific inquiry.  See, e.g., Glassman, 90 F.3d at 624 (fact\r\nthat lead underwriter may have had incentive to inflate the\r\noffering price was significant, but overall, complaint failed to\r\nstate a claim on which relief could be granted).\r\nThe most salient feature of the PSLRA is that whatever\r\nthe characteristic pattern of the facts alleged, those facts must\r\nnow present a strong inference of scienter.  A mere reasonable\r\ninference is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.  Our pre-\r\nAct case law had used both the language of \"strong\" inference and\r\nof \"reasonable\" inference in various contexts.  For example,\r\n\"strong inference\" is used in Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 9 and Suna v.\r\nBailey Corp., 107 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 1997).  \"Reasonable\r\ninference\" language was used in Gross v. Summa Four Inc., 93 F.3d\r\n987, 996 (1st Cir. 1996); Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1224; Serabian, 24 F.3d\r\nat 368; Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 25; and Romani, 929 F.2d at 878. \r\nIt is clear that scienter allegations now must be judged under the\r\n\"strong inference\" standard at the motion to dismiss stage.\r\nOur view of the Act is thus close to that articulated by\r\nthe Sixth Circuit.  That court held that a plaintiff could survive\r\na motion to dismiss by \"pleading facts that give rise to a strong\r\ninference of [scienter].\"  In re Comshare, Inc. Sec. Litig., 183\r\nF.3d 542, 550 (6th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nThe Sixth Circuit found that evidence of motive and opportunity to\r\ncommit fraud did not, of itself, constitute scienter for purposes\r\nof section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  See id. at 551.  \"Indeed, those\r\ncourts addressing motive and opportunity in Securities Act cases\r\nhave held only that facts showing a motive and opportunity may\r\nadequately allege scienter, not that the existence of motive and\r\nopportunity may support, as scienter itself, liability under  10b\r\nor Rule 10b-5.\"  Id.  The court held that evidence of motive and\r\nopportunity was \"relevant\" to pleading facts that could establish\r\nscienter, and, on occasion, could \"rise to the level of creating a\r\nstrong inference of reckless or knowing conduct.\"  Id. \r\nNevertheless, such evidence, standing alone, could not \"constitute\r\nthe pleading of a strong inference of scienter.\"  Id.; accord\r\nBryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., No. 98-9253, 1999 WL 688050, at *8\r\n(11th Cir. Sept. 3, 1999).\r\nWithout adopting any pleading litany of motive and\r\nopportunity, we reject defendants' argument that facts showing\r\nmotive and opportunity can never be enough to permit the drawing of\r\na strong inference of scienter.  But, as we cautioned in Maldonado,\r\n137 F.3d at 10 n.6, merely pleading motive and opportunity,\r\nregardless of the strength of the inferences to be drawn of\r\nscienter, is not enough.  Three circuits have interpreted the PSLRA\r\nas permitting use of motive and opportunity type pleading if it\r\nraises a strong inference.  See In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig.,\r\n180 F.3d 525, 534-35 (3d Cir. 1999); Press v. Chemical Inv. Servs.\r\nCorp., 166 F.3d 529, 537-38 (2d Cir. 1999); Williams v. WMX Techs.,\r\nInc., 112 F.3d 175, 178 (5th Cir. 1997) (dicta).  Like the Third\r\nCircuit, we caution that \"catch-all allegations that defendants\r\nstood to benefit from wrongdoing and had the opportunity to\r\nimplement a fraudulent scheme are [not] sufficient.\"  In re Advanta\r\nCorp., 180 F.3d at 535.\r\nSimilarly, the PSLRA neither prohibits nor endorses the\r\npleading of insider trading as evidence of scienter, but requires\r\nthat the evidence meet the \"strong inference\" standard.  Unusual\r\ntrading or trading at suspicious times or in suspicious amounts by\r\ncorporate insiders has long been recognized as probative of\r\nscienter.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1204; Rubinstein v. Collins, 20\r\nF.3d 160, 169-70 (5th Cir. 1994); Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26.  The\r\nvitality of the inference to be drawn depends on the facts, and can\r\nrange from marginal, see Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1204, to strong, see\r\nRubinstein, 20 F.3d at 169-70.  This continues to be true in\r\nlitigation after the effective date of the PSLRA.  Indeed, in\r\nGreenstone we noted, and still think today, that allegations of\r\nunusual insider trading by a defendant with access to material non-\r\npublic information can support a strong inference of scienter.  See\r\nGreenstone, 975 F.2d at 26.  We similarly caution that mere\r\npleading of insider trading, without regard to either context or\r\nthe strength of the inferences to be drawn, is not enough.  See\r\nMaldonado, 137 F.3d at 9-10.  At a minimum, the trading must be in\r\na context where defendants have incentives to withhold material,\r\nnon-public information, and it must be unusual, well beyond the\r\nnormal patterns of trading by those defendants.\r\nC.  Substantive Scienter Standards\r\nThe parties disagree about the effect, if any, of the\r\nPSLRA on the substantive standard for proving scienter.  We start\r\nwith the state of the law in this circuit before the enactment of\r\nthe PSLRA.\r\nThe Supreme Court has defined scienter as \"a mental state\r\nembracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\"  Ernst &amp;\r\nErnst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976).  The Court\r\nexplicitly reserved the issue of whether recklessness sufficed,\r\nsaying \"[i]n certain areas of the law recklessness is considered to \r\nbe a form of intentional conduct for purposes of imposing liability\r\nfor some act.\"  Id.  Before enactment of the PSLRA, most circuits\r\nhad held that scienter in civil securities fraud actions could be\r\nshown by showing recklessness.  It is accepted that recklessness\r\nmay establish intent to defraud in criminal prosecutions under \r\n17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and under the mail and wire fraud\r\nstatutes.  See 8 L. Loss and J. Seligman, Securities Regulation\r\n3656-57 (3d ed. 1991).  The question became whether the standard\r\nfor criminal liability should also apply to civil liability.  That,\r\nin turn, raised the question of what was meant by recklessness.\r\nWe have used a definition of recklessness articulated by\r\nthe Seventh Circuit:\r\n  [R]eckless conduct may be defined as a highly\r\nunreasonable omission, involving not merely simple, or\r\neven inexcusable, negligence, but an extreme departure\r\nfrom the standards of ordinary care, and which presents\r\na danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either\r\nknown to the defendant or is so obvious the actor must\r\nhave been aware of it.\r\n\nSundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chem. Corp., 553 F.2d 1033, 1045 (7th Cir.\r\n1977) (quoting Franke v. Midwestern Okla. Dev. Auth., 428 F. Supp.\r\n719, 725 (W.D. Okla. 1976)).  Without at first explicitly adopting\r\nthat standard, this court assumed that it applied and cited it with\r\napproval in Cook v. Avien, Inc., 573 F.2d 685, 692 (1st Cir. 1978). \r\nIn Hoffman v. Estabrook &amp; Co., 587 F.2d 509, 515-16 (1st Cir.\r\n1978), this court again assumed that recklessness could ground a\r\nRule 10b-5 action and, again, quoted with approval a Seventh\r\nCircuit definition:\r\n    In view of the Supreme Court's analysis in\r\nHochfelder of the statutory scheme of implied private\r\nremedies and express remedies, the definition of\r\n\"reckless behavior\" should not be a liberal one lest any\r\ndiscernible distinction between \"scienter\" and\r\n\"negligence\" be obliterated for these purposes.  We\r\nbelieve \"reckless\" in these circumstances comes closer to\r\nbeing a lesser form of intent than merely a greater\r\ndegree of ordinary negligence.  We perceive it to be not\r\njust a difference in degree, but also in kind.\r\n\nSanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., 554 F.2d 790, 793 (7th Cir. 1977). \r\nThis court explicitly rejected a formulation of recklessness as\r\nmere negligence, finding it had to come closer to being a lesser\r\nform of intent than merely a greater degree of ordinary negligence. \r\nSee Hoffman, 587 F.2d at 516 &amp; n.10. \r\nIn Serabian this court held that it was error to dismiss\r\na securities fraud complaint that alleged sufficient facts to draw\r\n\"an inference that the [defendant] knew, or should have known, that\r\nits public statements were inconsistent with the actual conditions\r\nthen being reported to [it].\"  Serabian, 24 F.3d at 365 (emphasis\r\nadded and original emphasis omitted).  We understand Serabian to\r\nhave used \"should have known\" in the reckless disregard sense used\r\nin Cook and Hoffman.  This court has explicitly tested factual\r\nallegations to see whether they supported an inference that\r\ndefendants acted with reckless disregard.  See Romani, 929 F.2d at\r\n878.  Since then, there have been encapsulated references to this\r\nrule in dicta in other cases.  See, e.g., Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 9\r\nn.4.  The rule in this circuit has been to accept recklessness, as\r\nnarrowly defined in the two Seventh Circuit cases (Sundstrand and\r\nSanders), as a method of proving scienter.  See Serabian, 24 F.3d\r\nat 365.  That definition of recklessness does not encompass\r\nordinary negligence and is closer to a lesser form of intent. \r\nThe effect of the PSLRA on the standard for scienter has\r\nbeen much disputed.  The Act itself is silent on the general\r\nscienter requirements for 10b-5 actions, referring only to scienter\r\nas \"the required state of mind.\"  15 U.S.C.  78u-4(b)(2).  \r\nPlaintiffs and the SEC maintain that the PSLRA did not intend or\r\npurport to change whatever the preexisting standard was, and that\r\nstandard included some form of recklessness.  The defendants say\r\nthat only the most heightened recklessness standard should be used,\r\nand that the SEC's views are not entitled to any weight.\r\nThe circuit courts have reached different results.  A\r\npanel in the Ninth Circuit has held that the PSLRA elevated the\r\nstandard to one of \"deliberate recklessness,\" In re Silicon\r\nGraphics Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.  1999).  One\r\ndistrict court within this circuit has concluded that recklessness\r\nis insufficient and that only conscious conduct would suffice under\r\nthe Act.  See Friedberg v. Discreet Logic Inc., 959 F. Supp. 42, 48\r\n(D. Mass. 1997).\r\nIn contrast, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that the\r\nPSLRA did not alter the state of mind requirement and thus a\r\ncomplaint pleading facts that give rise to a \"'strong inference of\r\nrecklessness' of the kind required for securities fraud liability\"\r\nsuffices.  In re Comshare, Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 542, 552-53\r\n(6th Cir. 1999).  The Sixth Circuit had previously adopted, as had\r\nthis circuit, the Sundstrand definition of recklessness, see id. at\r\n550, and concluded that same standard applied after the PSLRA was\r\nenacted.  The Eleventh Circuit has expressed its \"basic agreement\"\r\nwith the Sixth Circuit, Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., No. 98-9253,\r\n1999 WL 688050, at *8 (11th Cir. Sept. 3, 1999), holding that the\r\nPSLRA did not \"substantively change the actionable level of\r\nscienter,\" id. at *10.  The Third Circuit has concluded that\r\n\"[a]lthough the Reform Act established a uniform pleading standard,\r\nit did not purport to alter the substantive contours of scienter,\"\r\nIn re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 534 (3d Cir. 1999),\r\nand reiterated its prior law that recklessness, as defined in\r\nSundstrand, suffices, see id.  Without much discussion of the\r\nissue, the Second Circuit has adhered to its previous acceptance of\r\nrecklessness.  See Press v. Chemical Inv. Servs. Corp., 166 F.3d\r\n529, 537-38 (2d Cir. 1999).  The Fourth Circuit has also concluded\r\nthat the PSLRA did not change the pre-existing scienter standard. \r\nSee Phillips v. LCI Int'l, Inc., No. 98-2572, 1999 WL 717253, at\r\n*11 (4th Cir. Sept. 15, 1999) (\"[T]o establish scienter, a\r\nplaintiff must still prove that the defendant acted intentionally,\r\nwhich may perhaps be shown by recklessness.\").  Two district courts\r\nin this circuit have reached the conclusion that some form of\r\nrecklessness is available.  See In re PLC Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig.,\r\n41 F.Supp.2d 106, 115 (D. Mass 1999); Lirette v. Shiva Corp., 27\r\nF.Supp.2d 268, 282 (D. Mass. 1998).\r\nWe agree with those courts that hold that the PSLRA did\r\nnot address the substantive definition of scienter.  The\r\nlegislative history shows no such intent and the language of the\r\nAct itself does not address the topic.  See generally Dunn, Note,\r\nPleading Scienter After the Private Securities Litigation Reform\r\nAct, 84 Cornell L. Rev. 193 (1998).  The opinions of the Sixth and\r\nThird Circuits discuss these points ably and there is no reason to\r\nrepeat the discussion here. \r\nWe add additional reasons that buttress this conclusion. \r\nThe PSLRA does in fact discuss the role of \"knowing\" violations,\r\nand thus an aspect of scienter, in two different respects.  The\r\nfirst concerns contribution; the second, \"safe harbors\" for\r\ndefendants.  As to contribution, the Act, through a new  21D(g),\r\nadded a section \"to preserve joint and several liability for\r\npersons who knowingly commit securities fraud, but otherwise to\r\nproportionately limit liability to the 'portion of the judgment\r\nthat corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that\r\ncovered person.'\"  10 Loss &amp; Seligman, at 4687 (quoting 15 U.S.C.\r\n78u-4(f)(2)(B)(i)).  The PSLRA specifies that:\r\n  [a]ny covered person against whom a final judgment is\r\nentered in a private action shall be liable for damages\r\njointly and severally only if the trier of fact\r\nspecifically determines that such covered person\r\nknowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.\r\n\n15 U.S.C.  78u-4(f)(2)(A).  In turn \"knowingly commits a violation\r\nof the securities laws\" is defined (for 10b-5 purposes) as\r\nrequiring \"actual knowledge\" that a representation is false or an\r\nomission renders a representation false.  Id.  78u-4(f)(10)(A). \r\nThe definition specifically excludes \"reckless conduct\" as a basis\r\nfor construing a knowing commission of a violation.  Id.  78-\r\nu(f)(10)(B).\r\nThese special contribution provisions lead to several\r\nconclusions.  Congress, having explicitly eliminated recklessness\r\nas a basis for imposing joint and several liability, should not be\r\ntaken as implicitly having eliminated recklessness as a basis for\r\nany liability.  See In re Silicon Graphics, 183 F.3d at 995\r\n(Browning, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Because\r\njoint and several liability is more onerous than individual\r\nliability, the exclusion of recklessness as the basis for imposing\r\njoint and several liability constitutes a recognition that some\r\nform of recklessness may suffice for individual liability. \r\nFurthermore, Congress took great care to insure that the actual\r\nknowledge requirement was restricted to the joint and several\r\nliability provisions of the Act.  Section 78u-4(f)(1) provides that\r\n\"nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create, affect,\r\nor in any manner modify, the standard for liability associated with\r\nany action arising under the securities laws.\"  15 U.S.C.  78-\r\nu(f)(1).  Including this language would not make sense if Congress\r\nhad altered the general scienter requirement to restrict it to\r\nactual knowledge.\r\nThe \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Act similarly\r\nbuttress the conclusion that the Act did not alter pre-existing law\r\ndefining scienter.  The PSLRA adopted a statutory \"safe harbor\" by\r\nadding a new section 27A to the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C.  77z-2, and a\r\nnew section 21E to the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C.  78u-5.  The safe\r\nharbor has two alternative inlets: the first shelters forward-\r\nlooking statements that are accompanied by meaningful cautionary\r\nstatements.  See 15 U.S.C.  78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i).  The second inlet\r\nis of importance here.  It focuses on the state of mind of the\r\ndefendant and precludes liability for a forward-looking statement\r\nunless the maker of the statement had actual knowledge it was false\r\nor misleading.  See  78u-5(c)(1)(B); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369\r\n(1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 743.  Again, this new\r\nsection 21E to the 1934 Act is explicit, in contrast with the lack\r\nof such language in the definition of scienter in  21D(b)(2).  See\r\nBryant, 1999 WL 688050, at *10; In re Silicon Graphics, 183 F.3d at\r\n995 (Browning, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\r\nConcluding that the Act does not alter the pre-existing\r\ndefinition of scienter adopted by this circuit, we accordingly test\r\nthe complaint against that definition.\r\n                              V\r\n     Application of Standards to Plaintiffs' Complaint\r\nWe review the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint de novo,\r\ngiving plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences, but\r\nholding plaintiffs to the standard of showing a strong inference of\r\nscienter.  See Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 991 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  We think the claims are either insufficiently\r\nparticularized or, where particularized, do not permit a strong\r\ninference of scienter.\r\nAt the heart of plaintiffs' case is the allegation that\r\ndefendants consistently overstated the earnings of the company by\r\nimproperly booking as revenue (and inadequately reserving) \"sales\"\r\nthat were actually contingent transactions.  This was improper,\r\nplaintiffs say, under generally accepted accounting principles\r\n(\"GAAP\"), specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standards\r\nNo. 48 (\"FAS 48\").  Plaintiffs claim that the sales were contingent\r\nbecause there were unlimited return rights.  Plaintiffs say that\r\nthey have evidence both tending directly to show conscious\r\nwrongdoing on the part of defendants and circumstantial evidence\r\nfrom which such wrongdoing may be inferred, including that the\r\ndefendants had both motive and opportunity.\r\nA.  Direct Evidence of Scienter\r\nTwo types of allegations tend to show conscious\r\nwrongdoing: the \"white-out\" and the warehousing allegations.\r\n1.  The \"White-Out\" Allegations and the Rule 56(f) Motion\r\nThe \"white-out\" allegations claimed that FTP personnel\r\n\"whited out\" (in a manner undetectable to company auditors) the\r\ncustomers' additions to standard purchase orders; those additions\r\nmade orders contingent on the customers' unlimited right to return\r\nthe goods to FTP.  The white-out allegations were powerful, as the\r\ndistrict court recognized in initially denying the motion to\r\ndismiss.  If adequately supported, claims that management\r\ndeliberately altered company records to hide material information\r\nfrom company auditors could well create strong inferences of\r\nscienter.  But, as the district court correctly ruled on summary\r\njudgment, plaintiffs could not produce admissible evidence to\r\nsupport the white-out allegations, and so we disregard these\r\nallegations.\r\n2. The Warehousing Allegations\r\nThe warehousing allegations remain.  In essence, the\r\ncomplaint asserts that at some time before the Class Period, the\r\ncompany made a phony sale or sales and caused to be booked as goods\r\nsold certain product that was shipped to a warehouse and not to\r\ncustomers; the company then recognized the revenue from such phony\r\nsales.  After a period, the product was sent back from the\r\nwarehouse as \"returned\" goods.  The allegations state that Robert\r\nCasa, an employee who refused to sign for the \"returned\" product\r\nand complained about the practice, was fired.  If true, such\r\npractices by a company are very serious.  See United States v.\r\nBradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming a criminal\r\nconviction for, inter alia, \"knowingly falsifying [a company's]\r\nbooks and records in an attempt to conceal [securities] fraud\").\r\nThe complaint is deficient in not identifying when this\r\ntook place.  The complaint is specific only in saying this occurred\r\nbefore the Class Period.  The complaint alleges, on information and\r\nbelief, that the practice continued into the Class Period but\r\nprovides no specifics about why the practice is thought to have\r\noccurred during the Class Period or why it caused harm to\r\nplaintiffs.  The defendants say the temporal lag means the\r\nallegations are irrelevant and should be disregarded.  The\r\nallegations are not irrelevant -- evidence of past practice may\r\nindeed be probative of present practice.  But there is scant else\r\nfrom which to infer that this was the company's practice at any\r\npertinent time, and the allegations are not enough to support a\r\nstrong inference of scienter.  See Lefkowitz v. Smith Barney,\r\nHarris Upham &amp; Co., 804 F.2d 154, 155-56 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\nB. Indirect Evidence of Scienter\r\nThere is also indirect evidence from which plaintiffs say\r\nscienter can be inferred.  Defendants, or so the complaint alleges,\r\nknew the company was in trouble because they knew that Microsoft\r\nwould have, as an integral part of its Windows 95 package, a\r\nproduct that would compete with FTP's wares.  Purchasers of Windows\r\n95 would therefore have no reason to purchase FTP's product. Before\r\nand during the Class Period (July 14, 1995, to January 3, 1996),\r\nFTP engineers repeatedly warned management of this competitive\r\nthreat.   Indeed, certain large orders, such as a $10 million order\r\nby the French Post Office, were cancelled.  Plaintiffs allege that\r\nFTP's management responded through two strategies, \"channel\r\nstuffing\" and contingent sales, which artificially inflated the\r\ncompany's revenues.\r\n1. Channel Stuffing\r\n\"Channel stuffing\" means inducing purchasers to increase\r\nsubstantially their purchases before they would, in the normal\r\ncourse, otherwise purchase products from the company.  It has the\r\nresult of shifting earnings into earlier quarters, quite likely to\r\nthe detriment of earnings in later quarters.  There is nothing\r\ninherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than\r\nin the normal course, and we do not understand plaintiffs'\r\ncomplaint to make any such claim.  Plaintiffs make use of the\r\nchannel stuffing allegations in a different way.  They say evidence\r\nof channel stuffing supports their contention that management knew\r\nthat revenues during the Class Period would be low and attempted to\r\nhide that fact by shifting income through channel stuffing (which\r\nremained undisclosed) and by artificially inflating income through\r\nimproper revenue recognition.  In this context, the channel\r\nstuffing evidence has some probative value.  But that value is\r\nweak.  Unlike altering company documents, there may be any number\r\nof legitimate reasons for attempting to achieve sales earlier. \r\nThus, it does not support a strong inference of scienter.\r\n2.  Contingent Sales\r\nPlaintiffs allege that the financial statements included\r\nin FTP's Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 1995 were\r\nprepared in violation of GAAP and contained improperly inflated\r\nrevenues and earnings.  Specifically, plaintiffs claim that FTP\r\nrecognized revenues from sales that included a right of return,\r\nwhich did not meet the requirements for revenue recognition set\r\nforth in FAS 48.  When a buyer has the right to return a product,\r\nFAS 48 prohibits the seller from recognizing income from the sale\r\nunless six conditions are met.  See Statement of Financial\r\nAccounting Standards No. 48,  6 (Fin. Accounting Standards Bd.,\r\nJune 1981).  \r\nPlaintiffs focus on three of the six FAS 48 conditions: \r\nthat the buyer's obligation to pay the seller is not contingent on\r\nresale of the product; that the seller does not have significant\r\nobligations for future performance directly to bring about resale\r\nof the product by the buyer; and that the amount of future returns\r\ncan be reasonably estimated.  See id.  If any of the conditions are\r\nnot met at the time of the sale, sales revenue cannot be\r\nimmediately recognized.  See id.\r\nPlaintiffs allege that during the Class Period FTP\r\nrecorded as \"sales\" transactions including a right of return that\r\nviolated all three of the above conditions.  Plaintiffs claim FTP\r\n\"induc[ed] distributors to purchase more product than they needed\r\nwith the promise that they could return the product if it were\r\nunsold . . . . [S]ubsequently, a material portion of these 'sales'\r\nwere either returned in the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995 or\r\nremained with distributors, but were unpaid for.\"  Plaintiffs\r\ncontend that \"[u]nder certain circumstances, the distributor could\r\ndefer payment until FTP's or its own sales force had booked a sale\r\nto an ultimate customer for the products.  FTP, however, would not\r\nreceive payment until the distributor was in a position to book the\r\nsale and ship the product and receive payment from the end user .\r\n. . .\"  Furthermore, \"due to the constantly changing competitive\r\nenvironment and the release of Microsoft's 'Windows '95', FTP had\r\nno way to reasonably estimate returns.\"  Finally, even if all the\r\nconditions for immediate revenue recognition are met, FAS 48\r\nrequires that the seller reduce sales revenue and cost of sales\r\nreported in the income statement to reflect estimated returns.  See\r\nid.  7.  Plaintiffs allege that FTP violated this by failing to\r\nadequately reserve for returns.\r\nViolations of GAAP standards such as FAS 48 could provide\r\nevidence of scienter.  See Malone v. Microdyne Corp., 26 F.3d 471,\r\n478-79 (4th Cir. 1994).   To support even a reasonable inference of\r\nscienter, however, the complaint must describe the violations with\r\nsufficient particularity; \"a general allegation that the practices\r\nat issue resulted in a false report of company earnings is not a\r\nsufficiently particular claim of misrepresentation.\"  Gross v.\r\nSumma Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 996 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting\r\nSerabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 362 n.5 (1st\r\nCir. 1994)).  Here, as the district court correctly concluded, the\r\ncomplaint clearly falls short.  The  allegations in the complaint\r\ndo not include such basic details as the approximate amount by\r\nwhich revenues and earnings were overstated, see Gross, 93 F.3d at\r\n996; the products involved in the contingent transactions, cf.\r\nMalone, 26 F.3d at 476-77 (products that were \"sold\" with rights of\r\nreturn specifically identified); the dates of any of the\r\ntransactions; or the identities of any of the customers or FTP\r\nemployees involved in the transactions.  We do not say that each of\r\nthese particulars must appear in a complaint, but their complete\r\nabsence in this case is indicative of the excessive generality of\r\nthese allegations.\r\nAs part of their opposition to defendants' renewed motion\r\nto dismiss, plaintiffs attempted to introduce evidence of four\r\nalleged contingent transactions drawn from defendants' automatic\r\ndisclosure.  The district court, however, refused to take this new\r\nevidence into consideration in its ruling.  The court reasoned that\r\nthere would have been no disclosure but for the white-out\r\nallegations, because the complaint would have been dismissed at the\r\noutset; the white-out allegations proved insubstantial, even with\r\nthe benefit of disclosure; and therefore the remainder of the\r\ncomplaint should be judged without the additional evidence obtained\r\nthrough disclosure.  We need not decide whether the district\r\ncourt's refusal to consider the additional evidence was correct,\r\nbecause we believe that plaintiffs' additional evidence would not\r\nhave sufficed to prevent dismissal.\r\nPlaintiffs identify four sets of transactions from the\r\nthird quarter of 1995 that allegedly involve improperly booked\r\nrevenue.  Plaintiffs present invoices, purchase orders, and other\r\ndocumentation that show, they contend: (a) a set of transactions\r\ntotaling $678,000 with a distributor, Merisel, in which Merisel was\r\nnot obliged to pay for the product; (b) a $705,250 transaction with\r\nreseller CC-OPS in which CC-OPS was given an unlimited right to\r\nreturn the product; (c) a $1.14 million transaction with reseller\r\nAfina Sistemas that involved the \"sale\" of an FTP product that did\r\nnot yet exist; and (d) a $416,325 transaction with reseller Force\r\n3 that was contingent upon Force 3 receiving a government contract.\r\na. The Merisel Transactions\r\nThe Merisel allegations involve one $130,078 transaction\r\nin August 1995 and two transactions in late September 1995 totaling\r\n$548,192.  Plaintiffs claim that the August transaction, for which\r\nFTP issued an invoice, was not a true sale but a \"stock rotation,\"\r\nin which FTP replaced outdated products in Merisel's inventory at\r\nno charge.  Plaintiffs point to a credit issued to Merisel by FTP\r\nin mid-October for the full amount.  Less detail is provided\r\nconcerning the September transactions.  To support their contention\r\nthat those transactions were improperly booked contingent sales,\r\nplaintiffs proffer three items: the $548,192 posted to accounts\r\nreceivable on September 29; the fact that $494,872 remained unpaid\r\nas of December 31; and the agreement between Merisel and FTP, which\r\nstates that Merisel will pay FTP for all copies of FTP's products\r\nsub-licensed by Merisel and its dealers.  \r\nA possible -- though far from necessary -- conclusion is\r\nthat the August transaction was an exchange of new products for old\r\nimproperly booked as a sale, as the original Merisel purchase order\r\ncontains the notation \"[o]ffsetting order f. stockrotation\" (sic). \r\nThe September transactions, on the other hand, are described in\r\ninsufficient detail to support plaintiffs' allegations.  The mere\r\nexistence of an overdue receivable does not support an inference\r\nthat the original transaction was booked as a sale in violation of\r\nGAAP.\r\nb. The CC-OPS Transaction \r\nThe CC-OPS allegation concerns a September 29 order for\r\n$705,250 of FTP products, which FTP immediately booked as a sale. \r\nA letter from FTP's sales director for the Americas apparently\r\naccompanied the invoice.  The letter stated that it was FTP's\r\n\"policy\" to \"allow[] large or frequent customers to return product\r\nwithout contingency within 60 days of receipt of order.\"  Large\r\ncustomers were defined as those generating over $100,000 per year. \r\nA copy of the original letter is not present in the invoice file. \r\nOn November 27, CC-OPS faxed a copy of the letter back to FTP, and\r\nFTP extended the right of return from 60 to 90 days.  This revised\r\nletter is present in the file.  Shortly after the return period was\r\nlengthened, FTP issued a credit for the full amount of the invoice\r\nand authorized the return of the product. On the original invoice\r\nis written: \"Credit per Jack Geraghty.  Not recognizable revenue.\"\r\nPlaintiffs charge that the initial booking of revenue\r\nfrom this transaction violated GAAP; that the letter indicates that\r\nFTP had a policy of granting unlimited return rights to its\r\ncustomers; and that the absence of the original September 29 letter\r\nfrom the file indicates that FTP was attempting to conceal the\r\nexistence of return rights.  However, FAS 48 permits sellers to\r\nrecognize sales that include a right of return, so long as the\r\nrequired conditions are met and the seller establishes a reasonable\r\nreserve for returns.  The granting of a right of return in a\r\nparticular transaction, or even a general policy of granting return\r\nrights, does not per se mean that revenue cannot be recognized at\r\nthe time of sale.  Plaintiffs merely make an allegation that FTP\r\nfailed to adequately reserve and materially overstated FTP's\r\nrevenues.  Without any information on FTP's experience with past\r\nreturn rates, the size of its reserve for returns, or how the\r\nreserve changed over time, it is difficult to infer that FTP's\r\nrevenue recognition decisions were unreasonable enough to violate\r\nGAAP, or that they give rise to a strong inference of scienter.  \r\n\"'Generally accepted accounting principles,' . . . tolerate a range\r\nof 'reasonable' treatments, leaving the choice among alternatives\r\nto management.\"  Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner of Internal\r\nRevenue, 439 U.S. 522, 544 (1979).\r\nc. The Afina Sistemas Transaction\r\nThe Afina Sistemas (\"Afina\") allegation involves two\r\npurchase orders totaling $1.14 million issued on September 28.  The\r\norders were for 200,000 copies of FTP's Internet browser, custom\r\nmade for an Afina client.  FTP booked the entire amount as revenue\r\non September 29 and carried the amount as an account receivable\r\nthroughout the fourth quarter.  Plaintiffs claim that this revenue\r\nwas improperly booked because the version of the browser ordered by\r\nAfina was then still under development.  An internal FTP document\r\nindicates that the test version of the Spanish edition of the\r\nbrowser was not scheduled to be completed until late October. \r\nPlaintiffs also point to notations reading \"DO NOT SHIP PRODUCTS\"\r\non documents attached to each invoice.\r\nThis transaction is difficult to classify.  This appears\r\nto be one part of a larger undertaking (the \"Telefonica project\"\r\nreferred to on the Afina purchase order) about which plaintiffs\r\npresent only fragmentary information.  It is not clear that the\r\ncustom version of FTP's browser referred to in Afina's purchase\r\norder is the same as the Spanish version listed on FTP's\r\ndevelopment schedule.  Furthermore, marking \"DO NOT SHIP\"\r\nprominently on documents seems an odd way to conceal an improperly\r\nbooked sale from auditors.  Finally, the fact that an overseas\r\ncustomer with 90 days to pay has not paid after 94 days is not\r\nhighly suspicious.  It is possible to infer, however -- at least\r\ntentatively -- that this transaction should not have been booked as\r\na sale in September.  It is a leap from there to a strong inference\r\nof scienter.\r\nd. The Force 3 Transaction\r\nThe Force 3 allegations concern a purchase order for\r\n$416,325 issued on September 30, which stated on its face that it\r\nwas contingent on Force 3's receipt of a government contract.  FTP\r\nnonetheless immediately recorded the entire amount as an account\r\nreceivable.  On December 29, FTP issued Force 3 a credit for the\r\nfull amount.  The same day, Force 3 sent FTP a new purchase order\r\nfor the same products it ordered on September 30, but this purchase\r\norder did not refer to any contingency.  FTP issued a new invoice\r\nand again booked the amount as a sale.  The original booking of\r\nthis sale in September appears to have violated the requirement in\r\nFAS 48 that the buyer's obligation to pay the seller is not\r\ncontingent on resale of the product.  \r\nAt best, plaintiffs' additional evidence supports an\r\ninference that FTP improperly recognized from $416,000 to $1.55\r\nmillion in revenue in the third quarter of 1995.  Because FTP\r\nreported overall revenue during the quarter of $37.1 million, these\r\ntransactions do not support a strong inference of scienter.  It\r\nis equally possible to conclude that FTP made some incorrect\r\naccounting decisions regarding a limited number of transactions. \r\nSeeing fraud, however, requires too great of an inferential leap. \r\nIn short, even when viewed in combination with plaintiffs' other\r\nallegations, plaintiffs' additional evidence does not support a\r\nstrong inference of scienter, and thus the district court's\r\ndecision not to consider the evidence could not have affected the\r\noutcome of the motion to dismiss.\r\n3.  Insider Trading\r\nThe allegations of insider trading do not, either alone\r\nor together with the other allegations, suffice.  The individual\r\ndefendants sold FTP common stock during the Class Period.  For\r\nexample, Zirkle sold 40,000 shares on July 21, 1995 at a price of\r\n$26.27 per share, for total proceeds of $1,050,800.  Goodnow sold\r\n40,000 shares on July 27 at a price of $29.00 per share, for a\r\ntotal price of $1,160,000.  Last, on August 2, 1995, Charlotte\r\nEvans sold 200 shares at $28.50 per share, for a total of $57,000. \r\nAll three defendants sold stock later in the Class Period as well.\r\nWe first look at context.  The timing does not appear\r\nvery suspicious.  None of these three key players sold at the high\r\npoints of the stock price.  Each waited to sell until after FTP\r\nannounced a corporate reorganization on July 14, an announcement\r\nwhich caused the price of the stock to fall.  Each sold some stock\r\nbefore an allegedly manipulated analyst's report from Brookehill\r\nEquities recommended FTP stock as a long-term buy on August 3,\r\n1995, and before a favorable Cowen &amp; Co. report on December 1,\r\n1995.\r\nThe total sum of sales involved -- over $23 million\r\nduring a six month period -- could be suspicious, but a closer look\r\nprovides ready explanations.  Goodnow, as plaintiffs allege,\r\nretired on October 26, 1995, from his position as vice president,\r\nCFO, and treasurer.  His sale of stock in July occurred not long\r\nbefore he left the company.  He also sold a considerable number of\r\nshares after he left the company -- 690,000 shares  accounting for\r\n$19 million out of his total of almost $20.2 million in sales\r\nduring the Class Period.  The vast majority of the $23 million in\r\nsales by the individual defendants, more than $20 million worth,\r\nwere by one individual who was leaving the company, and more than\r\n$19 million was after that individual had left the company.  It is\r\nnot unusual for individuals leaving a company, like Goodnow, to\r\nsell shares.  Indeed, they often have a limited period of time to\r\nexercise their company stock options.  As to the others, the sales\r\ndo not reflect either unusual sales or sales made before a big\r\n\"event\" unknown to the public.  Selling after delivering news that\r\ncauses a company's stock price to go down is not suggestive of\r\nwithholding information.  But that is what happened here. \r\nPlaintiffs provided no information on sales by corporate insiders\r\nat times outside the Class Period, so there is no comparison point. \r\nAlthough the total sum involved was large, the district\r\ncourt correctly concluded that plaintiffs produced no evidence that\r\nthe trading was out of the ordinary or suspicious.  Absent\r\nadditional evidence, it is not possible to draw a strong inference\r\nof scienter based on improper trading on material, non-public\r\ninformation. \r\nC.  Other Alleged False Statements and Material Omissions\r\n1.  Zirkle's Statements\r\nZirkle's upbeat statements of optimism and puffing about\r\nthe company's prospects, described earlier, have each been reviewed\r\nand we conclude that they are not actionable.  See Glassman, 90\r\nF.3d at 635-36; Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1217-19.  \r\n2.  Form 10-Q Report for Third Quarter 1995\r\nThe 10-Q Report stated there was an increase in accounts\r\nreceivable and attributed it to increased sales.  Plaintiffs do not\r\nsay this statement was false; only that it was misleading because\r\nit did not say the increased sales were subject to return rights. \r\nAs an independent ground, this is too slight; as a ground in\r\nservice of the contingent sales/improper booking argument, it fails\r\nfor the same reasons that argument fails.\r\nD.  Individual Defendants\r\nBecause the dismissal of the complaint is upheld, we do\r\nnot reach the arguments of the individual defendants that the facts\r\nalleged do not make out a claim against them.\r\nE. Section 20(a) Claim\r\nPlaintiffs also assert claims against the individual\r\ndefendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, which provides\r\nfor derivative liability of persons who \"control\" others found to\r\nbe primarily liable under the Exchange Act.  See 15 U.S.C. \r\n78t(a).  Because plaintiffs' complaint does not adequately allege\r\nan underlying violation of the securities laws, the district court\r\nwas correct to dismiss the Section 20(a) claim.  See Suna v. Bailey\r\nCorp., 107 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n                             VI\r\nThe district court correctly refused to dismiss the\r\ncomplaint originally and was well within its discretion in limiting\r\nthe discovery it afforded.  The difficult and different balance the\r\nAct now requires -- testing allegations before little or no\r\ndiscovery, but holding plaintiffs to a strong inference of scienter\r\nstandard -- has been honored in this case.  Plaintiffs did not have\r\nenough weight on their side of the balance to meet the requirements\r\nof the Act, and so we affirm the dismissal.  Costs to appellants.\n",

Plaintiffs, purchasers of FTP Software stock from July 14, 1995 to January 3, 1996, brought suit under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a). During the period of plaintiffs' purchases, the stock reached a high of $38.875 per share.  On January 4, 1996, the company announced that sales growth had declined and that it would have lower earnings. That same day, the stock price fell 52% on heavy trading, from $25.25 to $11.875 per share.  By August 9, 1996, the stock price was $8 per share. Plaintiffs' suit was filed on March 3, 1996. It was dismissed on September 24, 1998.  See Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 182 F.R.D. 370, 376 (D.

After limited discovery, the district court concluded that plaintiffs could not prove the white-out claims and entered judgment on those claims. The defendants renewed their motion to dismiss the complaint,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the plaintiffs, in response, sought to make their allegations of fraud more specific by referring to discovered documents, but did not formally move to amend.  The district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, thus effectively denying the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint. The court did so without deciding whether, in light of the new evidence and allegations, the complaint was adequate to survive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appeal saying that summary judgment on the white-out allegations was inappropriate; that they are given refuge by Rule 56(f); that the dismissal of the remaining allegations was improper; and that they were entitled to amend their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges the following.  FTP Software, Inc. develops, markets, and supports Internet and Intranet software for personal computers and networks.  By the beginning of the Class Period<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (from July 14, 1995 to January 3, 1996), the demand for FTP's software was diminishing because many of FTP's clients were either developing the technology themselves or acquiring competing systems from other manufacturers, such as Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft, for example, was incorporating networking capabilities into its new Windows 95 software, free of additional charge.  In addition, FTP was struggling to keep pace with \"revolutionary\" technological developments that threatened to render its software obsolete.  In response, FTP and several of its directors and officers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> through fraudulent schemes inflated FTP's stock price and then made various false statements and material omissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that FTP failed to disclose the threats to its continued success, as well as several \"questionable\" sales practices. These included the making of \"warehouse shipments\" -- that is, booking a fictitious sale of a product to a non-existent buyer, shipping that product to a warehouse for storage, and then eventually returning it to FTP.  According to plaintiffs, one FTP employee who complained about these shipments, and who refused (in at least one instance) to sign for the product return, was dismissed as a result of his protest, all before the Class Period. Other objectionable sales practices included excessively discounted sales (as high as 90%) and \"channel stuffing\" activity that compressed sales and orders into the final weeks of a fiscal quarter, with the intention of \"cosmetically\" improving the reported results for that quarter. Finally, plaintiffs say that FTP failed to disclose its practice of inducing distributors to purchase more product than they needed by promising that the distributors could return the unsold product. Distributors would send their orders to FTP with a notation that they were entitled to return any unsold product. FTP then booked these sales as revenue, but because FTP understood that recognizing such sales as revenue was improper (because of a right of return existed), it allegedly instructed the sales force to white-out these right-of-return notations on the distributors' order forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FTP also made several statements that the plaintiffs characterize as false or materially misleading. On July 14, 1995, the first day of the Class Period, David Zirkle, FTP's President and Chief Executive Officer, reported FTP's financial performance results for the second fiscal quarter of 1995. Zirkle declared: \"We are pleased with our performance for the second quarter. Sales continue to be strong in both our U.S. and international channels.\" Zirkle also touted the release of several new products, stating that \"[t]hese products should help us achieve our revenue objective for the second half of 1995.\" Plaintiffs argue that these comments \"falsely convey[ed] the impression that sales were, and would continue to be, healthy and strong\" and that this false impression was deliberately aided by FTP's failure to disclose that in or around January 1995, the French Post Office canceled its planned purchase of $10 million of FTP products \"due to the impending release of 'Windows '95.'\"On the same day, Zirkle discussed FTP's impending corporate \"reconfiguration\" into two business units. He predicted that \"FTP Software [would] lead the market in providing applications and support that make it possible to share information and access resources across workgroups, LAN's, enterprise networks and the global Internet.\"  After this announcement, FTP's stock fell from $31.75 to $28.25.  Zirkle dismissed this decline as merely \"a 'knee-jerk' reaction to the short-term impact of the restructuring on earnings,\" and on the next trading day, the stock recovered, closing at $30.875. Plaintiffs argue that these comments were misleading because Zirkle did not disclose that FTP's costly investments in its reorganization would have to be continued over the long term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FTP's management team next met with \"the investment community and with securities analysts\" to promote the company's products and stock.  One securities firm rated FTP as a \"long-term buy.\" Plaintiffs assert that this report \"and the estimates contained therein were based upon communications with the management of FTP and were of a nature that could only have been provided (or be based on specific information provided) by [FTP] and its management.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, several of the individual defendants sold some of their FTP stock. In total, the six individual defendants sold over $23 million in stock during the Class Period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zirkle made another false statement, plaintiffs say, on October 25, 1995, when he reported FTP's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was another excellent quarter for FTP. Sales continue to grow both in our U.S. and international channels . . . . Our new ventures are also off to a good start with revenues of $2.7 million. . . . These new products have been well received by our channel partners and customers and will help us in our efforts to achieve fourth quarter revenue objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs assert that the \"new ventures\" Zirkle referred to were failing to generate the expected new business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 1995, FTP filed its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 1995 with the SEC. The report revealed a dramatic increase in accounts receivable for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 1994. FTP explained that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an increase is primarily attributable to increased unit sales and a relative increase, during the third quarter of 1995, in the number of units shipped during the last month of such quarter compared to prior quarters. The Company believes that it may continue to experience such a relative increase as it continues to grow, as is typical in the software industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the 10-Q report, and these statements, were false and misleading because the increased unit sales were subject to the purchasers' right to return unsold merchandise and were not the result of FTP's growth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FTP continued the \"drumbeat\" of misleading positive statements, according to plaintiffs, when Zirkle, speaking in an interview published in the November 27 - December 3, 1995 issue of Mass High Tech, said that \"[t]he networking business (TCP/IP) is a cash cow that is feeding the development of other businesses, which are feeding back new technology that makes the core business even better.\" In December 1995, two other securities firms issued positive reports on FTP; after these statements, FTP's stock rose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the complaint alleges, the \"truth [began] to emerge\" on January 4, 1996, when FTP announced that its earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995 would be less than the same period in 1994. FTP stated that this decline reflected, in part, the company's investment in its New Ventures Business Unit, but, nonetheless, the company's stock fell $13.375 per share to close at $11.875 per share (a one-day decline of 52%). Plaintiffs emphasize that this decline represented a $27 drop in market value (an approximately 70% decrease) from a Class Period high of $38.875 per share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 1996, plaintiffs brought suit against FTP and the individual defendants for violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The defendants moved to dismiss. The procedural history was recited above. The district court ultimately granted summary judgment on the white-out allegations because plaintiffs' only witness, Ms. Trudy Nichols, was unavailable and her testimony was potentially inadmissible (as hearsay). Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish that the defendants had ordered the alteration of any documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also granted the defendants' renewed motion to dismiss. The court found that the complaint failed to plead the circumstances of fraud with specificity, and could not even meet the pleading standards required to establish scienter under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Interpretation of the PSLRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enactment of the PSLRA in 1995 marked a bipartisan effort to curb abuse in private securities lawsuits, particularly the filing of strike suits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, at 32 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSLRA restated the requirements for securities fraud actions at subsections 21D(b)(1) and (2), codified at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1)-(2). Those provisions, involved here, read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Requirements for securities fraud actions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Misleading statements and omissions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant --</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Required state of mind</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1)-(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties and the SEC as amicus have framed different possible interpretations of these provisions. Essentially, these questions are raised:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, did the PSLRA alter the standards for pleading fraud with particularity previously adhered to by this circuit?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, did the PSLRA restrict the characteristic patterns of facts that may be pleaded in order to establish a \"strong inference\" of scienter? Specifically, are the two methods of showing scienter endorsed earlier by the Second Circuit -- motive and opportunity or circumstantial evidence of reckless or conscious behavior sufficient to raise a \"'strong inference' of fraudulent intent,\" see, e.g., In re Time Warner Inc. Sec. Litig., 9 F.3d 259, 268-69 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting O'Brien v. National Property Analysts Partners, 936 F.2d 674, 676 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted)) -- now available?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, did the PSLRA alter the scienter requirement for actions under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5? Specifically, is some form of recklessness sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties and amicus<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> all rely heavily on competing excerpts from the congressional history of the Act and on the pre-Act case law from the Second Circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The words of the statute are the first guide to any interpretation of the meaning of the statute. The usual maxim is that courts do not go beyond the text of the statute if the meaning is plain. See United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 328 v. Almac's Inc., 90 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996). But that maxim has inherent flexibility. Even seemingly straightforward text should be informed by the purpose and context of the statute.  See Stafford v. Briggs, 444 U.S. 527, 535 (1980); Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. Telecommunications Regulatory Bd.,189 F.3d 1 ,8-10(1st Cir. 1999). Both this court and the Supreme Court have checked a sense of a statute's plain meaning against undisputed legislative history as a guard against judicial error. See, e.g., Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 586 (1983) (\"It is a well-established canon of statutory construction that a court should go beyond the literal language of a statute if reliance on that language would defeat the plain purpose of the statute . . . .\"); Cablevision of Boston v. Public Improvement Comm'n, 184 F.3d 88, 101 (1st Cir. 1999). If the meaning is not plain from the words of the statute, then resort to legislative history is required. See Akins v. Penobscot Nation, 130 F.3d 482, 488 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On some of the points neither text nor history is indisputably clear. The legislative history is irretrievably conflicted as to the second issue -- which characteristic patterns of facts may be pleaded in order to establish a \"strong inference\" of scienter -- with all sides finding some support for their positions. About all that can be said with confidence on that issue is that Congress agreed on the need to curb abuses, that it attempted to do so in the guise of what are articulated as procedural requirements, and that there was agreement on the words of the statute and on little else. And so we return to the text of the statute and its purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Pleading Standards for Fraud Allegations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The text of the Act requires now that any complaint alleging that a statement or omission is misleading must:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

The effect of this is to embody in the Act itself at least the standards of Rule 9(b), Fed. R. Civ. P.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the PSLRA, a securities fraud claim had to meet the standards set by Rule 9(b). See Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., 754 F.2d 430, 439 (1st Cir. 1985). Rule 9(b) provides that \"[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). This circuit has interpreted Rule 9(b) to require \"specification of the time, place, and content of an alleged false representation.\" McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir. 1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> \"Even where allegations are based on information and belief, supporting facts on which the belief is founded must be set forth in the complaint. And this holds true even when the fraud relates to matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the opposing party.\" Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 444 (1st Cir. 1985) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSLRA's pleading standard is congruent and consistent with the pre-existing standards of this circuit. This circuit has been notably strict and rigorous in applying the Rule 9(b) standard in securities fraud actions. See Maldonado v. Domnguez, 137 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"This court has been especially rigorous in applying Rule 9(b) in securities fraud actions . . . .\") (quotation marks omitted); Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1223 (1st Cir. 1996) (similar); Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"We have been especially rigorous in demanding . . . factual support in the securities context . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirements of the PSLRA's new pleading standard in &#167; 78u-4(b)(1) were largely imposed under First Circuit law, although this court has not used the same precise terminology. First, this court had already required a fraud plaintiff to specify each allegedly misleading statement or omission. See, e.g., Romani, 929 F.2d at 878 (plaintiffs' isolation of the offering materials as the source of the alleged fraud was \"sufficient to identify the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations\"); New England Data Servs., 829 F.2d at 292 (rejecting plaintiffs' claims as merely \"conclusory allegations of mail and wire fraud . . . with no description of any time, place or content of the communication\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, this court has required a securities fraud plaintiff to explain why the challenged statement or omission is misleading by requiring that \"the complaint . . . provide some factual support for the allegations of fraud.\" Romani, 929 F.2d at 878 (citation omitted). This means that the plaintiff must not only allege the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentations with specificity, but also the \"factual allegations that would support a reasonable inference that adverse circumstances existed at the time of the offering, and were known and deliberately or recklessly disregarded by defendants.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this court has required plaintiffs who bring their claims on information and belief to \"set forth the source of the information and the reasons for the belief.\" Romani, 929 F.2d at 878; see also New England Data Servs., 829 F.2d at 288; Hayduk, 775 F.2d at 444-45; Wayne Inv., Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our previous strict pleading requirements under Rule 9(b) are, in our view, consistent with the PSLRA.

The \"required state of mind\" for liability under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is referred to as scienter, which the Supreme Court has defined as \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debate between the plaintiffs and the defendants is largely over whether Congress intended to embody, as the SEC says, the prior Second Circuit methods for proving scienter (i.e., by showing motive and opportunity or evidence of reckless or conscious behavior sufficient to raise a strong inference) or, as the defendants say, to prohibit use of at least the motive and opportunity method. This focus of the parties is not surprising, as there was much debate in Congress on these points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs and the SEC argue that the PSLRA does not prohibit use of the Second Circuit's methods for proving scienter. They refer to the bill reported out of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, see S. 240, 104th Cong. &#167; 104(b) (1995), reprinted in 141 Cong. Rec. S9222 (daily ed. June 28, 1995), and to the Senate Report, which states, in part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee does not adopt a new and untested pleading standard that would generate additional litigation. Instead, the Committee chose a uniform standard modeled upon the pleading standard of the Second Circuit. . . . [T]he Second Circuit requires that the plaintiff plead facts that give rise to a \"strong inference\" of defendant's fraudulent intent. The Committee does not intend to codify the Second Circuit's caselaw interpreting this pleading standard, although courts may find this body of law instructive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S. Res. 98, 104th Cong., at 15 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 694 (footnotes omitted). They also rely on the comments of Senator Dodd, co-sponsor of the PSLRA, explaining that Congress intended to codify the Second Circuit's \"pleading standards.\" 141 Cong. Rec. S17960 (daily ed. Dec. 5, 1995).  Finally, they argue that their position is bolstered by the Statement of Managers of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-353, 112 Stat. 3227, which declared that \"the managers again emphasize that the clear intent in 1995 and our continuing intent in this legislation is that neither the Reform Act nor [the Standards Act] in any way alters the scienter standard in Federal securities fraud suits.\" Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference, Conference Report to Accompany S. 1260, H.R.

To support their view, they note Congress' statement that \"[t]he Conference Committee language is based in part on the pleading standard of the Second Circuit,\" (emphasis added) and that \"[b]ecause the Conference Committee intends to strengthen existing pleading requirements, it does not intend to codify the Second Circuit's case law interpreting this pleading standard.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-369, at 41 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 740. Defendants also rely heavily on the footnote associated with this sentence, which states: \"For this reason, the Conference Report chose not to include in the pleading standard certain language relating to motive, opportunity, or recklessness.\" Id. at 41 n.23, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 747. Further, the defendants emphasize that although the Senate Bill (S. 240) included an amendment that would codify Second Circuit law, the Conference Committee eliminated that amendment. See Amend. 1485, S. 240, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995), 141 Cong. Rec. S9170 (daily ed. June 27, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendants place considerable weight on Congress' decision to override President Clinton's veto, in light of the President's statement that in the Act Congress \"intended to 'strengthen' the existing pleading requirements of the Second Circuit . . . [and] to erect a higher barrier to bringing suit than any now existing[.]\" H.R. Doc. No. 104-150, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995), 141 Cong. Rec. H15214 (Dec. 20, 1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Counsel for defendant FTP candidly admitted before the district court that the legislative history standing alone could be read either way, but argued that the President's veto -- based on his reading of the Act as overruling the Second Circuit motive and opportunity test -- administered the coup de grace. While the President's view of what Congress meant has some informational value, we give that view little weight: the real issue is what the intent was of the Congress, not the President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history is inconclusive on whether the Act was meant to either embody or to reject the Second Circuit's pleading standards. As the Third Circuit has noted, \"[t]he Reform Act's legislative history on this point is ambiguous and even contradictory.\" In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 531 (3d Cir. 1999). The history and text show no agreement to restrict the types of evidence which may be used to show a strong inference of scienter. Indeed, it would be unusual for Congress to legislate on what fact patterns could or could not prove fraud or scienter. At best, there appears to have been an agreement to disagree on the issue of Second Circuit standards (other than the strong inference standard), and perhaps, as is common, to leave such matters for courts to resolve. See, e.g., Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 2264 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the words of the Act, certain conclusions can be drawn. First, Congress plainly contemplated that scienter could be proven by inference, thus acknowledging the role of indirect and circumstantial evidence.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2) (requiring that \"the complaint . . . state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\") (emphasis added). Second, the words of the Act neither mandate nor prohibit the use of any particular method to establish an inference of scienter.  Third, Congress has effectively mandated a special standard for measuring whether allegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss. While under Rule 12(b)(6) all inferences must be drawn in plaintiffs' favor, inferences of scienter do not survive if they are merely reasonable, as is true when pleadings for other causes of action are tested by motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  Rather, inferences of scienter survive a motion to dismiss only if they are both reasonable and \"strong\" inferences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the debate about adoption or rejection of prior Second Circuit standards strikes us as somewhat beside the point. The categorization of patterns of facts as acceptable or unacceptable to prove scienter or to prove fraud has never been the approach this circuit has taken to securities fraud. As stated in Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 10 n.6, this court has never adopted the Second Circuit test. Instead we have analyzed the particular facts alleged in each individual case to determine whether the allegations were sufficient to support scienter. See, e.g., Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1209 (1st Cir. 1996). In this, the approach of this circuit has been like that taken by the Supreme Court as to the issue of materiality in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has considered many different types of evidence as relevant to show scienter. Examples include: insider trading (discussed below); divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject (see Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir. 1994)); closeness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later disclosure of inconsistent information (see Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1224-25); evidence of bribery by a top company official (see Greenstone v. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992)); existence of an ancillary lawsuit charging fraud by a company and the company's quick settlement of that suit (see id.); disregard of the most current factual information before making statements (see Glassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 627 (1st Cir. 1996)); disclosure of accrual basis information in a way which could only be understood by a sophisticated person with a high degree of accounting skill (see Holmes v. Bateson, 583 F.2d 542, 552 (1st Cir. 1978)); the personal interest of certain directors in not informing disinterested directors of impending sale of stock (see Estate of Soler v. Rodrguez, 63 F.3d 45, 54 (1st Cir. 1995)); and the self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs (see Serabian, 24 F.3d at 368). While a number of these cases could be thought of as falling into motive and opportunity patterns, this court continues to prefer a more fact-specific inquiry. See, e.g., Glassman, 90 F.3d at 624 (fact that lead underwriter may have had incentive to inflate the offering price was significant, but overall, complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most salient feature of the PSLRA is that whatever the characteristic pattern of the facts alleged, those facts must now present a strong inference of scienter. A mere reasonable inference is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Our pre-Act case law had used both the language of \"strong\" inference and of \"reasonable\" inference in various contexts. For example, \"strong inference\" is used in Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 9 and Suna v. Bailey Corp., 107 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 1997). \"Reasonable inference\" language was used in Gross v. Summa Four Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 996 (1st Cir. 1996); Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1224; Serabian, 24 F.3d at 368; Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 25; and Romani, 929 F.2d at 878. It is clear that scienter allegations now must be judged under the \"strong inference\" standard at the motion to dismiss stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our view of the Act is thus close to that articulated by the Sixth Circuit. That court held that a plaintiff could survive a motion to dismiss by \"pleading facts that give rise to a strong inference of [scienter].\" In re Comshare, Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 542, 550 (6th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit found that evidence of motive and opportunity to commit fraud did not, of itself, constitute scienter for purposes of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See id. at 551. \"Indeed, those courts addressing motive and opportunity in Securities Act cases have held only that facts showing a motive and opportunity may adequately allege scienter, not that the existence of motive and opportunity may support, as scienter itself, liability under &#167; 10b or Rule 10b-5.\" Id. The court held that evidence of motive and opportunity was \"relevant\" to pleading facts that could establish scienter, and, on occasion, could \"rise to the level of creating a strong inference of reckless or knowing conduct.\" Id. Nevertheless, such evidence, standing alone, could not \"constitute the pleading of a strong inference of scienter.\" Id.; accord Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., 187 F.3d 1271, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without adopting any pleading litany of motive and opportunity, we reject defendants' argument that facts showing motive and opportunity can never be enough to permit the drawing of a strong inference of scienter. But, as we cautioned in Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 10 n.6, merely pleading motive and opportunity, regardless of the strength of the inferences to be drawn of scienter, is not enough. Three circuits have interpreted the PSLRA as permitting use of motive and opportunity type pleading if it raises a strong inference. See In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 534-35 (3d Cir. 1999); Press v. Chemical Inv. Servs. Corp., 166 F.3d 529, 537-38 (2d Cir. 1999); Williams v. WMX Techs., Inc., 112 F.3d 175, 178 (5th Cir. 1997) (dicta). Like the Third Circuit, we caution that \"catch-all allegations that defendants stood to benefit from wrongdoing and had the opportunity to implement a fraudulent scheme are [not] sufficient.\" In re Advanta Corp., 180 F.3d at 535.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the PSLRA neither prohibits nor endorses the pleading of insider trading as evidence of scienter, but requires that the evidence meet the \"strong inference\" standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Unusual trading or trading at suspicious times or in suspicious amounts by corporate insiders has long been recognized as probative of scienter. See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1204; Rubinstein v. Collins, 20 F.3d 160, 169-70 (5th Cir. 1994); Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26. The vitality of the inference to be drawn depends on the facts, and can range from marginal, see Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1204, to strong, see Rubinstein, 20 F.3d at 169-70. This continues to be true in litigation after the effective date of the PSLRA. Indeed, in Greenstone we noted, and still think today, that allegations of unusual insider trading by a defendant with access to material non-public information can support a strong inference of scienter. See Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26. We similarly caution that mere pleading of insider trading, without regard to either context or the strength of the inferences to be drawn, is not enough. See Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 9-10. At a minimum, the trading must be in a context where defendants have incentives to withhold material, non-public information, and it must be unusual, well beyond the normal patterns of trading by those defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Substantive Scienter Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree about the effect, if any, of the PSLRA on the substantive standard for proving scienter.

Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976). The Court explicitly reserved the issue of whether recklessness sufficed, saying \"[i]n certain areas of the law recklessness is considered to be a form of intentional conduct for purposes of imposing liability for some act.\" Id. Before enactment of the PSLRA, most circuits had held that scienter in civil securities fraud actions could be shown by showing recklessness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> It is accepted that recklessness may establish intent to defraud in criminal prosecutions under &#167; 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and under the mail and wire fraud statutes. See 8 L. Loss and J. Seligman, Securities Regulation 3656-57 (3d ed. 1991). The question became whether the standard for criminal liability should also apply to civil liability. That, in turn, raised the question of what was meant by recklessness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have used a definition of recklessness articulated by the Seventh Circuit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[R]eckless conduct may be defined as a highly unreasonable omission, involving not merely simple, or even inexcusable, negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious the actor must have been aware of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chem. Corp., 553 F.2d 1033, 1045 (7th Cir. 1977) (quoting Franke v. Midwestern Okla. Dev. Auth., 428 F. Supp. 719, 725 (W.D. Okla. 1976)). Without at first explicitly adopting that standard, this court assumed that it applied and cited it with approval in Cook v. Avien, Inc., 573 F.2d 685, 692 (1st Cir. 1978). In Hoffman v. Estabrook &amp; Co., 587 F.2d 509, 515-16 (1st Cir. 1978), this court again assumed that recklessness could ground a Rule 10b-5 action and, again, quoted with approval a Seventh Circuit definition:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the Supreme Court's analysis in Hochfelder of the statutory scheme of implied private remedies and express remedies, the definition of \"reckless behavior\" should not be a liberal one lest any discernible distinction between \"scienter\" and \"negligence\" be obliterated for these purposes. We believe \"reckless\" in these circumstances comes closer to being a lesser form of intent than merely a greater degree of ordinary negligence. We perceive it to be not just a difference in degree, but also in kind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., 554 F.2d 790, 793 (7th Cir. 1977). This court explicitly rejected a formulation of recklessness as mere negligence, finding it had to come closer to being a lesser form of intent than merely a greater degree of ordinary negligence. See Hoffman, 587 F.2d at 516 &amp; n.10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Serabian this court held that it was error to dismiss a securities fraud complaint that alleged sufficient facts to draw \"an inference that the [defendant] knew, or should have known, that its public statements were inconsistent with the actual conditions then being reported to [it].\" Serabian, 24 F.3d at 365 (emphasis added and original emphasis omitted). We understand Serabian to have used \"should have known\" in the reckless disregard sense used in Cook and Hoffman. This court has explicitly tested factual allegations to see whether they supported an inference that defendants acted with reckless disregard. See Romani, 929 F.2d at 878. Since then, there have been encapsulated references to this rule in dicta in other cases. See, e.g., Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 9 n.4. The rule in this circuit has been to accept recklessness, as narrowly defined in the two Seventh Circuit cases (Sundstrand and Sanders), as a method of proving scienter. See Serabian, 24 F.3d at 365. That definition of recklessness does not encompass ordinary negligence and is closer to a lesser form of intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of the PSLRA on the standard for scienter has been much disputed. The Act itself is silent on the general scienter requirements for 10b-5 actions, referring only to scienter as \"the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). Plaintiffs and the SEC maintain that the PSLRA did not intend or purport to change whatever the preexisting standard was, and that standard included some form of recklessness.  The defendants say that only the most heightened recklessness standard should be used, and that the SEC's views are not entitled to any weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit courts have reached different results. A panel in the Ninth Circuit has held that the PSLRA elevated the standard to one of \"deliberate recklessness,\" In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 1999). One district court within this circuit has concluded that recklessness is insufficient and that only conscious conduct would suffice under the Act. See Friedberg v. Discreet Logic Inc., 959 F. Supp. 42, 48 (D. Mass. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that the PSLRA did not alter the state of mind requirement and thus a complaint pleading facts that give rise to a \"'strong inference of recklessness' of the kind required for securities fraud liability\" suffices. In re Comshare, Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 542, 552-53 (6th Cir. 1999). The Sixth Circuit had previously adopted, as had this circuit, the Sundstrand definition of recklessness, see id. at 550, and concluded that same standard applied after the PSLRA was enacted. The Eleventh Circuit has expressed its \"basic agreement\" with the Sixth Circuit, Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., 187 F.3d 1271-1282-83 (11th Cir. 1999), holding that the PSLRA did not \"substantively change the actionable level of scienter,\" id. at 1284-85. The Third Circuit has concluded that \"[a]lthough the Reform Act established a uniform pleading standard, it did not purport to alter the substantive contours of scienter,\" In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 534 (3d Cir. 1999), and reiterated its prior law that recklessness, as defined in Sundstrand, suffices, see id. Without much discussion of the issue, the Second Circuit has adhered to its previous acceptance of recklessness. See Press v. Chemical Inv. Servs. Corp., 166 F.3d 529, 537-38 (2d Cir. 1999). The Fourth Circuit has also concluded that the PSLRA did not change the pre-existing scienter standard. See Phillips v. LCI Int'l, Inc., 190 F.3d 609,620 (4th Cir. 1999) (\"[T]o establish scienter, a plaintiff must still prove that the defendant acted intentionally, which may perhaps be shown by recklessness.\"). Two district courts in this circuit have reached the conclusion that some form of recklessness is available. See In re PLC Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., 41 F.Supp.2d 106, 115 (D. Mass 1999); Lirette v. Shiva Corp., 27 F.Supp.2d 268, 282 (D. Mass. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with those courts that hold that the PSLRA did not address the substantive definition of scienter. The legislative history shows no such intent and the language of the Act itself does not address the topic. See generally Dunn, Note, Pleading Scienter After the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 84 Cornell L. Rev. 193 (1998). The opinions of the Sixth and Third Circuits discuss these points ably and there is no reason to repeat the discussion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add additional reasons that buttress this conclusion. The PSLRA does in fact discuss the role of \"knowing\" violations, and thus an aspect of scienter, in two different respects. The first concerns contribution; the second, \"safe harbors\" for defendants. As to contribution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> the Act, through a new &#167; 21D(g), added a section \"to preserve joint and several liability for persons who knowingly commit securities fraud, but otherwise to proportionately limit liability to the 'portion of the judgment that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that covered person.'\" 10 Loss &amp; Seligman, at 4687 (quoting 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(f)(2)(B)(i)). The PSLRA specifies that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ny covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable for damages jointly and severally only if the trier of fact specifically determines that such covered person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(f)(2)(A). In turn \"knowingly commits a violation of the securities laws\" is defined (for 10b-5 purposes) as requiring \"actual knowledge\" that a representation is false or an omission renders a representation false. Id. &#167; 78u-4(f)(10)(A). The definition specifically excludes \"reckless conduct\" as a basis for construing a knowing commission of a violation. Id. &#167; 78-u(f)(10)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These special contribution provisions lead to several conclusions. Congress, having explicitly eliminated recklessness as a basis for imposing joint and several liability, should not be taken as implicitly having eliminated recklessness as a basis for any liability. See In re Silicon Graphics, 183 F.3d at 995 (Browning, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Because joint and several liability is more onerous than individual liability, the exclusion of recklessness as the basis for imposing joint and several liability constitutes a recognition that some form of recklessness may suffice for individual liability.  Furthermore, Congress took great care to insure that the actual knowledge requirement was restricted to the joint and several liability provisions of the Act. Section 78u-4(f)(1) provides that \"nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create, affect, or in any manner modify, the standard for liability associated with any action arising under the securities laws.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78-u(f)(1). Including this language would not make sense if Congress had altered the general scienter requirement to restrict it to actual knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Act similarly buttress the conclusion that the Act did not alter pre-existing law defining scienter. The PSLRA adopted a statutory \"safe harbor\" by adding a new section 27A to the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77z-2, and a new section 21E to the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5. The safe harbor has two alternative inlets: the first shelters forward-looking statements that are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements. See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i). The second inlet is of importance here. It focuses on the state of mind of the defendant and precludes liability for a forward-looking statement unless the maker of the statement had actual knowledge it was false or misleading. See &#167; 78u-5(c)(1)(B); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 743. Again, this new section 21E to the 1934 Act is explicit, in contrast with the lack of such language in the definition of scienter in &#167; 21D(b)(2). See Bryant, 187 F.3d at 1284-85; In re Silicon Graphics, 183 F.3d at 995 (Browning, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding that the Act does not alter the pre-existing definition of scienter adopted by this circuit, we accordingly test the complaint against that definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application of Standards to Plaintiffs' Complaint</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint de novo, giving plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences, but holding plaintiffs to the standard of showing a strong inference of scienter. See Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 991 (1st Cir. 1996). We think the claims are either insufficiently particularized or, where particularized, do not permit a strong inference of scienter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of plaintiffs' case is the allegation that defendants consistently overstated the earnings of the company by improperly booking as revenue (and inadequately reserving) \"sales\" that were actually contingent transactions. This was improper, plaintiffs say, under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48 (\"FAS 48\"). Plaintiffs claim that the sales were contingent because there were unlimited return rights. Plaintiffs say that they have evidence both tending directly to show conscious wrongdoing on the part of defendants and circumstantial evidence from which such wrongdoing may be inferred, including that the defendants had both motive and opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Direct Evidence of Scienter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two types of allegations tend to show conscious wrongdoing: the \"white-out\" and the warehousing allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The \"White-Out\" Allegations and the Rule 56(f) Motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"white-out\" allegations claimed that FTP personnel \"whited out\" (in a manner undetectable to company auditors) the customers' additions to standard purchase orders; those additions made orders contingent on the customers' unlimited right to return the goods to FTP. The white-out allegations were powerful, as the district court recognized in initially denying the motion to dismiss. If adequately supported, claims that management deliberately altered company records to hide material information from company auditors could well create strong inferences of scienter. But, as the district court correctly ruled on summary judgment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> plaintiffs could not produce admissible evidence to support the white-out allegations, and so we disregard these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Warehousing Allegations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The warehousing allegations remain. In essence, the complaint asserts that at some time before the Class Period, the company made a phony sale or sales and caused to be booked as goods sold certain product that was shipped to a warehouse and not to customers; the company then recognized the revenue from such phony sales. After a period, the product was sent back from the warehouse as \"returned\" goods. The allegations state that Robert Casa, an employee who refused to sign for the \"returned\" product and complained about the practice, was fired. If true, such practices by a company are very serious. See United States v. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming a criminal conviction for, inter alia, \"knowingly falsifying [a company's] books and records in an attempt to conceal [securities] fraud\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint is deficient in not identifying when this took place. The complaint is specific only in saying this occurred before the Class Period. The complaint alleges, on information and belief, that the practice continued into the Class Period but provides no specifics about why the practice is thought to have occurred during the Class Period or why it caused harm to plaintiffs. The defendants say the temporal lag means the allegations are irrelevant and should be disregarded. The allegations are not irrelevant -- evidence of past practice may indeed be probative of present practice. But there is scant else from which to infer that this was the company's practice at any pertinent time, and the allegations are not enough to support a strong inference of scienter. See Lefkowitz v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., 804 F.2d 154, 155-56 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Indirect Evidence of Scienter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also indirect evidence from which plaintiffs say scienter can be inferred. Defendants, or so the complaint alleges, knew the company was in trouble because they knew that Microsoft would have, as an integral part of its Windows 95 package, a product that would compete with FTP's wares. Purchasers of Windows 95 would therefore have no reason to purchase FTP's product. Before and during the Class Period (July 14, 1995, to January 3, 1996), FTP engineers repeatedly warned management of this competitive threat. Indeed, certain large orders, such as a $10 million order by the French Post Office, were cancelled. Plaintiffs allege that FTP's management responded through two strategies, \"channel stuffing\" and contingent sales, which artificially inflated the company's revenues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Channel Stuffing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Channel stuffing\" means inducing purchasers to increase substantially their purchases before they would, in the normal course, otherwise purchase products from the company. It has the result of shifting earnings into earlier quarters, quite likely to the detriment of earnings in later quarters. There is nothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than in the normal course, and we do not understand plaintiffs' complaint to make any such claim. Plaintiffs make use of the channel stuffing allegations in a different way. They say evidence of channel stuffing supports their contention that management knew that revenues during the Class Period would be low and attempted to hide that fact by shifting income through channel stuffing (which remained undisclosed) and by artificially inflating income through improper revenue recognition. In this context, the channel stuffing evidence has some probative value.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> But that value is weak. Unlike altering company documents, there may be any number of legitimate reasons for attempting to achieve sales earlier. Thus, it does not support a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Contingent Sales</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the financial statements included in FTP's Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 1995 were prepared in violation of GAAP and contained improperly inflated revenues and earnings. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that FTP recognized revenues from sales that included a right of return, which did not meet the requirements for revenue recognition set forth in FAS 48. When a buyer has the right to return a product, FAS 48 prohibits the seller from recognizing income from the sale unless six conditions are met. See Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48, &#182; 6 (Fin. Accounting Standards Bd., June 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs focus on three of the six FAS 48 conditions: that the buyer's obligation to pay the seller is not contingent on resale of the product; that the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance directly to bring about resale of the product by the buyer; and that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. See id.  If any of the conditions are not met at the time of the sale, sales revenue cannot be immediately recognized. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period FTP recorded as \"sales\" transactions including a right of return that violated all three of the above conditions. Plaintiffs claim FTP \"induc[ed] distributors to purchase more product than they needed with the promise that they could return the product if it were unsold . . . . [S]ubsequently, a material portion of these 'sales' were either returned in the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995 or remained with distributors, but were unpaid for.\" Plaintiffs contend that \"[u]nder certain circumstances, the distributor could defer payment until FTP's or its own sales force had booked a sale to an ultimate customer for the products. FTP, however, would not receive payment until the distributor was in a position to book the sale and ship the product and receive payment from the end user . . . .\" Furthermore, \"due to the constantly changing competitive environment and the release of Microsoft's 'Windows '95', FTP had no way to reasonably estimate returns.\" Finally, even if all the conditions for immediate revenue recognition are met, FAS 48 requires that the seller reduce sales revenue and cost of sales reported in the income statement to reflect estimated returns. See id. &#182; 7. Plaintiffs allege that FTP violated this by failing to adequately reserve for returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Violations of GAAP standards such as FAS 48 could provide evidence of scienter. See Malone v. Microdyne Corp., 26 F.3d 471, 478-79 (4th Cir. 1994). To support even a reasonable inference of scienter, however, the complaint must describe the violations with sufficient particularity; \"a general allegation that the practices at issue resulted in a false report of company earnings is not a sufficiently particular claim of misrepresentation.\" Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 996 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 362 n.5 (1st Cir. 1994)). Here, as the district court correctly concluded, the complaint clearly falls short. The allegations in the complaint do not include such basic details as the approximate amount by which revenues and earnings were overstated, see Gross, 93 F.3d at 996; the products involved in the contingent transactions, cf. Malone, 26 F.3d at 476-77 (products that were \"sold\" with rights of return specifically identified); the dates of any of the transactions; or the identities of any of the customers or FTP employees involved in the transactions. We do not say that each of these particulars must appear in a complaint, but their complete absence in this case is indicative of the excessive generality of these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of their opposition to defendants' renewed motion to dismiss, plaintiffs attempted to introduce evidence of four alleged contingent transactions drawn from defendants' automatic disclosure. The district court, however, refused to take this new evidence into consideration in its ruling. The court reasoned that there would have been no disclosure but for the white-out allegations, because the complaint would have been dismissed at the outset; the white-out allegations proved insubstantial, even with the benefit of disclosure; and therefore the remainder of the complaint should be judged without the additional evidence obtained through disclosure.  We need not decide whether the district court's refusal to consider the additional evidence was correct, because we believe that plaintiffs' additional evidence would not have sufficed to prevent dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs identify four sets of transactions from the third quarter of 1995 that allegedly involve improperly booked revenue. Plaintiffs present invoices, purchase orders, and other documentation that show, they contend: (a) a set of transactions totaling $678,000 with a distributor, Merisel, in which Merisel was not obliged to pay for the product; (b) a $705,250 transaction with reseller CC-OPS in which CC-OPS was given an unlimited right to return the product; (c) a $1.14 million transaction with reseller Afina Sistemas that involved the \"sale\" of an FTP product that did not yet exist; and (d) a $416,325 transaction with reseller Force 3 that was contingent upon Force 3 receiving a government contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The Merisel Transactions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Merisel allegations involve one $130,078 transaction in August 1995 and two transactions in late September 1995 totaling $548,192. Plaintiffs claim that the August transaction, for which FTP issued an invoice, was not a true sale but a \"stock rotation,\" in which FTP replaced outdated products in Merisel's inventory at no charge. Plaintiffs point to a credit issued to Merisel by FTP in mid-October for the full amount. Less detail is provided concerning the September transactions. To support their contention that those transactions were improperly booked contingent sales, plaintiffs proffer three items: the $548,192 posted to accounts receivable on September 29; the fact that $494,872 remained unpaid as of December 31; and the agreement between Merisel and FTP, which states that Merisel will pay FTP for all copies of FTP's products sub-licensed by Merisel and its dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A possible -- though far from necessary -- conclusion is that the August transaction was an exchange of new products for old improperly booked as a sale, as the original Merisel purchase order contains the notation \"[o]ffsetting order f. stockrotation\" (sic). The September transactions, on the other hand, are described in insufficient detail to support plaintiffs' allegations. The mere existence of an overdue receivable does not support an inference that the original transaction was booked as a sale in violation of GAAP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The CC-OPS Transaction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CC-OPS allegation concerns a September 29 order for $705,250 of FTP products, which FTP immediately booked as a sale. A letter from FTP's sales director for the Americas apparently accompanied the invoice. The letter stated that it was FTP's \"policy\" to \"allow[] large or frequent customers to return product without contingency within 60 days of receipt of order.\" Large customers were defined as those generating over $100,000 per year. A copy of the original letter is not present in the invoice file. On November 27, CC-OPS faxed a copy of the letter back to FTP, and FTP extended the right of return from 60 to 90 days. This revised letter is present in the file. Shortly after the return period was lengthened, FTP issued a credit for the full amount of the invoice and authorized the return of the product. On the original invoice is written: \"Credit per Jack Geraghty. Not recognizable revenue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs charge that the initial booking of revenue from this transaction violated GAAP; that the letter indicates that FTP had a policy of granting unlimited return rights to its customers; and that the absence of the original September 29 letter from the file indicates that FTP was attempting to conceal the existence of return rights. However, FAS 48 permits sellers to recognize sales that include a right of return, so long as the required conditions are met and the seller establishes a reasonable reserve for returns. The granting of a right of return in a particular transaction, or even a general policy of granting return rights, does not per se mean that revenue cannot be recognized at the time of sale. Plaintiffs merely make an allegation that FTP failed to adequately reserve and materially overstated FTP's revenues. Without any information on FTP's experience with past return rates, the size of its reserve for returns, or how the reserve changed over time, it is difficult to infer that FTP's revenue recognition decisions were unreasonable enough to violate GAAP, or that they give rise to a strong inference of scienter. \"'Generally accepted accounting principles,' . . . tolerate a range of 'reasonable' treatments, leaving the choice among alternatives to management.\" Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 439 U.S. 522, 544 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. The Afina Sistemas Transaction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Afina Sistemas (\"Afina\") allegation involves two purchase orders totaling $1.14 million issued on September 28. The orders were for 200,000 copies of FTP's Internet browser, custom made for an Afina client. FTP booked the entire amount as revenue on September 29 and carried the amount as an account receivable throughout the fourth quarter. Plaintiffs claim that this revenue was improperly booked because the version of the browser ordered by Afina was then still under development. An internal FTP document indicates that the test version of the Spanish edition of the browser was not scheduled to be completed until late October. Plaintiffs also point to notations reading \"DO NOT SHIP PRODUCTS\" on documents attached to each invoice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This transaction is difficult to classify. This appears to be one part of a larger undertaking (the \"Telefonica project\" referred to on the Afina purchase order) about which plaintiffs present only fragmentary information. It is not clear that the custom version of FTP's browser referred to in Afina's purchase order is the same as the Spanish version listed on FTP's development schedule. Furthermore, marking \"DO NOT SHIP\" prominently on documents seems an odd way to conceal an improperly booked sale from auditors. Finally, the fact that an overseas customer with 90 days to pay has not paid after 94 days is not highly suspicious. It is possible to infer, however -- at least tentatively -- that this transaction should not have been booked as a sale in September. It is a leap from there to a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The Force 3 Transaction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Force 3 allegations concern a purchase order for $416,325 issued on September 30, which stated on its face that it was contingent on Force 3's receipt of a government contract. FTP nonetheless immediately recorded the entire amount as an account receivable. On December 29, FTP issued Force 3 a credit for the full amount. The same day, Force 3 sent FTP a new purchase order for the same products it ordered on September 30, but this purchase order did not refer to any contingency. FTP issued a new invoice and again booked the amount as a sale. The original booking of this sale in September appears to have violated the requirement in FAS 48 that the buyer's obligation to pay the seller is not contingent on resale of the product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At best, plaintiffs' additional evidence supports an inference that FTP improperly recognized from $416,000 to $1.55 million in revenue in the third quarter of 1995. Because FTP reported overall revenue during the quarter of $37.1 million, these transactions do not support a strong inference of scienter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> It is equally possible to conclude that FTP made some incorrect accounting decisions regarding a limited number of transactions. Seeing fraud, however, requires too great of an inferential leap. In short, even when viewed in combination with plaintiffs' other allegations, plaintiffs' additional evidence does not support a strong inference of scienter, and thus the district court's decision not to consider the evidence could not have affected the outcome of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Insider Trading</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations of insider trading do not, either alone or together with the other allegations, suffice. The individual defendants sold FTP common stock during the Class Period. For example, Zirkle sold 40,000 shares on July 21, 1995 at a price of $26.27 per share, for total proceeds of $1,050,800. Goodnow sold 40,000 shares on July 27 at a price of $29.00 per share, for a total price of $1,160,000. Last, on August 2, 1995, Charlotte Evans sold 200 shares at $28.50 per share, for a total of $57,000. All three defendants sold stock later in the Class Period as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first look at context. The timing does not appear very suspicious. None of these three key players sold at the high points of the stock price. Each waited to sell until after FTP announced a corporate reorganization on July 14, an announcement which caused the price of the stock to fall. Each sold some stock before an allegedly manipulated analyst's report from Brookehill Equities recommended FTP stock as a long-term buy on August 3, 1995, and before a favorable Cowen &amp; Co. report on December 1, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The total sum of sales involved -- over $23 million during a six month period -- could be suspicious, but a closer look provides ready explanations. Goodnow, as plaintiffs allege, retired on October 26, 1995, from his position as vice president, CFO, and treasurer.  His sale of stock in July occurred not long before he left the company. He also sold a considerable number of shares after he left the company -- 690,000 shares accounting for $19 million out of his total of almost $20.2 million in sales during the Class Period. The vast majority of the $23 million in sales by the individual defendants, more than $20 million worth, were by one individual who was leaving the company, and more than $19 million was after that individual had left the company. It is not unusual for individuals leaving a company, like Goodnow, to sell shares. Indeed, they often have a limited period of time to exercise their company stock options. As to the others, the sales do not reflect either unusual sales or sales made before a big \"event\" unknown to the public. Selling after delivering news that causes a company's stock price to go down is not suggestive of withholding information. But that is what happened here. Plaintiffs provided no information on sales by corporate insiders at times outside the Class Period, so there is no comparison point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the total sum involved was large, the district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs produced no evidence that the trading was out of the ordinary or suspicious. Absent additional evidence, it is not possible to draw a strong inference of scienter based on improper trading on material, non-public information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Other Alleged False Statements and Material Omissions</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Zirkle's Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zirkle's upbeat statements of optimism and puffing about the company's prospects, described earlier, have each been reviewed and we conclude that they are not actionable. See Glassman, 90 F.3d at 635-36; Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1217-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Form 10-Q Report for Third Quarter 1995</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 10-Q Report stated there was an increase in accounts receivable and attributed it to increased sales. Plaintiffs do not say this statement was false; only that it was misleading because it did not say the increased sales were subject to return rights. As an independent ground, this is too slight; as a ground in service of the contingent sales/improper booking argument, it fails for the same reasons that argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Individual Defendants</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the dismissal of the complaint is upheld, we do not reach the arguments of the individual defendants that the facts alleged do not make out a claim against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Section 20(a) Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also assert claims against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, which provides for derivative liability of persons who \"control\" others found to be primarily liable under the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a). Because plaintiffs' complaint does not adequately allege an underlying violation of the securities laws, the district court was correct to dismiss the Section 20(a) claim. See Suna v.

The difficult and different balance the Act now requires -- testing allegations before little or no discovery, but holding plaintiffs to a strong inference of scienter standard -- has been honored in this case. Plaintiffs did not have enough weight on their side of the balance to meet the requirements of the Act, and so we affirm the dismissal.

The device of effecting policy-based change through adjustments in procedural or evidentiary rules is not new, nor is it unique to Congress. Examples are found in statutory presumptions that make it easier or more difficult to prove a case. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1) (presumption of correctness for determinations of factual issues made by state courts in habeas corpus actions); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(a)(3)(A) (presumption of correctness for determinations made by plan sponsors under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act); 33 U.S.C. &#167; 920 (presumptions governing benefits claims under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act). At times, the Supreme Court has effected change similarly. An example is Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761-62 (1984) (rejecting a standard of proof in a vertical price-fixing conspiracy case that had permitted an inference to be drawn of the existence of a price fixing agreement from evidence of complaints from other distributors, constant communication between manufacturer and distributor about prices, and the termination of a dealer in response to complaints); see also Business Elecs.

Plaintiffs, purchasers of FTP Software stock from July 14, 1995 to January 3, 1996, brought suit under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a). During the period of plaintiffs' purchases, the stock reached a high of $38.875 per share.  On January 4, 1996, the company announced that sales growth had declined and that it would have lower earnings. That same day, the stock price fell 52% on heavy trading, from $25.25 to $11.875 per share.  By August 9, 1996, the stock price was $8 per share. Plaintiffs' suit was filed on March 3, 1996. It was dismissed on September 24, 1998.  See Greebel v.

After limited discovery, the district court concluded that plaintiffs could not prove the white-out claims and entered judgment on those claims. The defendants renewed their motion to dismiss the complaint,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the plaintiffs, in response, sought to make their allegations of fraud more specific by referring to discovered documents, but did not formally move to amend.  The district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, thus effectively denying the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint. The court did so without deciding whether, in light of the new evidence and allegations, the complaint was adequate to survive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appeal saying that summary judgment on the white-out allegations was inappropriate; that they are given refuge by Rule 56(f); that the dismissal of the remaining allegations was improper; and that they were entitled to amend their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges the following.  FTP Software, Inc. develops, markets, and supports Internet and Intranet software for personal computers and networks.  By the beginning of the Class Period<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (from July 14, 1995 to January 3, 1996), the demand for FTP's software was diminishing because many of FTP's clients were either developing the technology themselves or acquiring competing systems from other manufacturers, such as Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft, for example, was incorporating networking capabilities into its new Windows 95 software, free of additional charge.  In addition, FTP was struggling to keep pace with \"revolutionary\" technological developments that threatened to render its software obsolete.  In response, FTP and several of its directors and officers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> through fraudulent schemes inflated FTP's stock price and then made various false statements and material omissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that FTP failed to disclose the threats to its continued success, as well as several \"questionable\" sales practices. These included the making of \"warehouse shipments\" -- that is, booking a fictitious sale of a product to a non-existent buyer, shipping that product to a warehouse for storage, and then eventually returning it to FTP.  According to plaintiffs, one FTP employee who complained about these shipments, and who refused (in at least one instance) to sign for the product return, was dismissed as a result of his protest, all before the Class Period. Other objectionable sales practices included excessively discounted sales (as high as 90%) and \"channel stuffing\" activity that compressed sales and orders into the final weeks of a fiscal quarter, with the intention of \"cosmetically\" improving the reported results for that quarter. Finally, plaintiffs say that FTP failed to disclose its practice of inducing distributors to purchase more product than they needed by promising that the distributors could return the unsold product. Distributors would send their orders to FTP with a notation that they were entitled to return any unsold product. FTP then booked these sales as revenue, but because FTP understood that recognizing such sales as revenue was improper (because of a right of return existed), it allegedly instructed the sales force to white-out these right-of-return notations on the distributors' order forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FTP also made several statements that the plaintiffs characterize as false or materially misleading. On July 14, 1995, the first day of the Class Period, David Zirkle, FTP's President and Chief Executive Officer, reported FTP's financial performance results for the second fiscal quarter of 1995. Zirkle declared: \"We are pleased with our performance for the second quarter. Sales continue to be strong in both our U.S. and international channels.\" Zirkle also touted the release of several new products, stating that \"[t]hese products should help us achieve our revenue objective for the second half of 1995.\" Plaintiffs argue that these comments \"falsely convey[ed] the impression that sales were, and would continue to be, healthy and strong\" and that this false impression was deliberately aided by FTP's failure to disclose that in or around January 1995, the French Post Office canceled its planned purchase of $10 million of FTP products \"due to the impending release of 'Windows '95.'\"On the same day, Zirkle discussed FTP's impending corporate \"reconfiguration\" into two business units. He predicted that \"FTP Software [would] lead the market in providing applications and support that make it possible to share information and access resources across workgroups, LAN's, enterprise networks and the global Internet.\"  After this announcement, FTP's stock fell from $31.75 to $28.25.  Zirkle dismissed this decline as merely \"a 'knee-jerk' reaction to the short-term impact of the restructuring on earnings,\" and on the next trading day, the stock recovered, closing at $30.875. Plaintiffs argue that these comments were misleading because Zirkle did not disclose that FTP's costly investments in its reorganization would have to be continued over the long term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FTP's management team next met with \"the investment community and with securities analysts\" to promote the company's products and stock.  One securities firm rated FTP as a \"long-term buy.\" Plaintiffs assert that this report \"and the estimates contained therein were based upon communications with the management of FTP and were of a nature that could only have been provided (or be based on specific information provided) by [FTP] and its management.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, several of the individual defendants sold some of their FTP stock. In total, the six individual defendants sold over $23 million in stock during the Class Period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zirkle made another false statement, plaintiffs say, on October 25, 1995, when he reported FTP's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was another excellent quarter for FTP. Sales continue to grow both in our U.S. and international channels . . . . Our new ventures are also off to a good start with revenues of $2.7 million. . . . These new products have been well received by our channel partners and customers and will help us in our efforts to achieve fourth quarter revenue objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs assert that the \"new ventures\" Zirkle referred to were failing to generate the expected new business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 1995, FTP filed its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 1995 with the SEC. The report revealed a dramatic increase in accounts receivable for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 1994. FTP explained that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an increase is primarily attributable to increased unit sales and a relative increase, during the third quarter of 1995, in the number of units shipped during the last month of such quarter compared to prior quarters. The Company believes that it may continue to experience such a relative increase as it continues to grow, as is typical in the software industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the 10-Q report, and these statements, were false and misleading because the increased unit sales were subject to the purchasers' right to return unsold merchandise and were not the result of FTP's growth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FTP continued the \"drumbeat\" of misleading positive statements, according to plaintiffs, when Zirkle, speaking in an interview published in the November 27 - December 3, 1995 issue of Mass High Tech, said that \"[t]he networking business (TCP/IP) is a cash cow that is feeding the development of other businesses, which are feeding back new technology that makes the core business even better.\" In December 1995, two other securities firms issued positive reports on FTP; after these statements, FTP's stock rose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the complaint alleges, the \"truth [began] to emerge\" on January 4, 1996, when FTP announced that its earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995 would be less than the same period in 1994. FTP stated that this decline reflected, in part, the company's investment in its New Ventures Business Unit, but, nonetheless, the company's stock fell $13.375 per share to close at $11.875 per share (a one-day decline of 52%). Plaintiffs emphasize that this decline represented a $27 drop in market value (an approximately 70% decrease) from a Class Period high of $38.875 per share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 1996, plaintiffs brought suit against FTP and the individual defendants for violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The defendants moved to dismiss. The procedural history was recited above. The district court ultimately granted summary judgment on the white-out allegations because plaintiffs' only witness, Ms. Trudy Nichols, was unavailable and her testimony was potentially inadmissible (as hearsay). Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish that the defendants had ordered the alteration of any documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also granted the defendants' renewed motion to dismiss.

The usual maxim is that courts do not go beyond the text of the statute if the meaning is plain. See United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 328 v. Almac's Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722409\"><a href=\"/opinion/722409/united-food-and-commercial-workers-union-local-328-afl-cio-v-almacs/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1996). But that maxim has inherent flexibility. Even seemingly straightforward text should be informed by the purpose and context of the statute.  See Stafford v.

Co. v. Telecommunications Regulatory Bd.,189 F.3d 1 ,8-10(1st Cir. 1999). Both this court and the Supreme Court have checked a sense of a statute's plain meaning against undisputed legislative history as a guard against judicial error. See, e.g., Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110938\"><a href=\"/opinion/110938/bob-jones-univ-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, 586 (1983) (\"It is a well-established canon of statutory construction that a court should go beyond the literal language of a statute if reliance on that language would defeat the plain purpose of the statute . . . .\"); Cablevision of Boston v.

If the meaning is not plain from the words of the statute, then resort to legislative history is required. See Akins v.

The legislative history is irretrievably conflicted as to the second issue -- which characteristic patterns of facts may be pleaded in order to establish a \"strong inference\" of scienter -- with all sides finding some support for their positions. About all that can be said with confidence on that issue is that Congress agreed on the need to curb abuses, that it attempted to do so in the guise of what are articulated as procedural requirements, and that there was agreement on the words of the statute and on little else. And so we return to the text of the statute and its purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

See Amend. 1485, S. 240, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995), 141 Cong. Rec. S9170 (daily ed.

[and] to erect a higher barrier to bringing suit than any now existing[.]\" H.R. Doc. No. 104-150, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995), 141 Cong. Rec. H15214 (Dec. 20, 1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Counsel for defendant FTP candidly admitted before the district court that the legislative history standing alone could be read either way, but argued that the President's veto -- based on his reading of the Act as overruling the Second Circuit motive and opportunity test -- administered the coup de grace. While the President's view of what Congress meant has some informational value, we give that view little weight: the real issue is what the intent was of the Congress, not the President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history is inconclusive on whether the Act was meant to either embody or to reject the Second Circuit's pleading standards. As the Third Circuit has noted, \"[t]he Reform Act's legislative history on this point is ambiguous and even contradictory.\" In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></span>, 531 (3d Cir. 1999). The history and text show no agreement to restrict the types of evidence which may be used to show a strong inference of scienter. Indeed, it would be unusual for Congress to legislate on what fact patterns could or could not prove fraud or scienter. At best, there appears to have been an agreement to disagree on the issue of Second Circuit standards (other than the strong inference standard), and perhaps, as is common, to leave such matters for courts to resolve. See, e.g., Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2257</span></a></span>, 2264 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the words of the Act, certain conclusions can be drawn. First, Congress plainly contemplated that scienter could be proven by inference, thus acknowledging the role of indirect and circumstantial evidence.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2) (requiring that \"the complaint . . . state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\") (emphasis added). Second, the words of the Act neither mandate nor prohibit the use of any particular method to establish an inference of scienter.  Third, Congress has effectively mandated a special standard for measuring whether allegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss. While under Rule 12(b)(6) all inferences must be drawn in plaintiffs' favor, inferences of scienter do not survive if they are merely reasonable, as is true when pleadings for other causes of action are tested by motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Conley v. Gibson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1957).  Rather, inferences of scienter survive a motion to dismiss only if they are both reasonable and \"strong\" inferences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the debate about adoption or rejection of prior Second Circuit standards strikes us as somewhat beside the point. The categorization of patterns of facts as acceptable or unacceptable to prove scienter or to prove fraud has never been the approach this circuit has taken to securities fraud. As stated in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197814\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Maldonado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197814/maldonado-v-dominguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">10</span> </a></span>n.6, this court has never adopted the Second Circuit test. Instead we have analyzed the particular facts alleged in each individual case to determine whether the allegations were sufficient to support scienter. See, e.g., Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196753\"><a href=\"/opinion/196753/shaw-v-digital/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1209 (1st Cir. 1996). In this, the approach of this circuit has been like that taken by the Supreme Court as to the issue of materiality in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112022\"><a href=\"/opinion/112022/basic-inc-v-levinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span> </a></span>(1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has considered many different types of evidence as relevant to show scienter. Examples include: insider trading (discussed below); divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject (see Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195389\"><a href=\"/opinion/195389/serabian-v-amoskeag-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 361 (1st Cir. 1994)); closeness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later disclosure of inconsistent information (see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196753\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Shaw,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196753/shaw-v-digital/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1224-25</span></a></span>); evidence of bribery by a top company official (see Greenstone v.

Computervision Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196899\"><a href=\"/opinion/196899/glassman-v-computervision/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 627 (1st Cir. 1996)); disclosure of accrual basis information in a way which could only be understood by a sophisticated person with a high degree of accounting skill (see Holmes v. Bateson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359617\"><a href=\"/opinion/359617/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96532-elizabeth-d-holmes-and-industrial-national-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 552 (1st Cir. 1978)); the personal interest of certain directors in not informing disinterested directors of impending sale of stock (see Estate of Soler v. Rodrguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196244\"><a href=\"/opinion/196244/estate-of-soler-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir. 1995)); and the self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs (see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195389\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Serabian,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195389/serabian-v-amoskeag-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>). While a number of these cases could be thought of as falling into motive and opportunity patterns, this court continues to prefer a more fact-specific inquiry. See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196899\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Glassman,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196899/glassman-v-computervision/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">624</span> </a></span>(fact that lead underwriter may have had incentive to inflate the offering price was significant, but overall, complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most salient feature of the PSLRA is that whatever the characteristic pattern of the facts alleged, those facts must now present a strong inference of scienter. A mere reasonable inference is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Our pre-Act case law had used both the language of \"strong\" inference and of \"reasonable\" inference in various contexts. For example, \"strong inference\" is used in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197814\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Maldonado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197814/maldonado-v-dominguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">9</span> </a></span>and Suna v.

The Act itself is silent on the general scienter requirements for 10b-5 actions, referring only to scienter as \"the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). Plaintiffs and the SEC maintain that the PSLRA did not intend or purport to change whatever the preexisting standard was, and that standard included some form of recklessness.  The defendants say that only the most heightened recklessness standard should be used, and that the SEC's views are not entitled to any weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit courts have reached different results. A panel in the Ninth Circuit has held that the PSLRA elevated the standard to one of \"deliberate recklessness,\" In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Sec.

One district court within this circuit has concluded that recklessness is insufficient and that only conscious conduct would suffice under the Act. See Friedberg v.

In re Comshare, Inc. Sec.

The Sixth Circuit had previously adopted, as had this circuit, the Sundstrand definition of recklessness, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765129\"><a href=\"/opinion/765129/in-re-comshare-incorporated-securities-litigation-harry-m-hoffman-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 550, </a></span>and concluded that same standard applied after the PSLRA was enacted. The Eleventh Circuit has expressed its \"basic agreement\" with the Sixth Circuit, Bryant v.

The Fourth Circuit has also concluded that the PSLRA did not change the pre-existing scienter standard. See Phillips v. LCI Int'l, Inc., 190 F.3d 609,620 (4th Cir. 1999) (\"[T]o establish scienter, a plaintiff must still prove that the defendant acted intentionally, which may perhaps be shown by recklessness.\"). Two district courts in this circuit have reached the conclusion that some form of recklessness is available. See In re PLC Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411655\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411655/in-re-plc-systems-inc-securities-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mass. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with those courts that hold that the PSLRA did not address the substantive definition of scienter. The legislative history shows no such intent and the language of the Act itself does not address the topic. See generally Dunn, Note, Pleading Scienter After the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 84 Cornell L. Rev. 193 (1998). The opinions of the Sixth and Third Circuits discuss these points ably and there is no reason to repeat the discussion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add additional reasons that buttress this conclusion. The PSLRA does in fact discuss the role of \"knowing\" violations, and thus an aspect of scienter, in two different respects. The first concerns contribution; the second, \"safe harbors\" for defendants. As to contribution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> the Act, through a new &#167; 21D(g), added a section \"to preserve joint and several liability for persons who knowingly commit securities fraud, but otherwise to proportionately limit liability to the 'portion of the judgment that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that covered person.'\" 10 Loss &amp; Seligman, at 4687 (quoting 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(f)(2)(B)(i)). The PSLRA specifies that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ny covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable for damages jointly and severally only if the trier of fact specifically determines that such covered person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(f)(2)(A). In turn \"knowingly commits a violation of the securities laws\" is defined (for 10b-5 purposes) as requiring \"actual knowledge\" that a representation is false or an omission renders a representation false. Id. &#167; 78u-4(f)(10)(A). The definition specifically excludes \"reckless conduct\" as a basis for construing a knowing commission of a violation. Id. &#167; 78-u(f)(10)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These special contribution provisions lead to several conclusions. Congress, having explicitly eliminated recklessness as a basis for imposing joint and several liability, should not be taken as implicitly having eliminated recklessness as a basis for any liability. See In re Silicon <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765192\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Graphics,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/765192/in-re-silicon-graphics-inc-securities-litigation-edmund-j-janas-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">995</span> </a></span>(Browning, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Because joint and several liability is more onerous than individual liability, the exclusion of recklessness as the basis for imposing joint and several liability constitutes a recognition that some form of recklessness may suffice for individual liability.  Furthermore, Congress took great care to insure that the actual knowledge requirement was restricted to the joint and several liability provisions of the Act. Section 78u-4(f)(1) provides that \"nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create, affect, or in any manner modify, the standard for liability associated with any action arising under the securities laws.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78-u(f)(1). Including this language would not make sense if Congress had altered the general scienter requirement to restrict it to actual knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Act similarly buttress the conclusion that the Act did not alter pre-existing law defining scienter. The PSLRA adopted a statutory \"safe harbor\" by adding a new section 27A to the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77z-2, and a new section 21E to the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5. The safe harbor has two alternative inlets: the first shelters forward-looking statements that are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements. See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i). The second inlet is of importance here. It focuses on the state of mind of the defendant and precludes liability for a forward-looking statement unless the maker of the statement had actual knowledge it was false or misleading. See &#167; 78u-5(c)(1)(B); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 743. Again, this new section 21E to the 1934 Act is explicit, in contrast with the lack of such language in the definition of scienter in &#167; 21D(b)(2).

See Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196921\"><a href=\"/opinion/196921/gross-v-summa-four-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 991 (1st Cir. 1996). We think the claims are either insufficiently particularized or, where particularized, do not permit a strong inference of scienter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of plaintiffs' case is the allegation that defendants consistently overstated the earnings of the company by improperly booking as revenue (and inadequately reserving) \"sales\" that were actually contingent transactions. This was improper, plaintiffs say, under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48 (\"FAS 48\"). Plaintiffs claim that the sales were contingent because there were unlimited return rights. Plaintiffs say that they have evidence both tending directly to show conscious wrongdoing on the part of defendants and circumstantial evidence from which such wrongdoing may be inferred, including that the defendants had both motive and opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Direct Evidence of Scienter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two types of allegations tend to show conscious wrongdoing: the \"white-out\" and the warehousing allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The \"White-Out\" Allegations and the Rule 56(f) Motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"white-out\" allegations claimed that FTP personnel \"whited out\" (in a manner undetectable to company auditors) the customers' additions to standard purchase orders; those additions made orders contingent on the customers' unlimited right to return the goods to FTP. The white-out allegations were powerful, as the district court recognized in initially denying the motion to dismiss. If adequately supported, claims that management deliberately altered company records to hide material information from company auditors could well create strong inferences of scienter. But, as the district court correctly ruled on summary judgment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> plaintiffs could not produce admissible evidence to support the white-out allegations, and so we disregard these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Warehousing Allegations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The warehousing allegations remain. In essence, the complaint asserts that at some time before the Class Period, the company made a phony sale or sales and caused to be booked as goods sold certain product that was shipped to a warehouse and not to customers; the company then recognized the revenue from such phony sales. After a period, the product was sent back from the warehouse as \"returned\" goods. The allegations state that Robert Casa, an employee who refused to sign for the \"returned\" product and complained about the practice, was fired. If true, such practices by a company are very serious. See United States v. Bradstreet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197762\"><a href=\"/opinion/197762/united-states-v-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming a criminal conviction for, inter alia, \"knowingly falsifying [a company's] books and records in an attempt to conceal [securities] fraud\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint is deficient in not identifying when this took place. The complaint is specific only in saying this occurred before the Class Period. The complaint alleges, on information and belief, that the practice continued into the Class Period but provides no specifics about why the practice is thought to have occurred during the Class Period or why it caused harm to plaintiffs. The defendants say the temporal lag means the allegations are irrelevant and should be disregarded. The allegations are not irrelevant -- evidence of past practice may indeed be probative of present practice. But there is scant else from which to infer that this was the company's practice at any pertinent time, and the allegations are not enough to support a strong inference of scienter. See Lefkowitz v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478730\"><a href=\"/opinion/478730/blue-sky-l-rep-p-72461-fed-sec-l-rep-p-92977-bertram-lefkowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 155-56 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Indirect Evidence of Scienter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also indirect evidence from which plaintiffs say scienter can be inferred. Defendants, or so the complaint alleges, knew the company was in trouble because they knew that Microsoft would have, as an integral part of its Windows 95 package, a product that would compete with FTP's wares. Purchasers of Windows 95 would therefore have no reason to purchase FTP's product. Before and during the Class Period (July 14, 1995, to January 3, 1996), FTP engineers repeatedly warned management of this competitive threat. Indeed, certain large orders, such as a $10 million order by the French Post Office, were cancelled. Plaintiffs allege that FTP's management responded through two strategies, \"channel stuffing\" and contingent sales, which artificially inflated the company's revenues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Channel Stuffing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Channel stuffing\" means inducing purchasers to increase substantially their purchases before they would, in the normal course, otherwise purchase products from the company. It has the result of shifting earnings into earlier quarters, quite likely to the detriment of earnings in later quarters. There is nothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than in the normal course, and we do not understand plaintiffs' complaint to make any such claim. Plaintiffs make use of the channel stuffing allegations in a different way. They say evidence of channel stuffing supports their contention that management knew that revenues during the Class Period would be low and attempted to hide that fact by shifting income through channel stuffing (which remained undisclosed) and by artificially inflating income through improper revenue recognition. In this context, the channel stuffing evidence has some probative value.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> But that value is weak. Unlike altering company documents, there may be any number of legitimate reasons for attempting to achieve sales earlier. Thus, it does not support a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Contingent Sales</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the financial statements included in FTP's Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 1995 were prepared in violation of GAAP and contained improperly inflated revenues and earnings. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that FTP recognized revenues from sales that included a right of return, which did not meet the requirements for revenue recognition set forth in FAS 48. When a buyer has the right to return a product, FAS 48 prohibits the seller from recognizing income from the sale unless six conditions are met. See Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48, &#182; 6 (Fin. Accounting Standards Bd., June 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs focus on three of the six FAS 48 conditions: that the buyer's obligation to pay the seller is not contingent on resale of the product; that the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance directly to bring about resale of the product by the buyer; and that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478730\"><a href=\"/opinion/478730/blue-sky-l-rep-p-72461-fed-sec-l-rep-p-92977-bertram-lefkowitz/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  If any </a></span>of the conditions are not met at the time of the sale, sales revenue cannot be immediately recognized. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period FTP recorded as \"sales\" transactions including a right of return that violated all three of the above conditions. Plaintiffs claim FTP \"induc[ed] distributors to purchase more product than they needed with the promise that they could return the product if it were unsold . . . . [S]ubsequently, a material portion of these 'sales' were either returned in the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995 or remained with distributors, but were unpaid for.\" Plaintiffs contend that \"[u]nder certain circumstances, the distributor could defer payment until FTP's or its own sales force had booked a sale to an ultimate customer for the products. FTP, however, would not receive payment until the distributor was in a position to book the sale and ship the product and receive payment from the end user . . . .\" Furthermore, \"due to the constantly changing competitive environment and the release of Microsoft's 'Windows '95', FTP had no way to reasonably estimate returns.\" Finally, even if all the conditions for immediate revenue recognition are met, FAS 48 requires that the seller reduce sales revenue and cost of sales reported in the income statement to reflect estimated returns. See id. &#182; 7. Plaintiffs allege that FTP violated this by failing to adequately reserve for returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Violations of GAAP standards such as FAS 48 could provide evidence of scienter. See Malone v. Microdyne Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672055\"><a href=\"/opinion/672055/fed-sec-l-rep-p-98237-40-fed-r-evid-serv-18-michael-f-malone/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 478-79 (4th Cir. 1994). To support even a reasonable inference of scienter, however, the complaint must describe the violations with sufficient particularity; \"a general allegation that the practices at issue resulted in a false report of company earnings is not a sufficiently particular claim of misrepresentation.\" Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196921\"><a href=\"/opinion/196921/gross-v-summa-four-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 996 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Serabian v.

The district court, however, refused to take this new evidence into consideration in its ruling. The court reasoned that there would have been no disclosure but for the white-out allegations, because the complaint would have been dismissed at the outset; the white-out allegations proved insubstantial, even with the benefit of disclosure; and therefore the remainder of the complaint should be judged without the additional evidence obtained through disclosure.  We need not decide whether the district court's refusal to consider the additional evidence was correct, because we believe that plaintiffs' additional evidence would not have sufficed to prevent dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs identify four sets of transactions from the third quarter of 1995 that allegedly involve improperly booked revenue. Plaintiffs present invoices, purchase orders, and other documentation that show, they contend: (a) a set of transactions totaling $678,000 with a distributor, Merisel, in which Merisel was not obliged to pay for the product; (b) a $705,250 transaction with reseller CC-OPS in which CC-OPS was given an unlimited right to return the product; (c) a $1.14 million transaction with reseller Afina Sistemas that involved the \"sale\" of an FTP product that did not yet exist; and (d) a $416,325 transaction with reseller Force 3 that was contingent upon Force 3 receiving a government contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The Merisel Transactions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Merisel allegations involve one $130,078 transaction in August 1995 and two transactions in late September 1995 totaling $548,192. Plaintiffs claim that the August transaction, for which FTP issued an invoice, was not a true sale but a \"stock rotation,\" in which FTP replaced outdated products in Merisel's inventory at no charge. Plaintiffs point to a credit issued to Merisel by FTP in mid-October for the full amount. Less detail is provided concerning the September transactions. To support their contention that those transactions were improperly booked contingent sales, plaintiffs proffer three items: the $548,192 posted to accounts receivable on September 29; the fact that $494,872 remained unpaid as of December 31; and the agreement between Merisel and FTP, which states that Merisel will pay FTP for all copies of FTP's products sub-licensed by Merisel and its dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A possible -- though far from necessary -- conclusion is that the August transaction was an exchange of new products for old improperly booked as a sale, as the original Merisel purchase order contains the notation \"[o]ffsetting order f. stockrotation\" (sic). The September transactions, on the other hand, are described in insufficient detail to support plaintiffs' allegations. The mere existence of an overdue receivable does not support an inference that the original transaction was booked as a sale in violation of GAAP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The CC-OPS Transaction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CC-OPS allegation concerns a September 29 order for $705,250 of FTP products, which FTP immediately booked as a sale. A letter from FTP's sales director for the Americas apparently accompanied the invoice. The letter stated that it was FTP's \"policy\" to \"allow[] large or frequent customers to return product without contingency within 60 days of receipt of order.\" Large customers were defined as those generating over $100,000 per year. A copy of the original letter is not present in the invoice file. On November 27, CC-OPS faxed a copy of the letter back to FTP, and FTP extended the right of return from 60 to 90 days. This revised letter is present in the file. Shortly after the return period was lengthened, FTP issued a credit for the full amount of the invoice and authorized the return of the product. On the original invoice is written: \"Credit per Jack Geraghty. Not recognizable revenue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs charge that the initial booking of revenue from this transaction violated GAAP; that the letter indicates that FTP had a policy of granting unlimited return rights to its customers; and that the absence of the original September 29 letter from the file indicates that FTP was attempting to conceal the existence of return rights. However, FAS 48 permits sellers to recognize sales that include a right of return, so long as the required conditions are met and the seller establishes a reasonable reserve for returns. The granting of a right of return in a particular transaction, or even a general policy of granting return rights, does not per se mean that revenue cannot be recognized at the time of sale. Plaintiffs merely make an allegation that FTP failed to adequately reserve and materially overstated FTP's revenues. Without any information on FTP's experience with past return rates, the size of its reserve for returns, or how the reserve changed over time, it is difficult to infer that FTP's revenue recognition decisions were unreasonable enough to violate GAAP, or that they give rise to a strong inference of scienter. \"'Generally accepted accounting principles,' . . . tolerate a range of 'reasonable' treatments, leaving the choice among alternatives to management.\" Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109974\"><a href=\"/opinion/109974/thor-power-tool-co-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 544 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. The Afina Sistemas Transaction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Afina Sistemas (\"Afina\") allegation involves two purchase orders totaling $1.14 million issued on September 28. The orders were for 200,000 copies of FTP's Internet browser, custom made for an Afina client. FTP booked the entire amount as revenue on September 29 and carried the amount as an account receivable throughout the fourth quarter. Plaintiffs claim that this revenue was improperly booked because the version of the browser ordered by Afina was then still under development. An internal FTP document indicates that the test version of the Spanish edition of the browser was not scheduled to be completed until late October. Plaintiffs also point to notations reading \"DO NOT SHIP PRODUCTS\" on documents attached to each invoice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This transaction is difficult to classify. This appears to be one part of a larger undertaking (the \"Telefonica project\" referred to on the Afina purchase order) about which plaintiffs present only fragmentary information. It is not clear that the custom version of FTP's browser referred to in Afina's purchase order is the same as the Spanish version listed on FTP's development schedule. Furthermore, marking \"DO NOT SHIP\" prominently on documents seems an odd way to conceal an improperly booked sale from auditors. Finally, the fact that an overseas customer with 90 days to pay has not paid after 94 days is not highly suspicious. It is possible to infer, however -- at least tentatively -- that this transaction should not have been booked as a sale in September. It is a leap from there to a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The Force 3 Transaction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Force 3 allegations concern a purchase order for $416,325 issued on September 30, which stated on its face that it was contingent on Force 3's receipt of a government contract. FTP nonetheless immediately recorded the entire amount as an account receivable. On December 29, FTP issued Force 3 a credit for the full amount. The same day, Force 3 sent FTP a new purchase order for the same products it ordered on September 30, but this purchase order did not refer to any contingency. FTP issued a new invoice and again booked the amount as a sale. The original booking of this sale in September appears to have violated the requirement in FAS 48 that the buyer's obligation to pay the seller is not contingent on resale of the product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At best, plaintiffs' additional evidence supports an inference that FTP improperly recognized from $416,000 to $1.55 million in revenue in the third quarter of 1995. Because FTP reported overall revenue during the quarter of $37.1 million, these transactions do not support a strong inference of scienter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> It is equally possible to conclude that FTP made some incorrect accounting decisions regarding a limited number of transactions. Seeing fraud, however, requires too great of an inferential leap. In short, even when viewed in combination with plaintiffs' other allegations, plaintiffs' additional evidence does not support a strong inference of scienter, and thus the district court's decision not to consider the evidence could not have affected the outcome of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Insider Trading</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations of insider trading do not, either alone or together with the other allegations, suffice. The individual defendants sold FTP common stock during the Class Period. For example, Zirkle sold 40,000 shares on July 21, 1995 at a price of $26.27 per share, for total proceeds of $1,050,800. Goodnow sold 40,000 shares on July 27 at a price of $29.00 per share, for a total price of $1,160,000. Last, on August 2, 1995, Charlotte Evans sold 200 shares at $28.50 per share, for a total of $57,000. All three defendants sold stock later in the Class Period as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first look at context. The timing does not appear very suspicious. None of these three key players sold at the high points of the stock price. Each waited to sell until after FTP announced a corporate reorganization on July 14, an announcement which caused the price of the stock to fall. Each sold some stock before an allegedly manipulated analyst's report from Brookehill Equities recommended FTP stock as a long-term buy on August 3, 1995, and before a favorable Cowen &amp; Co. report on December 1, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The total sum of sales involved -- over $23 million during a six month period -- could be suspicious, but a closer look provides ready explanations. Goodnow, as plaintiffs allege, retired on October 26, 1995, from his position as vice president, CFO, and treasurer.  His sale of stock in July occurred not long before he left the company. He also sold a considerable number of shares after he left the company -- 690,000 shares accounting for $19 million out of his total of almost $20.2 million in sales during the Class Period. The vast majority of the $23 million in sales by the individual defendants, more than $20 million worth, were by one individual who was leaving the company, and more than $19 million was after that individual had left the company. It is not unusual for individuals leaving a company, like Goodnow, to sell shares. Indeed, they often have a limited period of time to exercise their company stock options. As to the others, the sales do not reflect either unusual sales or sales made before a big \"event\" unknown to the public. Selling after delivering news that causes a company's stock price to go down is not suggestive of withholding information. But that is what happened here. Plaintiffs provided no information on sales by corporate insiders at times outside the Class Period, so there is no comparison point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the total sum involved was large, the district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs produced no evidence that the trading was out of the ordinary or suspicious. Absent additional evidence, it is not possible to draw a strong inference of scienter based on improper trading on material, non-public information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Plaintiffs do not say this statement was false; only that it was misleading because it did not say the increased sales were subject to return rights. As an independent ground, this is too slight; as a ground in service of the contingent sales/improper booking argument, it fails for the same reasons that argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Individual Defendants</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the dismissal of the complaint is upheld, we do not reach the arguments of the individual defendants that the facts alleged do not make out a claim against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.

The device of effecting policy-based change through adjustments in procedural or evidentiary rules is not new, nor is it unique to Congress. Examples are found in statutory presumptions that make it easier or more difficult to prove a case. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1) (presumption of correctness for determinations of factual issues made by state courts in habeas corpus actions); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(a)(3)(A) (presumption of correctness for determinations made by plan sponsors under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act); 33 U.S.C. &#167; 920 (presumptions governing benefits claims under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act).
