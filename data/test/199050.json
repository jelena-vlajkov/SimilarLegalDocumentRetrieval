Before the Court is an appeal from\n\nthe district court's entry of summary judgment. The district court\n\nheld that appellant's sex discrimination claims under the Equal Pay Act\n\nand Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 failed as a matter of law\n\nand entered judgment in favor of the appellee.        We affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n          A.   Appellant's Employment at Smithkline\n\n          Appellant Hilda Rodríguez began employment at appellee\n\nSmithkline Beecham Pharmaceutical, P.R., Inc. (\"Smithkline\") in 1979 as\n\nan Analytical Chemist, a grade level C position within Smithkline's\n\ncompensation structure. She was promoted in 1985 to the position of\n\nSenior Analyst, with a grade level of E.\n\n          In 1986, appellant applied for a lateral transfer to\n\nSmithkline's Documentation Department as a Senior Document Monitor; she\n\nreceived the transfer, although initially as a \"temporary\" assignment.\n\nIn November of 1986, the Senior Document Monitor position was\n\nreevaluated and reclassified as a grade level F position, pursuant to\n\nSmithkline's Job Evaluation Program.1 Appellant's appointment as Senior\n\nDocumentation Monitor was made permanent in June of 1987. In March of\n\n1988, the title of that position was changed to Senior Monitor. In\n\nFebruary 1989, appellant was promoted to Master Records Specialist, a\n\n1 The Job Evaluation Program provides for the regular evaluation of\npositions to ensure that compensation is commensurate with the duties\nof the position, relative to other positions in the company.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fgrade level H position. In January 1991, she was again promoted, to\n\nthe position of Quality Assurance Administrator in the Process\n\nOperations Management System project, with a job grade level of 5E.\n\n          B.   Alleged Wage Discrimination with Regard to the Document\n               Leader Position\n\n          When appellant first joined the Documentation Department in\n\n1986, the position of Documentation Manager was held by Gloria Vales.\n\nVales was compensated at level 7.      In September 1989, Vales was\n\ntransferred to another department and was replaced by Manuel Llivina.\n\nLlivina was transferred in from a grade level 7 position in another\n\ndepartment as part of Smithkline's Management Development Program, and\n\nhe maintained his grade level while serving as Documentation Manager.2\n\nIn August of 1992, Llivina was transferred out of the Documentation\n\nDepartment, again as part of the Management Development Program, and\n\nthe Documentation Manager position became vacant.\n\n          Meanwhile, in July 1991, a new position called Records\n\nManagement Leader was created in the Documentation Department, at grade\n\nlevel 6. Rodoberto Feo was transferred to that position from another\n\n\n\n\n2 The Management Development Program, also called the Leadership\nPlanning Program, protects an employee's grade level as he or she is\nrotated through different positions with the company for developmental\npurposes.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fposition within the company, and he maintained his previous grade level\n\nof 8 pursuant to Smithkline's Personal to Holder policy.3\n\n          After reassessing departmental needs in 1992, Smithkline\n\ndecided to eliminate the Documentation Manager and Records Management\n\nLeader positions. A new position entitled Documentation Leader was\n\ncreated in January of 1993, and appellant was identified as the\n\ncandidate to fill the new position.       When the new position was\n\nevaluated pursuant to the Job Evaluation Program, it was designated a\n\nlevel 6 position. Appellant claims that the difference in grade level\n\n(and thus in compensation) compared to that of Llivina and Feo\n\nconstituted gender-based wage discrimination.\n\n          C.   Alleged Discriminatory Failure to Hire or Promote\n\n          On January 16, 1995, Edwin López was hired as an Analytical\n\nServices Leader or Laboratory Manager, with a grade level of 8, to\n\nmanage and direct the Quality Control section's analytical laboratories\n\n(which included all chemistry laboratories at the facility).        As\n\nrequired by the job description, López had a masters degree and\n\nsignificant previous work experience managing an analytical laboratory.\n\nAppellant claims, however, that appellee's failure to hire or promote\n\nher to the position of Analytical Services Leader, instead of López,\n\n\n\n3 The Personal to Holder policy allows the company to utilize a current\nemployee in a lower grade position without negatively impacting the\nemployee's compensation.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fconstituted sex discrimination.4 Although she does not hold a masters\n\nor doctoral degree, nor had she ever managed an analytical laboratory,\n\nappellant claims that her prior experience at Smithkline qualified her\n\nfor the position.\n\n            D.   Alleged Wage Discrimination with Regard to Compliance\n                 Process Improver Position\n\n            As Analytical Services Leader, López's responsibilities\n\nincluded (1) managerial and supervisory responsibility for all of\n\nQuality Control's5 analytical laboratory operations; (2) monitoring of\n\nall analytical data for submission to regulatory agencies; (3) approval\n\nof all analytical reports, Annual Product Review reports, and Water\n\nSystems reports; (4) improvement, validation, and automation of current\n\nmethodology and technology; (5) provision of analytical and technical\n\nsupport for complaints, internal investigations, product development\n\nactivities, and product transfer areas; (6) development of new and\n\nimproved analytical methodology, including review of pertinent\n\nliterature and formulation of recommendations; and (7) extensive\n\nbudgetary    responsibilities    for    the   analytical   laboratories.\n\n\n\n4 Nowhere does appellant indicate that she applied for this position.\nHowever, appellee seems to concede that she was in the pool of\npotential candidates, apparently pursuant to the company's practice of\nlooking first at current employees when filling vacancies.\n5 Smithkline's Compliance Department is divided into two primary\nfunctional areas: Quality Control and Quality Assurance. According to\nthe company, the functions and processes of each are different from\nthose of the other.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fApproximately sixty-two employees were under López's supervision as\n\nAnalytical Services Leader.\n\n          In 1995, Smithkline began to implement a new organic\n\nstructure in the Compliance Department, as part of a facility-wide\n\nrestructuring. During implementation of the new structure, López was\n\ninformed that his title would eventually change to that of Compliance\n\nProcess Improver for the Quality Control section, although his duties\n\nwould not be affected.6 The Compliance Process Improver position was\n\nreviewed under the Job Evaluation Program and designated a level 6\n\nposition. Before the transition was complete, however, Smithkline\n\nreassessed its needs and determined that López should retain his duties\n\nas head of the laboratories under the title of Compliance Laboratory\n\nStrategist. Because this position entailed most of the functions of\n\nthe Analytical Services Leader position, plus some aspects of the\n\nCompliance Process Improver job, the Laboratory Strategist position was\n\ndesignated a level 8 position.7\n\n          During the implementation of the new organic structure,\n\nappellant was also informed that her title would change to Compliance\n\n\n6 López continued, and still continues, to perform the duties of\nAnalytical Services Leader, although he currently holds the title of\nCompliance Laboratory Strategist.\n7 In his new position, López has supervisory capacity over seventy-four\nemployees, as well as additional quality control and budgetary duties\nbeyond those described above in relation to the Analytical Services\nLeader position. Later in 1997, Smithkline's microbiology laboratory\nwas added to the chemistry labs already under López's supervision.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fProcess Improver, in her case for the Quality Assurance section.\n\nThroughout the transitional period, appellant continued to perform her\n\nduties as Documentation Leader. On January 1, 1997, appellant's change\n\nin position became effective, and she assumed her duties as Compliance\n\nProcess Improver.8 As such, appellant's duties included primarily the\n\nidentification of potential improvement areas and the formulation and\n\nimplementation of projects to make such improvements. She does not\n\ncurrently have, nor has she ever had, managerial responsibility for any\n\nof the laboratories, nor does she supervise any employees or control\n\nany budgetary decisions.\n\n          E.   Procedural History\n\n          On October 1, 1996, appellant sent a letter to Smithkline\n\ncomplaining of discriminatory treatment. She filed a discrimination\n\ncharge with the Antidiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department\n\nof Labor and Human Resources on June 13, 1997. Appellant received her\n\nnotice of right to sue from the Equal        Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission on March 25, 1998, and she subsequently filed this action in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\n\nstating claims under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964.\n\n\n\n\n8  This was the same date upon which López became a Laboratory\nStrategist. The parties dispute whether López was ever actually a\nCompliance Process Improver.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          On July 8, 1999, the district court granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of Smithkline, rejecting all of appellant's claims.\n\nSee Rodríguez v. Smithkline Beecham Pharmaceutical, Puerto Rico, Inc.,\n\n62 F. Supp. 2d 374 (D.P.R. 1999).9 The court first rejected appellant's\n\nfailure to hire or promote claim as untimely. See id. at 379. The\n\ncourt then proceeded to examine the Title VII wage discrimination\n\nclaims. Following the majority of federal courts of appeals to have\n\naddressed the interplay of the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\") and Title VII, the\n\ndistrict court held that the Bennett Amendment to Title VII\n\nincorporated the EPA statutory defenses to wage discrimination claims\n\nbut did not otherwise alter the Title VII analysis, including the\n\nburden-shifting aspects. See id. at 381-82. Applying existing First\n\nCircuit law, the court determined that appellant had failed to make out\n\na prima facie case of discrimination, see id. at 383-84, and further\n\nthat appellant had not shown Smithkline's proffered reasons to be\n\npretextual, see id. at 384. Finally, the district court rejected\n\nappellant's EPA claims, concluding as a matter of law that appellant's\n\njob was not substantially similar to that of López nor to that of\n\nLlivina or Feo.    See id.\n\n\n\n\n9 The court had previously denied a motion by appellant to add an\nexpert to her witness list. See Rodríguez v. Smithkline Beecham\nPharmaceutical, P.R., Inc., Civil No. 98-1649(JP) (D.P.R. filed Mar.\n25, 1999); id. (D.P.R. filed Apr. 5, 1999) (denying motion for\nreconsideration).\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          This appeal followed. In addition to claiming that the\n\ndistrict court erred in entering summary judgment against her on all\n\nclaims, appellant also argues that the court erred in denying her\n\nmotion to add an expert to her witness list.\n\nII.   LAW AND APPLICATION\n\n          A.   Standard of Review\n\n          We review orders granting summary judgment de novo,\n\nconstruing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and\n\nresolving all reasonable inferences in her favor. See GE Supply v. C\n\n& G Enters., Inc., 212 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2000). We are not limited\n\nto accepting or rejecting the district court's rationale; rather, we\n\nmay affirm the entry of summary judgment on any sufficient ground\n\nrevealed by the record.     See id.\n\n          The district court's exclusion of expert testimony is\n\nreviewed under an \"abuse of discretion\" standard. See General Elec.\n\nCo. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 139 (1997).\n\n          B.   Equal Pay Act Claims\n\n          The Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\"), codified at 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1),\n\nstates:\n\n          No employer . . . shall discriminate, within any\n          establishment in which such employees are\n          employed, between employees on the basis of sex\n          by paying wages . . . at a rate less than the\n          rate at which he pays wages to employees of the\n          opposite sex in such establishment for equal work\n          on jobs the performance of which requires equal\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f          skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are\n          performed under similar working conditions,\n          except where such payment is made pursuant to (i)\n          a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a\n          system which measures earnings by quantity or\n          quality of production; or (iv) a differential\n          based on any other factor other than sex . . . .\n\nAn EPA claimant must make a prima facie showing that the employer paid\n\ndifferent wages to a member of the opposite sex for substantially equal\n\nwork. See Byrd v. Ronayne, 61 F.3d 1026, 1033 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing\n\nCorning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 195 (1974)). Once a\n\nprima facie case has been made, the employer then must establish one of\n\nthe four statutory affirmative defenses to avoid liability.          See id.\n\n          Appellant claims that she suffered gender-based wage\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the EPA with respect to two positions --\n\nthat of Document Leader, and that of Compliance Process Improver.\n\nNeither claim has merit.\n\n             1.   Document Leader Position\n\n          Appellant claims that she was discriminated against on the\n\nbasis of her gender when the Document Leader position was classified as\n\na level 6 position. She bases this contention on the fact that the\n\nprevious Document Manager was paid at level 7 and the previous Records\n\nManagement Leader was paid at level 8. However, appellant has failed\n\nto make a prima facie showing that the Document Manager and Records\n\nManagement Leader positions were substantially equal to the Document\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fLeader position, and Smithkline has also established that the different\n\npay levels were based on a \"factor other than sex.\"\n\n          As the district court properly concluded, the position of\n\nDocument Leader created in 1993 entailed a substantially different set\n\nof responsibilities from those of the Document Manager and Records\n\nManagement Leader positions.      For instance, although there was\n\ncertainly overlap between the duties of the new position and those of\n\nthe former positions, several important functions of the Document\n\nManager position were omitted from the role of Document Leader,\n\nincluding responsibility for the microfilming program, the handling of\n\nnew drug applications, and the preparation of annual reviews. The\n\nDocument Manager was also responsible for evaluating abnormalities in\n\nthe manufacturing process and recommending solutions when problems\n\narose, as well as informing the management of significant deviations\n\nfrom standard operating procedures and making sensitive decisions\n\nregarding drug recalls. We cannot conclude that these uncontested\n\ndifferences in responsibility were insubstantial, and we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that appellant failed to make a prima facie showing of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n          Although the failure to establish a prima facie case is fatal\n\nto appellant's claim, we also mention our agreement with the district\n\ncourt that the different wages paid to appellant and the prior Document\n\nManager and Record Management Leader were based on a factor other than\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fsex. See 29 U.S.C § 206(d)(1)(iv). Smithkline established that both\n\nLlivina and Feo were being paid at the level of a prior position\n\npursuant to standing company policies designed, in one instance, to\n\nprotect employees' salary and grade levels during developmental\n\nplacements and, in the other, to allow the company to utilize employees\n\nat lower level positions without detriment to the employee's\n\ncompensation. Such programs are \"factors other than sex\" within the\n\nmeaning of the EPA and therefore constitute a legitimate basis for wage\n\ndifferentials. Cf. Handy v. New Orleans Hilton Hotel, 532 F. Supp. 68,\n\n72 (E.D. La. 1982) (noting that wage differential was lawful because,\n\ninter alia, higher-paid employee's wage was set pursuant to defendant's\n\nPersonnel Development Program).\n\n             2.   The Compliance Process Improver Position\n\n          Appellant next argues that she was discriminated against\n\nbecause she was compensated at level 6 while Edwin López was\n\ncompensated at level 8, although it appears that the two may have had\n\nthe same job title. Here again, appellant has failed to make out a\n\nprima facie case.\n\n          Although job titles may be given some weight in determining\n\nwhether two employees hold substantially equal positions, the EPA's\n\nemphasis is on the responsibilities and functions of the position. See\n\nMiranda v. B & B Cash Grocery Store, 975 F.2d 1518, 1533 (11th Cir.\n\n1992) (\"Although job titles are entitled to some weight in this\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fevaluation [of whether jobs are substantially equal], 'the controlling\n\nfactor under the Equal Pay Act is job content' -- the actual duties\n\nthat the respective employees are called upon to perform.\"). Here,\n\nthere exists a genuine dispute of fact over whether López at one time\n\nheld the position of Compliance Process Improver;10 however, that\n\ndispute is not material, because appellant has failed as a matter of\n\nlaw to establish that her responsibilities were substantially equal to\n\nthose   of   López.    López   has    had   managerial   and   supervisory\n\nresponsibility for all of Smithkline's Quality Control analytical\n\nlaboratories since he became Analytical Services Leader, and he now has\n\nresponsibility for the microbiology and external compliance labs as\n\nwell. He oversees the performance of scores of employees and also\n\ncontrols a budget of nearly three million dollars. Appellant has not\n\nshown that she ever had comparable responsibility. In sum, we are\n\npersuaded that the two positions were in fact substantially dissimilar,\n\nand we agree with the district court that appellant has failed to make\n\na prima facie showing of disparate compensation for comparable work.\n\nHer EPA claim therefore fails as a matter of law.\n\n             C.   Title VII Claims\n\n             Appellant also makes two allegations under Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). She\n\n10 It is not contested that his title was changed to Laboratory\nStrategist on January 1, 1997, the same date that appellant became a\nCompliance Process Improver.\n\n                                     -14-\n\ffirst alleges that Smithkline discriminatorily failed to hire or\n\npromote her to the position of Analytical Service Leader, the position\n\nfor which López was hired in 1995, and she also claims that she\n\nsuffered wage discrimination in violation of Title VII with respect to\n\nthe Document Leader and Compliance Process Improver positions.\n\n             1.   Failure to Hire or Promote Claim\n\n           Appellant alleges that, when Smithkline hired López to fill\n\nthe position of Analytical Service Leader in 1995, its failure to hire\n\nor promote her to that position constituted sex discrimination\n\nprohibited by Title VII. However, as the district court correctly\n\nnoted, any person seeking relief under Title VII must file a charge\n\nwith the EEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged\n\nemployment practice occurred,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1), or if a claim\n\nis filed with a state or local agency \"within three hundred days after\n\nthe alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\" id. López was\n\nhired on January 16, 1995. Appellant's charge was not filed until June\n\nof 1997.   Her cause of action is therefore barred.\n\n           Appellant argues that the 300-day limitations period was\n\ntolled in her case because the discriminatory actions of the appellee\n\nwere ongoing and systemic and subject to the continuing violation\n\nexception to the limitations period. See Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy,\n\n145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998). However, the only evidence offered by\n\nappellant to support her contention of a discriminatory policy or\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fpractice by Smithkline is what she optimistically refers to as\n\n\"statistical\" evidence. Although the figures admitted by appellant\n\nundeniably demonstrate that more males than females held higher paying\n\npositions at Smithkline's facility, the numbers are not provided in a\n\ncontext which would lend them probative value in a statistical sense.\n\nTo give just one example, no showing has been made of how many females\n\napplied for higher-paying positions, nor of how many qualified females\n\nthere may have been in any relevant pool of potential employees. See\n\nBlizard v. Frechette, 601 F.2d 1217, 1223-24 (1st Cir. 1979) (upholding\n\nexclusion of statistical evidence because, inter alia, \"appellant's\n\noffer was in no way related to the available pool of qualified female\n\napplicants for the positions filled predominantly by males\"). Although\n\nwe recognize that statistical evidence can be a valid, and often\n\npowerful, means of proving discriminatory practices, the numbers\n\noffered by appellant fall far short of establishing any such\n\ndiscrimination by Smithkline. The continuing violation doctrine has no\n\napplication to appellant's case, and her failure to hire or promote\n\nclaim is time-barred.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f             2.   Wage Discrimination\n\n           Appellant's Title VII wage discrimination claim fails for the\n\nsame reason that her EPA wage discrimination contention failed -- she\n\nhas not made a prima facie showing that she was paid less than a male\n\nemployee for substantially equal work.\n\n           While noting that the federal courts of appeals have\n\ndisagreed over the effect of the Bennett Amendment to Title VII,11 the\n\ndistrict court analyzed appellant's wage discrimination claim under the\n\nburden-shifting evidentiary framework generally applied to Title VII\n\nallegations.12 See Rodríguez, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 382. In doing so, the\n\n\n11   The Bennett Amendment states:\n\n           It shall not be an unlawful employment practice\n           under [Title VII] for any employer to\n           differentiate upon the basis of sex in\n           determining the amount of the wages or\n           compensation paid or to be paid to employees of\n           such employer if such differentiating is\n           authorized by the provisions of [the EPA].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(h). The disagreement among the courts of appeals\nhas been over whether the Amendment merely incorporates the EPA's\nstatutory affirmative defenses or whether the Amendment alters the\nactual evidentiary framework and analysis of Title VII wage\ndiscrimination claims to incorporate the liability standards of the\nEPA. See Rodríguez, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 381-82 (discussing the circuit\nsplit). We need not resolve that question in this case, because\nappellant failed to make a prima facie case under either the EPA or the\ngeneral Title VII framework.\n12 We note the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in Reeves\nv. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2109 (2000), in\nwhich the Court held that, under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting\nanalysis, a plaintiff may rely on her prima facie case, together with\na showing that the defendant's proffered reasons for the adverse\n\n                                 -17-\n\fcourt properly found that appellant had failed to make a prima facie\n\nshowing of gender-based wage discrimination.        See id. at 383-84.\n\n           As we set forth above, the uncontested facts before the\n\ndistrict   court   indicate   that   appellant's   job   functions   and\n\nresponsibilities were not substantially similar or comparable to those\n\nof Document Manager Llivina or Records Management Leader Feo, nor to\n\nthose of Edwin López. Absent such a showing, plaintiff's Title VII\n\nclaim fails as a matter of law for lack of a prima facie case.\n\n           D.   Exclusion of Expert Testimony\n\n           Finally, appellant argues, almost in passing, that the\n\ndistrict court erred in excluding the testimony of her proposed expert.\n\nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion. See\n\nGeneral Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 139 (1997) (abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard of review applies to admission or exclusion of\n\nexpert testimony).\n\n           The district court's orders make clear that appellant had\n\nfailed to comply with the court's scheduling orders and was attempting\n\nto add an expert a mere two weeks before the deadline for filing\n\n\n\nemployment action were false, without further demonstrating that the\ndefendant's stated reasons were motivated by a discriminatory animus.\nAlthough the district court's reference to the so-called \"pretext-plus\"\nstandard, see Rodríguez, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 384-85, was therefore in\nerror, such error does not require reversal because Smithkline is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis that appellant\nfailed to make out a prima facie case of wage discrimination (thus\nnever reaching the subsequent stages of the burden-shifting analysis).\n\n                                 -18-\n\fdispositive motions. Such noncompliance with court orders, together\n\nwith the fact that appellant failed to even specify the area of the\n\nwitness's expertise except to say that he would testify with respect to\n\nher EPA and Title VII claims, persuades us that the district court was\n\nwell justified in excluding the proposed testimony. See Atlas Truck\n\nLeasing, Inc. v. First NH Banks, Inc., 808 F.2d 902, 903-04 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (district court has wide latitude in formulating pretrial orders\n\nand imposing sanctions for noncompliance and will be reversed only when\n\nruling results in clear injustice).\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we hold that the district\n\ncourt properly granted summary judgment in favor of Smithkline and\n\nagainst appellant on all of her EPA and Title VII claims.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f",

Before the Court is an appeal from\n\nthe district court's entry of summary judgment. The district court\n\nheld that appellant's sex discrimination claims under the Equal Pay Act\n\nand Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 failed as a matter of law\n\nand entered judgment in favor of the appellee.        We affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n          A.   Appellant's Employment at Smithkline\n\n          Appellant Hilda Rodríguez began employment at appellee\n\nSmithkline Beecham Pharmaceutical, P.R., Inc. (\"Smithkline\") in 1979 as\n\nan Analytical Chemist, a grade level C position within Smithkline's\n\ncompensation structure. She was promoted in 1985 to the position of\n\nSenior Analyst, with a grade level of E.\n\n          In 1986, appellant applied for a lateral transfer to\n\nSmithkline's Documentation Department as a Senior Document Monitor; she\n\nreceived the transfer, although initially as a \"temporary\" assignment.\n\nIn November of 1986, the Senior Document Monitor position was\n\nreevaluated and reclassified as a grade level F position, pursuant to\n\nSmithkline's Job Evaluation Program.1 Appellant's appointment as Senior\n\nDocumentation Monitor was made permanent in June of 1987. In March of\n\n1988, the title of that position was changed to Senior Monitor. In\n\nFebruary 1989, appellant was promoted to Master Records Specialist, a\n\n1 The Job Evaluation Program provides for the regular evaluation of\npositions to ensure that compensation is commensurate with the duties\nof the position, relative to other positions in the company.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fgrade level H position. In January 1991, she was again promoted, to\n\nthe position of Quality Assurance Administrator in the Process\n\nOperations Management System project, with a job grade level of 5E.\n\n          B.   Alleged Wage Discrimination with Regard to the Document\n               Leader Position\n\n          When appellant first joined the Documentation Department in\n\n1986, the position of Documentation Manager was held by Gloria Vales.\n\nVales was compensated at level 7.      In September 1989, Vales was\n\ntransferred to another department and was replaced by Manuel Llivina.\n\nLlivina was transferred in from a grade level 7 position in another\n\ndepartment as part of Smithkline's Management Development Program, and\n\nhe maintained his grade level while serving as Documentation Manager.2\n\nIn August of 1992, Llivina was transferred out of the Documentation\n\nDepartment, again as part of the Management Development Program, and\n\nthe Documentation Manager position became vacant.\n\n          Meanwhile, in July 1991, a new position called Records\n\nManagement Leader was created in the Documentation Department, at grade\n\nlevel 6. Rodoberto Feo was transferred to that position from another\n\n\n\n\n2 The Management Development Program, also called the Leadership\nPlanning Program, protects an employee's grade level as he or she is\nrotated through different positions with the company for developmental\npurposes.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fposition within the company, and he maintained his previous grade level\n\nof 8 pursuant to Smithkline's Personal to Holder policy.3\n\n          After reassessing departmental needs in 1992, Smithkline\n\ndecided to eliminate the Documentation Manager and Records Management\n\nLeader positions. A new position entitled Documentation Leader was\n\ncreated in January of 1993, and appellant was identified as the\n\ncandidate to fill the new position.       When the new position was\n\nevaluated pursuant to the Job Evaluation Program, it was designated a\n\nlevel 6 position. Appellant claims that the difference in grade level\n\n(and thus in compensation) compared to that of Llivina and Feo\n\nconstituted gender-based wage discrimination.\n\n          C.   Alleged Discriminatory Failure to Hire or Promote\n\n          On January 16, 1995, Edwin López was hired as an Analytical\n\nServices Leader or Laboratory Manager, with a grade level of 8, to\n\nmanage and direct the Quality Control section's analytical laboratories\n\n(which included all chemistry laboratories at the facility).        As\n\nrequired by the job description, López had a masters degree and\n\nsignificant previous work experience managing an analytical laboratory.\n\nAppellant claims, however, that appellee's failure to hire or promote\n\nher to the position of Analytical Services Leader, instead of López,\n\n\n\n3 The Personal to Holder policy allows the company to utilize a current\nemployee in a lower grade position without negatively impacting the\nemployee's compensation.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fconstituted sex discrimination.4 Although she does not hold a masters\n\nor doctoral degree, nor had she ever managed an analytical laboratory,\n\nappellant claims that her prior experience at Smithkline qualified her\n\nfor the position.\n\n            D.   Alleged Wage Discrimination with Regard to Compliance\n                 Process Improver Position\n\n            As Analytical Services Leader, López's responsibilities\n\nincluded (1) managerial and supervisory responsibility for all of\n\nQuality Control's5 analytical laboratory operations; (2) monitoring of\n\nall analytical data for submission to regulatory agencies; (3) approval\n\nof all analytical reports, Annual Product Review reports, and Water\n\nSystems reports; (4) improvement, validation, and automation of current\n\nmethodology and technology; (5) provision of analytical and technical\n\nsupport for complaints, internal investigations, product development\n\nactivities, and product transfer areas; (6) development of new and\n\nimproved analytical methodology, including review of pertinent\n\nliterature and formulation of recommendations; and (7) extensive\n\nbudgetary    responsibilities    for    the   analytical   laboratories.\n\n\n\n4 Nowhere does appellant indicate that she applied for this position.\nHowever, appellee seems to concede that she was in the pool of\npotential candidates, apparently pursuant to the company's practice of\nlooking first at current employees when filling vacancies.\n5 Smithkline's Compliance Department is divided into two primary\nfunctional areas: Quality Control and Quality Assurance. According to\nthe company, the functions and processes of each are different from\nthose of the other.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fApproximately sixty-two employees were under López's supervision as\n\nAnalytical Services Leader.\n\n          In 1995, Smithkline began to implement a new organic\n\nstructure in the Compliance Department, as part of a facility-wide\n\nrestructuring. During implementation of the new structure, López was\n\ninformed that his title would eventually change to that of Compliance\n\nProcess Improver for the Quality Control section, although his duties\n\nwould not be affected.6 The Compliance Process Improver position was\n\nreviewed under the Job Evaluation Program and designated a level 6\n\nposition. Before the transition was complete, however, Smithkline\n\nreassessed its needs and determined that López should retain his duties\n\nas head of the laboratories under the title of Compliance Laboratory\n\nStrategist. Because this position entailed most of the functions of\n\nthe Analytical Services Leader position, plus some aspects of the\n\nCompliance Process Improver job, the Laboratory Strategist position was\n\ndesignated a level 8 position.7\n\n          During the implementation of the new organic structure,\n\nappellant was also informed that her title would change to Compliance\n\n\n6 López continued, and still continues, to perform the duties of\nAnalytical Services Leader, although he currently holds the title of\nCompliance Laboratory Strategist.\n7 In his new position, López has supervisory capacity over seventy-four\nemployees, as well as additional quality control and budgetary duties\nbeyond those described above in relation to the Analytical Services\nLeader position. Later in 1997, Smithkline's microbiology laboratory\nwas added to the chemistry labs already under López's supervision.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fProcess Improver, in her case for the Quality Assurance section.\n\nThroughout the transitional period, appellant continued to perform her\n\nduties as Documentation Leader. On January 1, 1997, appellant's change\n\nin position became effective, and she assumed her duties as Compliance\n\nProcess Improver.8 As such, appellant's duties included primarily the\n\nidentification of potential improvement areas and the formulation and\n\nimplementation of projects to make such improvements. She does not\n\ncurrently have, nor has she ever had, managerial responsibility for any\n\nof the laboratories, nor does she supervise any employees or control\n\nany budgetary decisions.\n\n          E.   Procedural History\n\n          On October 1, 1996, appellant sent a letter to Smithkline\n\ncomplaining of discriminatory treatment. She filed a discrimination\n\ncharge with the Antidiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department\n\nof Labor and Human Resources on June 13, 1997. Appellant received her\n\nnotice of right to sue from the Equal        Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission on March 25, 1998, and she subsequently filed this action in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\n\nstating claims under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964.\n\n\n\n\n8  This was the same date upon which López became a Laboratory\nStrategist. The parties dispute whether López was ever actually a\nCompliance Process Improver.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          On July 8, 1999, the district court granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of Smithkline, rejecting all of appellant's claims.\n\nSee Rodríguez v.

In addition to claiming that the\n\ndistrict court erred in entering summary judgment against her on all\n\nclaims, appellant also argues that the court erred in denying her\n\nmotion to add an expert to her witness list.\n\nII.

Equal Pay Act Claims\n\n          The Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\"), codified at 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1),\n\nstates:\n\n          No employer . . . shall discriminate, within any\n          establishment in which such employees are\n          employed, between employees on the basis of sex\n          by paying wages . . . at a rate less than the\n          rate at which he pays wages to employees of the\n          opposite sex in such establishment for equal work\n          on jobs the performance of which requires equal\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f          skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are\n          performed under similar working conditions,\n          except where such payment is made pursuant to (i)\n          a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a\n          system which measures earnings by quantity or\n          quality of production; or (iv) a differential\n          based on any other factor other than sex . . . .\n\nAn EPA claimant must make a prima facie showing that the employer paid\n\ndifferent wages to a member of the opposite sex for substantially equal\n\nwork.

Document Leader Position\n\n          Appellant claims that she was discriminated against on the\n\nbasis of her gender when the Document Leader position was classified as\n\na level 6 position. She bases this contention on the fact that the\n\nprevious Document Manager was paid at level 7 and the previous Records\n\nManagement Leader was paid at level 8. However, appellant has failed\n\nto make a prima facie showing that the Document Manager and Records\n\nManagement Leader positions were substantially equal to the Document\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fLeader position, and Smithkline has also established that the different\n\npay levels were based on a \"factor other than sex.\"\n\n          As the district court properly concluded, the position of\n\nDocument Leader created in 1993 entailed a substantially different set\n\nof responsibilities from those of the Document Manager and Records\n\nManagement Leader positions.      For instance, although there was\n\ncertainly overlap between the duties of the new position and those of\n\nthe former positions, several important functions of the Document\n\nManager position were omitted from the role of Document Leader,\n\nincluding responsibility for the microfilming program, the handling of\n\nnew drug applications, and the preparation of annual reviews. The\n\nDocument Manager was also responsible for evaluating abnormalities in\n\nthe manufacturing process and recommending solutions when problems\n\narose, as well as informing the management of significant deviations\n\nfrom standard operating procedures and making sensitive decisions\n\nregarding drug recalls. We cannot conclude that these uncontested\n\ndifferences in responsibility were insubstantial, and we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that appellant failed to make a prima facie showing of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n          Although the failure to establish a prima facie case is fatal\n\nto appellant's claim, we also mention our agreement with the district\n\ncourt that the different wages paid to appellant and the prior Document\n\nManager and Record Management Leader were based on a factor other than\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fsex. See 29 U.S.C § 206(d)(1)(iv). Smithkline established that both\n\nLlivina and Feo were being paid at the level of a prior position\n\npursuant to standing company policies designed, in one instance, to\n\nprotect employees' salary and grade levels during developmental\n\nplacements and, in the other, to allow the company to utilize employees\n\nat lower level positions without detriment to the employee's\n\ncompensation. Such programs are \"factors other than sex\" within the\n\nmeaning of the EPA and therefore constitute a legitimate basis for wage\n\ndifferentials. Cf. Handy v. New Orleans Hilton Hotel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146092\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146092/handy-v-new-orleans-hilton-hotel/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

La. 1982) (noting that wage differential was lawful because,\n\ninter alia, higher-paid employee's wage was set pursuant to defendant's\n\nPersonnel Development Program).\n\n             2.   The Compliance Process Improver Position\n\n          Appellant next argues that she was discriminated against\n\nbecause she was compensated at level 6 while Edwin López was\n\ncompensated at level 8, although it appears that the two may have had\n\nthe same job title. Here again, appellant has failed to make out a\n\nprima facie case.\n\n          Although job titles may be given some weight in determining\n\nwhether two employees hold substantially equal positions, the EPA's\n\nemphasis is on the responsibilities and functions of the position. See\n\nMiranda v. B & B Cash Grocery Store, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591210\"><a href=\"/opinion/591210/karen-miranda-v-b-b-cash-grocery-store-inc-karen-miranda-v-b-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1533 (11th Cir.\n\n1992) (\"Although job titles are entitled to some weight in this\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fevaluation [of whether jobs are substantially equal], 'the controlling\n\nfactor under the Equal Pay Act is job content' -- the actual duties\n\nthat the respective employees are called upon to perform.\"). Here,\n\nthere exists a genuine dispute of fact over whether López at one time\n\nheld the position of Compliance Process Improver;10 however, that\n\ndispute is not material, because appellant has failed as a matter of\n\nlaw to establish that her responsibilities were substantially equal to\n\nthose   of   López.    López   has    had   managerial   and   supervisory\n\nresponsibility for all of Smithkline's Quality Control analytical\n\nlaboratories since he became Analytical Services Leader, and he now has\n\nresponsibility for the microbiology and external compliance labs as\n\nwell. He oversees the performance of scores of employees and also\n\ncontrols a budget of nearly three million dollars. Appellant has not\n\nshown that she ever had comparable responsibility. In sum, we are\n\npersuaded that the two positions were in fact substantially dissimilar,\n\nand we agree with the district court that appellant has failed to make\n\na prima facie showing of disparate compensation for comparable work.\n\nHer EPA claim therefore fails as a matter of law.\n\n             C.   Title VII Claims\n\n             Appellant also makes two allegations under Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). She\n\n10 It is not contested that his title was changed to Laboratory\nStrategist on January 1, 1997, the same date that appellant became a\nCompliance Process Improver.\n\n                                     -14-\n\ffirst alleges that Smithkline discriminatorily failed to hire or\n\npromote her to the position of Analytical Service Leader, the position\n\nfor which López was hired in 1995, and she also claims that she\n\nsuffered wage discrimination in violation of Title VII with respect to\n\nthe Document Leader and Compliance Process Improver positions.\n\n             1.   Failure to Hire or Promote Claim\n\n           Appellant alleges that, when Smithkline hired López to fill\n\nthe position of Analytical Service Leader in 1995, its failure to hire\n\nor promote her to that position constituted sex discrimination\n\nprohibited by Title VII. However, as the district court correctly\n\nnoted, any person seeking relief under Title VII must file a charge\n\nwith the EEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged\n\nemployment practice occurred,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1), or if a claim\n\nis filed with a state or local agency \"within three hundred days after\n\nthe alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> López was\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\nhired on January 16, 1995. Appellant's charge was not filed until June\n\nof 1997.   Her cause of action is therefore barred.\n\n           Appellant argues that the 300-day limitations period was\n\ntolled in her case because the discriminatory actions of the appellee\n\nwere ongoing and systemic and subject to the continuing violation\n\nexception to the limitations period.

Although\n\nwe recognize that statistical evidence can be a valid, and often\n\npowerful, means of proving discriminatory practices, the numbers\n\noffered by appellant fall far short of establishing any such\n\ndiscrimination by Smithkline. The continuing violation doctrine has no\n\napplication to appellant's case, and her failure to hire or promote\n\nclaim is time-barred.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f             2.   Wage Discrimination\n\n           Appellant's Title VII wage discrimination claim fails for the\n\nsame reason that her EPA wage discrimination contention failed -- she\n\nhas not made a prima facie showing that she was paid less than a male\n\nemployee for substantially equal work.\n\n           While noting that the federal courts of appeals have\n\ndisagreed over the effect of the Bennett Amendment to Title VII,11 the\n\ndistrict court analyzed appellant's wage discrimination claim under the\n\nburden-shifting evidentiary framework generally applied to Title VII\n\nallegations.12 See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410533\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rodríguez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2410533/rodriguez-v-smithkline-beecham-pharmaceutical/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In doing so, the\n\n\n11   The Bennett Amendment states:\n\n           It shall not be an unlawful employment practice\n           under [Title VII] for any employer to\n           differentiate upon the basis of sex in\n           determining the amount of the wages or\n           compensation paid or to be paid to employees of\n           such employer if such differentiating is\n           authorized by the provisions of [the EPA].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(h). The disagreement among the courts of appeals\nhas been over whether the Amendment merely incorporates the EPA's\nstatutory affirmative defenses or whether the Amendment alters the\nactual evidentiary framework and analysis of Title VII wage\ndiscrimination claims to incorporate the liability standards of the\nEPA.

Exclusion of Expert Testimony\n\n           Finally, appellant argues, almost in passing, that the\n\ndistrict court erred in excluding the testimony of her proposed expert.\n\nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion. See\n\nGeneral Elec. Co. v.

Such noncompliance with court orders, together\n\nwith the fact that appellant failed to even specify the area of the\n\nwitness's expertise except to say that he would testify with respect to\n\nher EPA and Title VII claims, persuades us that the district court was\n\nwell justified in excluding the proposed testimony.
