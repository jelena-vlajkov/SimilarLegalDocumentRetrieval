Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Walter B. Prince with whom Peckham, Lobel, Casey, Prince &amp; Tye\r\nLLP was on brief for respondent-appellant.\r\n   Richard L. Hoffman, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\npetitioner-appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 21, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This appeal, which presents\r\ndifficult questions concerning the adverse spousal testimony\r\nprivilege, arises out of the following facts.  The appellant, Rafia\r\nFeghi, is married to Joseph A. Yerardi, Jr.  In October 1993,\r\nJoseph Yerardi was indicted in the district court on 71 counts,\r\nincluding money laundering, extortion, witness intimidation,\r\noperating an illegal gambling business, racketeering and criminal\r\nforfeiture.  18 U.S.C.  2, 892, 894, 982, 1503, 1512, 1955-56,\r\n1962-63.  In due course, the forfeiture counts resulted in\r\nancillary proceedings that are the focus of this appeal.\r\nYerardi was released on bail in July 1994, and Feghi\r\nsigned a $1.5 million appearance bond to secure his presence.  When\r\nYerardi was later charged with violating conditions of his release,\r\nthe government sought forfeiture of the bond.  Feghi testified at\r\nthe forfeiture proceeding in February 1995, invoking certain\r\ntestimonial privileges but (says the government) not invoking the\r\nadverse spousal testimony privilege.  The government now relies on\r\nthis failure as precluding later assertion of the privilege.\r\nOn May 1, 1995, Yerardi entered into a written plea\r\nagreement with the government.  Pursuant to that agreement, Yerardi\r\npled guilty to all counts of the indictment and, in accordance with\r\n18 U.S.C.  982, 1963, agreed to forfeit $916,000.  He also\r\nconsented to the entry of an asset discovery order, including the\r\ndeposition of witnesses and the production of documents and related\r\nmaterials deemed necessary by the U.S. Attorney to implement the\r\nforfeiture agreement.  At sentencing, however, Yerardi's counsel\r\nmaintained Yerardi's earlier position that his only asset was\r\n$5,000 worth of jewelry.  \r\nThe government believes that Feghi now controls or knows\r\nof assets that once belonged to Yerardi but have since been\r\nforfeited to the United States, and that Feghi would not qualify as\r\na bona fide purchaser for value.  18 U.S.C.  1963(l)(6)(B); 21\r\nU.S.C.  853(n)(6)(B). Further, the government wants to locate\r\nother Yerardi assets, which Feghi may control or know of, that\r\ncould be available to the government to make up the value of any\r\ndirectly forfeited assets that can no longer be found.  18 U.S.C.\r\n1963(m); 21 U.S.C.  853(p).  Apparently, the government sought\r\nFeghi's informal cooperation but was rebuffed.\r\nAccordingly, the government served a subpoena duces tecum\r\non Feghi in October 1995, later enforced in part by the district\r\ncourt, and it deposed Feghi on March 22, 1996.  Ultimately, in\r\nresponse to the enforced document requests, Feghi took the position\r\nthat she had no such documents, and she declined in deposition to\r\nanswer further questions about the requests, as well as direct\r\nquestions on a number of different issues concerning Yerardi's\r\nassets, transfers of money between Yerardi and Feghi, actions taken\r\nby Feghi pursuant to the power of attorney that Yerardi had given\r\nto her, and similar matters.  The basis for these refusals was\r\nFeghi's assertion of the adverse spousal testimony privilege.\r\nIn April 1996, the government moved to compel Feghi to\r\nanswer its questions.  The magistrate judge allowed the\r\ngovernment's motion to compel on September 26, 1996, primarily on\r\nthe ground that the prospect of future criminal prosecution of\r\nYerardi (e.g., for tax evasion) was too speculative to support the\r\nprivilege, and also on the ground that Yerardi had disclaimed any\r\ninterest in the assets held by Feghi.  The district court affirmed\r\nthe magistrate judge's order on May 5, 1997, when it rejected\r\nFeghi's motion for reconsideration.\r\nFeghi continued to refuse to testify and invited the\r\ndistrict court to hold her in contempt so that she could test its\r\nprivilege ruling on appeal.  After a hearing on December 21, 1998,\r\nthe district court held Feghi in contempt for refusing to answer,\r\nand it imposed prospectively civil penalties on Feghi, rising after\r\ntwo weeks to $1,000 per day, to compel obedience.  Thereafter, on\r\nApril 30, 1999, this court stayed the district court's contempt\r\norder pending Feghi's appeal.  Although we thought it a close\r\nquestion whether Feghi was likely to prevail, accumulating fines\r\n(unless stayed) appeared likely to force Feghi to answer\r\nimmediately and thereby deprive her of an effective appeal.\r\nAlthough contempt rulings are sometimes said to be\r\nreviewable for \"abuse of discretion,\" the standard depends upon the\r\nprecise issue or issues presented: abstract issues of law are\r\nreviewed de novo and determinations of raw fact are tested under\r\nthe clearly erroneous standard.  Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v.\r\nPepsiCo, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 61 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998).  Whether a\r\nfuture criminal prosecution of Yerardi based on Feghi's testimony\r\nis \"speculative\" is the kind of \"mixed\" question on which the\r\ndistrict court's assessment is often, although not always, given\r\nweight.  See In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).\r\nIn federal criminal cases, issues of privilege are\r\nresolved by judge-made rules based on common law principles, except\r\nwhere the Constitution or other federal enactments resolve the\r\nissue.  Fed. R. Evid. 501.  As revamped by the Supreme Court in\r\nTrammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), the privilege against\r\nadverse spousal testimony gives the witness-spouse a privilege not\r\nto testify against the defendant-spouse in criminal or related\r\nproceedings, subject to certain exceptions and to waiver.  See \r\nLarkin, Federal Practice: Federal Testimonial Privileges  4.02\r\n(1999).  The privilege is a companion to, but distinct from, the\r\nprivilege protecting confidential communications between husband\r\nand wife.  See id.  4.03.\r\nAt the threshold, the government urges that the privilege\r\nhas been waived because Yerardi in his plea agreement consented\r\nboth to the forfeiture and to full discovery by the government of\r\nall information needed to implement the forfeiture.  The plea\r\nagreement might be read as an implicit waiver of the privilege by\r\nYerardi.  However, the Supreme Court made clear in Trammel that the\r\nprivilege against adverse spousal testimony belongs not to the\r\ndefendant-spouse, here Yerardi, but rather to the witness-spouse,\r\nhere Feghi.  See Trammel, 445 U.S. at 53.  Yerardi as the\r\ndefendant-spouse thus had no privilege to waive and, far more\r\nimportantly, he had no authority to waive Feghi's privilege to\r\nrefuse to testify adversely to him.\r\nBecause the privilege is rooted in a dual desire to\r\nprotect marital harmony and to avoid the unseemliness of compelling\r\none spouse to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding,\r\nid. at 44-45, 52-53 &amp; n.12, the privilege is limited to testimony\r\nthat is adverse to the legal interests of the defendant-spouse, 8\r\nWigmore, Evidence  2234, at 231 (McNaughton rev. 1961).  Pointing\r\nagain to Yerardi's plea agreement, the government contends that\r\ntestimony cannot be adverse where the defendant-spouse has\r\nconsented to it.  It is hard to see how a future criminal\r\nprosecution of Yerardi--the extent of the threat is discussed below\r\n--would not be \"adverse\" to his legal interests.  \r\nIn a separate but related objection, the government\r\nclaims that Feghi herself waived the privilege by earlier\r\ntestifying at Yerardi's bail forfeiture hearing.  There, Feghi\r\nanswered certain questions regarding her joint purchase and sale of\r\nproperty with Yerardi, her receipt of money from Yerardi, and her\r\nbank deposits and transfers.  The government concedes that Feghi\r\ndid not at any point expressly waive the privilege, which certainly\r\nshe could do; but it asserts that by answering questions in the\r\nsame general area without asserting the privilege, she has engaged\r\nin conduct tantamount to waiver of the privilege.\r\nThe concept of waiver by conduct exists, but often\r\namounts simply to a determination that the privilege holder's\r\nconduct makes it unfair to allow subsequent assertion of the \r\nprivilege.  See Developments in the Law--Privileged Communications,\r\n98 Harv. L. Rev. 1450, 1629-31 (1985).  Probably the most common\r\nexample is a privilege holder's effort to answer some questions in\r\na subject area (usually those that serve the privilege holder's\r\ninterests) but not others (those that harm the privilege holder's\r\ninterest).  Id. at 1633-35.  Such a pick-and-choose approach may\r\nseem unfair in general or because it distorts the evidence that is\r\npresented to the factfinder.\r\nIn all events, the government's claim that Feghi waived\r\nher privilege by her earlier testimony cannot be resolved, as the\r\ngovernment assumes, simply by asking whether Feghi testified\r\npreviously about certain property or bank transactions relating to\r\nher husband.  The privilege applies only to adverse testimony, and\r\nconceivably some (or all) of the questions answered in the bail\r\nhearing may not have been adverse to Yerardi.  It would require a\r\nfairly detailed comparison of the prior answers given and the more\r\nrecent questions that Feghi refused to answer to determine whether\r\nFeghi's prior answers precluded privilege claims now.  The\r\ngovernment has not provided any such analysis.\r\nIn another set of threshold arguments, the government\r\nsays that as a matter of law the adverse spousal testimony\r\nprivilege should not be invokable in criminal forfeiture\r\nproceedings.  It argues that this proceeding to achieve the\r\nforfeiture is itself \"more civil than criminal,\" affecting only a\r\nproperty interest.  The government adds that the legislative\r\nhistory of the RICO statute, see H.R. Rep. No. 98-1030, at 195\r\n(1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3378, underscores the\r\nneed to make forfeiture proceedings effective against efforts by\r\norganized crime figures to confide assets to family members.\r\nThe privilege is almost always invoked only in criminal\r\nproceedings in which one spouse is called to testify against the\r\nother, and understandably so since criminal jeopardy is the threat\r\nwith which the privilege is concerned.  And some formulations of\r\nthe privilege, and dicta in some of the cases, assume that the\r\nprivilege could never be asserted in a civil case.  Interestingly,\r\nit is hard to find a square holding to this effect, and one can\r\nthink of cases that would test that assumption (say, a government\r\ncivil fraud case where a criminal prosecution might plausibly\r\nfollow).  Cf. Ryan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 568 F.2d\r\n531, 543-44 (7th Cir. 1977) (reserving issue in civil tax\r\nproceeding and finding it inapplicable where immunity granted).\r\nWe need not pursue the issue because, even if the\r\nprivilege can only be asserted \"in\" a criminal proceeding, the\r\nproceeding in which Feghi is here sought to be questioned is\r\nancillary to a criminal case and seeks to recover a penalty under\r\ncriminal forfeiture provisions.  See 18 U.S.C.  982, 1963.  There\r\nare civil forfeiture remedies, see id.  984, 1964, but the\r\ngovernment did not invoke them against Yerardi.  Since this case is\r\nan adjunct to a criminal proceeding and the questioning (as we\r\nshall see) raises an appreciable risk of contributing to future\r\ncriminal prosecution of Yerardi, it is hard to see why we should\r\nstrain to re-label the matter as \"civil.\"\r\nThe government cites us to a few cases in which courts\r\nhave treated criminal forfeitures as \"civil\" for limited purposes,\r\nsee United States v. Lavin, 942 F.2d 177, 181-82 (3d Cir. 1991)\r\n(allowing the longer civil period to appeal from a forfeiture\r\norder), or at least as separable from the main criminal action, see\r\nUnited States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1995) (filing\r\nof appeal from criminal conviction did not prevent later forfeiture\r\norder).  But the issue in each case was different than that posed\r\nhere and, in each case, there was a colorable policy reason for the\r\ndistinction drawn.  No such reason is proffered in this case.\r\nSurely Congress wanted RICO forfeitures to be effective,\r\nbut there is no indication that allowing the privilege to Feghi or\r\nother spouses will compromise this aim.  If Feghi's testimony is\r\nessential to recovering forfeited property, which it may be, the\r\ngovernment (as we shall explain) need only file an affidavit\r\nproviding the same protection normally afforded when testimony is\r\ncompelled from a witness who claims the privilege against self-\r\nincrimination.  As for the legislative history, the government\r\npoints to nothing to suggest that Congress intended to suspend or\r\npare back existing privileges.\r\nThis brings us to the district court's holding that the\r\nthreat Feghi's testimony posed to Yerardi was too speculative to\r\nsupport her assertion of the privilege here.  The district court\r\nadded:  \"Questions that may arise if the government at some time in\r\nthe future attempts to use Ms. Feghi's testimony as a basis for an\r\nattempt to impose further civil or criminal penalties on her\r\nhusband are more properly presented to the court when they have\r\nbecome less speculative than they now are.\"  On appeal, Feghi says\r\nthat her concerns were not too speculative.\r\nThe district court assumed, and we agree, that the\r\nprivilege could not be justified merely because Feghi's testimony\r\nmight help the government recover former or present assets of\r\nYerardi subject to criminal forfeiture.  Yerardi had already\r\ndisclaimed any interest in property, apart from his $5,000 in\r\njewelry.  Further, even if he had not, we are doubtful that the\r\nrationale of the privilege would be offended by making Feghi assist\r\nthe government in locating those of Yerardi's assets subject to\r\nforfeiture if this were the only adverse consequence said to flow\r\nfrom the testimony.\r\nAfter all, as Trammel explained, the main concerns of the\r\nprivilege are the threat to marital harmony and the arguable\r\nunseemliness of requiring one spouse to assist in the criminal\r\nconviction or incarceration of the other spouse.  Feghi could\r\nreadily be called by the plaintiff in a civil damage action to\r\nestablish that Yerardi's negligence had caused a traffic accident\r\nin which the plaintiff was injured, and Feghi could not ordinarily\r\nassert the privilege in such a case even though her testimony might\r\nlead to a large damage award against Yerardi.  See generally\r\nLarkin, supra,  4.02[3], at 4-9.  We see no reason why recovery of\r\nforfeited assets should be treated differently.\r\nHowever, Feghi's purported fear is not confined to\r\nYerardi's loss of property; she also asserted in the district\r\ncourt, and argues forcefully in this court, that various of the\r\nquestions posed by the government could lead to subsequent criminal\r\nprosecution of Yerardi for tax evasion or related crimes.  This is\r\nnot on its face a farfetched concern:  if Yerardi has been\r\nconcealing assets, one might also suppose that he has not been\r\nreporting to the Internal Revenue Service income derived from those\r\nassets and might be subject to tax evasion charges.  26 U.S.C. \r\n7201.  Other offenses based on such concealment can also be\r\nimagined.\r\nThe government says that Feghi is not really concerned\r\nabout such a prosecution, arguing that she did not take up the\r\ngovernment's earlier offer to negotiate some form of immunity.  At\r\noral argument, the government tendered a letter in which it offered\r\nto give Feghi, in exchange for her complete and truthful testimony,\r\na written assurance that it would not use her compelled testimony\r\ndirectly in any future criminal prosecution of her husband.  The\r\nletter explicitly refused to promise Feghi that her testimony would\r\nnot be used indirectly, i.e., to generate other evidence that could\r\nbe used in such a prosecution.\r\nWe think the government's immunity proposal underscores\r\nthe fact that a further criminal prosecution of Yerardi is a\r\nrealistic possibility, and that Feghi's answers could contribute to\r\nthat prosecution.  If this were not so, it is hard to see why the\r\ngovernment's letter would explicitly reserve to it the right to use\r\nFeghi's testimony indirectly, i.e., through \"fruits\" evidence\r\nderived from it, in a future prosecution.  Whatever weight might\r\ngenerally be accorded to the district court's finding, we cannot\r\nagree that the threat of an adverse affect on Yerardi's legal\r\ninterests is so clearly \"speculative\" as to defeat the privilege.\r\nIt is a different question whether protection against\r\nindirect use is required.  We arguably assumed so in In re\r\nSnoonian, 502 F.2d 110 (1st Cir. 1974); there, we held that the\r\nadverse spousal testimony privilege was overcome where the\r\ngovernment filed an affidavit promising that it would not use\r\neither directly or indirectly the compelled grand jury testimony of\r\none spouse in subsequent criminal proceedings against the other\r\nspouse.  See id. at 112-13.  Other courts have adopted the same\r\napproach.  See In re Grand Jury, 111 F.3d 1083 (3d Cir. 1997); In\r\nre Grand Jury Subpoena (Ford v. United States), 756 F.2d 249 (2d\r\nCir. 1985).  We think it is fair to insist upon such an affidavit\r\nin the present case.\r\nThe government says that, without the reservation\r\npermitting indirect use, a burden would rest upon it to show--in\r\nany future prosecution of Yerardi--that other evidence it might\r\noffer against him apart from Feghi's direct testimony was not\r\nderived from that testimony.  However, this is a burden that the\r\nprosecution customarily carries, whenever it compels privileged\r\ntestimony through a grant of use immunity, by showing that it has\r\nan independent source for the \"other evidence.\"  See, e.g., United\r\nStates v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989).  Only in peculiar\r\ncircumstances has it proved to be an insuperable burden.  See\r\nUnited States v. North, 920 F.2d 940 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  It is worth\r\nadding that the government controls the scope of its questioning,\r\nwhich can be tailored to limit the tainting of future evidence.\r\nThus far, we have treated the questions that the\r\ngovernment seeks to compel Feghi to answer as if they were all of\r\na piece.  Customarily, issues of privilege are resolved on a\r\nquestion-by-question basis, as the privilege may be justified as to\r\nsome questions but not as to others.  In re Lochiatto, 497 F.2d\r\n803, 805 n.3 (1st Cir. 1974).  However, the government has not\r\nargued that all of its questions are benign, and most addressed to\r\nthe concealment of assets are not likely to be.  Thus, we cannot\r\navoid the issues posed by this appeal.\r\nIf on remand the government provides an unconditional\r\nSnoonian affidavit, that would eliminate the privilege across the\r\nboard for any questions hereafter put to Fehgi.  If instead the\r\ngovernment declines to provide an affidavit, it remains free to re-\r\nnotice Feghi's deposition and insist on her assertion of the\r\nprivilege on a question-by-question basis.  However, this assumes\r\nthat the government has questions to ask Feghi, the answers to\r\nwhich could not plausibly threaten the legal interests of Yerardi\r\nin a future criminal prosecution relating to any concealed assets.\r\nWhether the government has such questions is unclear.\r\nSome formulations of the adverse spousal testimony\r\nprivilege state or imply not only that the proceedings in which the\r\ntestimony is compelled must be criminal, but that the adverse\r\neffects on the other spouse must be felt in the same proceeding. \r\nSee 8 Wigmore, supra,  2234, at 231.  Here, the proceeding is\r\ncriminal, Yerardi is a party, but the only likely adverse effect--\r\napart from the irrelevant loss of property--is future prosecution\r\nof Yerardi for tax evasion or like crimes in another case.  Since\r\nthe effect is to be felt in a different proceeding, the government\r\ncontends that for this reason as well the spousal privilege should\r\nnot be allowed.\r\nCertainly, the line could be drawn in this fashion.  Yet,\r\nSnoonian itself holds that a spouse can assert the privilege in a\r\ngrand jury proceeding to which no private person is \"a party\" even\r\nthough the adverse effect on the other spouse would occur in what\r\nis formally a different proceeding, namely, the later prosecution\r\nof that spouse.  See In re Snoonian, 502 F.2d at 112.  It may be\r\ngeneralization enough to say that the relationship between two\r\nproceedings, which itself bears on the probability of an adverse\r\neffect, is likely to be a matter of degree, and that a case-by-case\r\nresolution will have to do for the present.\r\nHere, we think that the connection between the\r\ngovernment's criminal forfeiture proceeding directed against\r\nYerardi and the possible prosecution of him (e.g., for tax evasion)\r\nrelating to concealment of the same assets is close enough that the\r\nprivilege may fairly be asserted in the forfeiture proceeding to\r\nguard against the use of Feghi's testimony to convict Yerardi\r\nthereafter.  Like most privileges that obstruct evidence, the\r\nprivilege against adverse spousal testimony is construed strictly,\r\nTrammel, 445 U.S. at 50; but Trammel deliberately preserved the\r\nprivilege, and it retains enough force to be respected in the\r\npresent case where, as we have noted, the government can remove it\r\nin a one-sentence affidavit.\r\nFinally, a word should be said about the district court's\r\nstatement, already quoted, that another reason for compelling Feghi\r\nto answer now is that a trial court would retain the power later to\r\nexclude her testimony if offered in a new prosecution of Yerardi. \r\nSee also United States v. George, 444 F.2d 310, 314 (6th Cir. 1971)\r\n(similar suggestion).  The same course (i.e., deferral) could also\r\nbe taken as to \"fruits\" evidence.  The government, which needless\r\nto say prefers an outright rejection of the privilege claim, has\r\nnot stressed this possibility; and it is not clear whether the\r\ndistrict court viewed it as an alternative ground for denying the\r\nprivilege or simply as a pertinent consideration.\r\nSuch a reservation might at first seem a satisfactory way\r\nof resolving hard privilege issues that turn on predicted future\r\nimpact, but it is a solution with some weaknesses.  In general, a\r\nprivilege once established is overcome only where co-extensive\r\nprotection (e.g., immunity) is assured at the time the answer is\r\ncompelled.  Maness v. Meyers, 419 U.S. 449, 473 (1975) (White, J.,\r\nconcurring in the result).  Further, the core concerns of the\r\nprivilege with which we deal here--marital harmony and seemliness--\r\nwould not be fully satisfied by compelling potentially adverse\r\ntestimony now and promising merely to consider later exclusion of\r\nit or its fruits in a future trial of the other spouse.  \r\nThe government, as just noted, has not pressed on us the\r\ndistrict court's suggestion that a final ruling on the privilege\r\nissue might be deferred.  While postponement might occasionally\r\nserve the prosecutor's interests, in other cases the prosecutor is\r\nfar better off with a definitive ruling at the outset, thereby\r\navoiding (or at least lessening) the risk of conferring unintended\r\nimmunity.  See generally Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 500\r\n(1967); Ellis v. United States, 416 F.2d 791 (D.C. Cir. 1969). \r\nWhether deferral might ever be a sound solution we leave for\r\nanother occasion.     \r\nAccordingly, we vacate the present order of contempt and\r\nremand the case to the district court so that the government may\r\nfurnish the necessary affidavit, if it is so minded.  If it does\r\nso, then the adverse spousal privilege should be deemed overcome\r\nand further delay on this ground by Feghi need not be tolerated. \r\nFailing that, the government is still entitled to depose Feghi, but\r\nshe is entitled to invoke the adverse spousal testimony privilege\r\non a question-by-question basis and subject to district court\r\nscrutiny under standards set forth above.\r\nIt is so ordered.  \n",

The appellant, Rafia Feghi, is married to Joseph A. Yerardi, Jr. In October 1993, Joseph Yerardi was indicted in the district court on 71 counts, including money laundering, extortion, witness intimidation, operating an illegal gambling business, racketeering and criminal forfeiture. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 892, 894, 982, 1503, 1512, 1955-56, 1962-63. In due course, the forfeiture counts resulted in ancillary proceedings that are the focus of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yerardi was released on bail in July 1994, and Feghi signed a $1.5 million appearance bond to secure his presence. When Yerardi was later charged with violating conditions of his release, the government sought forfeiture of the bond. Feghi testified at the forfeiture proceeding in February 1995, invoking certain testimonial privileges but (says the government) not invoking the adverse spousal testimony privilege. The government now relies on this failure as precluding later assertion of the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 1995, Yerardi entered into a written plea agreement with the government. Pursuant to that agreement, Yerardi pled guilty to all counts of the indictment and, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 982, 1963, agreed to forfeit $916,000. He also consented to the entry of an asset discovery order, including the deposition of witnesses and the production of documents and related materials deemed necessary by the U.S. Attorney to implement the forfeiture agreement. At sentencing, however, Yerardi's counsel maintained Yerardi's earlier position that his only asset was $5,000 worth of jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government believes that Feghi now controls or knows of assets that once belonged to Yerardi but have since been forfeited to the United States, and that Feghi would not qualify as a bona fide purchaser for value. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(l)(6)(B); 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(n)(6)(B). Further, the government wants to locate other Yerardi assets, which Feghi may control or know of, that could be available to the government to make up the value of any directly forfeited assets that can no longer be found. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(m); 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p). Apparently, the government sought Feghi's informal cooperation but was rebuffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the government served a subpoena duces tecum on Feghi in October 1995, later enforced in part by the district court, and it deposed Feghi on March 22, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Ultimately, in response to the enforced document requests, Feghi took the position that she had no such documents, and she declined in deposition to answer further questions about the requests, as well as direct questions on a number of different issues concerning Yerardi's assets, transfers of money between Yerardi and Feghi, actions taken by Feghi pursuant to the power of attorney that Yerardi had given to her, and similar matters. The basis for these refusals was Feghi's assertion of the adverse spousal testimony privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1996, the government moved to compel Feghi to answer its questions. The magistrate judge allowed the government's motion to compel on September 26, 1996, primarily on the ground that the prospect of future criminal prosecution of Yerardi (e.g., for tax evasion) was too speculative to support the privilege, and also on the ground that Yerardi had disclaimed any interest in the assets held by Feghi. The district court affirmed the magistrate judge's order on May 5, 1997, when it rejected Feghi's motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feghi continued to refuse to testify and invited the district court to hold her in contempt so that she could test its privilege ruling on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> After a hearing on December 21, 1998, the district court held Feghi in contempt for refusing to answer, and it imposed prospectively civil penalties on Feghi, rising after two weeks to $1,000 per day, to compel obedience. Thereafter, on April 30, 1999, this court stayed the district court's contempt order pending Feghi's appeal. Although we thought it a close question whether Feghi was likely to prevail, accumulating fines (unless stayed) appeared likely to force Feghi to answer immediately and thereby deprive her of an effective appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although contempt rulings are sometimes said to be reviewable for \"abuse of discretion,\" the standard depends upon the precise issue or issues presented: abstract issues of law are reviewed de novo and determinations of raw fact are tested under the clearly erroneous standard. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v. PepsiCo, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 61 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998). Whether a future criminal prosecution of Yerardi based on Feghi's testimony is \"speculative\" is the kind of \"mixed\" question on which the district court's assessment is often, although not always, given weight. See In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal criminal cases, issues of privilege are resolved by judge-made rules based on common law principles, except where the Constitution or other federal enactments resolve the issue. Fed. R. Evid. 501. As revamped by the Supreme Court in Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), the privilege against adverse spousal testimony gives the witness-spouse a privilege not to testify against the defendant-spouse in criminal or related proceedings, subject to certain exceptions and to waiver. See Larkin, Federal Practice: Federal Testimonial Privileges &#167; 4.02 (1999). The privilege is a companion to, but distinct from, the privilege protecting confidential communications between husband and wife. See id. &#167; 4.03.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the government urges that the privilege has been waived because Yerardi in his plea agreement consented both to the forfeiture and to full discovery by the government of all information needed to implement the forfeiture. The plea agreement might be read as an implicit waiver of the privilege by Yerardi. However, the Supreme Court made clear in Trammel that the privilege against adverse spousal testimony belongs not to the defendant-spouse, here Yerardi, but rather to the witness-spouse, here Feghi. See Trammel, 445 U.S. at 53. Yerardi as the defendant-spouse thus had no privilege to waive and, far more importantly, he had no authority to waive Feghi's privilege to refuse to testify adversely to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the privilege is rooted in a dual desire to protect marital harmony and to avoid the unseemliness of compelling one spouse to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding, id. at 44-45, 52-53 &amp; n.12, the privilege is limited to testimony that is adverse to the legal interests of the defendant-spouse, 8 Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2234, at 231 (McNaughton rev. 1961). Pointing again to Yerardi's plea agreement, the government contends that testimony cannot be adverse where the defendant-spouse has consented to it. It is hard to see how a future criminal prosecution of Yerardi--the extent of the threat is discussed below --would not be \"adverse\" to his legal interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate but related objection, the government claims that Feghi herself waived the privilege by earlier testifying at Yerardi's bail forfeiture hearing. There, Feghi answered certain questions regarding her joint purchase and sale of property with Yerardi, her receipt of money from Yerardi, and her bank deposits and transfers. The government concedes that Feghi did not at any point expressly waive the privilege, which certainly she could do; but it asserts that by answering questions in the same general area without asserting the privilege, she has engaged in conduct tantamount to waiver of the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concept of waiver by conduct exists, but often amounts simply to a determination that the privilege holder's conduct makes it unfair to allow subsequent assertion of the privilege. See Developments in the Law--Privileged Communications, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1450, 1629-31 (1985). Probably the most common example is a privilege holder's effort to answer some questions in a subject area (usually those that serve the privilege holder's interests) but not others (those that harm the privilege holder's interest). Id. at 1633-35. Such a pick-and-choose approach may seem unfair in general or because it distorts the evidence that is presented to the factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the government's claim that Feghi waived her privilege by her earlier testimony cannot be resolved, as the government assumes, simply by asking whether Feghi testified previously about certain property or bank transactions relating to her husband. The privilege applies only to adverse testimony, and conceivably some (or all) of the questions answered in the bail hearing may not have been adverse to Yerardi. It would require a fairly detailed comparison of the prior answers given and the more recent questions that Feghi refused to answer to determine whether Feghi's prior answers precluded privilege claims now. The government has not provided any such analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In another set of threshold arguments, the government says that as a matter of law the adverse spousal testimony privilege should not be invokable in criminal forfeiture proceedings. It argues that this proceeding to achieve the forfeiture is itself \"more civil than criminal,\" affecting only a property interest. The government adds that the legislative history of the RICO statute, see H.R. Rep. No. 98-1030, at 195 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3378, underscores the need to make forfeiture proceedings effective against efforts by organized crime figures to confide assets to family members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The privilege is almost always invoked only in criminal proceedings in which one spouse is called to testify against the other, and understandably so since criminal jeopardy is the threat with which the privilege is concerned. And some formulations of the privilege, and dicta in some of the cases, assume that the privilege could never be asserted in a civil case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Interestingly, it is hard to find a square holding to this effect, and one can think of cases that would test that assumption (say, a government civil fraud case where a criminal prosecution might plausibly follow). Cf. Ryan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 568 F.2d 531, 543-44 (7th Cir. 1977) (reserving issue in civil tax proceeding and finding it inapplicable where immunity granted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue the issue because, even if the privilege can only be asserted \"in\" a criminal proceeding, the proceeding in which Feghi is here sought to be questioned is ancillary to a criminal case and seeks to recover a penalty under criminal forfeiture provisions. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 982, 1963. There are civil forfeiture remedies, see id. &#167;&#167; 984, 1964, but the government did not invoke them against Yerardi. Since this case is an adjunct to a criminal proceeding and the questioning (as we shall see) raises an appreciable risk of contributing to future criminal prosecution of Yerardi, it is hard to see why we should strain to re-label the matter as \"civil.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites us to a few cases in which courts have treated criminal forfeitures as \"civil\" for limited purposes, see United States v. Lavin, 942 F.2d 177, 181-82 (3d Cir. 1991) (allowing the longer civil period to appeal from a forfeiture order), or at least as separable from the main criminal action, see United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1995) (filing of appeal from criminal conviction did not prevent later forfeiture order). But the issue in each case was different than that posed here and, in each case, there was a colorable policy reason for the distinction drawn. No such reason is proffered in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surely Congress wanted RICO forfeitures to be effective, but there is no indication that allowing the privilege to Feghi or other spouses will compromise this aim. If Feghi's testimony is essential to recovering forfeited property, which it may be, the government (as we shall explain) need only file an affidavit providing the same protection normally afforded when testimony is compelled from a witness who claims the privilege against self-incrimination. As for the legislative history, the government points to nothing to suggest that Congress intended to suspend or pare back existing privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the district court's holding that the threat Feghi's testimony posed to Yerardi was too speculative to support her assertion of the privilege here. The district court added: \"Questions that may arise if the government at some time in the future attempts to use Ms. Feghi's testimony as a basis for an attempt to impose further civil or criminal penalties on her husband are more properly presented to the court when they have become less speculative than they now are.\" On appeal, Feghi says that her concerns were not too speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court assumed, and we agree, that the privilege could not be justified merely because Feghi's testimony might help the government recover former or present assets of Yerardi subject to criminal forfeiture. Yerardi had already disclaimed any interest in property, apart from his $5,000 in jewelry. Further, even if he had not, we are doubtful that the rationale of the privilege would be offended by making Feghi assist the government in locating those of Yerardi's assets subject to forfeiture if this were the only adverse consequence said to flow from the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After all, as Trammel explained, the main concerns of the privilege are the threat to marital harmony and the arguable unseemliness of requiring one spouse to assist in the criminal conviction or incarceration of the other spouse. Feghi could readily be called by the plaintiff in a civil damage action to establish that Yerardi's negligence had caused a traffic accident in which the plaintiff was injured, and Feghi could not ordinarily assert the privilege in such a case even though her testimony might lead to a large damage award against Yerardi. See generally Larkin, supra, &#167; 4.02[3], at 4-9.  We see no reason why recovery of forfeited assets should be treated differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Feghi's purported fear is not confined to Yerardi's loss of property; she also asserted in the district court, and argues forcefully in this court, that various of the questions posed by the government could lead to subsequent criminal prosecution of Yerardi for tax evasion or related crimes. This is not on its face a farfetched concern: if Yerardi has been concealing assets, one might also suppose that he has not been reporting to the Internal Revenue Service income derived from those assets and might be subject to tax evasion charges. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201. Other offenses based on such concealment can also be imagined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that Feghi is not really concerned about such a prosecution, arguing that she did not take up the government's earlier offer to negotiate some form of immunity. At oral argument, the government tendered a letter in which it offered to give Feghi, in exchange for her complete and truthful testimony, a written assurance that it would not use her compelled testimony directly in any future criminal prosecution of her husband. The letter explicitly refused to promise Feghi that her testimony would not be used indirectly, i.e., to generate other evidence that could be used in such a prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the government's immunity proposal underscores the fact that a further criminal prosecution of Yerardi is a realistic possibility, and that Feghi's answers could contribute to that prosecution. If this were not so, it is hard to see why the government's letter would explicitly reserve to it the right to use Feghi's testimony indirectly, i.e., through \"fruits\" evidence derived from it, in a future prosecution. Whatever weight might generally be accorded to the district court's finding, we cannot agree that the threat of an adverse affect on Yerardi's legal interests is so clearly \"speculative\" as to defeat the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a different question whether protection against indirect use is required. We arguably assumed so in In re Snoonian, 502 F.2d 110 (1st Cir. 1974); there, we held that the adverse spousal testimony privilege was overcome where the government filed an affidavit promising that it would not use either directly or indirectly the compelled grand jury testimony of one spouse in subsequent criminal proceedings against the other spouse. See id. at 112-13. Other courts have adopted the same approach. See In re Grand Jury, 111 F.3d 1083 (3d Cir. 1997); In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Ford v. United States), 756 F.2d 249 (2d Cir. 1985). We think it is fair to insist upon such an affidavit in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that, without the reservation permitting indirect use, a burden would rest upon it to show--in any future prosecution of Yerardi--that other evidence it might offer against him apart from Feghi's direct testimony was not derived from that testimony. However, this is a burden that the prosecution customarily carries, whenever it compels privileged testimony through a grant of use immunity, by showing that it has an independent source for the \"other evidence.\" See, e.g., United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989). Only in peculiar circumstances has it proved to be an insuperable burden. See United States v. North, 920 F.2d 940 (D.C. Cir. 1990). It is worth adding that the government controls the scope of its questioning, which can be tailored to limit the tainting of future evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far, we have treated the questions that the government seeks to compel Feghi to answer as if they were all of a piece. Customarily, issues of privilege are resolved on a question-by-question basis, as the privilege may be justified as to some questions but not as to others. In re Lochiatto, 497 F.2d 803, 805 n.3 (1st Cir. 1974). However, the government has not argued that all of its questions are benign, and most addressed to the concealment of assets are not likely to be. Thus, we cannot avoid the issues posed by this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If on remand the government provides an unconditional Snoonian affidavit, that would eliminate the privilege across the board for any questions hereafter put to Fehgi.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If instead the government declines to provide an affidavit, it remains free to re-notice Feghi's deposition and insist on her assertion of the privilege on a question-by-question basis. However, this assumes that the government has questions to ask Feghi, the answers to which could not plausibly threaten the legal interests of Yerardi in a future criminal prosecution relating to any concealed assets. Whether the government has such questions is unclear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some formulations of the adverse spousal testimony privilege state or imply not only that the proceedings in which the testimony is compelled must be criminal, but that the adverse effects on the other spouse must be felt in the same proceeding. See 8 Wigmore, supra, &#167; 2234, at 231. Here, the proceeding is criminal, Yerardi is a party, but the only likely adverse effect--apart from the irrelevant loss of property--is future prosecution of Yerardi for tax evasion or like crimes in another case. Since the effect is to be felt in a different proceeding, the government contends that for this reason as well the spousal privilege should not be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the line could be drawn in this fashion. Yet, Snoonian itself holds that a spouse can assert the privilege in a grand jury proceeding to which no private person is \"a party\" even though the adverse effect on the other spouse would occur in what is formally a different proceeding, namely, the later prosecution of that spouse. See In re Snoonian, 502 F.2d at 112. It may be generalization enough to say that the relationship between two proceedings, which itself bears on the probability of an adverse effect, is likely to be a matter of degree, and that a case-by-case resolution will have to do for the present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we think that the connection between the government's criminal forfeiture proceeding directed against Yerardi and the possible prosecution of him (e.g., for tax evasion) relating to concealment of the same assets is close enough that the privilege may fairly be asserted in the forfeiture proceeding to guard against the use of Feghi's testimony to convict Yerardi thereafter. Like most privileges that obstruct evidence, the privilege against adverse spousal testimony is construed strictly, Trammel, 445 U.S. at 50; but Trammel deliberately preserved the privilege, and it retains enough force to be respected in the present case where, as we have noted, the government can remove it in a one-sentence affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a word should be said about the district court's statement, already quoted, that another reason for compelling Feghi to answer now is that a trial court would retain the power later to exclude her testimony if offered in a new prosecution of Yerardi. See also United States v. George, 444 F.2d 310, 314 (6th Cir. 1971) (similar suggestion). The same course (i.e., deferral) could also be taken as to \"fruits\" evidence. The government, which needless to say prefers an outright rejection of the privilege claim, has not stressed this possibility; and it is not clear whether the district court viewed it as an alternative ground for denying the privilege or simply as a pertinent consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a reservation might at first seem a satisfactory way of resolving hard privilege issues that turn on predicted future impact, but it is a solution with some weaknesses. In general, a privilege once established is overcome only where co-extensive protection (e.g., immunity) is assured at the time the answer is compelled. Maness v. Meyers, 419 U.S. 449, 473 (1975) (White, J., concurring in the result). Further, the core concerns of the privilege with which we deal here--marital harmony and seemliness--would not be fully satisfied by compelling potentially adverse testimony now and promising merely to consider later exclusion of it or its fruits in a future trial of the other spouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, as just noted, has not pressed on us the district court's suggestion that a final ruling on the privilege issue might be deferred. While postponement might occasionally serve the prosecutor's interests, in other cases the prosecutor is far better off with a definitive ruling at the outset, thereby avoiding (or at least lessening) the risk of conferring unintended immunity. See generally Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 500 (1967); Ellis v. United States, 416 F.2d 791 (D.C. Cir. 1969). Whether deferral might ever be a sound solution we leave for another occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the present order of contempt and remand the case to the district court so that the government may furnish the necessary affidavit, if it is so minded. If it does so, then the adverse spousal privilege should be deemed overcome and further delay on this ground by Feghi need not be tolerated. Failing that, the government is still entitled to depose Feghi, but she is entitled to invoke the adverse spousal testimony privilege on a question-by-question basis and subject to district court scrutiny under standards set forth above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The asset discovery proceedings at issue here are authorized by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(k) and 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(m) (as incorporated by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(b)), and are ancillary to the criminal case in which Yerardi pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit $916,000. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 982, 1963.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court's ruling rejecting the claim of privilege was interlocutory, and an interim appeal by Feghi to seek review of the privilege ruling was dismissed by this court.

The appellant, Rafia Feghi, is married to Joseph A. Yerardi, Jr. In October 1993, Joseph Yerardi was indicted in the district court on 71 counts, including money laundering, extortion, witness intimidation, operating an illegal gambling business, racketeering and criminal forfeiture. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 892, 894, 982, 1503, 1512, 1955-56, 1962-63. In due course, the forfeiture counts resulted in ancillary proceedings that are the focus of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yerardi was released on bail in July 1994, and Feghi signed a $1.5 million appearance bond to secure his presence. When Yerardi was later charged with violating conditions of his release, the government sought forfeiture of the bond. Feghi testified at the forfeiture proceeding in February 1995, invoking certain testimonial privileges but (says the government) not invoking the adverse spousal testimony privilege. The government now relies on this failure as precluding later assertion of the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 1995, Yerardi entered into a written plea agreement with the government. Pursuant to that agreement, Yerardi pled guilty to all counts of the indictment and, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 982, 1963, agreed to forfeit $916,000. He also consented to the entry of an asset discovery order, including the deposition of witnesses and the production of documents and related materials deemed necessary by the U.S. Attorney to implement the forfeiture agreement. At sentencing, however, Yerardi's counsel maintained Yerardi's earlier position that his only asset was $5,000 worth of jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government believes that Feghi now controls or knows of assets that once belonged to Yerardi but have since been forfeited to the United States, and that Feghi would not qualify as a bona fide purchaser for value. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(l)(6)(B); 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(n)(6)(B). Further, the government wants to locate other Yerardi assets, which Feghi may control or know of, that could be available to the government to make up the value of any directly forfeited assets that can no longer be found. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(m); 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p). Apparently, the government sought Feghi's informal cooperation but was rebuffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the government served a subpoena duces tecum on Feghi in October 1995, later enforced in part by the district court, and it deposed Feghi on March 22, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Ultimately, in response to the enforced document requests, Feghi took the position that she had no such documents, and she declined in deposition to answer further questions about the requests, as well as direct questions on a number of different issues concerning Yerardi's assets, transfers of money between Yerardi and Feghi, actions taken by Feghi pursuant to the power of attorney that Yerardi had given to her, and similar matters. The basis for these refusals was Feghi's assertion of the adverse spousal testimony privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1996, the government moved to compel Feghi to answer its questions. The magistrate judge allowed the government's motion to compel on September 26, 1996, primarily on the ground that the prospect of future criminal prosecution of Yerardi (e.g., for tax evasion) was too speculative to support the privilege, and also on the ground that Yerardi had disclaimed any interest in the assets held by Feghi. The district court affirmed the magistrate judge's order on May 5, 1997, when it rejected Feghi's motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feghi continued to refuse to testify and invited the district court to hold her in contempt so that she could test its privilege ruling on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> After a hearing on December 21, 1998, the district court held Feghi in contempt for refusing to answer, and it imposed prospectively civil penalties on Feghi, rising after two weeks to $1,000 per day, to compel obedience. Thereafter, on April 30, 1999, this court stayed the district court's contempt order pending Feghi's appeal. Although we thought it a close question whether Feghi was likely to prevail, accumulating fines (unless stayed) appeared likely to force Feghi to answer immediately and thereby deprive her of an effective appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although contempt rulings are sometimes said to be reviewable for \"abuse of discretion,\" the standard depends upon the precise issue or issues presented: abstract issues of law are reviewed de novo and determinations of raw fact are tested under the clearly erroneous standard. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v. PepsiCo, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198206\"><a href=\"/opinion/198206/ocean-spray-v-pepsico-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 61 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998). Whether a future criminal prosecution of Yerardi based on Feghi's testimony is \"speculative\" is the kind of \"mixed\" question on which the district court's assessment is often, although not always, given weight. See In re Extradition of Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal criminal cases, issues of privilege are resolved by judge-made rules based on common law principles, except where the Constitution or other federal enactments resolve the issue. Fed. R. Evid. 501. As revamped by the Supreme Court in Trammel v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span> </a></span>(1980), the privilege against adverse spousal testimony gives the witness-spouse a privilege not to testify against the defendant-spouse in criminal or related proceedings, subject to certain exceptions and to waiver. See Larkin, Federal Practice: Federal Testimonial Privileges &#167; 4.02 (1999). The privilege is a companion to, but distinct from, the privilege protecting confidential communications between husband and wife. See id. &#167; 4.03.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the government urges that the privilege has been waived because Yerardi in his plea agreement consented both to the forfeiture and to full discovery by the government of all information needed to implement the forfeiture. The plea agreement might be read as an implicit waiver of the privilege by Yerardi. However, the Supreme Court made clear in Trammel that the privilege against adverse spousal testimony belongs not to the defendant-spouse, here Yerardi, but rather to the witness-spouse, here Feghi. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Trammel,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>. Yerardi as the defendant-spouse thus had no privilege to waive and, far more importantly, he had no authority to waive Feghi's privilege to refuse to testify adversely to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the privilege is rooted in a dual desire to protect marital harmony and to avoid the unseemliness of compelling one spouse to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 44-45, </a></span>52-53 &amp; n.12, the privilege is limited to testimony that is adverse to the legal interests of the defendant-spouse, 8 Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2234, at 231 (McNaughton rev. 1961). Pointing again to Yerardi's plea agreement, the government contends that testimony cannot be adverse where the defendant-spouse has consented to it. It is hard to see how a future criminal prosecution of Yerardi--the extent of the threat is discussed below --would not be \"adverse\" to his legal interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate but related objection, the government claims that Feghi herself waived the privilege by earlier testifying at Yerardi's bail forfeiture hearing. There, Feghi answered certain questions regarding her joint purchase and sale of property with Yerardi, her receipt of money from Yerardi, and her bank deposits and transfers. The government concedes that Feghi did not at any point expressly waive the privilege, which certainly she could do; but it asserts that by answering questions in the same general area without asserting the privilege, she has engaged in conduct tantamount to waiver of the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concept of waiver by conduct exists, but often amounts simply to a determination that the privilege holder's conduct makes it unfair to allow subsequent assertion of the privilege. See Developments in the Law--Privileged Communications, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1450, 1629-31 (1985). Probably the most common example is a privilege holder's effort to answer some questions in a subject area (usually those that serve the privilege holder's interests) but not others (those that harm the privilege holder's interest). <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1633-35. </span>Such a pick-and-choose approach may seem unfair in general or because it distorts the evidence that is presented to the factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the government's claim that Feghi waived her privilege by her earlier testimony cannot be resolved, as the government assumes, simply by asking whether Feghi testified previously about certain property or bank transactions relating to her husband. The privilege applies only to adverse testimony, and conceivably some (or all) of the questions answered in the bail hearing may not have been adverse to Yerardi. It would require a fairly detailed comparison of the prior answers given and the more recent questions that Feghi refused to answer to determine whether Feghi's prior answers precluded privilege claims now. The government has not provided any such analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In another set of threshold arguments, the government says that as a matter of law the adverse spousal testimony privilege should not be invokable in criminal forfeiture proceedings. It argues that this proceeding to achieve the forfeiture is itself \"more civil than criminal,\" affecting only a property interest. The government adds that the legislative history of the RICO statute, see H.R. Rep. No. 98-1030, at 195 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3378, underscores the need to make forfeiture proceedings effective against efforts by organized crime figures to confide assets to family members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The privilege is almost always invoked only in criminal proceedings in which one spouse is called to testify against the other, and understandably so since criminal jeopardy is the threat with which the privilege is concerned. And some formulations of the privilege, and dicta in some of the cases, assume that the privilege could never be asserted in a civil case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Interestingly, it is hard to find a square holding to this effect, and one can think of cases that would test that assumption (say, a government civil fraud case where a criminal prosecution might plausibly follow). Cf. Ryan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"351971\"><a href=\"/opinion/351971/raymond-j-ryan-and-helen-ryan-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 543-44 (7th Cir. 1977) (reserving issue in civil tax proceeding and finding it inapplicable where immunity granted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue the issue because, even if the privilege can only be asserted \"in\" a criminal proceeding, the proceeding in which Feghi is here sought to be questioned is ancillary to a criminal case and seeks to recover a penalty under criminal forfeiture provisions. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 982, 1963. There are civil forfeiture remedies, see id. &#167;&#167; 984, 1964, but the government did not invoke them against Yerardi. Since this case is an adjunct to a criminal proceeding and the questioning (as we shall see) raises an appreciable risk of contributing to future criminal prosecution of Yerardi, it is hard to see why we should strain to re-label the matter as \"civil.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites us to a few cases in which courts have treated criminal forfeitures as \"civil\" for limited purposes, see United States v. Lavin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566819\"><a href=\"/opinion/566819/united-states-v-lawrence-w-lavin-wmot-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, 181-82 (3d Cir. 1991) (allowing the longer civil period to appeal from a forfeiture order), or at least as separable from the main criminal action, see United States v. Hurley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702294\"><a href=\"/opinion/702294/united-states-v-vincent-hurley-united-states-of-america-v-carlo-demarco/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1995) (filing of appeal from criminal conviction did not prevent later forfeiture order). But the issue in each case was different than that posed here and, in each case, there was a colorable policy reason for the distinction drawn. No such reason is proffered in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surely Congress wanted RICO forfeitures to be effective, but there is no indication that allowing the privilege to Feghi or other spouses will compromise this aim. If Feghi's testimony is essential to recovering forfeited property, which it may be, the government (as we shall explain) need only file an affidavit providing the same protection normally afforded when testimony is compelled from a witness who claims the privilege against self-incrimination. As for the legislative history, the government points to nothing to suggest that Congress intended to suspend or pare back existing privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the district court's holding that the threat Feghi's testimony posed to Yerardi was too speculative to support her assertion of the privilege here. The district court added: \"Questions that may arise if the government at some time in the future attempts to use Ms. Feghi's testimony as a basis for an attempt to impose further civil or criminal penalties on her husband are more properly presented to the court when they have become less speculative than they now are.\" On appeal, Feghi says that her concerns were not too speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court assumed, and we agree, that the privilege could not be justified merely because Feghi's testimony might help the government recover former or present assets of Yerardi subject to criminal forfeiture. Yerardi had already disclaimed any interest in property, apart from his $5,000 in jewelry. Further, even if he had not, we are doubtful that the rationale of the privilege would be offended by making Feghi assist the government in locating those of Yerardi's assets subject to forfeiture if this were the only adverse consequence said to flow from the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After all, as Trammel explained, the main concerns of the privilege are the threat to marital harmony and the arguable unseemliness of requiring one spouse to assist in the criminal conviction or incarceration of the other spouse. Feghi could readily be called by the plaintiff in a civil damage action to establish that Yerardi's negligence had caused a traffic accident in which the plaintiff was injured, and Feghi could not ordinarily assert the privilege in such a case even though her testimony might lead to a large damage award against Yerardi. See generally Larkin, supra, &#167; 4.02[3], at 4-9.  We see no reason why recovery of forfeited assets should be treated differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Feghi's purported fear is not confined to Yerardi's loss of property; she also asserted in the district court, and argues forcefully in this court, that various of the questions posed by the government could lead to subsequent criminal prosecution of Yerardi for tax evasion or related crimes. This is not on its face a farfetched concern: if Yerardi has been concealing assets, one might also suppose that he has not been reporting to the Internal Revenue Service income derived from those assets and might be subject to tax evasion charges. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201. Other offenses based on such concealment can also be imagined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that Feghi is not really concerned about such a prosecution, arguing that she did not take up the government's earlier offer to negotiate some form of immunity. At oral argument, the government tendered a letter in which it offered to give Feghi, in exchange for her complete and truthful testimony, a written assurance that it would not use her compelled testimony directly in any future criminal prosecution of her husband. The letter explicitly refused to promise Feghi that her testimony would not be used indirectly, i.e., to generate other evidence that could be used in such a prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the government's immunity proposal underscores the fact that a further criminal prosecution of Yerardi is a realistic possibility, and that Feghi's answers could contribute to that prosecution. If this were not so, it is hard to see why the government's letter would explicitly reserve to it the right to use Feghi's testimony indirectly, i.e., through \"fruits\" evidence derived from it, in a future prosecution. Whatever weight might generally be accorded to the district court's finding, we cannot agree that the threat of an adverse affect on Yerardi's legal interests is so clearly \"speculative\" as to defeat the privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a different question whether protection against indirect use is required. We arguably assumed so in In re Snoonian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321204\"><a href=\"/opinion/321204/in-re-gary-snoonian/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1974); there, we held that the adverse spousal testimony privilege was overcome where the government filed an affidavit promising that it would not use either directly or indirectly the compelled grand jury testimony of one spouse in subsequent criminal proceedings against the other spouse. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321204\"><a href=\"/opinion/321204/in-re-gary-snoonian/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 112-13. </a></span>Other courts have adopted the same approach. See In re Grand Jury, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739911\"><a href=\"/opinion/739911/in-re-grand-jury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span> </a></span>(3d Cir. 1997); In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Ford v. United States), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449004\"><a href=\"/opinion/449004/in-the-matter-of-the-grand-jury-subpoena-of-jean-ford-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span> </a></span>(2d Cir. 1985). We think it is fair to insist upon such an affidavit in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that, without the reservation permitting indirect use, a burden would rest upon it to show--in any future prosecution of Yerardi--that other evidence it might offer against him apart from Feghi's direct testimony was not derived from that testimony. However, this is a burden that the prosecution customarily carries, whenever it compels privileged testimony through a grant of use immunity, by showing that it has an independent source for the \"other evidence.\" See, e.g., United States v. Serrano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519968\"><a href=\"/opinion/519968/united-states-v-miguel-a-serrano-dba-ponce-developers-inc-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1989). Only in peculiar circumstances has it proved to be an insuperable burden. See United States v. North, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552750\"><a href=\"/opinion/552750/united-states-v-oliver-l-north/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span> </a></span>(D.C. Cir. 1990). It is worth adding that the government controls the scope of its questioning, which can be tailored to limit the tainting of future evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far, we have treated the questions that the government seeks to compel Feghi to answer as if they were all of a piece. Customarily, issues of privilege are resolved on a question-by-question basis, as the privilege may be justified as to some questions but not as to others. In re Lochiatto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"319512\"><a href=\"/opinion/319512/in-re-barbara-lochiatto-in-re-patrick-lochiatto-in-re-john-e-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 805 n.3 (1st Cir. 1974). However, the government has not argued that all of its questions are benign, and most addressed to the concealment of assets are not likely to be. Thus, we cannot avoid the issues posed by this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If on remand the government provides an unconditional Snoonian affidavit, that would eliminate the privilege across the board for any questions hereafter put to Fehgi.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If instead the government declines to provide an affidavit, it remains free to re-notice Feghi's deposition and insist on her assertion of the privilege on a question-by-question basis. However, this assumes that the government has questions to ask Feghi, the answers to which could not plausibly threaten the legal interests of Yerardi in a future criminal prosecution relating to any concealed assets. Whether the government has such questions is unclear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some formulations of the adverse spousal testimony privilege state or imply not only that the proceedings in which the testimony is compelled must be criminal, but that the adverse effects on the other spouse must be felt in the same proceeding. See 8 Wigmore, supra, &#167; 2234, at 231. Here, the proceeding is criminal, Yerardi is a party, but the only likely adverse effect--apart from the irrelevant loss of property--is future prosecution of Yerardi for tax evasion or like crimes in another case. Since the effect is to be felt in a different proceeding, the government contends that for this reason as well the spousal privilege should not be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the line could be drawn in this fashion. Yet, Snoonian itself holds that a spouse can assert the privilege in a grand jury proceeding to which no private person is \"a party\" even though the adverse effect on the other spouse would occur in what is formally a different proceeding, namely, the later prosecution of that spouse. See In re <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321204\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Snoonian,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/321204/in-re-gary-snoonian/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>. It may be generalization enough to say that the relationship between two proceedings, which itself bears on the probability of an adverse effect, is likely to be a matter of degree, and that a case-by-case resolution will have to do for the present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we think that the connection between the government's criminal forfeiture proceeding directed against Yerardi and the possible prosecution of him (e.g., for tax evasion) relating to concealment of the same assets is close enough that the privilege may fairly be asserted in the forfeiture proceeding to guard against the use of Feghi's testimony to convict Yerardi thereafter. Like most privileges that obstruct evidence, the privilege against adverse spousal testimony is construed strictly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Trammel,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>; but Trammel deliberately preserved the privilege, and it retains enough force to be respected in the present case where, as we have noted, the government can remove it in a one-sentence affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a word should be said about the district court's statement, already quoted, that another reason for compelling Feghi to answer now is that a trial court would retain the power later to exclude her testimony if offered in a new prosecution of Yerardi. See also United States v. George, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297412\"><a href=\"/opinion/297412/united-states-v-thomas-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span>, 314 (6th Cir. 1971) (similar suggestion). The same course (i.e., deferral) could also be taken as to \"fruits\" evidence. The government, which needless to say prefers an outright rejection of the privilege claim, has not stressed this possibility; and it is not clear whether the district court viewed it as an alternative ground for denying the privilege or simply as a pertinent consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a reservation might at first seem a satisfactory way of resolving hard privilege issues that turn on predicted future impact, but it is a solution with some weaknesses. In general, a privilege once established is overcome only where co-extensive protection (e.g., immunity) is assured at the time the answer is compelled. Maness v. Meyers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109130\"><a href=\"/opinion/109130/maness-v-meyers/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 473 (1975) (White, J., concurring in the result). Further, the core concerns of the privilege with which we deal here--marital harmony and seemliness--would not be fully satisfied by compelling potentially adverse testimony now and promising merely to consider later exclusion of it or its fruits in a future trial of the other spouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, as just noted, has not pressed on us the district court's suggestion that a final ruling on the privilege issue might be deferred. While postponement might occasionally serve the prosecutor's interests, in other cases the prosecutor is far better off with a definitive ruling at the outset, thereby avoiding (or at least lessening) the risk of conferring unintended immunity. See generally Garrity v. New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107336\"><a href=\"/opinion/107336/garrity-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>, 500 (1967); Ellis v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286703\"><a href=\"/opinion/286703/james-h-ellis-jr-v-united-states-of-america-alfred-m-watkins-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span> </a></span>(D.C. Cir. 1969). Whether deferral might ever be a sound solution we leave for another occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the present order of contempt and remand the case to the district court so that the government may furnish the necessary affidavit, if it is so minded. If it does so, then the adverse spousal privilege should be deemed overcome and further delay on this ground by Feghi need not be tolerated. Failing that, the government is still entitled to depose Feghi, but she is entitled to invoke the adverse spousal testimony privilege on a question-by-question basis and subject to district court scrutiny under standards set forth above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The asset discovery proceedings at issue here are authorized by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(k) and 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(m) (as incorporated by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(b)), and are ancillary to the criminal case in which Yerardi pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit $916,000. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 982, 1963.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court's ruling rejecting the claim of privilege was interlocutory, and an interim appeal by Feghi to seek review of the privilege ruling was dismissed by this court.
