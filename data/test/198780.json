This appeal is a sequel to prior\r\nlitigation growing out of the same district court proceeding. \r\nOnce again, the issues relate to interim matters; the merits have\r\nnot yet been decided in the district court.  To avoid repetition,\r\nfamiliarity with our prior decisions is assumed; and we confine\r\nourselves to a bare-bones summary limited to events necessary for\r\nthis appeal.\r\nIn 1997, acting under recently enacted state legislation,\r\nthe New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (\"the Commission\")\r\nissued a plan and implementing orders to restructure electric power\r\nregulation in the state.  The new regime, aimed at promoting\r\ncompetition through various means including market-based rates,\r\ncreated a risk that existing utilities might not be able to recover\r\ntheir full investment in previously built facilities.  The largest\r\nutility in the state, Public Service Company of New Hampshire\r\n(\"PSNH\"), obtained a preliminary injunction in the district court\r\nbased, inter alia, on a colorable claim that the state's action\r\nviolated a specific agreement with that company and so also\r\nviolated bankruptcy court orders and the Contract Clause of the\r\nU.S. Constitution.  See Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 21, 26, 28.\r\nIn our principal decision issued in 1998--Patch IV--we\r\nupheld this preliminary injunction and, with somewhat greater\r\nreluctance, its extension by the district court to other New\r\nHampshire utilities that had intervened, including Connecticut\r\nValley Electric Company (\"Connecticut Valley\").  Id. at 27-29. \r\nHowever, in the same proceeding, the district court had also\r\nordered the Commission to allow a specific rate increase sought by\r\nConnecticut Valley to recover increased power costs which the\r\nCommission had previously disallowed in December 1997, see Patch V,\r\n167 F.3d at 32-33; in our companion decision--Patch V--we vacated\r\nthe district court's injunction in this respect, holding that\r\nConnecticut Valley had not shown a likelihood of prevailing in\r\nfederal court on this aspect of the case.  Id. at 36.\r\nFollowing our decisions, the Commission and PSNH engaged\r\nin negotiations and have been moving toward a possible settlement\r\nof their differences.  While proceedings in the district court as\r\nto a permanent injunction for PSNH have been deferred pending\r\napproval of the settlement, litigation between the Commission and\r\nConnecticut Valley has moved forward; several months ago both sides\r\nargued cross-motions for summary judgment on the merits of\r\npermanent relief.  During this same period, two new and quite\r\ndistinct disputes have arisen--one relating to the preliminary\r\ninjunction upheld in Patch IV and the other to the further interim\r\nrelief that we disallowed in Patch V.\r\nThe first of these two disputes stems from a new motion\r\nfiled by the Commission after Patch IV asking the district court to\r\nvacate its earlier injunction barring the New Hampshire\r\nrestructuring plan.  That injunction had rested primarily, as\r\npreliminary injunctions normally do, see Ross-Simons of Warwick,\r\nInc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996), on a\r\nshowing of likelihood of success on the merits coupled with a\r\nshowing of threatened irreparable injury.  The irreparable injury\r\nshowing, initially made by PSNH, rested in part on an accounting\r\nconvention regarding the financial treatment of so-called\r\nregulatory assets; according to PSNH's affidavits, the proposed New\r\nHampshire restructuring plan would have triggered changes in the\r\ncompany's financial statements, placing it in immediate default on\r\nhuge bank loans.\r\nOur decision in Patch IV affirming the preliminary\r\ninjunction against the restructuring plan was rendered on December\r\n3, 1998.  On January 18, 1999, the Commission moved to vacate the\r\ninjunction, primarily on the ground that changes in accounting\r\ntreatment by the Financial Account Standards Board had eliminated\r\nthe threat relied upon by PSNH in its original showing of\r\nirreparable injury.  Connecticut Valley vigorously opposed the\r\nmotion.  The district court's decision on this motion is the first\r\nissue on this appeal.\r\nThe second dispute arises in the wake of our decision in\r\nPatch V vacating a different aspect of the district court's\r\npendente lite relief.  As noted above and explained in detail in\r\nPatch V, even before its restructuring plan was scheduled to be\r\nimplemented, the Commission had disallowed an attempt by\r\nConnecticut Valley in December 1997 to implement a specific rate\r\nincrease designed to pass along to its customers a routine increase\r\nin the cost of power it purchases from its parent and wholesale\r\nsupplier, Central Vermont Public Service Company (\"Central\r\nVermont\").  The Commission took the view that while the increase in\r\nConnecticut Valley's costs was real, purchasing from Central\r\nVermont was no longer prudent because power could currently be\r\nbought for less on the open market.  167 F.3d at 32.  Connecticut\r\nValley had a long-term requirements contract with Central Vermont,\r\nbut the Commission deemed it to be terminable on short notice.\r\nWithout sharply distinguishing between this specific\r\ndisallowance by the Commission and its far-reaching restructuring\r\nplan, the district court in April 1998 directed the Commission to\r\nallow the increase.  It was this further preliminary relief that we\r\nfound not to be justified because (in our view) Connecticut Valley\r\nhad failed to show that it was likely to prevail on the merits in\r\nits ultimate challenge to this disallowance in federal court.  Our\r\nPatch V decision vacated this aspect of the district court's\r\npreliminary injunction, thereby permitting the Commission to roll\r\nback Connecticut Valley's retail rates to the pre-1998 level, see\r\n167 F.3d at 36.\r\nThe Commission not only rolled back the rate increase but\r\nalso ordered further temporary reductions by Connecticut Valley,\r\nbelow the level prevailing in December 1997, in order to flow back\r\nto customers the amount of the increases that had been collected\r\nbetween the time of the district court's injunction with respect to\r\nthe disallowance and the later vacation of that injunction in Patch\r\nV.  Connecticut Valley then asked the district court to enjoin the\r\nCommission from requiring this further reduction until the district\r\ncourt decided the merits of Connecticut Valley's request for a\r\npermanent injunction requiring the Commission to allow the company\r\nto charge rates sufficient to cover all of its costs.  The\r\nCommission opposed the request.\r\nOn April 7, 1999, after a hearing, the district court\r\nentered an order refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction\r\nupheld in Patch IV and granting in substance the additional relief\r\nsought by Connecticut Valley to defer any flow-back of the increase\r\nthat the company had collected before this court vacated the\r\ndistrict court's April 1998 injunction in that respect in Patch V. \r\nThe district court did not discuss at length its reasons for the\r\nfirst of these actions; but it wrote several paragraphs of findings\r\nand explanations with respect to the second.  The Commission now\r\nappeals, challenging both aspects of the district court's order.\r\nOn this appeal, little need be said about the district\r\ncourt's refusal to modify the preliminary injunction enjoining the \r\nthe Commission's restructuring plan.  PSNH's original showing of\r\nirreparable injury did depend in part on the issue of the then-\r\ncurrent accounting treatment of so-called regulatory assets; but\r\nthe threatened accounting treatment merely accelerated and made\r\nmore dramatic the adverse consequences of the plan for PSNH.  It\r\nwas credibly alleged, at least sufficiently for preliminary relief,\r\nthat the restructuring plan, as framed at the time, would prevent\r\nPSNH from ever recovering very substantial prior investments\r\nassertedly protected by a specific contract with the state and by\r\nimplementing orders of the bankruptcy court.\r\nWhen in early 1998 Connecticut Valley joined PSNH in\r\nseeking interim relief, it provided arguments and affidavits of its\r\nown to demonstrate the harm that the restructuring plan would do to\r\nit.  Once again, the projected accounting treatment of regulatory\r\nassets was one of several strands in the showing of harm to\r\nConnecticut Valley.  But, as is shown by even a brief review of the\r\ncompany's motion papers, it was certainly not the only one--nor was\r\nthe greatest dollar impact on the company attributed to this\r\naccounting requirement.\r\nAs we pointed out in Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 23, 28, the\r\nCommission made little effort to challenge the showing of\r\nirreparable injury by either PSNH or Connecticut Valley.  Only the\r\nmost significant change in circumstances would require the district\r\ncourt to revisit that issue.  Yet the change in accounting\r\ntreatment now trumpeted by the Commission was apparently made in\r\nJuly 1997, over a year before our decision in Patch IV upholding\r\nthe same injunction.  If the Commission thought that this\r\nadjustment changed everything, it certainly should have stressed\r\nthis in its original appeal in Patch IV, or asked for a remand to\r\nconsider the effect of the change.  In any event, the district\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify the\r\npreliminary injunction based on the accounting change.\r\nThe district court's new prohibition of the Commission's\r\nfurther reduction in Connecticut Valley's rates is an entirely\r\ndifferent matter.  In part, the company's defense of this new\r\nrelief rests on a narrow ground, namely, on case law that the\r\ncompany argues allows a court to defer claims of restitution\r\nstemming from a vacated preliminary injunction until the merits\r\nhave been decided.  However, Connecticut Valley's defense also\r\ninvolves a view of our prior decisions in Patch IV and V that is\r\nnot consistent with those decisions and may have implications for\r\nany further interim disputes and possibly for the merits of this\r\ncase.  For this reason, we revisit briefly the scope and rationale\r\nof our earlier decisions.\r\nOrdinarily, a district judge has a great deal of freedom\r\nto impose interim relief and, in particular, to preserve the status\r\nquo in all matters properly before it.  But efforts by utilities to\r\nenjoin state rate orders are not ordinary cases and relief--interim\r\nor permanent--is severely restricted, especially by the so-called\r\nBurford abstention doctrine, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315\r\n(1943), and by the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C.  1342 (1994).  Broadly\r\nspeaking, the staples of utility-company appeals--attacks under\r\nstate law or based on due process--are severely limited when made\r\nin federal courts.  See Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 24-25.  PSNH barely\r\nthreaded its way through this maze of limitations in obtaining a\r\npreliminary injunction against the restructuring plan--relief\r\nextended to the other utilities partly based on defaults by the\r\nCommission.  Id. at 28.\r\nHowever, thus far in the district court neither PSNH nor\r\nany other company has justified relief--consistent with Burford and\r\nthe Johnson Act--against any rate orders of the Commission except\r\nits attempts to implement the restructuring plan.  The orders of\r\nthe Commission refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to recover the\r\ncost increases imposed by Central Vermont are not orders\r\nimplementing that plan, which is why in Patch V we vacated the\r\nfurther relief granted by the district court.  This is equally true\r\nof the Commission's latest order lowering rates temporarily below\r\nthe December 1997 rate to refund the amounts collected under the\r\nvacated Patch V injunction.\r\nIn its brief and at oral argument, Connecticut Valley\r\nmade clear that it thinks that the district court has assured the\r\ncompany pendente lite of its right to collect \"its costs,\" a goal\r\nfrustrated in part by this court's supposed failure to understand\r\nthat cost recovery is the status quo that the district court has\r\nsought to preserve.  However, what Patch IV and V sought to make\r\nclear is that no such assurance is valid; the district court's\r\ninjunctive relief was sustained only against orders implementing\r\nthe restructuring plan.  If injunctive relief is to extend beyond\r\nsuch orders, it must be independently justified.  True, the\r\nrestructuring plan and the disallowance and refund orders against\r\nConnecticut Valley both may undermine cost recovery; but the former\r\nhas been validly enjoined pendente lite and the latter has not.\r\nThis leaves open the possibility that the district\r\ncourt's latest action deferring any refund can be justified on a\r\nnarrower set of grounds.  The decisions relied on by Connecticut\r\nValley, see note 2 above, reflect a common-sense policy that allows\r\na district court to wait until the end of a case to undo any\r\nmischief wrought by interim relief it granted in error.  This often\r\nmakes sense because the final outcome may affect the amount of any\r\nrestitution or damage relief, or show that nothing at all should be\r\nrepaid, even though the preliminary relief was wrongly granted in\r\nthe first place.\r\nBut here the district court is not deferring a\r\nrestitution order of its own; it is enjoining the Commission from\r\nordering restitution on the Commission's own authority.  Agencies\r\nlike the Commission often require refunds of rates \"wrongly\"\r\ncollected.  Unless the original Commission order disallowing the\r\nConnecticut Valley increase is vulnerable to injunction by a\r\nfederal court, it is hard to see what authority a federal court has\r\nto defer the Commission-ordered refund.  And, as we explained in\r\nPatch V, 167 F.3d at 35-36, Connecticut Valley has not yet made\r\nsuch a showing of likely vulnerability as to the disallowance\r\norder.\r\nThis is not because the Commission's disallowance order\r\nis sound.  At best, the state agency may be exploiting a possible\r\ndrafting mistake--the short-notice termination clause in the\r\noriginal contract between the two utilities--to shift to Central\r\nVermont (or to Vermont ratepayers) what may well have been\r\nConnecticut Valley's prudently incurred costs of achieving long-\r\nterm rate protection for its New Hampshire customers.  See Patch V,\r\n167 F.3d at 36.  If so, there may be a remedy available to\r\nConnecticut Valley in state court and, in any event, if Central\r\nVermont prevails at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\r\n(\"FERC\") and is allowed to impose a termination charge on\r\nConnecticut Valley, the Commission may be forced to retreat from\r\nits effort to compel the contract termination, thereby undermining\r\nits rationale for its disallowance order.  \r\nNevertheless, given the limitations imposed by Burford\r\nand the Johnson Act, it remains unclear why Connecticut Valley\r\nthinks that it can overturn the disallowance order in federal\r\ncourt.  Its own Contract Clause argument is quite different from\r\nthat of PSNH, which implicated a specific bankruptcy settlement\r\nformally approved by the state; and, lacking a connection to\r\nfederal bankruptcy orders, Connecticut Valley's Contract Clause\r\nclaim may, even if otherwise sound, face some difficulty in federal\r\ncourt given the broad language of the Johnson Act.  See Patch IV,\r\n167 F.3d at 24-25.  Nor has the company yet been able to explain\r\nplausibly, at least to us, how the disallowance order conflicts\r\nwith a federal statute or FERC order--claims admittedly likely to\r\navoid the Johnson Act's bar.  See Patch V, 167 F.3d at 33-34.\r\nOn this record, we are no more able to sustain the\r\ninjunction against the Commission's new refund order than we were\r\nto sustain the earlier injunction against the underlying\r\ndisallowance that we vacated in Patch V.  But the district court\r\nmay be on the verge of supplying the missing explanation in\r\ndeciding the merits of the now-submitted cross-motions for summary\r\njudgment.  Based on its orders respecting the disallowance and the\r\nrefund, the district court seemingly believes that both measures\r\nare vulnerable to a federal injunction, despite the Johnson Act,\r\nand it may be on the verge of making clear why.\r\nIt is thus possible that in the near future the district\r\ncourt will grant permanent injunctive relief requiring the\r\nCommission to allow cost pass-throughs of Central Vermont cost\r\nincreases; and if so it would be very odd to have refunds,\r\ninconsistent with such an injunction, made effective in the next\r\nseveral months.  For this reason, we have determined not to vacate\r\nthe district court's injunction against the refund order ourselves\r\nbut instead to remand this aspect of the case to the district court\r\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Cf. SEC v.\r\nLehman Bros., Inc., 157 F.3d 2, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nOn remand, the district court may defer vacation of this\r\ninjunction against the refund order for up to 90 days.  If within\r\nthat period it has decided the merits of the request for a\r\npermanent injunction in a way inconsistent with refunds, or has\r\ntaken any other action that provides a showing that the company is\r\nlikely to prevail on the merits in federal court in barring the\r\nrefunds, it may enter a superceding injunction against the refund\r\norder, which the Commission may then appeal to us.  Otherwise, no\r\nlater than the end of the 90-day period, the district court must\r\nvacate its present injunction insofar as it enjoins the\r\nCommission's refund order.\r\nThe district court's refusal to modify the injunction\r\ninsofar as it prohibits implementation of the restructuring plan is\r\naffirmed; insofar as the district court has enjoined the\r\nCommission's refund order, the matter is remanded for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  \r\nIt is so ordered.\n",

Connecticut Valley then asked the district court to enjoin the Commission from requiring this further reduction until the district court decided the merits of Connecticut Valley's request for a permanent injunction requiring the Commission to allow the company to charge rates sufficient to cover all of its costs. The Commission opposed the request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1999, after a hearing, the district court entered an order refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction upheld in Patch IV and granting in substance the additional relief sought by Connecticut Valley to defer any flow-back of the increase that the company had collected before this court vacated the district court's April 1998 injunction in that respect in Patch V. The district court did not discuss at length its reasons for the first of these actions; but it wrote several paragraphs of findings and explanations with respect to the second. The Commission now appeals, challenging both aspects of the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, little need be said about the district court's refusal to modify the preliminary injunction enjoining the the Commission's restructuring plan. PSNH's original showing of irreparable injury did depend in part on the issue of the then-current accounting treatment of so-called regulatory assets; but the threatened accounting treatment merely accelerated and made more dramatic the adverse consequences of the plan for PSNH. It was credibly alleged, at least sufficiently for preliminary relief, that the restructuring plan, as framed at the time, would prevent PSNH from ever recovering very substantial prior investments assertedly protected by a specific contract with the state and by implementing orders of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When in early 1998 Connecticut Valley joined PSNH in seeking interim relief, it provided arguments and affidavits of its own to demonstrate the harm that the restructuring plan would do to it. Once again, the projected accounting treatment of regulatory assets was one of several strands in the showing of harm to Connecticut Valley. But, as is shown by even a brief review of the company's motion papers, it was certainly not the only one--nor was the greatest dollar impact on the company attributed to this accounting requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we pointed out in Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 23, 28, the Commission made little effort to challenge the showing of irreparable injury by either PSNH or Connecticut Valley. Only the most significant change in circumstances would require the district court to revisit that issue. Yet the change in accounting treatment now trumpeted by the Commission was apparently made in July 1997, over a year before our decision in Patch IV upholding the same injunction. If the Commission thought that this adjustment changed everything, it certainly should have stressed this in its original appeal in Patch IV, or asked for a remand to consider the effect of the change. In any event, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify the preliminary injunction based on the accounting change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's new prohibition of the Commission's further reduction in Connecticut Valley's rates is an entirely different matter. In part, the company's defense of this new relief rests on a narrow ground, namely, on case law that the company argues allows a court to defer claims of restitution stemming from a vacated preliminary injunction until the merits have been decided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, ConnecticutValley's defense also involves a view of our prior decisions in Patch IV and V that is not consistent with those decisions and may have implications for any further interim disputes and possibly for the merits of this case. For this reason, we revisit briefly the scope and rationale of our earlier decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a district judge has a great deal of freedom to impose interim relief and, in particular, to preserve the status quo in all matters properly before it. But efforts by utilities to enjoin state rate orders are not ordinary cases and relief--interim or permanent--is severely restricted, especially by the so-called Burford abstention doctrine, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), and by the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1342 (1994). Broadly speaking, the staples of utility-company appeals--attacks under state law or based on due process--are severely limited when made in federal courts. See Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 24-25. PSNH barely threaded its way through this maze of limitations in obtaining a preliminary injunction against the restructuring plan--relief extended to the other utilities partly based on defaults by the Commission. Id. at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, thus far in the district court neither PSNH nor any other company has justified relief--consistent with Burford and the Johnson Act--against any rate orders of the Commission except its attempts to implement the restructuring plan. The orders of the Commission refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to recover the cost increases imposed by Central Vermont are not orders implementing that plan, which is why in Patch V we vacated the further relief granted by the district court. This is equally true of the Commission's latest order lowering rates temporarily below the December 1997 rate to refund the amounts collected under the vacated Patch V injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief and at oral argument, Connecticut Valley made clear that it thinks that the district court has assured the company pendente lite of its right to collect \"its costs,\" a goal frustrated in part by this court's supposed failure to understand that cost recovery is the status quo that the district court has sought to preserve. However, what Patch IV and V sought to make clear is that no such assurance is valid; the district court's injunctive relief was sustained only against orders implementing the restructuring plan. If injunctive relief is to extend beyond such orders, it must be independently justified. True, the restructuring plan and the disallowance and refund orders against Connecticut Valley both may undermine cost recovery; but the former has been validly enjoined pendente lite and the latter has not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves open the possibility that the district court's latest action deferring any refund can be justified on a narrower set of grounds. The decisions relied on by Connecticut Valley, see note 2 above, reflect a common-sense policy that allows a district court to wait until the end of a case to undo any mischief wrought by interim relief it granted in error. This often makes sense because the final outcome may affect the amount of any restitution or damage relief, or show that nothing at all should be repaid, even though the preliminary relief was wrongly granted in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But here the district court is not deferring a restitution order of its own; it is enjoining the Commission from ordering restitution on the Commission's own authority. Agencies like the Commission often require refunds of rates \"wrongly\" collected. Unless the original Commission order disallowing the Connecticut Valley increase is vulnerable to injunction by a federal court, it is hard to see what authority a federal court has to defer the Commission-ordered refund. And, as we explained in Patch V, 167 F.3d at 35-36, Connecticut Valley has not yet made such a showing of likely vulnerability as to the disallowance order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not because the Commission's disallowance order is sound. At best, the state agency may be exploiting a possible drafting mistake--the short-notice termination clause in the original contract between the two utilities--to shift to Central Vermont (or to Vermont ratepayers) what may well have been Connecticut Valley's prudently incurred costs of achieving long-term rate protection for its New Hampshire customers. See Patch V, 167 F.3d at 36. If so, there may be a remedy available to Connecticut Valley in state court and, in any event, if Central Vermont prevails at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") and is allowed to impose a termination charge on Connecticut Valley, the Commission may be forced to retreat from its effort to compel the contract termination, thereby undermining its rationale for its disallowance order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, given the limitations imposed by Burford and the Johnson Act, it remains unclear why Connecticut Valley thinks that it can overturn the disallowance order in federal court. Its own Contract Clause argument is quite different from that of PSNH, which implicated a specific bankruptcy settlement formally approved by the state; and, lacking a connection to federal bankruptcy orders, Connecticut Valley's Contract Clause claim may, even if otherwise sound, face some difficulty in federal court given the broad language of the Johnson Act. See Patch IV, 167 F.3d at 24-25. Nor has the company yet been able to explain plausibly, at least to us, how the disallowance order conflicts with a federal statute or FERC order--claims admittedly likely to avoid the Johnson Act's bar. See Patch V, 167 F.3d at 33-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we are no more able to sustain the injunction against the Commission's new refund order than we were to sustain the earlier injunction against the underlying disallowance that we vacated in Patch V. But the district court may be on the verge of supplying the missing explanation in deciding the merits of the now-submitted cross-motions for summary judgment. Based on its orders respecting the disallowance and the refund, the district court seemingly believes that both measures are vulnerable to a federal injunction, despite the Johnson Act, and it may be on the verge of making clear why.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus possible that in the near future the district court will grant permanent injunctive relief requiring the Commission to allow cost pass-throughs of Central Vermont cost increases; and if so it would be very odd to have refunds, inconsistent with such an injunction, made effective in the next several months. For this reason, we have determined not to vacate the district court's injunction against the refund order ourselves but instead to remand this aspect of the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Cf. SEC v. Lehman Bros., Inc., 157 F.3d 2, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court may defer vacation of this injunction against the refund order for up to 90 days. If within that period it has decided the merits of the request for a permanent injunction in a way inconsistent with refunds, or has taken any other action that provides a showing that the company is likely to prevail on the merits in federal court in barring the refunds, it may enter a superceding injunction against the refund order, which the Commission may then appeal to us. Otherwise, no later than the end of the 90-day period, the district court must vacate its present injunction insofar as it enjoins the Commission's refund order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's refusal to modify the injunction insofar as it prohibits implementation of the restructuring plan is affirmed; insofar as the district court has enjoined the Commission's refund order, the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Public Serv.

To avoid repetition, familiarity with our prior decisions is assumed; and we confine ourselves to a bare-bones summary limited to events necessary for this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, acting under recently enacted state legislation, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (\"the Commission\") issued a plan and implementing orders to restructure electric power regulation in the state. The new regime, aimed at promoting competition through various means including market-based rates, created a risk that existing utilities might not be able to recover their full investment in previously built facilities. The largest utility in the state, Public Service Company of New Hampshire (\"PSNH\"), obtained a preliminary injunction in the district court based, inter alia, on a colorable claim that the state's action violated a specific agreement with that company and so also violated bankruptcy court orders and the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. See Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">IV,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, 26, 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our principal decision issued in 1998--Patch IV--we upheld this preliminary injunction and, with somewhat greater reluctance, its extension by the district court to other New Hampshire utilities that had intervened, including Connecticut Valley Electric Company (\"Connecticut Valley\"). <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 27-29. </span>However, in the same proceeding, the district court had also ordered the Commission to allow a specific rate increase sought by Connecticut Valley to recover increased power costs which the Commission had previously disallowed in December 1997, see Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">32-33</span></span>; in our companion decision--Patch V--we vacated the district court's injunction in this respect, holding that Connecticut Valley had not shown a likelihood of prevailing in federal court on this aspect of the case. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 36.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following our decisions, the Commission and PSNH engaged in negotiations and have been moving toward a possible settlement of their differences. While proceedings in the district court as to a permanent injunction for PSNH have been deferred pending approval of the settlement, litigation between the Commission and Connecticut Valley has moved forward; several months ago both sides argued cross-motions for summary judgment on the merits of permanent relief. During this same period, two new and quite distinct disputes have arisen--one relating to the preliminary injunction upheld in Patch IV and the other to the further interim relief that we disallowed in Patch V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these two disputes stems from a new motion filed by the Commission after Patch IV asking the district court to vacate its earlier injunction barring the New Hampshire restructuring plan. That injunction had rested primarily, as preliminary injunctions normally do, see Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir. 1996), on a showing of likelihood of success on the merits coupled with a showing of threatened irreparable injury. The irreparable injury showing, initially made by PSNH, rested in part on an accounting convention regarding the financial treatment of so-called regulatory assets; according to PSNH's affidavits, the proposed New Hampshire restructuring plan would have triggered changes in the company's financial statements, placing it in immediate default on huge bank loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Patch IV affirming the preliminary injunction against the restructuring plan was rendered on December 3, 1998. On January 18, 1999, the Commission moved to vacate the injunction, primarily on the ground that changes in accounting treatment by the Financial Account Standards Board had eliminated the threat relied upon by PSNH in its original showing of irreparable injury. Connecticut Valley vigorously opposed the motion. The district court's decision on this motion is the first issue on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second dispute arises in the wake of our decision in Patch V vacating a different aspect of the district court's pendente lite relief. As noted above and explained in detail in Patch V, even before its restructuring plan was scheduled to be implemented, the Commission had disallowed an attempt by Connecticut Valley in December 1997 to implement a specific rate increase designed to pass along to its customers a routine increase in the cost of power it purchases from its parent and wholesale supplier, Central Vermont Public Service Company (\"Central Vermont\"). The Commission took the view that while the increase in Connecticut Valley's costs was real, purchasing from Central Vermont was no longer prudent because power could currently be bought for less on the open <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">market.</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">32</span></span>. Connecticut Valley had a long-term requirements contract with Central Vermont, but the Commission deemed it to be terminable on short notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without sharply distinguishing between this specific disallowance by the Commission and its far-reaching restructuring plan, the district court in April 1998 directed the Commission to allow the increase. It was this further preliminary relief that we found not to be justified because (in our view) Connecticut Valley had failed to show that it was likely to prevail on the merits in its ultimate challenge to this disallowance in federal court. Our Patch V decision vacated this aspect of the district court's preliminary injunction, thereby permitting the Commission to roll back Connecticut Valley's retail rates to the pre-1998 level, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">36</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission not only rolled back the rate increase but also ordered further temporary reductions by Connecticut Valley, below the level prevailing in December 1997, in order to flow back to customers the amount of the increases that had been collected between the time of the district court's injunction with respect to the disallowance and the later vacation of that injunction in Patch V. Connecticut Valley then asked the district court to enjoin the Commission from requiring this further reduction until the district court decided the merits of Connecticut Valley's request for a permanent injunction requiring the Commission to allow the company to charge rates sufficient to cover all of its costs. The Commission opposed the request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1999, after a hearing, the district court entered an order refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction upheld in Patch IV and granting in substance the additional relief sought by Connecticut Valley to defer any flow-back of the increase that the company had collected before this court vacated the district court's April 1998 injunction in that respect in Patch V. The district court did not discuss at length its reasons for the first of these actions; but it wrote several paragraphs of findings and explanations with respect to the second. The Commission now appeals, challenging both aspects of the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, little need be said about the district court's refusal to modify the preliminary injunction enjoining the the Commission's restructuring plan. PSNH's original showing of irreparable injury did depend in part on the issue of the then-current accounting treatment of so-called regulatory assets; but the threatened accounting treatment merely accelerated and made more dramatic the adverse consequences of the plan for PSNH. It was credibly alleged, at least sufficiently for preliminary relief, that the restructuring plan, as framed at the time, would prevent PSNH from ever recovering very substantial prior investments assertedly protected by a specific contract with the state and by implementing orders of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When in early 1998 Connecticut Valley joined PSNH in seeking interim relief, it provided arguments and affidavits of its own to demonstrate the harm that the restructuring plan would do to it. Once again, the projected accounting treatment of regulatory assets was one of several strands in the showing of harm to Connecticut Valley. But, as is shown by even a brief review of the company's motion papers, it was certainly not the only one--nor was the greatest dollar impact on the company attributed to this accounting requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we pointed out in Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">IV,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>, 28, the Commission made little effort to challenge the showing of irreparable injury by either PSNH or Connecticut Valley. Only the most significant change in circumstances would require the district court to revisit that issue. Yet the change in accounting treatment now trumpeted by the Commission was apparently made in July 1997, over a year before our decision in Patch IV upholding the same injunction. If the Commission thought that this adjustment changed everything, it certainly should have stressed this in its original appeal in Patch IV, or asked for a remand to consider the effect of the change. In any event, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify the preliminary injunction based on the accounting change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's new prohibition of the Commission's further reduction in Connecticut Valley's rates is an entirely different matter. In part, the company's defense of this new relief rests on a narrow ground, namely, on case law that the company argues allows a court to defer claims of restitution stemming from a vacated preliminary injunction until the merits have been decided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, ConnecticutValley's defense also involves a view of our prior decisions in Patch IV and V that is not consistent with those decisions and may have implications for any further interim disputes and possibly for the merits of this case. For this reason, we revisit briefly the scope and rationale of our earlier decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a district judge has a great deal of freedom to impose interim relief and, in particular, to preserve the status quo in all matters properly before it. But efforts by utilities to enjoin state rate orders are not ordinary cases and relief--interim or permanent--is severely restricted, especially by the so-called Burford abstention doctrine, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103842\"><a href=\"/opinion/103842/burford-v-sun-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span> </a></span>(1943), and by the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1342 (1994). Broadly speaking, the staples of utility-company appeals--attacks under state law or based on due process--are severely limited when made in federal courts. See Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">IV,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">24-25</span></span>. PSNH barely threaded its way through this maze of limitations in obtaining a preliminary injunction against the restructuring plan--relief extended to the other utilities partly based on defaults by the Commission. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 28.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, thus far in the district court neither PSNH nor any other company has justified relief--consistent with Burford and the Johnson Act--against any rate orders of the Commission except its attempts to implement the restructuring plan. The orders of the Commission refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to recover the cost increases imposed by Central Vermont are not orders implementing that plan, which is why in Patch V we vacated the further relief granted by the district court. This is equally true of the Commission's latest order lowering rates temporarily below the December 1997 rate to refund the amounts collected under the vacated Patch V injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief and at oral argument, Connecticut Valley made clear that it thinks that the district court has assured the company pendente lite of its right to collect \"its costs,\" a goal frustrated in part by this court's supposed failure to understand that cost recovery is the status quo that the district court has sought to preserve. However, what Patch IV and V sought to make clear is that no such assurance is valid; the district court's injunctive relief was sustained only against orders implementing the restructuring plan. If injunctive relief is to extend beyond such orders, it must be independently justified. True, the restructuring plan and the disallowance and refund orders against Connecticut Valley both may undermine cost recovery; but the former has been validly enjoined pendente lite and the latter has not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves open the possibility that the district court's latest action deferring any refund can be justified on a narrower set of grounds. The decisions relied on by Connecticut Valley, see note 2 above, reflect a common-sense policy that allows a district court to wait until the end of a case to undo any mischief wrought by interim relief it granted in error. This often makes sense because the final outcome may affect the amount of any restitution or damage relief, or show that nothing at all should be repaid, even though the preliminary relief was wrongly granted in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But here the district court is not deferring a restitution order of its own; it is enjoining the Commission from ordering restitution on the Commission's own authority. Agencies like the Commission often require refunds of rates \"wrongly\" collected. Unless the original Commission order disallowing the Connecticut Valley increase is vulnerable to injunction by a federal court, it is hard to see what authority a federal court has to defer the Commission-ordered refund. And, as we explained in Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">35-36</span></span>, Connecticut Valley has not yet made such a showing of likely vulnerability as to the disallowance order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not because the Commission's disallowance order is sound. At best, the state agency may be exploiting a possible drafting mistake--the short-notice termination clause in the original contract between the two utilities--to shift to Central Vermont (or to Vermont ratepayers) what may well have been Connecticut Valley's prudently incurred costs of achieving long-term rate protection for its New Hampshire customers. See Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">36</span></span>. If so, there may be a remedy available to Connecticut Valley in state court and, in any event, if Central Vermont prevails at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") and is allowed to impose a termination charge on Connecticut Valley, the Commission may be forced to retreat from its effort to compel the contract termination, thereby undermining its rationale for its disallowance order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, given the limitations imposed by Burford and the Johnson Act, it remains unclear why Connecticut Valley thinks that it can overturn the disallowance order in federal court. Its own Contract Clause argument is quite different from that of PSNH, which implicated a specific bankruptcy settlement formally approved by the state; and, lacking a connection to federal bankruptcy orders, Connecticut Valley's Contract Clause claim may, even if otherwise sound, face some difficulty in federal court given the broad language of the Johnson Act. See Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">IV,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">24-25</span></span>. Nor has the company yet been able to explain plausibly, at least to us, how the disallowance order conflicts with a federal statute or FERC order--claims admittedly likely to avoid the Johnson Act's bar. See Patch <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">33-34</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we are no more able to sustain the injunction against the Commission's new refund order than we were to sustain the earlier injunction against the underlying disallowance that we vacated in Patch V. But the district court may be on the verge of supplying the missing explanation in deciding the merits of the now-submitted cross-motions for summary judgment. Based on its orders respecting the disallowance and the refund, the district court seemingly believes that both measures are vulnerable to a federal injunction, despite the Johnson Act, and it may be on the verge of making clear why.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus possible that in the near future the district court will grant permanent injunctive relief requiring the Commission to allow cost pass-throughs of Central Vermont cost increases; and if so it would be very odd to have refunds, inconsistent with such an injunction, made effective in the next several months. For this reason, we have determined not to vacate the district court's injunction against the refund order ourselves but instead to remand this aspect of the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Cf. SEC v. Lehman Bros., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198149\"><a href=\"/opinion/198149/sec-v-pinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court may defer vacation of this injunction against the refund order for up to 90 days. If within that period it has decided the merits of the request for a permanent injunction in a way inconsistent with refunds, or has taken any other action that provides a showing that the company is likely to prevail on the merits in federal court in barring the refunds, it may enter a superceding injunction against the refund order, which the Commission may then appeal to us. Otherwise, no later than the end of the 90-day period, the district court must vacate its present injunction insofar as it enjoins the Commission's refund order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's refusal to modify the injunction insofar as it prohibits implementation of the restructuring plan is affirmed; insofar as the district court has enjoined the Commission's refund order, the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Public Serv.
