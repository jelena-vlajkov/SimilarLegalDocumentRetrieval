After a thorough review of the record\r\nand of the parties' submissions, we affirm.  It appears that\r\nappellant Sigfrido Torres Lazzarini (\"Torres\") did file an\r\nadministrative claim for the mental suffering he says he\r\nendured as a result of the allegedly wrongful termination of\r\nhis benefits by the Veteran's Administration; and we will\r\nassume that claim was filed in July 1992, as reflected in\r\nExhibit F of Torres' Appendix.  Even if Torres' Federal Tort\r\nClaims Act claim was cognizable   a matter we do not decide  \r\nit is barred as untimely.  Torres' claim accrued in September\r\n1989, when he says Veteran's Administration officials conspired\r\nto withhold his benefits.  See United States v. Kubrick, 444\r\nU.S. 111, 113 (1979) (claim under the FTCA accrues \"when the\r\nplaintiff knows both the existence and the cause of his\r\ninjury.\").  In order to have been timely, his administrative\r\nclaim should have been filed by September 1991.  28 U.S.C.\r\n2401(b).\r\n          Affirmed.  1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n",
