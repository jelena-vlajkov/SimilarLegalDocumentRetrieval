Stern, United States Attorney, and Michael J.\nPineault, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       AUGUST 23, 2000\n\f              Per Curiam.     Appellant Christina Troisi appeals\n\nfrom    a    judgment   of   the   district   court   upholding   the\n\nCommissioner's denial of social security disability benefits\n\n(\"SSDI\") and supplemental security benefits (\"SSI\").         Troisi\n\nalleged an inability to engage in any \"substantial gainful\n\nactivity\" beginning in 1990 due to headaches, a depressive\n\ndisorder and a gender identity disorder.          She stated in her\n\napplication that she had worked full-time as a hairdresser\n\nuntil 1990, and had continued to work at that trade, but on\n\na part-time basis, earning $90 per week, until shortly\n\nbefore she filed her application for benefits on April 26,\n\n1995.       Her last insured date was September 30, 1996.\n\n              At the hearing before an ALJ in August, 1996,\n\nTroisi acknowledged that by March or May, 1996, she had\n\nresumed her part-time work as a hairdresser and was still so\n\nemployed for approximately three days per week, now earning\n\n$18 per day.       The ALJ found that this work \"probably\" was\n\nnot at a substantial \"gainful\" level, so her application was\n\nnot disqualified at Step One of the familiar sequential\n\nprocess.       See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1574(b), 416.974(b) (1997)\n\n(defining \"gainful\" earnings); see also 20 C.F.R. § 1572\n\f(providing that part-time work which involves significant\n\nphysical or mental activity is \"substantial\" work).\n\n            At    the   hearing,    the   ALJ   heard    testimony     from\n\nTroisi, a vocational expert, and a medical expert.                        The\n\nrecord was held open for additional medical evidence.                 Based\n\non the entire record, the ALJ determined that despite her\n\nmental impairments, Troisi retained a residual functional\n\ncapacity to work at a \"substantial gainful\" level as a\n\nhairdresser and to make an adjustment to other work which\n\nexists in significant numbers in the national economy.                    The\n\nAppeals Council denied review.\n\n            Upon a careful review of the record, we agree with\n\nthe district court that the ALJ's determination is supported\n\nby substantial evidence.       Accordingly, we affirm adding only\n\nthe following in light of the arguments here.\n\n            (1)    The ALJ did not \"ignore\" the second opinion\n\nletter from Troisi's treating psychologist dated August 26,\n\n1996, but fully summarized it in his report.                    The ALJ was\n\nnot required to chose between the psychologist's second\n\ndiagnosis of \"major depression in partial remission\" and the\n\nexamining    psychiatrist's        diagnosis    of   \"dysthymia\"      since\n\nneither   doctor    described      an   impairment      which    \"meets    or\n\nequals\" the severity        required for a finding of disability\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fat Step Three.        The psychologist's opinion, that Troisi was\n\nnot ready to return to \"full-time\" work without risk to her\n\nmental health, was not entitled to \"controlling\" weight\n\nsince it was inconsistent with other substantial evidence in\n\nthe   record    including        evidence   from   the    other   treating\n\nsources.       See    20    C.F.R.   §   404.1527(d)(2).    Anyway,    the\n\nquestion before the ALJ was whether, as defined in the\n\nregulations,        Troisi's     impairments   precluded    \"substantial\n\ngainful work activity\" for a continuous twelve-month period\n\nand that question is reserved to the Commissioner.                 See 20\n\nC.F.R. § 404.1527(e).\n\n             (2)     The ALJ's finding that Troisi's \"statements\n\nabout her impairments and their impact on her ability to\n\nwork are not entirely credible,\" is sufficiently explained\n\nby the     ensuing discussion of the medical evidence in his\n\nreport and his comments at the hearing.                    A credibility\n\nfinding is entitled to deference especially where, as here,\n\nit is consistent with substantial medical evidence.\n\n              (3)            The ALJ's findings as to Troisi's non-\n\nexertional limitations were specific and individualized and\n\ndid   fall     below       the   regulatory    standard    explained    in\n\nLancellotta v. Secretary of HHS, 806 F.2d 284, 285 (1st Cir.\n\n1986). The hypothetical which the ALJ posed to the VE fairly\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsummarized the limitations which were found to be credible\n\nand supported by the medical evidence.\n\n          (4)    The   parties    disagree        about   whether   the\n\npsychologist's third opinion letter, dated March 26, 1997,\n\nis a part of the record for purposes of judicial review.\n\nThe letter was offered to the Appeals Council as \"new\"\n\nevidence, but the Appeals Council denied review.\n\n          Troisi seeks a remand to the Commissioner for\n\nfurther \"evaluation,\" but we are not sure whether she means\n\nto argue (1) that under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), the letter is\n\n\"new\" and \"material\" evidence and there was \"good cause\" for\n\nthe failure to incorporate it into the record \"in a prior\n\nproceeding,\" or (2) that the Appeals Council erred as a\n\nmatter of law by denying review under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.976,\n\n416.1476, because the letter was \"new\" and \"material\" to the\n\nperiod \"on or before\" the ALJ's decision date, and/or (3)\n\nthat we should include the letter in our judicial review of\n\nthe entire record for \"substantial evidence.\"                 As to the\n\nlast of the possible arguments, the circuits are split over\n\nwhether such \"new evidence\" is considered a part of the\n\nadministrative record for purposes of judicial review.\n\n          However, here we need not reach the issue which has\n\ndivided   the   circuits.    Under     any   of    Troisi's    possible\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f arguments, we find that the psychologist's third opinion\n\n letter      cannot reasonably change the result.         The letter is\n\n dated six months after Troisi's insurance expired and two\n\n months after the ALJ's decision.                It \"updates\" Troisi's\n\n \"mental      status   and    current   functioning,\"     in     light   of\n\n intervening events and adds new diagnoses.                 It was too\n\n remote to be \"material\" to the SSDI issue of whether Troisi\n\n had acquired a defined disability prior to the expiration of\n\n her insurance.        Any retrospective inferences, even to the\n\n date of the ALJ's decision, are too attenuated to add weight\n\n to       Troisi's   claims   or   to   change    the   result    of     our\n\n \"substantial evidence\" review.1\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      In addition to the time line issue, we note that the\ndoctor's new diagnosis of \"apparent\" attention deficits and\n\"possible learning disabilities,\" would carry little or no\nweight, especially since the doctor had \"not been able to test\nMs. Troisi to determine the nature and/or level of her cognitive\ndeficits.\"   Other \"new\" diagnoses, or bases for the opinion\ninclude, \"lacking in job interview skills\" and \"lack of adequate\n[employment] training,\" matters which are not entitled to weight\nas \"medical\" opinion.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f",
