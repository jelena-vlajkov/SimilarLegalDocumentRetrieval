Caban,\n                       a/k/a Juan Caba,\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n      [Hon. Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Ramon Garcia on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Camille Velez-\nRive, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 8, 2000\n\f             Per Curiam.    Appellant Juan Molinuevo-Polanco pled\n\n guilty to one count of illegally reentering this country\n\n after   a   prior   conviction   for    an   aggravated   felony    and\n\n deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b).             Prior to\n\n sentencing, he never sought to withdraw his guilty plea, but\n\n this is the relief he seeks on appeal.          He contends that his\n\n Fifth   Amendment    due   process     rights   were   violated    when\n\n certain government agents failed to advise him of his rights\n\n under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and failed to\n\n advise him of his rights under the Vienna Convention on\n\n Consular Relations or to notify his consulate of his arrest.\n\n The thrust of his argument appears to be that he would not\n\n have made certain incriminating statements to government\n\n agents, or would not have pled guilty, if he had received\n\n the requisite Miranda warnings and if his Vienna Convention\n\n rights had been observed.            We affirm for the following\n\n reasons.1\n\n             1.   We think that the government has adequately\n\n explained in its brief why the Fifth Amendment due process\n\n\n\n    1We also grant Molinuevo's motion to submit his appeal to\nthe court on the basis of the parties' briefs and without oral\nargument.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fclaim fails, at least insofar as it is based on the alleged\n\nviolation of the Vienna Convention.        We agree that claimant\n\nhas not made the requisite showing of prejudice.           See United\n\nStates v. Ademaj, 170 F.3d 58, 67 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n120 S. Ct. 206 (1999) (rejecting Fifth Amendment due process\n\nclaim, based on violation of Vienna Convention, on plain\n\nerror review because appellant had not shown prejudice due\n\nto   the   violation).      Accordingly,   the    extent      to   which\n\nappellant may or may not have enforceable rights under the\n\nVienna Convention is irrelevant here.        See generally United\n\nStates v. Li, Nos. 97-2034 et al. (1st Cir. Feb. 29, 2000)\n\n(en banc).\n\n           2.     There is no need to consider the Miranda claim,\n\nalthough    the    government   submits   proof   that   it    advised\n\nMolinuevo of his Miranda rights before he admitted his guilt\n\nto government agents.      By pleading guilty, Molinuevo waived\n\nany Miranda violation.          See United States v. Cordero, 42\n\nF.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that an unconditional\n\nguilty plea waives prior non-jurisdictional constitutional\n\nerrors and rejecting contention that a claim for suppression\n\nof evidence is a non-waived jurisdictional issue); Acevedo-\n\nRamos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 307-09 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f(concluding that guilty plea waivers of affirmative defenses\n\nto prosecution need not be explicit).\n\n               In any event, even if we were to consider his claim\n\non this undeveloped record (the appellant never filed a\n\nmotion to suppress below and no suppression hearing based on\n\nany Miranda violation was ever held), we could not find that\n\nthe alleged Miranda violation was plain error.                    For all we\n\nknow, Molinuevo may have impliedly or even explicitly waived\n\nhis Miranda rights before admitting his guilt.                     See United\n\nStates    v.        Nunez,    19    F.3d   719,   723      (1st   Cir.     1994)\n\n(concluding, after assuming that plain error review of a\n\nwaived suppression claim was appropriate, that plain error\n\ncould    not    be    shown   given     the   lack    of   adequate      factual\n\ndevelopment in the district court); accord United States v.\n\nDavenport, 986 F.2d 1047, 1048-49 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\n               3.    Molinuevo has not explicitly contended that he\n\ndid not enter his guilty plea voluntarily, knowingly and\n\nintelligently, and he has not challenged the validity of his\n\nplea hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11.                 Accordingly, he has\n\nnot shown that vacating his guilty plea on direct appeal\n\nwould be appropriate.              See United States v. Noriega-Millan,\n\n110   F.3d     162,    166    (1st    Cir.    1997)   (indicating        that   a\n\ncriminal defendant seeking to withdraw his guilty plea for\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe   first   time   on    direct   appeal    would   have       to    show   a\n\n\"substantial defect in the Rule 11 proceeding\") (citation\n\nomitted); United States v. McKelvey, No. 99-1264, slip op.\n\nat 6 (1st Cir. Feb. 11, 2000) (indicating that a criminal\n\ndefendant seeking to withdraw his guilty plea on direct\n\nappeal would have to show \"a fundamental defect [in his plea\n\nproceeding]      which     inherently      results      in   a        complete\n\nmiscarriage of justice or an omission inconsistent with the\n\nrudimentary      demands    of   fair     procedure\")    (citation         and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            4.   We note our doubt that Molinuevo's allegedly\n\nunconstitutional confession factored into his decision to\n\nplead   guilty.      As     an   undisputed    investigative           report\n\nappended to the government's brief shows, the government had\n\nample evidence of his guilt apart from the confession.\n\nMoreover, by the time he pled guilty he was represented by\n\nan attorney who would seem better able to advise him in\n\nconnection with his plea than consular authorities.\n\n            The conviction and sentence are affirmed. See Loc.\n\nR. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
