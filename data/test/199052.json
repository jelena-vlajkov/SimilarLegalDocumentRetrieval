Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Norberto Colon on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        July 13, 2000\n\f          Per Curiam.    After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm.\n\n          Because     appellant   Julio   Quiñones     Meléndez\n\n(“Quiñones”) did not object below to the sentencing court’s\n\nfindings regarding drug quantity or his role in the offense,\n\nthose arguments are forfeited.    See United States v. Bayes,\n\n210 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2000); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\nEven if they had not been forfeited, they are without merit.\n\nQuiñones admitted under oath at the Rule 11 hearing that he\n\nwas guilty of the charge of conspiring to possess more than\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, so we see no clear error in the\n\ncourt’s decision to credit those sworn admissions.          See\n\nUnited States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 354 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n          As for his role in the offense, this court would\n\nonly review for clear error, and we see none.        See United\n\nStates v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 148-49 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Quiñones agreed that the adjustment for a “minor”\n\nrole under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b) should apply; and because the\n\ngovernment agreed to understate the quantity of drugs for\n\nwhich Quiñones was to be held responsible, the sentencing\n\ncourt was entitled to deny him a more generous role in the\n\noffense adjustment.     Id. at 149.\n\f         Quiñones    also   complains   that   he   has   not   been\n\nassigned to serve his sentence in a rehabilitation camp,\n\ndespite the recommendation of the sentencing court.        But the\n\nauthority to assign prisoners to particular facilities lies\n\nsolely with the Bureau of Prisons.      See 18 U.S.C. § 3621.\n\n         Affirmed.    1st Cir. Loc.
