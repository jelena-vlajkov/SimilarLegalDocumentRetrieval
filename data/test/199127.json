Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Melba N. Rivera-Camacho on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam E. Mendoza\nToro, Assistant United States Attorney, and Nancy B. Salafia,\nAssistant Regional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\f                          October 13, 2000\n\n\n            Per Curiam.      After carefully reviewing the briefs\n\nand record on appeal, we affirm the Commissioner’s decision.\n\nThe     administrative law judge (ALJ) was not obligated to\n\ngive    controlling    weight      to    the     treating    psychiatrist’s\n\nopinion,    inasmuch    as    the       record    contained        conflicting\n\nevidence.     See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2).                 Moreover, the\n\nALJ’s finding of adequate mental status was supported by\n\nsubstantial      evidence.    No    more       was    exigible,      though    a\n\ncontrary conclusion might also have been reasonable.                       See,\n\ne.g.,    Manso-Pizarro       v.    Secretary         of   Health    and   Human\n\nServices, 76 F.3d 15 (1st Cir. 1996); Perez v.                 Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services, 958 F.2d 445 (1 st Cir. 1991);\n\nIrlanda Oritz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 955\n\nF.2d 765 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            We add that the medical expert properly considered\n\nwhether    the   appellant’s       obesity       qualified     as    a    listed\n\ncondition, but concluded that it did not.                   The appellant’s\n\nweight fell twenty-six pounds shy of the requirement.                         The\n\nappellant also fails to make a plausible argument that her\n\ncombination of impairments equaled a listed condition.                        The\n\nmedical expert found no severe limitation in the range of\n\fmotion in her hips and knees, her weight was under the\n\nlisted minimum, and the ALJ reasonably concluded that her\n\nmental status was not markedly limited.      We need go no\n\nfurther.\n\n           Affirmed.   See Loc. R. 27 (c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f",
