DESTEFANO,\r\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n         [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Stahl and Lipez,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Walter F. McKee and Lipman &amp; Katz, P.A. on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n   Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and F. Mark Terison,\r\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on Motion to Vacate and Remand to the\r\nDistrict Court, for appellee.\r\n\nNOVEMBER 22, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  In this direct criminal appeal, the\r\nappellant, who was convicted of two counts of being a felon in\r\npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g) and\r\n924(a)(2), contends that the counts in question were\r\nmultiplicitous and that the district court plainly erred when\r\nit entered judgment on and sentenced him for both counts of\r\nconviction.  The appellant also asserts that the district court\r\nplainly erred when it directed the probation officer to\r\nestablish a payment schedule for the criminal monetary\r\npenalties imposed on him.  The government has essentially\r\nconceded that appellant is correct by moving this court to\r\nvacate one count of conviction and to remand for resentencing\r\non the remaining count.  \r\n          In light of appellant's arguments and the\r\ngovernment's motion, we direct that appellant's conviction and\r\nsentence on Count I be vacated as multiplicitous.  See United\r\nStates v. Rivera, 77 F.3d 1348, 1351, 1352 (11th Cir.) (per\r\ncuriam), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1250 (1996); United States v.\r\nHorodner, 993 F.2d 191, 193 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v.\r\nJones, 533 F.2d 1387, 1391-92 (6th Cir. 1976) (all agreeing\r\nthat the continuous and uninterrupted possession of the same\r\nfirearm by a felon constitutes a single chargeable offense);\r\nUnited States v. Gore, 154 F.3d 34, 47-48 (2d Cir. 1998)\r\n(finding multiplicitous convictions and sentences to be plain\r\nerror and correcting the error by vacating one conviction).\r\n          We affirm the conviction on Count II.  Because the\r\ndistrict court did not impose fully concurrent sentences on the\r\ntwo counts of conviction (which involved essentially the same\r\nunderlying conduct), we vacate the sentence on Count II in its\r\nentirety and remand for resentencing de novo.  See United\r\nStates v. Rodriguez, 112 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.) (noting that,\r\nin multi-count convictions based on the same course of conduct,\r\nthe sentences form a \"package\" that work together, so that if\r\none is vacated on appeal, the trial judge ought to be free to\r\nreconsider \"how the pieces fit together\"), cert. denied, 118 S.\r\nCt. 237 (1997); cf. United States v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d\r\n57, 68 (1st Cir. 1999) (declining to consider alleged\r\nsentencing errors after vacating certain convictions for\r\ninsufficient evidence where, on remand, the district court\r\nwould be able to reevaluate and recalculate the sentence in\r\nlight of the court's rulings)  (both citing United States v.\r\nPimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1989)).  We note\r\nthat any new sentence providing for a payment schedule for any\r\nfine or special monetary assessment must comply with this\r\ncourt's recent decision in United States v. Merric, 166 F.3d\r\n406, 409 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that a sentencing court may\r\nnot delegate the task of setting a payment schedule for\r\ncriminal fines to the probation officer). \r\n          The judgment of conviction and the sentence on Count\r\nI of the indictment are vacated.  The judgment of conviction on\r\nCount II is affirmed.  The sentence on Count II is vacated and\r\nremanded for resentencing de novo in accordance with this\r\nopinion.\n",
