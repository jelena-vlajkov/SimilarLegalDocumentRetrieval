Michael Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Circuit Judge, \r\n\n        Aldrich and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   John C. Sikorski with whom Keith A. Minoff and Robinson,\r\nDonovan, Madden &amp; Barry, P.C. were on brief for plaintiffs.\r\n   David G. Cohen with whom Charles S. Cohen and Egan, Flanagan\r\nand Cohen, P.C. were on brief for defendants.\r\n\nSeptember 15, 1999\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Plaintiffs each retired\r\nfrom defendant Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company\r\n(\"MassMutual\" or \"the Company\") under terms that were less\r\nfavorable than those in a special offer made to employees soon\r\nafter.  They filed suit against MassMutual and the Massachusetts\r\nMutual Voluntary Termination Program (\"VTP\"), alleging that by\r\nfailing to reveal that a more favorable retirement option was\r\nforthcoming, MassMutual violated its fiduciary duties under the\r\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") (codified\r\nat 29 U.S.C.  1001 et seq.).  Plaintiffs also alleged \r\nmisrepresentation under Massachusetts common law.  The district\r\ncourt dismissed plaintiffs' ERISA claims on the ground that the\r\nseverance package offered by the Company did not constitute a\r\n\"plan\" for purposes of ERISA.  Exercising supplemental\r\njurisdiction, the court also granted summary judgment dismissing\r\nthe state law misrepresentation claims as well as later-added\r\nestoppel claims.  Plaintiffs appeal from the grant of summary\r\njudgment on their state law claims.  MassMutual cross-appeals from\r\nthe district court's ruling that the severance package is not a\r\n\"plan\" governed by ERISA.  The Company contends that should the\r\ncase be remanded to the district court, only plaintiffs' ERISA\r\nclaims will survive.  \r\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiffs' ERISA claims.  We also affirm,\r\nalthough on grounds somewhat different from those stated by the\r\ndistrict court, the dismissal of most of plaintiffs' state law\r\nclaims, but reverse and remand for trial the claims of three of the\r\neight plaintiffs.\r\n                          I.  FACTS \r\nThis case has followed a torturous path.  The underlying\r\nfacts and procedural history are set forth in two opinions below. \r\nSee Rodowicz v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., 857 F. Supp.\r\n992 (D. Mass. 1994); Rodowicz v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins.\r\nCo., 3 F. Supp.2d 1481 (D. Mass. 1998).  We summarize the facts\r\npertinent to the issues raised in the parties' appeals. \r\nIn 1990, MassMutual began to be concerned that senior\r\nexecutives were not leaving the company in sufficient numbers to\r\nmake room for the promotion of other executives.  To address this\r\nproblem, employees drafted a 1990 Voluntary Incentive Program\r\n(\"VIP\"), which was intended to induce more senior executives to\r\nretire.  The VIP was never adopted.  However, the VIP documents\r\nwere saved by the Company for possible use at a later date.  \r\nDuring the summer of 1991, for the first time in\r\nMassMutual's history, two ratings agencies lowered their ratings of\r\nMassMutual products.  The agencies were especially concerned that\r\nMassMutual was over-invested in real estate, creating the danger \r\nthat losses in that sector could impact negatively upon the\r\nCompany's value.  The agencies' downrating occurred at a time when\r\nboth the national economy and the insurance industry were\r\nexperiencing economic troubles.  \r\nMassMutual thereupon began to consider what measures it\r\ncould take to lower costs.  As employee salaries comprised the\r\nlargest single category of cost, at the end of 1991 senior\r\nexecutives at MassMutual looked into reducing staffing levels. \r\nAfter consideration, however, the Company decided against workforce\r\nreduction at the time.\r\nIn February 1992, Thomas Wheeler, MassMutual's Chief\r\nExecutive Officer, delivered an annual \"state of the company\"\r\nspeech to all employees.  The February 14, 1992 issue of the\r\ncompany newsletter, the MassMutual News, summarized Wheeler's\r\nremarks.  Wheeler stated, in essence, that MassMutual was in good\r\nfinancial condition.  He stated that while the ratings downgrade\r\nhad \"hurt our pride,\" there \"would be no change in how we do\r\nbusiness.\"  Wheeler went on to state: \"We are a company with\r\nintegrity.  We handle our business ethically and are better than\r\nour competitors.\"  During the speech, Wheeler made no reference to\r\nany reduction in the Company's workforce.  \r\nIn March 1992, John Pajak, MassMutual's Chief Operating\r\nOfficer, assigned to senior members of his management team the task\r\nof determining the costs and savings from a workforce reduction. \r\nIn connection with this assignment, Susan Alfano, Senior Vice\r\nPresident in Charge of Human Resources, gathered data from the\r\nCompany's outside employee benefits consultant.  Between March and\r\nSeptember, 1992, Alfano thoroughly analyzed the costs and benefits\r\nof a reduction in force.  \r\nOn September 17, 1992, Wheeler, Pajak, and other senior\r\nMassMutual executives met for the purpose of reviewing the\r\nCompany's five-year budget.  During the meeting, Wheeler and Pajak\r\ndiscussed MassMutual's wages and salaries paid, which, as said,\r\nwere the Company's largest operating expense.  Wheeler asked Pajak\r\nto develop some options for reducing  this expense.  Specifically,\r\nWheeler instructed Pajak to \"dust off\" the VIP that had been\r\ndeveloped in 1991.\r\nOn September 30, 1992, Pajak and Alfano made a\r\npresentation to the President's Cabinet, a formal MassMutual\r\ngoverning body that consisted of senior executives who reported\r\ndirectly to Wheeler.  Pajak and Alfano recommended that the Company\r\nconsider the possibility of a two-step reduction in force, in which\r\na voluntary termination program (\"VTP\") would be followed by \r\ninvoluntary layoffs, to be completed by early 1993.  Immediately\r\nfollowing this presentation, Pajak and Alfano were instructed to\r\ndevelop the details of such a program for further consideration.  \r\nIn early October, 1992, senior MassMutual employees began\r\ndeveloping the specifics of a workforce reduction program.  By\r\nOctober 12, 1992, the terms of the VTP were drafted, and the\r\nCompensation Committee of MassMutual's Board of Directors for the\r\nfirst time authorized Wheeler to adopt the plan at his discretion. \r\nOn October 19, 1992, Wheeler decided to adopt the VTP.  The Company\r\nannounced the adoption of the plan on October 23, 1992.  The terms\r\nof the VTP were not finally settled and the plan documents were not\r\nsigned until mid-November, 1992.\r\nThe VTP was open to most full-time MassMutual employees,\r\nabout 4,000 in number.  The plan provided for a one-time, lump sum\r\nseverance bonus equal to:  (1) three weeks of salary for every year\r\nof service, up to a maximum of 78 weeks, or (2) one week of salary\r\nfor each full $5,000 of compensation, and a proportionate amount\r\nfor an increment less than $5,000, up to a maximum of 52 weeks. \r\nThe Company set December 1, 1992 as the deadline for eligible\r\nemployees to elect to participate in the VTP.  At its discretion,\r\nhowever, the Company could defer an employee's election date beyond\r\nthe December 1 deadline, but in no case past June 30, 1993.  The\r\nVTP included a mechanism whereby employees to whom the Company\r\ndenied benefits could appeal from the denial.        \r\nOnly employees who retired on or after October 23, 1992\r\nand before January 2, 1993 were eligible to receive benefits under\r\nthe VTP.  Each of the named plaintiffs retired from MassMutual\r\nbetween August 1, 1992 and October 1, 1992.  All of the plaintiffs\r\nwould have received substantially higher retirement benefits if\r\nthey had waited to retire until after October 23, 1992.\r\nPlaintiffs each claim to have decided to retire after\r\nbeing lulled by misrepresentations made by Company personnel to the\r\neffect that no change in retirement benefits was planned.  The\r\nspecific allegations are set forth below.    \r\nPlaintiff Stanley Rodowicz claims that in late August or\r\nearly September 1992, Laura Cowles, an employee in Corporate Human\r\nResources, told him that the Board of Directors had decided that\r\nthere would be no change in the retirement package.  Plaintiff\r\nBarbara Binsky alleges that in or around May 1992, she asked Byron\r\nMattson, a Second Vice President, whether there was going to be any\r\ngolden parachute or early retirement incentive.  He answered\r\n\"absolutely not, there will be no golden handshake.\"  Later, Binsky\r\nasked a similar question of Priscilla Dill, a retirement counselor,\r\nwho replied:  \"I really don't think there will be anything.\"\r\nPlaintiff Anne Buck alleges that in July 1992, she was\r\ntold by Dill that \"I am not aware of anything coming down the\r\nroad,\" or, as far as Dill knew at that point in time there was\r\nnothing going on with retirement packages.  Sometime before May\r\n1992, Michael Walker, Buck's former boss, allegedly told her that \r\n\"anything can happen, but we have no definite plans [to adopt any\r\nenhanced benefits].\"\r\nPlaintiff Patricia Kennedy claims that in the spring of\r\n1992, she was present when her boss, Linda Egan, told people at a\r\ndepartment meeting that there would not be any severance program or\r\nearly retirement incentive program.  Plaintiff James Lemon claims\r\nthat in the summer of 1992, he attended a retirement meeting at\r\nwhich Jack Wilson, a supervisor in Human Resources, announced that\r\nthere would be no enhanced benefit package.  Also, in 1985, Kenneth\r\nCardwell, a MassMutual employee without any responsibility for\r\nemployee benefits, had told Lemon that a severance payment offered\r\nto employees in other divisions would not be offered to his\r\ndivision.  \r\nPlaintiff Margaret Stevens alleges that in April 1992,\r\nshe was told by Pat Ogoley, a retirement counselor, that she [Ms.\r\nOgoley] did not know whether there would be any early retirement\r\nincentives.  At some other time, another retirement counselor,\r\nLois DeGray, indicated in response to an inquiry from Stevens that\r\nthere would not be any enhanced benefit package or \"golden\r\nhandshake.\"\r\nPlaintiff Sigmund Ziemba claims that in the spring of\r\n1992, he happened to see Robert Pouliot, a senior officer at the\r\ncompany, in a hallway.  Pouliot asked Ziemba how he was, and Ziemba\r\nresponded that he was considering retirement but was concerned, as\r\nhe understood that there might be a \"package.\"  Pouliot responded\r\nthat he did not know, but that that was not what he had heard.\r\nPlaintiff Raymond Faniel assumed that, as a forty-five\r\nyear employee, MassMutual would keep him abreast of any pending\r\nchanges in employee benefits.  In March 1992, Faniel spoke with \r\nPriscilla Dill who, in response to Faniel's statement that it\r\n\"doesn't look like there [will] be any changes,\" stated \"I don't\r\nknow, I don't think so, I haven't heard anything.\"  \r\nIn addition to these specific statements, each of the\r\nplaintiffs asserted that they were misled by Wheeler's statements,\r\nquoted in the February 12, 1992 MassMutual News, to the effect that\r\nthe Company was in good financial condition and there would be \"no\r\nchange\" in the Company's course.  \r\n                   II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nPlaintiffs brought suit in federal court, invoking ERISA\r\nand the district court's federal question jurisdiction.  The\r\nplaintiffs' original complaint contained two counts under ERISA for\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty and improper administration of an employee\r\nbenefit plan, as well as one count under Massachusetts common law\r\nalleging negligent and/or intentional misrepresentation.  In an\r\nopinion issued on July 27, 1994, the district court denied, in\r\npart, defendants' motion to dismiss with regard to the two ERISA\r\ncounts but allowed the motion with regard to the misrepresentation\r\nclaims on the ground that plaintiffs' common law misrepresentation\r\nclaims were preempted by ERISA.  See Rodowicz, 857 F. Supp. at 999. \r\n  In 1995 this court, in Belanger v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 71\r\nF.3d 451, clarified the circumstances under which benefits given to\r\nemployees would constitute a \"plan\" for purposes of ERISA.  The\r\ndistrict court ordered the parties to submit memoranda regarding\r\nthe applicability of Belanger, and, thereafter, concluded that the\r\nMassMutual VTP did not, in fact, constitute an employee benefit\r\n\"plan\" within the meaning of ERISA.  See Rodowicz v. Massachusetts\r\nMutual Life Ins. Co., 915 F. Supp. 486, 489-90 (D. Mass. 1996). \r\nHence the district court, sua sponte, dismissed plaintiffs' ERISA-\r\nbased claims.\r\nThe district court was then faced with a rather unusual\r\nsituation.  The effect of the court's ruling that the VTP was not\r\na \"plan\" subject to ERISA was to leave plaintiffs with no viable\r\nclaims to pursue, as the court had previously dismissed all of\r\nplaintiffs' state law claims on the basis of ERISA preemption.  As\r\nit seemed unfair to deprive plaintiffs of an opportunity to pursue\r\ntheir common law claims \"merely as an outcome of the rapidly-\r\nevolving nature of ERISA law,\" the district court reconsidered and\r\nvacated its July 27, 1994 ruling and reinstated plaintiffs' common\r\nlaw misrepresentation claims.  Id. at 491.  The district court also\r\nallowed plaintiffs to amend their complaint to assert additional\r\ncommon law claims for violation of the covenant of good faith and\r\nfair dealing, and both promissory and equitable estoppel.  The\r\ncourt retained jurisdiction over the common law claims \"as a matter\r\nof discretion.\"  Id.\r\nIn an opinion issued on April 24, 1998, the district\r\ncourt granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to all of\r\nplaintiffs' common law claims.  See Rodowicz, 3 F. Supp. 2d at\r\n1489.  The court based its decision primarily upon Vartanian v.\r\nMonsanto Company, 131 F.3d 264 (1st Cir. 1997), in which we held\r\nthat an employer has a fiduciary duty under ERISA to disclose\r\nchanges in retirement benefits at the point when \"serious\r\nconsideration\" of the change in benefits occurs.  See id. at 268. \r\nThe district court concluded that summary judgment was warranted as\r\nto all of plaintiffs' claims because plaintiffs could not\r\ndemonstrate that the VTP was under \"serious consideration\" by\r\nMassMutual until at least September 1992, by which time six of the\r\neight plaintiffs had already retired, and after which neither of\r\nthe two remaining plaintiffs made any inquiry regarding possible\r\nchanges in retirement benefits. \r\n                   III.  DISCUSSION       \r\nOn appeal, plaintiffs assert that the district court\r\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the\r\nstate common law claims.  In its cross-appeal, MassMutual asserts\r\nthat the district court erred in concluding that the VTP was not a\r\n\"plan\" governed by ERISA.  The Company argues that in the event we\r\ndetermine that reversal of the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment is warranted in any respect, plaintiffs should be\r\npermitted to proceed, if at all, only with regard to their ERISA-\r\nbased claims.  We will first address the issue raised by\r\nMassMutual's cross-appeal.  \r\nA.  Dismissal of the ERISA Claims\r\nThe district court dismissed plaintiffs' ERISA-based\r\nclaims on the ground that the MassMutual VTP was not an \"employee\r\nbenefit plan\" governed by ERISA.  Our standard of review to such a\r\nruling is deferential.  \"[A]s long as the trial court accurately\r\napplies the relevant legal standards, the existence vel non of an\r\nERISA plan is principally a question of fact, and the court of\r\nappeals must defer to the district court's judgment unless that\r\njudgment is clearly erroneous.\"  Belanger v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 71\r\nF.3d 451, 453 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\"The beacon by which we must steer\" to determine whether\r\nthe MassMutual VTP is a covered ERISA \"plan\" is the Supreme Court's\r\nopinion in Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1 (1987). \r\nId., 71 F.3d at 454.  In Fort Halifax, the Court stated that an\r\nemployee benefit package is such a \"plan\" only if its \"provision by\r\nnature requires an ongoing administrative program to meet the\r\nemployer's obligation.\"  Id. at 11.  See also District of Columbia\r\nv. Greater Wash. Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125, 130 n.2 (1992) (plan\r\nrequires \"some minimal, ongoing 'administrative' scheme or\r\npractice\").  In Fort Halifax, the Court found that a Maine statute\r\nrequiring employers to tender a one-time severance payment to\r\ndisplaced employees was not a \"plan\" because it called for no more\r\nthan a \"one-time, lump-sum payment triggered by a single event.\" \r\nId. at 12.  ERISA did not apply because the Maine statute created\r\nno \"need for an ongoing administrative program for processing\r\nclaims and paying benefits.\"  Id.  \r\nIn Fort Halifax, the Supreme Court emphasized that \r\nCongress had enacted  ERISA in order to (1) protect employees from\r\na \"patchwork scheme\" of employee benefit regulations, and (2)\r\nsafeguard the financial integrity of employee benefit funds over\r\nthe long term.  See id. at 12, 15-16.  Neither concern is\r\nimplicated by a one-time payment triggered by a single event.  By\r\ncontrast, ongoing investments and obligations may give rise to a\r\n\"patchwork scheme\" of benefit regulations that are vulnerable to\r\nemployer abuse, and thus implicate the purposes of ERISA.  See id.\r\nat 16.  \r\nFollowing Fort Halifax, this court has stated that \"the\r\nexistence of a plan turns on the nature and extent of an employer's\r\nbenefit obligations.\"  Belanger, 71 F.3d at 454.  See also Wickman\r\nv. Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co., 908 F.2d 1077, 1083 (1st Cir.) (the\r\n\"crucial factor in determining if a 'plan' has been established is\r\nwhether the [proffering of an employee benefit] constituted an\r\nexpressed intention by the employer to provide benefits on a\r\nregular and long term basis\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1013 (1990). \r\n\"[S]o long as a proffered benefit does not involve employer\r\nobligations materially beyond those reflected in Fort Halifax . .\r\n. the benefit will not amount to a plan under the ERISA statute.\" \r\nBelanger, 71 F.3d at 455.   \r\n  In Belanger, we held that a series of early retirement\r\noffers by which the defendant employer committed to give each\r\neligible employee a one-time, lump-sum severance bonus equal to a\r\nweek's salary for each year of employment with the company did not\r\nconstitute a \"plan\" for purposes of ERISA.  We stated that these\r\noffers were \"precisely the kind of one-time, lump-sum payment that\r\nthe Fort Halifax Court clearly excluded from the pantheon of ERISA\r\nplans.\"  Id. at 455.  By contrast, in Simas v. Quaker Fabric Corp.,\r\n6 F.3d 849 (1st Cir. 1993), we had held that the Massachusetts \"tin\r\nparachute\" statute, which authorized severance pay for employees\r\nwho lost their jobs within twenty-four months following a corporate\r\ntakeover, required an ongoing administrative scheme and was\r\ntherefore a \"plan\" for purposes of ERISA.  The \"tin parachute\"\r\nstatute was triggered separately for each employee by the\r\nemployee's individual termination within one of several alternative\r\ntime periods.  The statute also required the plan administrator to\r\ndetermine whether each employee was eligible for unemployment\r\ncompensation under Massachusetts law.  We described this as\r\n\"effectively a cross-reference to other requirements,\" most\r\nimportantly that the employee not have been discharged \"for cause\"\r\nwithin the meaning of state law.  See id. at 853.  We thought that \r\nindividualized determinations, which would have taken place over\r\nthe course of at least two years after the takeover, required\r\n\"ongoing administrative obligations . . . of a kind and over a time\r\nperiod, that go far enough beyond Fort Halifax to call the regime\r\na 'plan' within the meaning of ERISA.\"  Id.               \r\nApplying these precedents, the district court concluded\r\nthat the MassMutual VTP \"bears a striking resemblance to the\r\nindividual severance packages in Belanger.\"  Rodowicz, 915 F. Supp.\r\nat 489.  The district court reasoned that the one-time bonus\r\noffered for the two-month period in the VTP, like the offers made\r\nin Belanger, was available to virtually all full-time MassMutual\r\nemployees, required little in the way of administrative burden or\r\nexpense, and did not require that the Company make a long-term\r\nfinancial commitment to any employee who chose to participate in\r\nthe VTP.  See id.  The district court recognized that the VTP\r\nexpressly excluded employees who had been \"involuntarily\r\nterminated,\" calling for a determination that might be likened to\r\nthe \"for cause\" decision in Simas.  But based upon its\r\ninterpretation of the VTP documents, the district court thought\r\nthat the type of individualized determination required in Simas\r\nwould not be required under the VTP, as the administrator of the\r\nVTP was authorized in his discretion to exclude all employees who\r\nhad been terminated \"for any reason or no reason at all.\"  See id.\r\nat 490.  No careful assessment of \"cause\" would be required.\r\nFurther, unlike the plan in Simas, the district court reasoned that\r\nthe VTP did not require the administrator to make exclusion\r\ndeterminations over an extended period of time.  See id.  Finally,\r\nthe district court concluded that the Company's decision to defer\r\nthe election dates of some employees up to June 30, 1993 imposed no\r\nongoing administrative burdens or financial obligations on the\r\nCompany, but rather merely deferred the writing of a check until\r\nthat time.  See id. \r\nWe are unable to say that the district court's evaluation \r\nthat, on its particular facts, the MassMutual VTP did not\r\nconstitute an ERISA \"plan\" was \"clearly erroneous.\"  See Belanger,\r\n71 F.3d at 453.  True, the VTP authorized certain exclusions and\r\ndeferrals, as well as appeals by disappointed employees, making it\r\nsomewhat less mechanical and unthinking than the Maine statutory\r\nscheme in Fort Halifax and the one-time payment schemes in\r\nBelanger.  Yet, as the district court found, the VTP did not call\r\nfor the sort of ongoing, individualized determinations necessitated\r\nby the \"tin parachute\" statute addressed in Simas.  The question\r\nunder Fort Halifax, as we acknowledged in Simas, is a matter of\r\ndegree.  See Simas, 6 F.3d at 853.  \"[S]o long as Fort Halifax\r\nprescribes a definition based on the extent and complexity of\r\nadministrative obligations, line drawing of this kind is necessary\r\nand close cases will approach the line from both sides.\"  Simas, 6\r\nF.3d at 854.  The district court's conclusion that the VTP did not\r\ngo significantly beyond the employer obligations in Fort Halifax\r\nwas a supportable one.  See id. at  12 (no plan for purposes of\r\nERISA in absence of \"periodic demands on [employer] assets that\r\ncreate need for financial coordination and control\").  The court\r\nidentified the correct legal standard and supportably found that\r\nthe VTP fell closer to the factual situation in Belanger than in\r\nSimas.  We, therefore, hold that plaintiffs' ERISA-based claims\r\nwere properly dismissed by the district court on summary judgment.\r\nB.  The State Law Claims\r\nAfter the district court dismissed plaintiffs' ERISA-\r\nbased claims, it retained jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state\r\ncommon law claims and dismissed all of them on summary judgment. \r\nWe review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. \r\nSee Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104,\r\n108-09 (1st Cir. 1997). Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\r\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\r\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n56(c).  While we draw all inferences in the light most favorable to\r\nthe non-moving party, here the plaintiffs, \"[t]he mere existence of\r\na scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will\r\nbe insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could\r\nreasonably find for the plaintiff.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\r\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986). \r\nThe district court advanced alternative reasons for\r\nentering summary judgment in favor of MassMutual with regard to\r\nplaintiffs' common law claims.  Under Massachusetts law, a\r\nplaintiff in a misrepresentation action must prove a false\r\nstatement of material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act,\r\ntogether with reasonable reliance on the false statement to the\r\nplaintiff's detriment.  See Zimmerman v. Kent, 31 Mass. App. Ct.\r\n72, 77 (1991).  The district court concluded without explanation\r\nthat \"[t]he undisputed facts confirm that no employee of the\r\ndefendant, knowingly or unknowingly, conveyed a false statement of\r\nany kind, let alone one of material fact, to the plaintiffs to\r\ninduce them to act.\"  Rodowicz, 3 F. Supp.2d at 1487.  The court\r\nalso stated, again without elaboration, that it was \"a stretch\" to\r\ncharacterize any of the statements made to plaintiffs as\r\nrepresentations of fact at all.  See id. at 1488.    \r\nThe district court did not ultimately rest its grant of\r\nsummary judgment on principles of Massachusetts tort law, however. \r\n\"More importantly,\" the district court continued, \"absolutely no\r\nevidence supports plaintiff's position that a specific proposed\r\nbenefits package was in fact under 'serious consideration' before\r\nthe middle or end of September 1992 at the absolute earliest.\"  Id.\r\nat 1488.  The district court borrowed its \"serious consideration\"\r\ncriterion from Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 131 F.3d 264 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  There we held that an employer breaches its fiduciary duty\r\nunder ERISA when it misrepresents to its employees that no change\r\nin benefits is forthcoming when, in fact, the employer has such a\r\nchange under \"serious consideration.\"  See id. at 272.  We held\r\nthat \"serious consideration\" of a change in plan benefits exists\r\nwhen:  \"(1) a specific proposal which would affect a person in the\r\nposition of plaintiff (2) is being discussed for purposes of\r\nimplementation (3) by senior management with the authority to\r\nimplement that change.\"  Id.  The district court concluded that\r\nthese three factors did not coalesce here until, at the earliest,\r\nSeptember 30, 1992, when Pajak and Alfano made their presentation\r\nto the President's Cabinet.  As all but two of the plaintiffs had\r\nretired prior to that time, and as the two remaining employees made\r\nno inquiries regarding an enhanced retirement package after\r\nSeptember 17, 1992, the district court concluded that none of the\r\nplaintiffs had a viable misrepresentation claim.      \r\nPlaintiffs assail the district court's conclusion that\r\n\"although technically advanced under theories of [Massachusetts]\r\ncommon law,\" their state law claims are \"controlled by the body of\r\ndecisions governing  lawsuits under [ERISA].\"  Rodowicz, 3 F. Supp.\r\n2d at 1486.  They argue on appeal, as they did below, that the\r\ndistrict court should have applied Massachusetts common law to each\r\nof their claims.  Plaintiffs assert that an application of\r\nMassachusetts common law principles would lead to the conclusion\r\nthat there are triable issues of fact that preclude summary\r\njudgment as to each of their claims.  We agree with plaintiffs that\r\nMassachusetts common law provides the relevant yardstick.  Using\r\nthat yardstick, we believe it was error to grant summary judgment\r\nagainst three of the plaintiffs, although we affirm as to the\r\nothers.  \r\nThe \"serious consideration\" test is not a product of the\r\ncommon law, but rather was developed by federal courts in\r\nlitigation involving ERISA claims for breach of fiduciary duty.  In\r\nVartanian, this circuit adopted a mode of analysis utilized  by the\r\nThird Circuit in Fischer v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., 96 F.3d 1533\r\n(3d Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1247 (1997)(\"Fischer II\"). \r\nWe said we adopted the Fischer II approach because of the\r\n\"conflicting interests that ERISA seeks to reconcile.\"  Vartanian,\r\n131 F.3d at 271.  We pointed out that Congress had sought in ERISA\r\nto protect employee pensions and other benefits while not\r\ndiscouraging employers from offering such benefits in the first\r\nplace.  See id.  (\"Indeed, it is not implausible that imposing a\r\nthreshold lower than that of Fischer II would frustrate the very\r\npurposes for which a severance program typically is designed:  to\r\nreduce a workforce by voluntary means\").  We saw the \"serious\r\nconsideration\" test as \"delineat[ing] the point at which one form\r\nof reasonable employer behavior, namely the confidential\r\nconsideration of an employee severance proposal, is overbalanced by\r\nthe corresponding fiduciary duty imposed by ERISA.\"  Vartanian, 131\r\nF.3d at 268.  Under the test, only those changes in benefits that\r\nhave reached a level of \"serious consideration\" and are thus\r\n\"material\" to an employee's decision whether to retire must be\r\ndisclosed to employees.  See Fischer II, 96 F.3d at 1538 (equating\r\n\"materiality\" for purposes of ERISA fiduciary duty analysis with\r\n\"serious consideration\").  An employer retains its prerogative to\r\nconsider options confidentially in the normal course of business,\r\nand has a duty to disclose its plans, where necessary to prevent an\r\naffirmative representation from being misleading, only at a point\r\nwhen a specific benefit plan exists, its implementation is being\r\ndiscussed, and senior management are involved.  \r\nEven though it had earlier determined that the MassMutual\r\nVTP did not qualify as an ERISA \"plan,\" the district court applied\r\nthe Vartanian \"serious consideration\" test because it concluded\r\nthat Massachusetts and federal law do not differ with regard to the\r\nstandard for \"materiality.\"  Rodowicz, 3 F. Supp.2d at 1487.  We\r\nagree that the basic standard of \"materiality\" is the same under\r\nfederal and state law  \"whether 'a reasonable man would attach\r\nimportance [to the facts not disclosed] in determining his choice\r\nof action in the transaction in question,'\"  Zimmerman, 31 Mass.\r\nApp. Ct. at 78 (quoting Rogen v. Ilikon Corp., 361 F.2d 260, 266\r\n(1st Cir. 1966)) (bracketed material in original).  But  \"serious\r\nconsideration\" is a special gloss on the common law materiality\r\nstandard that has been developed by federal courts in ERISA breach\r\nof fiduciary duty cases expressly to serve the interests implicated\r\nby ERISA.  Because of those weighty interests, the \"serious\r\nconsideration\" test differs from the common law materiality\r\nstandard in various ways.  \r\nFor example, the \"serious consideration\" test may require\r\nmore of a plaintiff in terms of proof than does the common law\r\nmateriality standard.  Under Massachusetts law, a misstatement\r\nconcerning retirement benefits is \"material\" if it is more likely\r\nthan not that it would lead a reasonable employee to retire.  But\r\nby requiring a plaintiff to prove the existence of all three\r\nelements under the \"serious consideration\" standard, courts require\r\nthat there be a \"substantial likelihood\" that the employee would\r\nnot have retired had the statement not been made.  Compare Fischer\r\nv. Philadelphia Electric Co., 994 F.2d 130, 135 (3d Cir.) (defining\r\n\"materiality,\" for purposes of \"serious consideration test, as\r\n\"substantial likelihood\" that the misrepresentation would mislead\r\na reasonable employee), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1020 (1993)\r\n(\"Fischer I\") with Zimmerman, 31 Mass. App. Ct. at 78\r\n(\"materiality\" under Massachusetts law defined as whether\r\nreasonable man \"would attach importance [to the fact not\r\ndisclosed]\").    \r\nFurther, to satisfy the \"serious consideration\" test, a\r\nplaintiff must demonstrate that a misrepresentation concerns a\r\nspecific change in benefits that is actively under consideration by\r\npersons in senior management with the authority to implement the\r\nchange.  Then and only then can an employee be said to have\r\nreasonably relied upon a misstatement concerning changes in\r\nbenefits such that his or her claim may reach the jury.  See, e.g.,\r\nHockett v. Sun Company, Inc., 109 F.3d 1515, 1524 (10th Cir. 1997)\r\n(holding that misrepresentations concerning a severance plan did\r\nnot become material under \"serious consideration\" test until a\r\nmeeting was convened that \"gathered together the heads of all\r\ndepartments related to employee benefits\" to discuss a specific\r\nproposal).  By contrast, a trial court applying common law\r\nprinciples may withdraw a misrepresentation case from the jury only\r\nupon concluding that the fact misrepresented \"is so obviously\r\nunimportant that the jury could not reasonably find that a\r\nreasonable man would have been influenced by it.\").  Restatement\r\n(Second) of Torts  538(2)(a), comment e (emphasis supplied).  \r\nIn our view, a reasonable employee could \"attach\r\nimportance\" to and be influenced by misstatements that fail to meet\r\nthe strict requirements of the \"serious consideration\" test.  A\r\nstatement, for example, that no change in benefits is being\r\ncontemplated made at a time when several proposals urging such\r\nchanges are on the table but, as yet, senior management with the\r\nauthority to implement a change has not yet chosen a specific plan\r\nfor implementation cannot be said to be \"so obviously unimportant\r\nthat the jury could not reasonably find that a reasonable man would\r\nhave been influenced by it.\"  In such a case, the existence of the\r\nproposals and the attendant discussion might reasonably be expected\r\nto influence a decision with respect to retirement.         \r\nWe hold that it was error for the district court to apply\r\nthe \"serious consideration\" test to plaintiffs' state law claims. \r\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court may someday be persuaded\r\nto apply the \"serious consideration\" test in situations analogous\r\nto this, but it has not yet done so.  Until such time, the \r\nstandard for \"materiality\" is as set forth in Massachusetts case\r\nlaw and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  Cf.  Adams v. Coveney,\r\n162 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1998) (concluding that Massachusetts\r\ncourts would not necessarily adopt federal \"responsible person\"\r\nstandard in determining whether individual had duty to pay\r\nwithholding and meals taxes, and applying instead state common law\r\nstandard).  Applying that standard, we cannot say that all of the\r\nplaintiffs' claims fail on summary judgment.\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, plaintiffs had to demonstrate\r\nthat MassMutual (1) made false statements of material fact (2) to\r\ninduce them to retire when they did, and (3) that they reasonably\r\nrelied on those statements to their detriment.  Zimmerman, 31 Mass.\r\nApp. Ct. at 77.  If plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any one of\r\nthese elements, their misrepresentation claims must be dismissed. \r\nThe statements allegedly relied upon by plaintiffs must\r\nbe ones of fact, not of \"expectation, estimate, opinion, or\r\njudgment.\"  Id.  See also Powell v. Rasmussen, 355 Mass. 117, 118\r\n(1986).  \"A representation is one of opinion if it expresses only\r\n. . . the belief of the maker, without certainty, as to the\r\nexistence of the fact.\"  Restatement (Second) of Torts  538A\r\n(1977) (emphasis supplied).  See McEneaney v. Chestnut Hill Realty\r\nCorp., 38 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 574 (1995).  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court that it is too much of \"a stretch\" to characterize\r\nmany of the statements upon which plaintiffs rely as ones of fact. \r\nRodowicz, 3 F. Supp.2d at 1481.  \r\nThe statements allegedly made to plaintiffs Binsky, Buck,\r\nStevens, Ziemba, and Faniel \"fall[] within the ordinary rule that\r\nfalse statements of opinion, of conditions to exist in the future,\r\nor of matters promissory in nature\" are not actionable in a claim\r\nfor misrepresentation.  Yerid v. Mason, 341 Mass. 527, 530 (1960). \r\nThe statements made to these plaintiffs were cautionary in nature\r\nand represented nothing more than the opinion or belief of the\r\ndeclarant as to the prospect of future changes in retirement\r\nbenefits.  See id. at 530-31 (home seller's statements to the\r\neffect that buyers \"would have no further trouble with water\" in\r\ncellar were expressions of strong belief, not statements of fact). \r\nSome of the statements relied upon were no more than ordinary\r\nworkplace gossip, which is plainly not actionable.  Thus, to the\r\nextent that they are premised upon these statements, the\r\nmisrepresentation claims of plaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Stevens,\r\nZiemba, and Faniel were properly dismissed as they did not meet the\r\n\"statement of fact\" requirement under Massachusetts law.\r\nWe reach a similar conclusion insofar as plaintiffs'\r\nmisrepresentation claims are each based upon the statements made by\r\nPresident Wheeler during the \"state of the company\" speech, as \r\nreported in the MassMutual News.  As the district court stated:\r\n  Bromides in a company newsletter about\r\nMassMutual's good financial shape and the\r\nPresident's intention not to make any\r\nfundamental changes, cannot be construed as\r\naffirmative representations with regard to\r\nretirement benefits.  To hold otherwise would\r\ntransform any effort to comment generally on a\r\ncompany's performance into a minefield of\r\npotential liability. \r\n\nRodowicz, 3 F. Supp.2d at 1488.  We agree that the statements\r\nreported in the Company newsletter did not constitute\r\nrepresentations, much less material misrepresentations,  concerning\r\nthe Company's plan with regard to retirement benefits.  Thus, to\r\nthe extent that plaintiffs' claims are based upon statements in the\r\ncompany newsletter, they were properly dismissed. \r\nCertain of plaintiffs' misrepresentation claims fail for\r\nan additional reason.  Plaintiffs sued MassMutual based upon\r\nalleged material misrepresentations made by certain individual\r\nemployees concerning retirement benefits.  In Massachusetts, an\r\nemployer may be held liable for the tortious acts of an employee \r\nif the acts were committed within the scope of the employment.  See\r\nWorcester Ins. Co. v. Fells Acre Day School, Inc., 408 Mass. 393,\r\n404 (1990).  Conduct of an employee is within the scope of\r\nemployment if it is of the kind he is employed to perform.  Wang\r\nLaboratories, Inc. v. Business Incentives, Inc.,  398 Mass. 854,\r\n859 (1986).  In order for plaintiffs to hold MassMutual liable for\r\nthe alleged misrepresentations made by its employees, plaintiffs\r\nmust demonstrate that the declarant had actual or, at least,\r\napparent authority to speak on behalf of the company with respect\r\nto retirement benefits.  See, e.g., Hudson v. Mass. Property Ins.\r\nUnderwriting Ass'n, 386 Mass. 450, 457 (1982); see also Restatement\r\n(Second) of Agency  8 (1957).  \r\nThe record demonstrates that MassMutual retirement\r\ncounselors and Human Resources personnel were cloaked with actual\r\nor, at least, apparent authority to speak on behalf of the Company\r\nwith regard to retirement benefits.  Cf. Fischer I, 994 F.2d at 134\r\n(benefits counselors possessed apparent authority to provide\r\ninformation and guidance with regard to changes in employee\r\nbenefits).  However, Byron Mattson, Michael Walker, Linda Egan,\r\nKenneth Cardwell, and Robert Pouliot, upon whose statements certain\r\nplaintiffs claim to have relied, were neither retirement counselors\r\nnor Human Resources personnel, and therefore did not possess actual\r\nauthority to speak on behalf of the Company with regard to employee\r\nbenefits.  Further, there is no evidence in the record that any\r\nof these employees had apparent authority to answer questions on\r\nbehalf of the Company concerning changes in retirement benefits. \r\nTo the contrary, as plaintiff Faniel, for example, stated in his\r\ndeposition, employees were aware that retirement counselors were\r\nthe Company representatives \"that you were to go to if you had any\r\nquestions about retirement benefits.\"  With regard to employees\r\nMatson, Walker, Egan, Cardwell, and Pouliot, no evidence even\r\nsuggests \"conduct by the principal [that] . . . causes a third\r\nperson reasonably to believe that a particular person . . . has\r\n[such] authority.\"  Neilson v. Malcolm Kenneth Co., 303 Mass. 437,\r\n441 (1939).  Accordingly, the statements made by these employees\r\nto, respectively, plaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Lemon, and\r\nZiemba were not made on behalf of the Company and, for that reason,\r\nwere not actionable.\r\nWe also conclude, although again on somewhat different \r\ngrounds than those relied upon by the district court, that summary\r\njudgment was properly granted with regard to the equitable estoppel\r\nclaims brought by plaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Ziemba, and\r\nFaniel.  Under an equitable estoppel theory, plaintiffs must\r\ndemonstrate that they relied upon a misrepresentation of past or\r\npresent material facts.  See Boylston Development Group, Inc. v. 22\r\nBoylston Street Corp., 412 Mass. 531 (1992).  See also Restatement\r\n(Second) of Torts  872 (tort liability based upon equitable\r\nestoppel requires \"definite misrepresentation of fact\").  As\r\nstated, many of the alleged representations upon which plaintiffs\r\nclaim to have relied were mere statements of opinion or belief, not\r\ndefinite representations concerning past or present facts.  Still\r\nothers were made by employees without the requisite authority to\r\nbind the Company in the area of employee benefits.  Hence the\r\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment as to most of\r\nplaintiffs' equitable estoppel claims.\r\nThe preceding discussion disposes of the claims of\r\nplaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Ziemba, and Faniel.  However, we\r\nconclude that three of the eight named plaintiffs  Rodowicz,\r\nLemon, and Stevens  have viable misrepresentation and estoppel\r\nclaims under Massachusetts law.  Plaintiff Rodowicz alleges that in\r\nlate August or early September, 1992, Laura Cowles, an employee in\r\nMassMutual's Corporate Human Resources department, told him that\r\nthe Board of Directors had decided there would be no changes in the\r\nretirement package.  A jury could reasonably find that Cowles\r\npossessed the requisite authority to speak for the Company with\r\nregard to retirement benefits.  Further, under Massachusetts law,\r\nCowles's statement, if made, that the Board of Directors had\r\ndecided there would be no retirement package changes could be found\r\nto be an assertion of fact as to the Board's action.  It is not a\r\nstatement of mere opinion or belief.  Finally, again applying\r\nMassachusetts law, a jury could reasonably find that Cowles's\r\nstatement in September 1992 that the Board had decided there would\r\nbe no changes in retirement benefits was material and that Rodowicz\r\nreasonably relied upon it.  Thus, plaintiff Rodowicz is entitled to\r\npresent his misrepresentation and equitable estoppel claims to a\r\njury, although, as said supra, he cannot rely upon the statements\r\nmade by President Wheeler in the \"state of the company\" speech.  \r\nWe reach the same conclusion with regard to plaintiffs\r\nLemon and Stevens.  In the summer of 1992, Lemon was allegedly told\r\nby Jack Wilson, a Human Resources employee with responsibility for\r\nemployee benefits, that there would be no enhanced benefit package. \r\nPlaintiff Stevens was told by Lois DeGray, a retirement counselor,\r\nthat there would not be any enhanced benefit package or \"golden\r\nhandshake.\"  These are statements of fact as to which a reasonable\r\njury could find that Wilson and DeGray were authorized to bind the\r\nCompany.  A reasonable jury could also find that the statements\r\nwere material under the Massachusetts common law standard and that\r\nplaintiffs Lemon and Stevens reasonably relied upon the\r\nrepresentations.  Thus, like plaintiff Rodowicz, plaintiffs Lemon\r\nand Stevens are also entitled to present their state common law\r\nclaims to a jury.\r\nIn saying as we have at several places that the claims of\r\nthese three plaintiffs could be the basis for recovery in a jury\r\ntrial, we do not in any way mean to suggest that the plaintiffs\r\nwill or should necessarily prevail.  Issues of fact and assessment\r\nremain to be resolved and, in addition, the evidence at trial may\r\nvary from what we have assumed.  But we are required on summary\r\njudgment to view the issue from the standpoint of the party\r\nresisting summary judgment and while the case may be a close one\r\neven from that vantage, we think that the three plaintiffs in\r\nquestion have crossed the threshold and that their state claims\r\ncannot be resolved against them at this stage.\r\n                       IV.  CONCLUSION\r\nTo summarize, we affirm in part and reverse in part the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in favor of MassMutual. \r\nWe affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' ERISA\r\nclaims.  We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment \r\nin favor of MassMutual with regard to the Massachusetts common law\r\nclaims of plaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Ziemba, and Faniel, but\r\nreverse the grant of summary judgment with regard to the state law\r\nclaims of plaintiffs Rodowicz, Lemon, and Stevens.  The cause is\r\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\nSo ordered.  Each party to bear its own costs.          \r\n",

Michael Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Circuit Judge, \r\n\n        Aldrich and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   John C.

Cohen and Egan, Flanagan\r\nand Cohen, P.C. were on brief for defendants.\r\n\nSeptember 15, 1999\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Plaintiffs each retired\r\nfrom defendant Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company\r\n(\"MassMutual\" or \"the Company\") under terms that were less\r\nfavorable than those in a special offer made to employees soon\r\nafter.  They filed suit against MassMutual and the Massachusetts\r\nMutual Voluntary Termination Program (\"VTP\"), alleging that by\r\nfailing to reveal that a more favorable retirement option was\r\nforthcoming, MassMutual violated its fiduciary duties under the\r\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") (codified\r\nat 29 U.S.C.  1001 et seq.).  Plaintiffs also alleged \r\nmisrepresentation under Massachusetts common law.  The district\r\ncourt dismissed plaintiffs' ERISA claims on the ground that the\r\nseverance package offered by the Company did not constitute a\r\n\"plan\" for purposes of ERISA.  Exercising supplemental\r\njurisdiction, the court also granted summary judgment dismissing\r\nthe state law misrepresentation claims as well as later-added\r\nestoppel claims.  Plaintiffs appeal from the grant of summary\r\njudgment on their state law claims.  MassMutual cross-appeals from\r\nthe district court's ruling that the severance package is not a\r\n\"plan\" governed by ERISA.  The Company contends that should the\r\ncase be remanded to the district court, only plaintiffs' ERISA\r\nclaims will survive.  \r\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiffs' ERISA claims.  We also affirm,\r\nalthough on grounds somewhat different from those stated by the\r\ndistrict court, the dismissal of most of plaintiffs' state law\r\nclaims, but reverse and remand for trial the claims of three of the\r\neight plaintiffs.\r\n                          I.  FACTS \r\nThis case has followed a torturous path.  The underlying\r\nfacts and procedural history are set forth in two opinions below. \r\nSee Rodowicz v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008647\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008647/rodowicz-v-mass-mut-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins.\r\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568343\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568343/rodowicz-v-massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1481</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(D. Mass. 1998).  We summarize the facts\r\npertinent to the issues raised in the parties' appeals. \r\nIn 1990, MassMutual began to be concerned that senior\r\nexecutives were not leaving the company in sufficient numbers to\r\nmake room for the promotion of other executives.  To address this\r\nproblem, employees drafted a 1990 Voluntary Incentive Program\r\n(\"VIP\"), which was intended to induce more senior executives to\r\nretire.  The VIP was never adopted.  However, the VIP documents\r\nwere saved by the Company for possible use at a later date.  \r\nDuring the summer of 1991, for the first time in\r\nMassMutual's history, two ratings agencies lowered their ratings of\r\nMassMutual products.  The agencies were especially concerned that\r\nMassMutual was over-invested in real estate, creating the danger \r\nthat losses in that sector could impact negatively upon the\r\nCompany's value.  The agencies' downrating occurred at a time when\r\nboth the national economy and the insurance industry were\r\nexperiencing economic troubles.  \r\nMassMutual thereupon began to consider what measures it\r\ncould take to lower costs.  As employee salaries comprised the\r\nlargest single category of cost, at the end of 1991 senior\r\nexecutives at MassMutual looked into reducing staffing levels. \r\nAfter consideration, however, the Company decided against workforce\r\nreduction at the time.\r\nIn February 1992, Thomas Wheeler, MassMutual's Chief\r\nExecutive Officer, delivered an annual \"state of the company\"\r\nspeech to all employees.  The February 14, 1992 issue of the\r\ncompany newsletter, the MassMutual News, summarized Wheeler's\r\nremarks.  Wheeler stated, in essence, that MassMutual was in good\r\nfinancial condition.  He stated that while the ratings downgrade\r\nhad \"hurt our pride,\" there \"would be no change in how we do\r\nbusiness.\"  Wheeler went on to state: \"We are a company with\r\nintegrity.  We handle our business ethically and are better than\r\nour competitors.\"  During the speech, Wheeler made no reference to\r\nany reduction in the Company's workforce.  \r\nIn March 1992, John Pajak, MassMutual's Chief Operating\r\nOfficer, assigned to senior members of his management team the task\r\nof determining the costs and savings from a workforce reduction. \r\nIn connection with this assignment, Susan Alfano, Senior Vice\r\nPresident in Charge of Human Resources, gathered data from the\r\nCompany's outside employee benefits consultant.  Between March and\r\nSeptember, 1992, Alfano thoroughly analyzed the costs and benefits\r\nof a reduction in force.  \r\nOn September 17, 1992, Wheeler, Pajak, and other senior\r\nMassMutual executives met for the purpose of reviewing the\r\nCompany's five-year budget.  During the meeting, Wheeler and Pajak\r\ndiscussed MassMutual's wages and salaries paid, which, as said,\r\nwere the Company's largest operating expense.  Wheeler asked Pajak\r\nto develop some options for reducing  this expense.  Specifically,\r\nWheeler instructed Pajak to \"dust off\" the VIP that had been\r\ndeveloped in 1991.\r\nOn September 30, 1992, Pajak and Alfano made a\r\npresentation to the President's Cabinet, a formal MassMutual\r\ngoverning body that consisted of senior executives who reported\r\ndirectly to Wheeler.  Pajak and Alfano recommended that the Company\r\nconsider the possibility of a two-step reduction in force, in which\r\na voluntary termination program (\"VTP\") would be followed by \r\ninvoluntary layoffs, to be completed by early 1993.  Immediately\r\nfollowing this presentation, Pajak and Alfano were instructed to\r\ndevelop the details of such a program for further consideration.  \r\nIn early October, 1992, senior MassMutual employees began\r\ndeveloping the specifics of a workforce reduction program.  By\r\nOctober 12, 1992, the terms of the VTP were drafted, and the\r\nCompensation Committee of MassMutual's Board of Directors for the\r\nfirst time authorized Wheeler to adopt the plan at his discretion. \r\nOn October 19, 1992, Wheeler decided to adopt the VTP.  The Company\r\nannounced the adoption of the plan on October 23, 1992.  The terms\r\nof the VTP were not finally settled and the plan documents were not\r\nsigned until mid-November, 1992.\r\nThe VTP was open to most full-time MassMutual employees,\r\nabout 4,000 in number.  The plan provided for a one-time, lump sum\r\nseverance bonus equal to:  (1) three weeks of salary for every year\r\nof service, up to a maximum of 78 weeks, or (2) one week of salary\r\nfor each full $5,000 of compensation, and a proportionate amount\r\nfor an increment less than $5,000, up to a maximum of 52 weeks. \r\nThe Company set December 1, 1992 as the deadline for eligible\r\nemployees to elect to participate in the VTP.  At its discretion,\r\nhowever, the Company could defer an employee's election date beyond\r\nthe December 1 deadline, but in no case past June 30, 1993.  The\r\nVTP included a mechanism whereby employees to whom the Company\r\ndenied benefits could appeal from the denial.        \r\nOnly employees who retired on or after October 23, 1992\r\nand before January 2, 1993 were eligible to receive benefits under\r\nthe VTP.  Each of the named plaintiffs retired from MassMutual\r\nbetween August 1, 1992 and October 1, 1992.  All of the plaintiffs\r\nwould have received substantially higher retirement benefits if\r\nthey had waited to retire until after October 23, 1992.\r\nPlaintiffs each claim to have decided to retire after\r\nbeing lulled by misrepresentations made by Company personnel to the\r\neffect that no change in retirement benefits was planned.  The\r\nspecific allegations are set forth below.    \r\nPlaintiff Stanley Rodowicz claims that in late August or\r\nearly September 1992, Laura Cowles, an employee in Corporate Human\r\nResources, told him that the Board of Directors had decided that\r\nthere would be no change in the retirement package.  Plaintiff\r\nBarbara Binsky alleges that in or around May 1992, she asked Byron\r\nMattson, a Second Vice President, whether there was going to be any\r\ngolden parachute or early retirement incentive.  He answered\r\n\"absolutely not, there will be no golden handshake.\"  Later, Binsky\r\nasked a similar question of Priscilla Dill, a retirement counselor,\r\nwho replied:  \"I really don't think there will be anything.\"\r\nPlaintiff Anne Buck alleges that in July 1992, she was\r\ntold by Dill that \"I am not aware of anything coming down the\r\nroad,\" or, as far as Dill knew at that point in time there was\r\nnothing going on with retirement packages.  Sometime before May\r\n1992, Michael Walker, Buck's former boss, allegedly told her that \r\n\"anything can happen, but we have no definite plans [to adopt any\r\nenhanced benefits].\"\r\nPlaintiff Patricia Kennedy claims that in the spring of\r\n1992, she was present when her boss, Linda Egan, told people at a\r\ndepartment meeting that there would not be any severance program or\r\nearly retirement incentive program.  Plaintiff James Lemon claims\r\nthat in the summer of 1992, he attended a retirement meeting at\r\nwhich Jack Wilson, a supervisor in Human Resources, announced that\r\nthere would be no enhanced benefit package.  Also, in 1985, Kenneth\r\nCardwell, a MassMutual employee without any responsibility for\r\nemployee benefits, had told Lemon that a severance payment offered\r\nto employees in other divisions would not be offered to his\r\ndivision.  \r\nPlaintiff Margaret Stevens alleges that in April 1992,\r\nshe was told by Pat Ogoley, a retirement counselor, that she [Ms.\r\nOgoley] did not know whether there would be any early retirement\r\nincentives.  At some other time, another retirement counselor,\r\nLois DeGray, indicated in response to an inquiry from Stevens that\r\nthere would not be any enhanced benefit package or \"golden\r\nhandshake.\"\r\nPlaintiff Sigmund Ziemba claims that in the spring of\r\n1992, he happened to see Robert Pouliot, a senior officer at the\r\ncompany, in a hallway.  Pouliot asked Ziemba how he was, and Ziemba\r\nresponded that he was considering retirement but was concerned, as\r\nhe understood that there might be a \"package.\"  Pouliot responded\r\nthat he did not know, but that that was not what he had heard.\r\nPlaintiff Raymond Faniel assumed that, as a forty-five\r\nyear employee, MassMutual would keep him abreast of any pending\r\nchanges in employee benefits.  In March 1992, Faniel spoke with \r\nPriscilla Dill who, in response to Faniel's statement that it\r\n\"doesn't look like there [will] be any changes,\" stated \"I don't\r\nknow, I don't think so, I haven't heard anything.\"  \r\nIn addition to these specific statements, each of the\r\nplaintiffs asserted that they were misled by Wheeler's statements,\r\nquoted in the February 12, 1992 MassMutual News, to the effect that\r\nthe Company was in good financial condition and there would be \"no\r\nchange\" in the Company's course.  \r\n                   II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nPlaintiffs brought suit in federal court, invoking ERISA\r\nand the district court's federal question jurisdiction.  The\r\nplaintiffs' original complaint contained two counts under ERISA for\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty and improper administration of an employee\r\nbenefit plan, as well as one count under Massachusetts common law\r\nalleging negligent and/or intentional misrepresentation.  In an\r\nopinion issued on July 27, 1994, the district court denied, in\r\npart, defendants' motion to dismiss with regard to the two ERISA\r\ncounts but allowed the motion with regard to the misrepresentation\r\nclaims on the ground that plaintiffs' common law misrepresentation\r\nclaims were preempted by ERISA.

The\r\ndistrict court ordered the parties to submit memoranda regarding\r\nthe applicability of Belanger, and, thereafter, concluded that the\r\nMassMutual VTP did not, in fact, constitute an employee benefit\r\n\"plan\" within the meaning of ERISA.

The effect of the court's ruling that the VTP was not\r\na \"plan\" subject to ERISA was to leave plaintiffs with no viable\r\nclaims to pursue, as the court had previously dismissed all of\r\nplaintiffs' state law claims on the basis of ERISA preemption.  As\r\nit seemed unfair to deprive plaintiffs of an opportunity to pursue\r\ntheir common law claims \"merely as an outcome of the rapidly-\r\nevolving nature of ERISA law,\" the district court reconsidered and\r\nvacated its July 27, 1994 ruling and reinstated plaintiffs' common\r\nlaw misrepresentation claims.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1618347\"><a href=\"/opinion/1618347/rodowicz-v-massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 491. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> The district court also\r\nallowed plaintiffs to amend their complaint to assert additional\r\ncommon law claims for violation of the covenant of good faith and\r\nfair dealing, and both promissory and equitable estoppel.

DISCUSSION       \r\nOn appeal, plaintiffs assert that the district court\r\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the\r\nstate common law claims.  In its cross-appeal, MassMutual asserts\r\nthat the district court erred in concluding that the VTP was not a\r\n\"plan\" governed by ERISA.  The Company argues that in the event we\r\ndetermine that reversal of the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment is warranted in any respect, plaintiffs should be\r\npermitted to proceed, if at all, only with regard to their ERISA-\r\nbased claims.  We will first address the issue raised by\r\nMassMutual's cross-appeal.  \r\nA.  Dismissal of the ERISA Claims\r\nThe district court dismissed plaintiffs' ERISA-based\r\nclaims on the ground that the MassMutual VTP was not an \"employee\r\nbenefit plan\" governed by ERISA.  Our standard of review to such a\r\nruling is deferential.  \"[A]s long as the trial court accurately\r\napplies the relevant legal standards, the existence vel non of an\r\nERISA plan is principally a question of fact, and the court of\r\nappeals must defer to the district court's judgment unless that\r\njudgment is clearly erroneous.\"  Belanger v.

Because of those weighty interests, the \"serious\r\nconsideration\" test differs from the common law materiality\r\nstandard in various ways.  \r\nFor example, the \"serious consideration\" test may require\r\nmore of a plaintiff in terms of proof than does the common law\r\nmateriality standard.

A\r\nstatement, for example, that no change in benefits is being\r\ncontemplated made at a time when several proposals urging such\r\nchanges are on the table but, as yet, senior management with the\r\nauthority to implement a change has not yet chosen a specific plan\r\nfor implementation cannot be said to be \"so obviously unimportant\r\nthat the jury could not reasonably find that a reasonable man would\r\nhave been influenced by it.\"  In such a case, the existence of the\r\nproposals and the attendant discussion might reasonably be expected\r\nto influence a decision with respect to retirement.         \r\nWe hold that it was error for the district court to apply\r\nthe \"serious consideration\" test to plaintiffs' state law claims. \r\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court may someday be persuaded\r\nto apply the \"serious consideration\" test in situations analogous\r\nto this, but it has not yet done so.

Further, there is no evidence in the record that any\r\nof these employees had apparent authority to answer questions on\r\nbehalf of the Company concerning changes in retirement benefits. \r\nTo the contrary, as plaintiff Faniel, for example, stated in his\r\ndeposition, employees were aware that retirement counselors were\r\nthe Company representatives \"that you were to go to if you had any\r\nquestions about retirement benefits.\"  With regard to employees\r\nMatson, Walker, Egan, Cardwell, and Pouliot, no evidence even\r\nsuggests \"conduct by the principal [that] . . . causes a third\r\nperson reasonably to believe that a particular person . . . has\r\n[such] authority.\"  Neilson v. Malcolm Kenneth Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n441 (1939).  Accordingly, the statements made by these employees\r\nto, respectively, plaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Lemon, and\r\nZiemba were not made on behalf of the Company and, for that reason,\r\nwere not actionable.\r\nWe also conclude, although again on somewhat different \r\ngrounds than those relied upon by the district court, that summary\r\njudgment was properly granted with regard to the equitable estoppel\r\nclaims brought by plaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Ziemba, and\r\nFaniel.  Under an equitable estoppel theory, plaintiffs must\r\ndemonstrate that they relied upon a misrepresentation of past or\r\npresent material facts.  See Boylston Development Group, Inc. v. 22\r\nBoylston Street Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098142\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098142/boylston-development-group-v-22-boylston-st-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1992).  See also Restatement\r\n(Second) of Torts  872 (tort liability based upon equitable\r\nestoppel requires \"definite misrepresentation of fact\").  As\r\nstated, many of the alleged representations upon which plaintiffs\r\nclaim to have relied were mere statements of opinion or belief, not\r\ndefinite representations concerning past or present facts.  Still\r\nothers were made by employees without the requisite authority to\r\nbind the Company in the area of employee benefits.  Hence the\r\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment as to most of\r\nplaintiffs' equitable estoppel claims.\r\nThe preceding discussion disposes of the claims of\r\nplaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Ziemba, and Faniel.  However, we\r\nconclude that three of the eight named plaintiffs  Rodowicz,\r\nLemon, and Stevens  have viable misrepresentation and estoppel\r\nclaims under Massachusetts law.  Plaintiff Rodowicz alleges that in\r\nlate August or early September, 1992, Laura Cowles, an employee in\r\nMassMutual's Corporate Human Resources department, told him that\r\nthe Board of Directors had decided there would be no changes in the\r\nretirement package.  A jury could reasonably find that Cowles\r\npossessed the requisite authority to speak for the Company with\r\nregard to retirement benefits.  Further, under Massachusetts law,\r\nCowles's statement, if made, that the Board of Directors had\r\ndecided there would be no retirement package changes could be found\r\nto be an assertion of fact as to the Board's action.  It is not a\r\nstatement of mere opinion or belief.  Finally, again applying\r\nMassachusetts law, a jury could reasonably find that Cowles's\r\nstatement in September 1992 that the Board had decided there would\r\nbe no changes in retirement benefits was material and that Rodowicz\r\nreasonably relied upon it.  Thus, plaintiff Rodowicz is entitled to\r\npresent his misrepresentation and equitable estoppel claims to a\r\njury, although, as </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">said</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, he cannot rely upon the statements\r\nmade by President Wheeler in the \"state of the company\" speech.  \r\nWe reach the same conclusion with regard to plaintiffs\r\nLemon and Stevens.  In the summer of 1992, Lemon was allegedly told\r\nby Jack Wilson, a Human Resources employee with responsibility for\r\nemployee benefits, that there would be no enhanced benefit package. \r\nPlaintiff Stevens was told by Lois DeGray, a retirement counselor,\r\nthat there would not be any enhanced benefit package or \"golden\r\nhandshake.\"  These are statements of fact as to which a reasonable\r\njury could find that Wilson and DeGray were authorized to bind the\r\nCompany.  A reasonable jury could also find that the statements\r\nwere material under the Massachusetts common law standard and that\r\nplaintiffs Lemon and Stevens reasonably relied upon the\r\nrepresentations.  Thus, like plaintiff Rodowicz, plaintiffs Lemon\r\nand Stevens are also entitled to present their state common law\r\nclaims to a jury.\r\nIn saying as we have at several places that the claims of\r\nthese three plaintiffs could be the basis for recovery in a jury\r\ntrial, we do not in any way mean to suggest that the plaintiffs\r\nwill or should necessarily prevail.  Issues of fact and assessment\r\nremain to be resolved and, in addition, the evidence at trial may\r\nvary from what we have assumed.  But we are required on summary\r\njudgment to view the issue from the standpoint of the party\r\nresisting summary judgment and while the case may be a close one\r\neven from that vantage, we think that the three plaintiffs in\r\nquestion have crossed the threshold and that their state claims\r\ncannot be resolved against them at this stage.\r\n                       IV.  CONCLUSION\r\nTo summarize, we affirm in part and reverse in part the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in favor of MassMutual. \r\nWe affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' ERISA\r\nclaims.  We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment \r\nin favor of MassMutual with regard to the Massachusetts common law\r\nclaims of plaintiffs Binsky, Buck, Kennedy, Ziemba, and Faniel, but\r\nreverse the grant of summary judgment with regard to the state law\r\nclaims of plaintiffs Rodowicz, Lemon, and Stevens.  The cause is\r\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\nSo ordered.  Each party to bear its own costs.          \r\n</pre>",
