Concurrently with the entry of this\n\nCertification Order, the Court of Appeals has issued an\n\nOpinion in the pending litigation.   That Opinion describes the\n\nhistory and current posture of the litigation, sets out the\n\nviews of the Court of Appeals on certain questions of federal\n\nlaw which currently frame the litigation, and undertakes to\n\nexplain why an authoritative resolution by the Supreme Court\n\nof Rhode Island of certain questions of Rhode Island law may\n\nprove determinative.\n\n         Since the Opinion of the Court of Appeals goes into\n\ngreater detail, both as to historical fact and as to law, than\n\nthe Supreme Court of Rhode Island may find it useful to\n\npursue, the Court of Appeals has prepared a summary statement\n\nof (1) the facts giving rise to the pending litigation, (2)\n\nthe course taken by the litigation up to this time, and (3)\n\nthe questions of Rhode Island law on which the Court of\n\nAppeals seeks advice from the Supreme Court of Rhode Island:\n\n                              (1)\n\n         Eugene E. Wigginton served in the United States\n\fMarines    for three years, from 1967 to 1970, and was then\n\nhonorably discharged.    In 1979, he was commissioned as an\n\nofficer in the United States Army Reserve and, concomitantly,\n\nas an officer in the United States Army National Guard and the\n\nRhode Island Army National Guard (“RIANG”) with the rank of\n\nSecond Lieutenant, assigned to a RIANG Military Police unit.\n\nBy 1996, Eugene Wigginton had risen to the rank of Major, was\n\nserving as a RIANG Public Affairs Officer, and was performing\n\nthe duties of Education Officer for RIANG.\n\n\n\n    In January of 1996, as Major Wigginton was nearing\n\ncompletion of his twentieth year of aggregate (Marine and\n\nRIANG) military service, he was advised that, in May of 1996,\n\na Selective Retention Board would be convened pursuant to\n\nNational Guard Regulation    635-102 (“Personnel Separations\n\nOFFICERS AND WARRANT OFFICERS SELECTIVE RETENTION”).     The\n\nprincipal stated purpose of National Guard Regulation (“NGR”)\n\n635-102 is to “[e]nsur[e] that only the most capable officers\n\nare retained beyond 20 years of qualifying service for\n\nassignment to the comparatively few higher level command and\n\nstaff positions.” The Selective Retention Board considered ten\n\nRIANG commissioned and warrant officers at its May 13, 1996\n\nmeeting.    Major Wigginton was one of four who were recommended\n\ffor non-retention.     Pursuant to the Board’s recommendation,\n\nBrigadier General Reginald A. Centracchio, Adjutant General of\n\nRhode Island, wrote to Major Wigginton on May 14, advising him\n\nthat he was not to be retained and, accordingly, was to be\n\nseparated as of July 13, 1996.     In due course, Major Wigginton\n\nwas separated as of that date.\n\n\n\n                                (2)\n\n         In September of 1996, Major Wigginton initiated this\n\nlitigation.     Suit was brought in the Superior Court for\n\nProvidence County against General Centracchio and the State of\n\nRhode Island.     The complaint contained two counts, each of\n\nwhich alleged that the conduct complained of had “deprived\n\nplaintiff of his civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section\n\n1983.”\n\n         The first count alleged that Major Wigginton’s non-\n\nretention was “in violation of [R.I. Gen. Laws §] 30-3-13.”\n\nThat statutory provision, which has been part of the military\n\ncode governing RIANG since 1956, states, inter alia, that\n\n“[a]ll commissioned officers of the staff corps and\n\ndepartments, hereafter appointed, . . . shall hold their\n\npositions until they have reached the age of sixty (60) years,\n\nunless retired prior to that time by reason of resignation or\n\fdisability, or for cause to be determined by an efficiency\n\nboard or a court-martial legally convened for that purpose.”\n\nIt was further alleged that Major Wigginton had not been\n\nretired by reason of resignation, disability, or dismissal for\n\ncause.\n\n          The second count alleged that the “criteria set\n\nforth in [NGR] 635-102\" governing the retention/non-retention\n\ndecision “were not followed” in Major Wigginton’s case; this\n\nclaim has not been pursued before the Court of Appeals.     The\n\nsecond count also alleged that Major Wigginton had never “been\n\ninformed of the reasons why he was not selected for retention”\n\n- a failure characterized as “depriv[ing] the plaintiff of due\n\nprocess of law.”\n\n    On the basis of the federal questions presented in Major\n\nWigginton’s complaint, the suit was removed by General\n\nCentracchio   to the United States District Court for Rhode\n\nIsland.   After removal, General Centracchio moved to dismiss\n\non the ground that Major Wigginton’s suit – brought against a\n\nsuperior officer and arising out of matters incident to\n\nmilitary service – was non-justiciable. The motion was\n\nreferred to a Magistrate Judge, who recommended dismissal.\n\nBut the District Court – disagreeing with the Magistrate Judge\n\non the issue of justiciability – denied the motion to dismiss.\n\fHaving concluded that Major Wigginton’s suit was judicially\n\ncognizable, the District Court held a hearing and then\n\nauthorized discovery on the question whether, on the date\n\nMajor Wigginton was discharged from RIANG, he was an officer\n\nof the RIANG “staff corps and departments” within the meaning\n\nof R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 and, hence, within the protective\n\nambit of that statute insofar as it directs that such officers\n\n“shall hold their positions until they have reached the age of\n\nsixty (60) years.”   On the basis of the materials adduced by\n\nthe parties, the District Court found itself unable to\n\ndetermine the meaning of “staff corps and departments.”     The\n\nDistrict Court went on to rule that -- given that Major\n\nWigginton as plaintiff had the burden of proof and had not\n\nsucceeded in establishing that he had been an officer of\n\nwhatever grouping was comprehended by the statutory phrase\n\n“staff corps and departments” -- summary   judgment should be\n\nentered on the first count in favor of the defendants.     On the\n\nsecond count, which alleged a denial of due process in the\n\nfailure to inform Major Wigginton of the reasons for his non-\n\nretention, the District Court also granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendants.\n\n         From the District Court’s grant of summary judgment,\n\nMajor Wigginton appealed.\n\f           In the opinion filed concurrently with this\n\nCertification Order, the Court of Appeals has ruled as\n\nfollows:    First: The District Court had been correct in\n\ndetermining that Major Wigginton’s suit was justiciable.\n\nSecond:    The District Court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nin favor of defendants. The Court of Appeals determined that,\n\nin order to present viable federal claims of denial of due\n\nprocess of law under both the first count and the second count\n\nof his complaint, Major Wigginton was required to establish,\n\nas a predicate, an underlying property interest created by\n\nstate law of which he had been deprived.    In the context of\n\nthis litigation, that state-created property interest, if it\n\nexisted, had to be rooted in Major Wigginton’s claim, under\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, that he was, at the time of his\n\ndischarge from RIANG, an officer of the “staff corps and\n\ndepartments” within the meaning of the statute.    Until the\n\nphrase “staff corps and departments” was judicially construed,\n\nit could not be determined whether Major Wigginton did or did\n\nnot come within the protection of the statute.    The District\n\nCourt recognized the ambiguity of the statute but did not\n\nresolve that ambiguity.    Since the District Court did not\n\nassign any fixed meaning to the crucial statutory phrase,\n\nruling one way or another on summary judgment was premature.\n\f                               (3)\n\n    The Court of Appeals has examined R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-\n\n13, together with other provisions of the statutory code\n\ngoverning RIANG that contain the phrase “staff corps and\n\ndepartments.”    These statutory texts do not appear to convey a\n\nclear meaning.    No pertinent legislative history has come to\n\nthe attention of the Court of Appeals.    And there are no\n\nreported judicial decisions – either in the courts of Rhode\n\nIsland or elsewhere – construing      R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13\n\nor any cognate statutory provision.    Under these\n\ncircumstances, in lieu of uninformed conjecture by a federal\n\ncourt, the Court of Appeals is of the view that the proper\n\ncourse is to seek an authoritative construction of “staff\n\ncorps and departments” as used in R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13\n\nfrom the tribunal most qualified to render it – the Supreme\n\nCourt of Rhode Island. Hence, this Certification Order.\n\n    If the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines that\n\nMajor Wigginton was not, when discharged from RIANG, an\n\nofficer of the “staff corps and departments” within the\n\nmeaning R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, that ruling would be\n\ndispositive of the litigation, adversely to Major Wigginton.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\n\ndetermines that Major Wigginton, at the time of his discharge,\n\fwas an officer of the “staff corps and departments” within the\n\nmeaning of the statute, the Court of Appeals would wish advice\n\non the further question whether R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 is to\n\nbe taken to mean what its plain text connotes – namely, that\n\nMajor Wigginton, as an officer who has not been retired by\n\nresignation or disability, or for cause, is entitled to\n\ncontinue in his RIANG status until he is sixty years old – or\n\nwhether Rhode Island’s statutory and/or decisional law\n\ngoverning RIANG attaches any other contingency to Major\n\nWigginton’s continued status until age sixty as a RIANG\n\nofficer.   If the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines\n\nthat, by virtue of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, Major Wigginton\n\nwas uncontingently entitled to continued status until age\n\nsixty as a RIANG officer, that determination of Rhode Island\n\nlaw would appear to satisfy the requirement of federal law\n\nthat a person asserting a right not to be discharged from a\n\npublic position without being afforded procedural due process\n\nmust establish “an enforceable expectation of continued public\n\nemployment.”   Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 321, 345 (1976).\n\nAssuming that the answers of the Rhode Island Supreme Court to\n\nthe certified questions persuade the Court of Appeals that\n\nMajor Wigginton did, at the time he was discharged, enjoy an\n\n“enforceable expectation of continued public employment,” the\n\ffurther questions to be addressed by the federal courts in\n\nthis litigation would be (1) whether the procedures\n\nculminating in General Centracchio’s decision of non-retention\n\nwith respect to Major Wigginton satisfied due process, and/or\n\n(2) whether the failure to inform Major Wigginton of the\n\nreasons for his non-retention was compatible with due process.\n\n    In conformity with the foregoing discussion, the Court of\n\nAppeals requests that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island advise\n\nthe Court of Appeals of the answers to the following questions\n\nof Rhode Island law:\n\n          1. At the time Major Wigginton was discharged\n          from RIANG, was he an officer of the “staff\n          corps and departments” within the meaning of R.\n          I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13?\n\n\n          2. If the answer to Question 1 is “Yes”,\n          does that signify that, pursuant to R.I.\n          Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, Major Wigginton was\n          (in the absence of resignation, disability,\n          or dismissal for cause) therefore entitled\n          to continue as a RIANG officer until age\n          sixty, or would Rhode Island’s statutory\n          and/or decisional law attach any other\n          contingency to Major Wigginton’s continued\n          status as a RIANG officer?\n\n                                 By Order:\n\n\n______________________________\n                                 Phoebe Morse, Clerk\n                                 United States Court of\nAppeals\nEnter:\n\f______________________________\nJuan R.

Gen. Laws § 30-3-13\n\nfrom the tribunal most qualified to render it – the Supreme\n\nCourt of Rhode Island. Hence, this Certification Order.\n\n    If the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines that\n\nMajor Wigginton was not, when discharged from RIANG, an\n\nofficer of the “staff corps and departments” within the\n\nmeaning R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, that ruling would be\n\ndispositive of the litigation, adversely to Major Wigginton.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\n\ndetermines that Major Wigginton, at the time of his discharge,\n\fwas an officer of the “staff corps and departments” within the\n\nmeaning of the statute, the Court of Appeals would wish advice\n\non the further question whether R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 is to\n\nbe taken to mean what its plain text connotes – namely, that\n\nMajor Wigginton, as an officer who has not been retired by\n\nresignation or disability, or for cause, is entitled to\n\ncontinue in his RIANG status until he is sixty years old – or\n\nwhether Rhode Island’s statutory and/or decisional law\n\ngoverning RIANG attaches any other contingency to Major\n\nWigginton’s continued status until age sixty as a RIANG\n\nofficer.   If the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines\n\nthat, by virtue of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, Major Wigginton\n\nwas uncontingently entitled to continued status until age\n\nsixty as a RIANG officer, that determination of Rhode Island\n\nlaw would appear to satisfy the requirement of federal law\n\nthat a person asserting a right not to be discharged from a\n\npublic position without being afforded procedural due process\n\nmust establish “an enforceable expectation of continued public\n\nemployment.”   Bishop v. Wood, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345 (1976).\n\nAssuming that the answers of the Rhode Island Supreme Court to\n\nthe certified questions persuade the Court of Appeals that\n\nMajor Wigginton did, at the time he was discharged, enjoy an\n\n“enforceable expectation of continued public employment,” the\n\ffurther questions to be addressed by the federal courts in\n\nthis litigation would be (1) whether the procedures\n\nculminating in General Centracchio’s decision of non-retention\n\nwith respect to Major Wigginton satisfied due process, and/or\n\n(2) whether the failure to inform Major Wigginton of the\n\nreasons for his non-retention was compatible with due process.\n\n    In conformity with the foregoing discussion, the Court of\n\nAppeals requests that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island advise\n\nthe Court of Appeals of the answers to the following questions\n\nof Rhode Island law:\n\n          1. At the time Major Wigginton was discharged\n          from RIANG, was he an officer of the “staff\n          corps and departments” within the meaning of R.\n          I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13?\n\n\n          2. If the answer to Question 1 is “Yes”,\n          does that signify that, pursuant to R.I.\n          Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, Major Wigginton was\n          (in the absence of resignation, disability,\n          or dismissal for cause) therefore entitled\n          to continue as a RIANG officer until age\n          sixty, or would Rhode Island’s statutory\n          and/or decisional law attach any other\n          contingency to Major Wigginton’s continued\n          status as a RIANG officer?\n\n                                 By Order:\n\n\n______________________________\n                                 Phoebe Morse, Clerk\n                                 United States Court of\nAppeals\nEnter:\n\f______________________________\nJuan R.
