Appellant     Joanne     I.    Connolly\n\n(“Connolly”)     challenges       the   lower   court’s     refusal      on\n\njurisdictional     grounds        to    entertain    her   motion       for\n\nreconsideration.    We find the district court erred.             Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 59(e) allows the district court to\n\nreconsider a judgment if the losing party files a motion\n\nwithin ten days of judgment, and Connolly’s motion was\n\ntimely.    Thus,    the    judgment      will   be   vacated     to   allow\n\nreconsideration of the dismissal order.\n\n           Appellee William J. Henderson (“Henderson”) argues\n\nthat judgment was appropriate anyway because Connolly’s\n\nclaim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nBut in her opposition to Henderson’s motion to dismiss,\n\nConnolly   presented      facts    which    arguably     might    justify\n\nequitable tolling of the limitations period, see, e.g.,\n\nCantrell v. Knoxville Community Dev. Corp., 60 F.3d 1177 (6th\n\nCir. 1995); Doherty v. Teamsters Pension Trust Fund, 16 F.3d\n\n1386 (3d Cir. 1994), although we have also stressed that the\n\nequitable tolling exception is a narrow one,                   see, e.g.,\n\nNunnally v. MacCausland, 996 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993), and\n\nwe take no position on her claim at this time.                  Henderson\n\nfails to mention or address these facts.\n\f         Finally, though Connolly filed her opposition late\n\nin violation of D. Mass. Local Rule 7.1(B)(2), we will leave\n\nit to the district court to decide what, if any, sanction is\n\nappropriate for this noncompliance.\n\n         The judgment of the lower court is vacated; the\n\nmatter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                             -3-\n\f",
