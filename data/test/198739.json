Wilcox, in their capacity as Selectmen of\r\nthe Town of Alford.\r\n\nDecember 14, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This appeal, limited to the\r\nnarrow question of counsel fees, has its roots in events long ago. \r\nIn 1953, four Massachusetts towns in the Southern Berkshire area of\r\nthe state formed a regional school district, and in 1954, a fifth\r\ntown joined.  The five towns are Sheffield, Monterey, Egremont, New\r\nMarlborough and Alford.  The district, empowered to govern public\r\nschools within the region, was formed pursuant to state law, see\r\n1951 Mass Acts c. 638, and was approved by the voters in each town.\r\nAt all times, the district has been governed by a ten\r\nmember committee with a fixed apportionment of seats among the\r\ntowns.  Sheffield has four seats, Egremont and New Marlborough have\r\ntwo each, and Alford and Monterey have one each.  Every committee\r\nmember's vote is equally weighted, so Sheffield has 40 percent of\r\nthe voting power, even though its population has at times\r\nrepresented close to half of the district's total population.  From\r\n1954 until very recently, each town's members on the committee were\r\nchosen by popular vote of the residents of that town.   \r\nIn 1986, this court upheld a challenge to another,\r\nsimilarly structured Massachusetts school district based on the\r\nSupreme Court's one person, one vote jurisprudence.  See Kelleher\r\nv. Southeastern Reg'l Vocational Technical High Sch. Dist., 806\r\nF.2d 9, 10-13 (1st Cir. 1986).  The court held that the\r\nsubstantial discrepancy in voter power as among the respective\r\ntowns was unlawful but could be cured in various ways, including\r\nresort to district-wide, at-large elections; weighting committee\r\nmember votes according to the population that they represent;\r\nkeying the number of locally elected members from each town to\r\npopulation; or eliminating direct popular elections and having\r\nlocal officials from each town appoint district members.  See id.\r\nat 13 n.17.\r\nA few months later, state officials advised all districts\r\nof the Kelleher decision and urged them to examine their own\r\nsituations; even if popularly elected, a district's governance\r\nstructure might or might not conform, depending on the deviation\r\nbetween each town's population and the voting power of its own\r\nmembers on the district committee.  For whatever reason, the\r\nSouthern Berkshire district involved in our case did nothing to\r\nalter its structure.  Then, in 1993, it solicited an opinion from\r\nstate officials and was told that its own district failed to comply\r\nwith Kelleher.  A subcommittee, consisting of representatives from\r\nall five towns, was set up to consider reforms.\r\nFor the next three years, the subcommittee considered\r\nvarious schemes but failed to reach an agreement.  Sheffield wanted\r\na plan that would retain local election of committee members but\r\nthat would increase Sheffield's voting power on the district\r\ncommittee to conform to Sheffield's population share.  The other\r\ntowns preferred either district wide, at-large voting (which would\r\nincrease Sheffield's power) or the appointment of the district\r\ncommittee members by elected bodies in each town (which would moot\r\nthe equal protection issue)--both solutions that Sheffield opposed.\r\nDissatisfied with the status quo, the Town of Sheffield\r\nand a group of its residents (including members of the town's board\r\nof selectmen) brought the present suit in 1996 against the district\r\nand the other four towns.  The suit, brought in federal district\r\ncourt under 42 U.S.C.  1983, sought a declaration that the present\r\nscheme was unconstitutional and injunctive relief to prevent new\r\nelections under the present regime and to require a new court-\r\napproved structure for elections.  The complaint also sought\r\nattorney's fees for the plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C.  1988.\r\nSheffield quickly moved for and received partial summary\r\njudgment from the district court declaring the existing scheme\r\nunconstitutional.  The defendants did not dispute that the scheme\r\nwas unconstitutional but questioned the need for a declaration\r\nsince the parties had been working on that assumption in seeking to\r\nnegotiate a solution.  Just before this ruling, Egremont proposed\r\na compromise--that the present committee structure be retained but\r\nthat the legal infirmity be remedied by having a local elected\r\nentity in each town select the town's committee members in place of\r\npopular elections.  Sheffield rejected the proposal.\r\nIn early 1998, the parties reached agreement without\r\nfurther litigation, and the district court approved the settlement. \r\nThe final scheme was that earlier urged by Egremont--retaining the\r\npresent committee structure and allocation of voting power but\r\neliminating direct popular election of the committee--with one\r\nvariation:  Egremont had initially proposed that local popularly\r\nelected school boards select the committee members, while the final\r\nscheme let the local board of selectmen choose the committee\r\nmembers for the town.  Thus Sheffield retained its original four\r\nseats and 40 percent of the voting power on the committee, but its\r\nmembers were now chosen without popular election.\r\nSome might think this an odd triumph for equal\r\nprotection, possibly raising a doubt or two about the Supreme Court\r\njurisprudence underpinning our decision in Kelleher, cf. id. at 13\r\n(Campbell, C.J., concurring), but that is not our concern.  Rather,\r\nthe present appeal grows out of the plaintiffs' post-settlement\r\nrequest for attorney's fees under section 1988.  The district court\r\ndenied that request on the ground that Sheffield was not a\r\n\"prevailing party,\" an explicit condition of such an award under\r\nthe statute.  See 42 U.S.C.  1988(b) (\"[T]he court, in its\r\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable\r\nattorney's fee as part of the costs . . . .\").  It is this ruling\r\nthat Sheffield now seeks to overturn.\r\nThe usual \"American rule\" is that parties bear their own\r\ncounsel fees, see Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y,\r\n421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975), but Congress may provide otherwise. \r\nCongress has sometimes directed that a prevailing plaintiff \"shall\"\r\nrecover a reasonable attorney's fee, e.g., 15 U.S.C.  15(a)\r\n(antitrust cases); by contrast, in section 1983 actions, Congress\r\nhas said that the court \"may\" make such an award to a prevailing\r\nparty \"in its discretion.\"  But the Supreme Court has read \"may\" to\r\nmean \"must,\" save for rare cases in which \"special circumstances\"\r\nwould render an award unjust.  Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87,\r\n89 n.1 (1989); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).\r\nPerhaps in compensation, the Supreme Court has construed\r\nthe term \"prevailing party\" in a more flexible fashion.  For\r\nexample, it has said that \"a technical victory may be so\r\ninsignificant . . . as to be insufficient to support prevailing\r\nparty status.\"  Texas State Teacher's Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch.\r\nDist., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989).  More recently, it ruled that a\r\nplaintiff who wins only nominal damages can \"prevail\" yet be\r\nentitled to no fee at all.  Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 113-15\r\n(1992).  And it has described the concept of \"prevailing party\" in\r\nphrases so general as to leave a good deal of latitude.  E.g., id.\r\nat 111-12 (\"[A] plaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the\r\nmerits of his claim  materially alters the legal relationship\r\nbetween the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way\r\nthat directly benefits the plaintiff.\").\r\nWe have taken the Supreme Court's cases to mean that,\r\nabsent unusual circumstances, the plaintiff is to be awarded\r\nattorney's fees in cases under section 1983 where it wins\r\nsignificant practical relief favorable to its position.  E.g.,\r\nPearson v. Fair, 980 F.2d 37, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1992).  Our cases\r\nhave also recognized that a plaintiff may achieve such ends through\r\nlitigation, and deserve attorney's fees, even without a formal\r\nvictory; for example, the so-called \"catalyst\" theory might justify\r\nan award where the defendant abandoned an unlawful practice after\r\nthe case was brought, as a direct result of the lawsuit, but\r\nwithout the need for a decree.  See id. at 43-45.  Again, the\r\ninquiry is a practical one.\r\nBecause the test of \"prevailing party\" is both general\r\nand practical, we have relied heavily on the informed judgment of\r\nthe district courts in applying it to the widely varying facts that\r\nare presented.  So long as the legal rules are properly understood,\r\na district court's application of them to individual circumstances\r\nis normally upheld, if there is no abuse of discretion.  See Paris\r\nv. HUD, 988 F.2d 236, 238-39 (1st Cir. 1993); McDonald v. HHS, 884\r\nF.2d 1468, 1473-74 (1st Cir. 1989).  This is one of many instances\r\nin which reasonableness is the touchstone, reflecting the trial\r\ncourt's greater familiarity with the details of the case and the\r\nabsence of any special need for de novo review.\r\nAgainst this background, we readily sustain the district\r\ncourt's denial of attorney's fees.  Far from obtaining their basic\r\nobjective in this case--increased power on the committee--the\r\nSheffield plaintiffs got exactly the opposite solution:  their\r\nvotes on the committee remain four out of ten or 40 percent of the\r\nwhole.  True, popular election of members is gone; but this can\r\nhardly be described as a victory \"for\" Sheffield since its own\r\nearlier demand had been to retain popular election (while\r\nincreasing Sheffield's share of the voting power on the committee).\r\nSheffield describes its law suit as a \"catalyst\" for the\r\nchange that occurred.  Cf. Pearson, 980 F.2d at 43.  Whether this\r\nis so in fact could fairly be debated since Sheffield was offered\r\npretty much the same outcome soon after the lawsuit was commenced,\r\nnamely, the present committee structure and apportionment of votes\r\nbut a switch from popular election to appointment of committee\r\nmembers.  Sheffield says that the earlier proposal would have had\r\nelected school boards appoint the committee members and it wanted\r\nat least to ensure the power of its selectmen to choose them; but\r\nthis choice has nothing to do with protecting the one person, one\r\nvote principle for voters.\r\nIn all events, the decisive question is not whether\r\nSheffield's lawsuit was a catalyst but whether it was a catalyst\r\nfor an outcome favorable to Sheffield.  Under the catalyst theory--\r\nitself simply a practical test for discerning victory--a plaintiff\r\nmay achieve its victory in a lawsuit even if there is no award or\r\ninjunction, so long as the lawsuit effectively achieved a favorable\r\nresult sought by the plaintiff.  See Pearson, 980 F.2d at 43-45. \r\nThe problem here is that, by any realistic measure, the result\r\nachieved was not that sought by Sheffield.\r\nNor does it help Sheffield's claim to point to the\r\ninterim declaratory ruling by the district court that the\r\npreexisting scheme violated the one person, one vote principle.  No\r\none in the litigation appears seriously to have doubted that the\r\nexisting regime had to be changed; indeed, the parties had been\r\nnegotiating on this premise well before the lawsuit began.  In a\r\nnumber of voting rights cases, the courts have declined to award\r\nattorney's fees where efforts to amend the unlawful scheme began\r\nprior to the filing of suit by the plaintiff.  A party is not\r\nentitled to attorney's fees when he obtains relief through\r\nlitigation that he would have obtained anyway in the absence of\r\nbringing a lawsuit.  See New Hampshire v. Adams, 159 F.3d 680, 687\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIn any event, even if the declaratory ruling sped up the\r\nnegotiations, which may or may not be so, the question remains\r\nwhether the Sheffield plaintiffs ultimately prevailed in obtaining\r\nrelief in their favor, which they did not.  As for town voters\r\nthroughout the district, the main outcome of the case is that they\r\nno longer have any direct vote for committee members.  This is\r\nhardly a compelling case for awarding attorney's fees to a\r\nplaintiff.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Under the catalyst theory--itself simply a practical test for discerning victory--a plaintiff may achieve its victory in a lawsuit even if there is no award or injunction, so long as the lawsuit effectively achieved a favorable result sought by the plaintiff.

In 1953, four Massachusetts towns in the Southern Berkshire area of the state formed a regional school district, and in 1954, a fifth town joined. The five towns are Sheffield, Monterey, Egremont, New Marlborough and Alford. The district, empowered to govern public schools within the region, was formed pursuant to state law, see 1951 Mass Acts c. 638, and was approved by the voters in each town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At all times, the district has been governed by a ten member committee with a fixed apportionment of seats among the towns. Sheffield has four seats, Egremont and New Marlborough have two each, and Alford and Monterey have one each. Every committee member's vote is equally weighted, so Sheffield has 40 percent of the voting power, even though its population has at times represented close to half of the district's total population. From 1954 until very recently, each town's members on the committee were chosen by popular vote of the residents of that town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, this court upheld a challenge to another, similarly structured Massachusetts school district based on the Supreme Court's one person, one vote jurisprudence. See Kelleher v. Southeastern Reg'l Vocational Technical High Sch. Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479864\"><a href=\"/opinion/479864/gerald-p-kelleher-v-southeastern-regional-vocational-technical-high/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 10-13 (1st Cir. 1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court held that the substantial discrepancy in voter power as among the respective towns was unlawful but could be cured in various ways, including resort to district-wide, at-large elections; weighting committee member votes according to the population that they represent; keying the number of locally elected members from each town to population; or eliminating direct popular elections and having local officials from each town appoint district members. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479864\"><a href=\"/opinion/479864/gerald-p-kelleher-v-southeastern-regional-vocational-technical-high/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 13 </a></span>n.17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few months later, state officials advised all districts of the Kelleher decision and urged them to examine their own situations; even if popularly elected, a district's governance structure might or might not conform, depending on the deviation between each town's population and the voting power of its own members on the district committee. For whatever reason, the Southern Berkshire district involved in our case did nothing to alter its structure. Then, in 1993, it solicited an opinion from state officials and was told that its own district failed to comply with Kelleher. A subcommittee, consisting of representatives from all five towns, was set up to consider reforms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the next three years, the subcommittee considered various schemes but failed to reach an agreement. Sheffield wanted a plan that would retain local election of committee members but that would increase Sheffield's voting power on the district committee to conform to Sheffield's population share. The other towns preferred either district wide, at-large voting (which would increase Sheffield's power) or the appointment of the district committee members by elected bodies in each town (which would moot the equal protection issue)--both solutions that Sheffield opposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dissatisfied with the status quo, the Town of Sheffield and a group of its residents (including members of the town's board of selectmen) brought the present suit in 1996 against the district and the other four towns. The suit, brought in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, sought a declaration that the present scheme was unconstitutional and injunctive relief to prevent new elections under the present regime and to require a new court-approved structure for elections. The complaint also sought attorney's fees for the plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheffield quickly moved for and received partial summary judgment from the district court declaring the existing scheme unconstitutional. The defendants did not dispute that the scheme was unconstitutional but questioned the need for a declaration since the parties had been working on that assumption in seeking to negotiate a solution. Just before this ruling, Egremont proposed a compromise--that the present committee structure be retained but that the legal infirmity be remedied by having a local elected entity in each town select the town's committee members in place of popular elections. Sheffield rejected the proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1998, the parties reached agreement without further litigation, and the district court approved the settlement. The final scheme was that earlier urged by Egremont--retaining the present committee structure and allocation of voting power but eliminating direct popular election of the committee--with one variation: Egremont had initially proposed that local popularly elected school boards select the committee members, while the final scheme let the local board of selectmen choose the committee members for the town. Thus Sheffield retained its original four seats and 40 percent of the voting power on the committee, but its members were now chosen without popular election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some might think this an odd triumph for equal protection, possibly raising a doubt or two about the Supreme Court jurisprudence underpinning our decision in Kelleher, cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479864\"><a href=\"/opinion/479864/gerald-p-kelleher-v-southeastern-regional-vocational-technical-high/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 13 </a></span>(Campbell, C.J., concurring), but that is not our concern. Rather, the present appeal grows out of the plaintiffs' post-settlement request for attorney's fees under section 1988. The district court denied that request on the ground that Sheffield was not a \"prevailing party,\" an explicit condition of such an award under the statute. See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988(b) (\"[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs . . . .\"). It is this ruling that Sheffield now seeks to overturn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The usual \"American rule\" is that parties bear their own counsel fees, see Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109246\"><a href=\"/opinion/109246/alyeska-pipeline-service-co-v-wilderness-society/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 247 (1975), but Congress may provide otherwise. Congress has sometimes directed that a prevailing plaintiff \"shall\" recover a reasonable attorney's fee, e.g., 15 U.S.C. &#167; 15(a) (antitrust cases); by contrast, in section 1983 actions, Congress has said that the court \"may\" make such an award to a prevailing party \"in its discretion.\" But the Supreme Court has read \"may\" to mean \"must,\" save for rare cases in which \"special circumstances\" would render an award unjust. Blanchard v. Bergeron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112196\"><a href=\"/opinion/112196/blanchard-v-bergeron/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 89 n.1 (1989); Hensley v.

For example, it has said that \"a technical victory may be so insignificant . . . as to be insufficient to support prevailing party status.\" Texas State Teacher's Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112225\"><a href=\"/opinion/112225/texas-teachers-assn-v-garland-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span>, 792 (1989). More recently, it ruled that a plaintiff who wins only nominal damages can \"prevail\" yet be entitled to no fee at all. Farrar v. Hobby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 113-15 (1992). And it has described the concept of \"prevailing party\" in phrases so general as to leave a good deal of latitude. E.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 111-12 </a></span>(\"[A] plaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have taken the Supreme Court's cases to mean that, absent unusual circumstances, the plaintiff is to be awarded attorney's fees in cases under section 1983 where it wins significant practical relief favorable to its position. E.g., Pearson v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595484\"><a href=\"/opinion/595484/donald-pearson-v-michael-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1992). Our cases have also recognized that a plaintiff may achieve such ends through litigation, and deserve attorney's fees, even without a formal victory; for example, the so-called \"catalyst\" theory might justify an award where the defendant abandoned an unlawful practice after the case was brought, as a direct result of the lawsuit, but without the need for a decree. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595484\"><a href=\"/opinion/595484/donald-pearson-v-michael-fair/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 43-45.</a></span><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Again, the inquiry is a practical one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the test of \"prevailing party\" is both general and practical, we have relied heavily on the informed judgment of the district courts in applying it to the widely varying facts that are presented. So long as the legal rules are properly understood, a district court's application of them to individual circumstances is normally upheld, if there is no abuse of discretion. See Paris v. HUD, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602342\"><a href=\"/opinion/602342/antonia-paris-v-us-department-of-housing-and-urban-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 238-39 (1st Cir. 1993); McDonald v. HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529274\"><a href=\"/opinion/529274/27-socsecrepser-18-unemplinsrep-cch-14888a-claire-mcdonald-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1468</span></a></span>, 1473-74 (1st Cir. 1989). This is one of many instances in which reasonableness is the touchstone, reflecting the trial court's greater familiarity with the details of the case and the absence of any special need for de novo review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we readily sustain the district court's denial of attorney's fees. Far from obtaining their basic objective in this case--increased power on the committee--the Sheffield plaintiffs got exactly the opposite solution: their votes on the committee remain four out of ten or 40 percent of the whole. True, popular election of members is gone; but this can hardly be described as a victory \"for\" Sheffield since its own earlier demand had been to retain popular election (while increasing Sheffield's share of the voting power on the committee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheffield describes its law suit as a \"catalyst\" for the change that occurred.
