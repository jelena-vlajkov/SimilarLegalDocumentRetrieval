Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     John Ward-Llambias, by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Jacabed Rodriguez-Coss, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E.\nVega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 17, 2000\n\f\f                 SELYA, Circuit Judge.          On April 10, 1997, a federal\n\ngrand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned a\n\nthree-count indictment against a number of individuals.                           In\n\nCount      2   of    the   indictment,    the    grand    jury   charged    several\n\npersons, including Walter Merced-Nieves, with conspiring to\n\ndistribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.       In Count 3 of the same indictment, the grand jury charged\n\nsome of the same individuals, including Merced-Nieves, with\n\nusing      and      carrying   firearms    during   and    in    relation   to   the\n\ncommission of a drug-trafficking offense.                        See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1).           Following a five-week trial, a petit jury found\n\nMerced-Nieves guilty as charged.                The district court thereafter\n\nsentenced him to a term of life imprisonment on the conspiracy\n\ncharge and, ironically, to a consecutive five-year prison term\n\non   the       firearms     charge.       Merced-Nieves     appeals. 1       Having\n\ncarefully reviewed the record, we affirm.\n\n                 The appellant's basic argument entails a challenge to\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence.                    This challenge invokes a\n\nfamiliar standard of review:              when evaluating the sufficiency of\n\n\n\n       1\n      Merced-Nieves stood trial with eight other alleged\ncoconspirators (all of whom were found guilty), and we\nconsolidated the nine ensuing appeals. Seven of them, including\nthis one, were argued together on September 14, 2000. The other\ntwo were submitted on the briefs to the same panel.     We have\nelected to decide this appeal in a separate opinion.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fthe evidence presented against a defendant in a criminal case,\n\nan    appellate    court      must    \"canvass          the   evidence      (direct     and\n\ncircumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution\n\nand    decide    whether      that    evidence,          including     all     plausible\n\ninferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder\n\nto    conclude    beyond      a    reasonable       doubt      that    the     defendant\n\ncommitted the charged crime.\"                 United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d\n\n490, 494 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           The principal statute of conviction here is 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 846.    To convict a defendant of violating that statute, the\n\ngovernment       must   \"show        beyond    a    reasonable         doubt     that     a\n\nconspiracy existed and that a particular defendant agreed to\n\nparticipate       in    it,       intending        to     commit      the    underlying\n\nsubstantive offense.\"             United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\n\n1173 (1st Cir. 1993).             Proof of the illicit agreement requires\n\n\"no particular formalities.\"             Id.    Thus, a defendant may join in\n\na drug-trafficking conspiracy without knowing the full extent of\n\nthe enterprise or the identities of all the coconspirators.                             See\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).    By like token, the government may satisfy its burden\n\nthrough either direct or circumstantial evidence, or through any\n\ncombination of the two.            See United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160\n\nF.3d 768, 772 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Hernandez, 146\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fF.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).     In short, both the conspiracy's\n\nexistence and a particular defendant's membership in it may be\n\ninferred from the participants' \"words and actions and the\n\ninterdependence of activities and persons involved.\"           United\n\nStates v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n         The remaining count of conviction implicates 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1), which provides in pertinent part that:       \"[Whoever,]\n\nduring and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime . .\n\n. for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United\n\nStates, uses or carries a firearm, shall . . . [be given\n\nadditional punishment].\"    In order to convict under the \"use\"\n\nprong of this statute, the government must show \"actual use\" of\n\na firearm, a standard that \"'includes brandishing, displaying,\n\nbartering,   striking   with,   and   most   obviously,   firing   or\n\nattempting to fire, a firearm.'\"       United States v. Valle, 72\n\nF.3d 210, 217 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Bailey v. United States,\n\n516 U.S. 137, 148 (1994) (citations omitted)).     To convict under\n\nthe \"carry\" prong of the statute, the government must prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly carried,\n\nconveyed, or transported a firearm.      See Muscarello v. United\n\nStates, 524 U.S. 125, 126 (1998).     Finally, the government must\n\nprove the requisite nexus between this use or carriage and a\n\ndrug-trafficking crime.    See, e.g., United States v. Bergodere,\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f40 F.3d 512, 518 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Hadfield, 918\n\nF.2d 987, 998 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the appellant's\n\nparamount assignment of error.             Merced-Nieves concedes, as he\n\nmust, that the government proved the existence of a large, long-\n\nlasting conspiracy to distribute various controlled substances.\n\nThe initial question, then, is whether the government also\n\nproved that he was part and parcel of it.                    The secondary\n\nquestion    is   whether   the   government     proved   that   he    used    or\n\ncarried a firearm to facilitate the ring's drug-trafficking\n\nexploits.    The record suggests that both of these questions must\n\nbe answered affirmatively.\n\n            At trial, the government adduced competent evidence\n\nthat Merced-Nieves sold narcotics for the ring and that he\n\nroutinely carried a firearm in the course of those felonious\n\nactivities.      The government also adduced evidence that Merced-\n\nNieves participated in other facilitative conduct, including\n\nsundry carjackings and drive-by shootings of rival gang members.\n\nThis evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, suffices to undergird his convictions.               See, e.g.,\n\nRivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d at 1079 (holding that \"[t]he fact that\n\n[the   defendant]     participated     in     one   retail     link   of     the\n\ndistribution      chain,   knowing    that     it   extended     beyond      his\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\findividual role, [is] sufficient\" to demonstrate his culpability\n\nas a member of a drug-trafficking conspiracy); United States v.\n\nCollazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 195 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that\n\nto   transgress    section    924(c)(1),    \"it     is   enough    that   the\n\nappellant    carried    the   firearms     during    the   [drug    related\n\nshootings] and therefore used the weapons in furtherance of the\n\ndrug conspiracy\").\n\n            The appellant seeks to deflect the force of this proof\n\nby   assailing    the   credibility   of    the     government's    several\n\nwitnesses.     But that line of attack avails him naught.                  In\n\npassing upon challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we\n\nare bound to refrain from making independent judgments as to\n\nwitness credibility.      See Noah, 130 F.3d at 494; United States\n\nv. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).              We recently\n\nsummed up this principle in United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d\n\n480 (1st Cir. 2000), in which we wrote that \"[e]xcept in the\n\nmost unusual circumstances . . . credibility determinations are\n\nfor the jury, not for an appellate court.\"               Id. at 483.      The\n\ncircumstances here are not extraordinary, so this case comes\n\nwithin the sweep of this general rule, not within the long-odds\n\nexception to it.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f         The appellant puts a twist on his credibility theme,\n\nstruggling to invoke the specter of a witness-bribery statute\n\nthat provides in pertinent part:\n\n         Whoever . . . directly or indirectly, gives,\n         offers or promises anything of value to any\n         person, for or because of the testimony\n         under oath or affirmation given or to be\n         given by such person as a witness upon a\n         trial, hearing, or other proceeding, before\n         any court . . . authorized by the laws of\n         the United States to hear evidence or take\n         testimony . . . shall be fined under this\n         title or imprisoned for not more than two\n         years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2).        In 1998, a Tenth Circuit panel held that\n\nthis statute forbade testimony given in exchange for promised\n\nleniency, and applied an exclusionary rule to remedy perceived\n\nviolations.    See United States v. Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343 (10th\n\nCir. 1998) (Singleton I).             The appellant acknowledges that\n\nSingleton I has been withdrawn and that the Tenth Circuit,\n\nsitting en banc, has repudiated it.                  See     United States v.\n\nSingleton,    165    F.3d   1297,    1298    (10th   Cir.    1999)   (en    banc)\n\n(Singleton    II),    cert.   denied,       527   U.S.     1024   (1999).     The\n\nappellant also acknowledges that this court has disavowed the\n\nreasoning of Singleton I.           See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d\n\n183, 198 (1st Cir. 1999).       He nonetheless argues that the spirit\n\nof Singleton I persists, and that the rationale behind the\n\ndecision — namely, that testimony from government witnesses who\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fhave received inducements to testify is inherently unreliable —\n\njustifies the reversal of the jury verdict in this case.\n\n         We reject this specious argument.              While the testimony\n\nof cooperating witnesses must always be scrutinized with care,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), the witnesses here were subjected to withering cross-\n\nexamination by several sets of defense counsel, and the jury was\n\nproperly instructed to weigh their testimony in light of the\n\npromises made and inducements tendered.              The jury apparently\n\nfound the witnesses credible.            We know of no authority that\n\nwould permit us, in the circumstances of this case, to second-\n\nguess the jury's assessment.        We therefore decline to accept the\n\nappellant's   reading     of    either   the   letter     or   the   spirit    of\n\nsection 201(c)(2).      See Lara, 181 F.3d at 198; Singleton II, 165\n\nF.3d at 1298; see also United States v. Lowery, 166 F.3d 1119,\n\n1122-24 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Ramsey, 165 F.3d 980,\n\n987 (D.C. Cir. 1999); United States v. Ware, 161 F.3d 414, 418-\n\n25 (6th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1045 (1999); United\n\nStates v. Haese, 162 F.3d 359, 366-68 (5th Cir. 1998), cert.\n\ndenied, 526 U.S. 1138 (1999).\n\n         We   need   go    no    further.      To   the    extent    that     the\n\nappellant offers other arguments, they are either undeveloped,\n\nor obviously meritless, or both.          We conclude that the evidence\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fintroduced at trial, taken in the light most congenial to the\n\ngovernment's    theory   of   the   case,   amply   supported   the   jury\n\nverdict on both counts of conviction.        Accordingly, the judgment\n\nbelow must be\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

To convict under\n\nthe \"carry\" prong of the statute, the government must prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly carried,\n\nconveyed, or transported a firearm.

Finally, the government must\n\nprove the requisite nexus between this use or carriage and a\n\ndrug-trafficking crime.    See, e.g., United States v.

Merced-Nieves concedes, as he\n\nmust, that the government proved the existence of a large, long-\n\nlasting conspiracy to distribute various controlled substances.\n\nThe initial question, then, is whether the government also\n\nproved that he was part and parcel of it.                    The secondary\n\nquestion    is   whether   the   government     proved   that   he    used    or\n\ncarried a firearm to facilitate the ring's drug-trafficking\n\nexploits.    The record suggests that both of these questions must\n\nbe answered affirmatively.\n\n            At trial, the government adduced competent evidence\n\nthat Merced-Nieves sold narcotics for the ring and that he\n\nroutinely carried a firearm in the course of those felonious\n\nactivities.      The government also adduced evidence that Merced-\n\nNieves participated in other facilitative conduct, including\n\nsundry carjackings and drive-by shootings of rival gang members.\n\nThis evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, suffices to undergird his convictions.

In 1998, a Tenth Circuit panel held that\n\nthis statute forbade testimony given in exchange for promised\n\nleniency, and applied an exclusionary rule to remedy perceived\n\nviolations.

He nonetheless argues that the spirit\n\nof Singleton I persists, and that the rationale behind the\n\ndecision — namely, that testimony from government witnesses who\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fhave received inducements to testify is inherently unreliable —\n\njustifies the reversal of the jury verdict in this case.\n\n         We reject this specious argument.              While the testimony\n\nof cooperating witnesses must always be scrutinized with care,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v.

The jury apparently\n\nfound the witnesses credible.            We know of no authority that\n\nwould permit us, in the circumstances of this case, to second-\n\nguess the jury's assessment.
