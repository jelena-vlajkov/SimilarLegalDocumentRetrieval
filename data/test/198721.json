Logan and\r\nVerrill &amp; Dana, LLP were on brief, for appellant.\r\nJames Q. Shirley, with whom Sheehan Phinney Bass + Green,\r\nP.A., Anna Barbara Hantz and Gottesman and Hollis, P.A. were on\r\nbrief, for appellee Michael G. Jabar d/b/a Mike's Roofing Company.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n              November 24, 1999\r\n                                           JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.  Lisa Varano\r\nappeals from the judgment as a matter of law entered against her on\r\nher products liability claim against Michael Jabar, and also from\r\nthe judgment entered against her on a jury verdict on her\r\nnegligence claim.  Varano claimed she became ill from fumes\r\nreleased when Jabar, doing business as Mike's Roofing, used an\r\nadhesive containing isocyanates to repair the roof above the store\r\nwhere Varano was working.  After Varano presented her case, the\r\ndistrict court entered judgment as a matter of law against her on\r\nher strict liability failure-to-warn claim because the court\r\nconcluded that Jabar was not a \"seller\" of the adhesive, which is\r\na statutory element of Varano's claim under Maine law.  The court\r\npermitted Jabar to introduce evidence that he had used the adhesive\r\nin the past without any problems.  The court submitted Varano's\r\nnegligence claim to the jury, but refused Varano's requested res\r\nipsa loquitur instruction on the ground that Varano had not adduced\r\nevidence that would warrant the instruction. The jury returned a\r\nverdict for Jabar.  On appeal, Varano argues that the district\r\ncourt erred in entering judgment against her on her strict\r\nliability claim, in permitting Jabar to introduce evidence of his\r\npast use of the adhesive without injuries, and in denying her\r\nrequested res ipsa loquitur instruction.  We affirm.\r\nVarano testified that on February 17, 1995, she was\r\nworking in her office in the back of the Nautica store in a mall in\r\nKittery, Maine.  She heard some banging on the roof of the store,\r\nfollowed by the presence of a strong odor of glue or adhesive.  She\r\nwent outside the store and saw that employees of Jabar's company,\r\nMike's Roofing, were working on the roof.  Back inside the store,\r\nVarano found that the odor had grown stronger, so she called the\r\nproperty management company to report the problem.  As the day went\r\non, the odor became stronger until Varano could see a \"vapor\" and\r\na \"haze\" in the room.\r\nBy the next day, Varano had a sore throat and chest\r\ndiscomfort.  She was admitted to the emergency room on March 2 and\r\nMarch 8, 1995 because she was experiencing chest pains and could\r\nnot breathe.\r\nOn March 9, 1995, Jabar's employees were back at work on\r\nthe roof of the mall.  When Varano arrived at work, one of her\r\ncoworkers told her that the odor had returned.  Varano again called\r\nthe management company to complain.  In response, two of Jabar's\r\nemployees and Jabar's wife, Wendy Collins, came to the Nautica\r\nstore.  Varano asked them what they were using on the roof.  One of\r\nJabar's employees left and returned with a can of Firestone Splice\r\nAdhesive.  He opened the can, and Varano identified the odor as the\r\none she had smelled in the store on February 17.\r\nAfter the incidents at the store in February and March\r\n1995, Varano was diagnosed with occupational asthma, induced by\r\nexposure to isocyanates.  Splice Adhesive contains isocyanates.\r\nVarano sued Jabar, alleging a products liability claim\r\nfor failure to warn of the danger posed by exposure to Splice\r\nAdhesive and negligence in failing to warn her.  Varano's theory\r\nwas that there was a \"release\" of Splice on the roof that worked\r\nits way down through the decking of the roof into the back of the\r\nNautica store where Varano was working.  Jabar's expert testified\r\nthat Varano could not have been exposed to levels of isocyanates\r\nsufficient to cause asthma in connection with the use of Splice\r\nAdhesive on the roof.  Jabar's medical expert testified that\r\nVarano's medical condition was not caused by isocyanate exposure,\r\nbut rather by recurrent infections.  The district court granted\r\njudgment as a matter of law against Varano on the ground that Jabar\r\nwas not a \"seller\" of Splice Adhesive within the meaning of Maine's\r\nproducts liability statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14,  221\r\n(West 1997).  The court submitted Varano's negligence claim to the\r\njury, which found for Jabar.\r\n                       I.\r\nVarano argues that the district court erred in entering\r\njudgment as a matter of law against her on her strict liability\r\nclaim on the ground that Jabar was not a seller of Splice Adhesive\r\nwithin the meaning of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14,  221.  We\r\nconclude that, whether or not Jabar was a seller under Maine law,\r\nthe court submitted to the jury the same elements in the negligence\r\ninstruction as Varano would have been entitled to under a strict\r\nliability failure-to-warn instruction.  Therefore, any possible\r\nerror in denying Varano the chance to submit her strict liability\r\nfailure-to-warn claim to the jury was harmless.\r\nVarano's complaint pleaded a strict liability claim based\r\nonly on failure to warn of danger associated with the use of Splice\r\nAdhesive.  Varano's tendered strict liability instruction included\r\na statement that the \"roofing products may be defective and\r\nunreasonably dangerous because of a failure to provide adequate\r\nwarnings regarding potential dangers involved in the use of the\r\nproducts.\"  Varano's tendered instruction did not contain any\r\nindication that the jury had to find that Jabar knew or should have\r\nknown of the danger to find Jabar liable for failure to warn of\r\nthat danger.  Jabar contends that, even assuming the district court\r\nerred in failing to submit the strict liability failure-to-warn\r\nclaim to the jury, the error is harmless as a matter of law because\r\nthe court instructed the jury on negligent failure to warn.  Jabar\r\nargues that the two claims are so similar under Maine law that the\r\njury's rejection of the negligence claim establishes that it would\r\nhave also rejected the strict liability claim.\r\nIn Cheshire Medical Center v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., 49 F.3d\r\n26, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1995), we held that failure to submit a strict\r\nliability failure-to-warn instruction would be harmless if the\r\ncourt instructed on a negligent failure-to-warn claim and if the\r\nstrict liability duty to warn was no more stringent than the duty\r\nof prudent care under New Hampshire law.\r\nThe Maine Supreme Judicial Court has stated that the duty\r\nimposed by Maine's products liability statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\r\ntit. 14,  221, in a duty to warn context, is the \"responsibility\r\nto inform users and consumers of dangers about which [the seller]\r\neither knows or should know at the time the product is sold.\" \r\nBernier v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 516 A.2d 534, 540 (Me. 1986),\r\nquoted in Lorfano v. Dura Stone Steps, Inc., 569 A.2d 195, 197 (Me.\r\n1990).  \"[T]his aspect of strict liability bears a strong\r\nresemblance to a negligence action.\"  Lorfano, 569 A.2d at 196. \r\nThe Maine court quoted the comments of Professor Prosser, who\r\nstated that the two claims are the same, except that the claim\r\nsounding in strict liability is subject to strict liability\r\ndefenses and other limitations on liability, rather than the\r\ndefenses and limitations relevant to negligence claims.  Id.\r\n(quoting W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, The Law of Torts  99, at 697 (5th\r\ned. 1984)).\r\nThus, while the Maine Court indicated that there are\r\ndifferences in the defenses and limitations on liability applicable\r\nto the two causes of action, both causes spring from an identical\r\nduty of care:\r\n         Regardless of whether a failure to warn claim\r\nis phrased in terms of negligence [or] strict\r\nliability, the analysis . . . is basically the\r\nsame.  [T]he general rule [is] that the\r\nsupplier of a product is liable to expected\r\nusers for harm that results from foreseeable\r\nuses of the product if the supplier has reason\r\nto know that the product is dangerous and\r\nfails to exercise reasonable care to so inform\r\nthe user. \r\n\nPottle v. Up-Right, Inc., 628 A.2d 672, 675 (Me. 1993) (internal\r\nquotations omitted and emphasis added).\r\nVarano's proposed strict liability instruction did not\r\ninclude the concept that Jabar would only be liable for failure to\r\nwarn of dangers of which he knew or should have known.  On appeal,\r\nVarano continues to argue that strict liability does not require a\r\nbreach of a duty of care.  However, under Maine law it is clear\r\nthat strict liability failure-to-warn cases do require breach of\r\nsuch a duty.  See Pottle, 628 A.2d at 675; Lorfano, 596 A.2d at\r\n196. We need not decide whether, on different facts, there might be\r\nsome differences between the strict liability failure-to-warn and\r\nnegligent failure-to-warn claims under Maine law; the only\r\ndifference urged upon us in this case concerns whether the strict\r\nliability failure-to-warn theory must include the concept that the\r\nsupplier knew or should have known of the danger posed by the\r\ndefect.  We hold that it does, and that Varano's strict liability\r\nclaim was therefore subsumed within her negligence claim.  See\r\nPottle, 628 A.2d at 675; cf. Cheshire Med. Ctr., 49 F.3d at 35\r\n(where plaintiff did not tender a correct instruction or object on\r\nthe correct ground, we did not reach the argument that there is\r\nsome difference between negligent and strict liability failure to\r\nwarn theories).  Consequently, we need not reach the question of\r\nwhether Jabar was a seller under the Maine products liability\r\nstatute.                               II.\r\nVarano next argues that the district court erred in\r\nallowing Jabar to introduce evidence that he and his employees had\r\nused Splice Adhesive in the past and had never experienced problems\r\nor had complaints.  Varano argues that this testimony was\r\nirrelevant, because Jabar contended at trial that his employees did\r\nnot use Splice Adhesive on February 17, 1995, but only cleared ice\r\nand snow off the roof.  In a similar vein, Varano argues that the\r\nnonoccurrence evidence was unduly prejudicial under Federal Rule of\r\nEvidence 403.  Ordinarily, we review for abuse of discretion the\r\ndistrict court's relevance determination and its weighing of\r\nprobative value versus unfair prejudice.  See Espeaignnette v. \r\nGene Tierney Co., 43 F.3d 1, 5, 10 (1st Cir. 1994).  Here, because\r\nVarano only objected to the evidence by a motion in limine and made\r\nno contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error.  See\r\nClausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1190 (1st Cir. 1994).  Varano\r\nargues that the district court's denial of her motion in limine was\r\nsufficiently final to obviate the need for her to object at trial,\r\nbut we see nothing in the district court's summary denial of her\r\nmotion that would excuse her from the usual obligation to object at\r\ntrial.\r\nVarano says that since Jabar denies using the Splice on\r\nthe date in question, evidence of what happened on other occasions\r\nwhen he did use it is irrelevant.  To the contrary, such evidence\r\nis directly relevant to Varano's claim that Jabar's  use of  Splice\r\non February 17 caused her injuries.  See Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at\r\n9-10 (evidence that manufacturer had received no reports of other\r\naccidents relevant to causation).  This evidence tends to show that\r\neven if Jabar had used Splice on the roof, it would not have caused\r\nVarano's injuries.  This reasoning is not inconsistent with Jabar's\r\ncontention that his employees did not use Splice on February 17;\r\nrather, it is auxiliary to Jabar's principal theory.  The district\r\ncourt certainly did not commit plain error in admitting evidence of\r\nprior use.  Varano argues that it was unfairly prejudicial to let\r\nJabar prove he had used Splice in the past without incident unless\r\nhe conceded that he used it on February 17.  This is merely a\r\nvariant on the argument we have already rejected.\r\n                      III.\r\nVarano contends that the district court erred in denying\r\nher requested res ipsa loquitur instruction.\r\nA district court is bound to instruct the jury on all\r\nissues of fact raised by the evidence adduced at trial.  See Wilson\r\nv. Maritime Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\n         The standard for determining whether a factual\r\nissue is sufficiently contested to require an\r\ninstruction is identical to the standard for\r\ndetermining whether a factual controversy\r\nprevents the entry of judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\r\n                    . . . .\r\n\n           In neither situation may the court weigh the\r\nevidence, make credibility determinations, or\r\nresolve conflicts in the proof.  Instead, the\r\ncourt must determine whether the evidence\r\npresented at trial, along with all inferences\r\nthat may reasonably be drawn therefrom, could\r\nplausibly support a finding for either party\r\non any given issue of material fact.\r\n\nId.  Our review of the district court's decision not to instruct on\r\nan issue is plenary.  Id.  If the court erroneously fails to\r\ninstruct on a material issue of fact, we still may not grant a new\r\ntrial on the basis of that error if the error is harmless.  Id. at\r\n6.\r\nThe right to a res ipsa loquitur instruction is\r\ndetermined by Maine law in this diversity case.  See, e.g., DiPalma\r\nv. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 938 F.2d 1463, 1464-65 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(applying Rhode Island law); Roln-Alvarado v. Municipality of San\r\nJuan, 1 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 1993) (applying Puerto Rico law).\r\nUnder Maine law, the res ipsa loquitur doctrine permits a finding\r\nof negligence in connection with an unexplained event if the\r\nplaintiff can show  (1) the event was of a kind which ordinarily\r\ndoes not occur in the absence of negligence; (2) other responsible\r\ncauses are sufficiently eliminated by the evidence; and (3) the\r\nindicated negligence is within the scope of the defendant's duty to\r\nthe plaintiff.  See Poulin v. Aquaboggan Waterslide, 567 A.2d 925,\r\n926 (Me. 1989); Ginn v. Penobscot Co., 334 A.2d 874, 878, 880 (Me.\r\n1975).  According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \"It is the\r\nfunction of the court to determine whether the inference may\r\nreasonably be drawn by the jury, or whether it must necessarily be\r\ndrawn.\"  Section 328D(2) (1965).\r\nThe district court denied the res ipsa loquitur\r\ninstruction, stating:\r\n         I think the evidence does not show that this\r\naccident could happen only as a result of the\r\nconduct on the part of the defendant, and that\r\nthere is no showing, no basis on which a jury\r\ncould conclude there is no other explanation\r\n[than] the conduct of the defendant in\r\nbringing about the injury complained of in\r\nthis case.\r\n\nThe evidence in this case included possible alternative\r\nexplanations for the odor in the Nautica store and for Varano's\r\nmedical condition.  Where the record establishes possible\r\nexplanations for the accident other than the defendant's\r\nnegligence, res ipsa loquitur does not apply.  See Wellington\r\nAssocs., Inc. v. Capital Fire Protection  Co., 594 A.2d 1089, 1092\r\n(Me. 1991); see also Sheltra v. Rochefort, 667 A.2d 868, 870 (Me.\r\n1995).  The district court did not err in concluding that the\r\nevidence did not warrant submitting a res ipsa loquitur instruction\r\nto the jury.\r\nWe affirm the judgment of the district court.\n",

On appeal, Varano continues to argue that strict liability does not require a breach of a duty of care. However, under Maine law it is clear that strict liability failure-to-warn cases do require breach of such a duty. See Pottle, 628 A.2d at 675; Lorfano, 596 A.2d at 196. We need not decide whether, on different facts, there might be some differences between the strict liability failure-to-warn and negligent failure-to-warn claims under Maine law; the only difference urged upon us in this case concerns whether the strict liability failure-to-warn theory must include the concept that the supplier knew or should have known of the danger posed by the defect. We hold that it does, and that Varano's strict liability claim was therefore subsumed within her negligence claim. See Pottle, 628 A.2d at 675; cf. Cheshire Med. Ctr., 49 F.3d at 35 (where plaintiff did not tender a correct instruction or object on the correct ground, we did not reach the argument that there is some difference between negligent and strict liability failure to warn theories). Consequently, we need not reach the question of whether Jabar was a seller under the Maine products liability statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano next argues that the district court erred in allowing Jabar to introduce evidence that he and his employees had used Splice Adhesive in the past and had never experienced problems or had complaints. Varano argues that this testimony was irrelevant, because Jabar contended at trial that his employees did not use Splice Adhesive on February 17, 1995, but only cleared ice and snow off the roof. In a similar vein, Varano argues that the nonoccurrence evidence was unduly prejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Ordinarily, we review for abuse of discretion the district court's relevance determination and its weighing of probative value versus unfair prejudice. See Espeaignnette v.  Gene Tierney Co., 43 F.3d 1, 5, 10 (1st Cir. 1994). Here, because Varano only objected to the evidence by a motion in limine and made no contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error. See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1190 (1st Cir. 1994). Varano argues that the district court's denial of her motion in limine was sufficiently final to obviate the need for her to object at trial, but we see nothing in the district court's summary denial of her motion that would excuse her from the usual obligation to object at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano says that since Jabar denies using the Splice on the date in question, evidence of what happened on other occasions when he did use it is irrelevant. To the contrary, such evidence is directly relevant to Varano's claim that Jabar's use of Splice on February 17 caused her injuries. See Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 9-10 (evidence that manufacturer had received no reports of other accidents relevant to causation). This evidence tends to show that even if Jabar had used Splice on the roof, it would not have caused Varano's injuries. This reasoning is not inconsistent with Jabar's contention that his employees did not use Splice on February 17; rather, it is auxiliary to Jabar's principal theory. The district court certainly did not commit plain error in admitting evidence of prior use. Varano argues that it was unfairly prejudicial to let Jabar prove he had used Splice in the past without incident unless he conceded that he used it on February 17. This is merely a variant on the argument we have already rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano contends that the district court erred in denying her requested res ipsa loquitur instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court is bound to instruct the jury on all issues of fact raised by the evidence adduced at trial.

See, e.g., DiPalma v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 938 F.2d 1463, 1464-65 (1st Cir. 1991) (applying Rhode Island law); Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 1993) (applying Puerto Rico law). Under Maine law, the res ipsa loquitur doctrine permits a finding of negligence in connection with an unexplained event if the plaintiff can show (1) the event was of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence; (2) other responsible causes are sufficiently eliminated by the evidence; and (3) the indicated negligence is within the scope of the defendant's duty to the plaintiff. See Poulin v. Aquaboggan Waterslide, 567 A.2d 925, 926 (Me. 1989); Ginn v. Penobscot Co., 334 A.2d 874, 878, 880 (Me. 1975). According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \"It is the function of the court to determine whether the inference may reasonably be drawn by the jury, or whether it must necessarily be drawn.\" Section 328D(2) (1965).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the res ipsa loquitur instruction, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think the evidence does not show that this accident could happen only as a result of the conduct on the part of the defendant, and that there is no showing, no basis on which a jury could conclude there is no other explanation [than] the conduct of the defendant in bringing about the injury complained of in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case included possible alternative explanations for the odor in the Nautica store and for Varano's medical condition.

Varano claimed she became ill from fumes released when Jabar, doing business as Mike's Roofing, used an adhesive containing isocyanates to repair the roof above the store where Varano was working. After Varano presented her case, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law against her on her strict liability failure-to-warn claim because the court concluded that Jabar was not a \"seller\" of the adhesive, which is a statutory element of Varano's claim under Maine law. The court permitted Jabar to introduce evidence that he had used the adhesive in the past without any problems. The court submitted Varano's negligence claim to the jury, but refused Varano's requested res ipsa loquitur instruction on the ground that Varano had not adduced evidence that would warrant the instruction. The jury returned a verdict for Jabar. On appeal, Varano argues that the district court erred in entering judgment against her on her strict liability claim, in permitting Jabar to introduce evidence of his past use of the adhesive without injuries, and in denying her requested res ipsa loquitur instruction. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano testified that on February 17, 1995, she was working in her office in the back of the Nautica store in a mall in Kittery, Maine. She heard some banging on the roof of the store, followed by the presence of a strong odor of glue or adhesive. She went outside the store and saw that employees of Jabar's company, Mike's Roofing, were working on the roof. Back inside the store, Varano found that the odor had grown stronger, so she called the property management company to report the problem. As the day went on, the odor became stronger until Varano could see a \"vapor\" and a \"haze\" in the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the next day, Varano had a sore throat and chest discomfort. She was admitted to the emergency room on March 2 and March 8, 1995 because she was experiencing chest pains and could not breathe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1995, Jabar's employees were back at work on the roof of the mall. When Varano arrived at work, one of her coworkers told her that the odor had returned. Varano again called the management company to complain. In response, two of Jabar's employees and Jabar's wife, Wendy Collins, came to the Nautica store. Varano asked them what they were using on the roof. One of Jabar's employees left and returned with a can of Firestone Splice Adhesive. He opened the can, and Varano identified the odor as the one she had smelled in the store on February 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the incidents at the store in February and March 1995, Varano was diagnosed with occupational asthma, induced by exposure to isocyanates. Splice Adhesive contains isocyanates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano sued Jabar, alleging a products liability claim for failure to warn of the danger posed by exposure to Splice Adhesive and negligence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in failing to warn her. Varano's theory was that there was a \"release\" of Splice on the roof that worked its way down through the decking of the roof into the back of the Nautica store where Varano was working. Jabar's expert testified that Varano could not have been exposed to levels of isocyanates sufficient to cause asthma in connection with the use of Splice Adhesive on the roof. Jabar's medical expert testified that Varano's medical condition was not caused by isocyanate exposure, but rather by recurrent infections. The district court granted judgment as a matter of law against Varano on the ground that Jabar was not a \"seller\" of Splice Adhesive within the meaning of Maine's products liability statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 221 (West 1997). The court submitted Varano's negligence claim to the jury, which found for Jabar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano argues that the district court erred in entering judgment as a matter of law against her on her strict liability claim on the ground that Jabar was not a seller of Splice Adhesive within the meaning of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 221. We conclude that, whether or not Jabar was a seller under Maine law, the court submitted to the jury the same elements in the negligence instruction as Varano would have been entitled to under a strict liability failure-to-warn instruction. Therefore, any possible error in denying Varano the chance to submit her strict liability failure-to-warn claim to the jury was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano's complaint pleaded a strict liability claim based only on failure to warn of danger associated with the use of Splice Adhesive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Varano's tendered strict liability instruction included a statement that the \"roofing products may be defective and unreasonably dangerous because of a failure to provide adequate warnings regarding potential dangers involved in the use of the products.\" Varano's tendered instruction did not contain any indication that the jury had to find that Jabar knew or should have known of the danger to find Jabar liable for failure to warn of that danger. Jabar contends that, even assuming the district court erred in failing to submit the strict liability failure-to-warn claim to the jury, the error is harmless as a matter of law because the court instructed the jury on negligent failure to warn. Jabar argues that the two claims are so similar under Maine law that the jury's rejection of the negligence claim establishes that it would have also rejected the strict liability claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cheshire Medical Center v.

Here, because Varano only objected to the evidence by a motion in limine and made no contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error. See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668217\"><a href=\"/opinion/668217/eric-clausen-v-sea-3-inc-storage-tank-development-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1190 (1st Cir. 1994). Varano argues that the district court's denial of her motion in limine was sufficiently final to obviate the need for her to object at trial, but we see nothing in the district court's summary denial of her motion that would excuse her from the usual obligation to object at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano says that since Jabar denies using the Splice on the date in question, evidence of what happened on other occasions when he did use it is irrelevant. To the contrary, such evidence is directly relevant to Varano's claim that Jabar's use of Splice on February 17 caused her injuries. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685127\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Espeaignnette,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/685127/41-fed-r-evid-serv-94-prodliabrep-cch-p-14121-william-and-rita/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">9-10</span> </a></span>(evidence that manufacturer had received no reports of other accidents relevant to causation). This evidence tends to show that even if Jabar had used Splice on the roof, it would not have caused Varano's injuries. This reasoning is not inconsistent with Jabar's contention that his employees did not use Splice on February 17; rather, it is auxiliary to Jabar's principal theory. The district court certainly did not commit plain error in admitting evidence of prior use. Varano argues that it was unfairly prejudicial to let Jabar prove he had used Splice in the past without incident unless he conceded that he used it on February 17. This is merely a variant on the argument we have already rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Varano contends that the district court erred in denying her requested res ipsa loquitur instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court is bound to instruct the jury on all issues of fact raised by the evidence adduced at trial.

See, e.g., DiPalma v. Westinghouse Elec.

Under Maine law, the res ipsa loquitur doctrine permits a finding of negligence in connection with an unexplained event if the plaintiff can show (1) the event was of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence; (2) other responsible causes are sufficiently eliminated by the evidence; and (3) the indicated negligence is within the scope of the defendant's duty to the plaintiff.

Aquaboggan Waterslide, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></span>, 926 (Me. 1989); Ginn v.
