Upon review of the briefs and record, we\r\nconclude that the district court properly dismissed plaintiff's\r\ncomplaint.  The issues raised, even were they not vague and\r\nunsupported, were inextricably intertwined with review of the\r\nstate court proceedings.  Accordingly, the district court\r\nlacked jurisdiction to consider those claims.  See District of\r\nColumbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476 (1983);\r\nRooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16 (1923);\r\nLancellotti v. Fay, 909 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\nPlaintiff's vague and unsupported allegations of denial of due\r\nprocess did not require any other result, and we find no merit\r\nin plaintiff's specific appellate arguments to the contrary.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
