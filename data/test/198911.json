Melissa Weber, mother of Samuel\n\nM. Weber, filed a seven-count complaint in the district court\n\nfor the District of Rhode Island against the Cranston School\n\nCommittee, committee members, and Cranston city officials in\n\ntheir individual and official capacities pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1983 and 1985, the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments,\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-\n\n12134,   Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794,\n\nand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20\n\nU.S.C.   §§    1400-1415.      The     district     court   granted    summary\n\njudgment      for   the   defendants    as   to    all   counts   in   Weber's\n\ncomplaint.\n\n           Weber limited her appeal from the district court’s\n\ndecision to Count IV, a claim of illegal retaliation pursuant to\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nCount IV of the complaint charges that the defendants retaliated\n\nagainst Weber for her complaints about the school district's\n\nfailure to implement her son's Individualized Education Plan by\n\ndenying her access to her son's school records, restricting her\n\ncommunications with his teachers, and threatening to report her\n\nto the state child welfare agency.                The district court found\n\nthat Weber's illegal retaliation claim merely rephrased prior\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fclaims that the district court had already rejected, namely her\n\nCount II claim that the defendants' retaliation infringed on her\n\nFirst Amendment rights and her Count III claim that she was\n\ndenied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because\n\nother     parents   could   access    their    children's      records     and\n\nteachers.    Alternatively, the district court ruled that Weber's\n\nCount IV claim was barred because of her failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies specified by IDEA.             IDEA requires such\n\nexhaustion prior to bringing a civil action pursuant to other\n\nfederal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities\n\nif the relief sought is available under subchapter II of IDEA,\n\nentitled     “Assistance    for   Education     of    All   Children     with\n\nDisabilities.”      See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).         Such relief is sought\n\nthrough    the   administrative   due      process   hearing    provided    in\n\nsubchapter II of IDEA.      See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f).           Agreeing with\n\nthis alternative ruling on the failure to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            This case has a complicated and contentious history.\n\nSamuel Weber entered the Cranston public school system (\"CPS\")\n\non January 6, 1993, identified as a disabled child in need of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fspecial education services under IDEA. 1    Samuel received an\n\nIndividualized Education Plan (the \"Plan\") pursuant to IDEA that\n\ndescribed his educational objectives for the school year and the\n\nservices necessary to achieve these objectives.2     One of the\n\nservices specified in Samuel's Plan was phonics instruction.\n\nAfter Weber approved Samuel's 1993-94 Plan, Principal Margaret\n\nDay told Weber that the school system planned to \"mainstream\"\n\nSamuel by removing him from his special education classroom and\n\nintegrating him into a standard curriculum class.   In addition,\n\nWeber learned that CPS was instituting a new language curriculum\n\nwhich did not include phonics.   Shortly after Samuel was moved\n\n\n\n    1 IDEA is a comprehensive federal education statute which\ngrants disabled students the right to a public education,\nprovides financial assistance to states to meet their\neducational needs, and conditions a state's federal funding on\nits having in place a policy that ensures that a \"free\nappropriate public education\" is available to all children with\ndisabilities. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1). A stated purpose of IDEA\nis \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available\nto them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes\nspecial education and related services designed to meet their\nunique needs and prepare them for employment and independent\nliving.\" Id. § 1400(d)(1)(A).\n    2An Individualized Education Plan is a written plan\ndeveloped jointly by the local educational agency, the school\nteaching staff, the child's parents, and an expert qualified to\ninterpret test results. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)-(4). The\nPlan records the child's present level of performance, sets\nannual educational objectives, and details the special services\nnecessary to meet these objectives. See id. § 1414(d)(1)(A).\nThe Plan must be reviewed and revised annually.      See id. §\n1414(d)(4)(A).\n\n                              -4-\n\finto a standard curriculum class, Weber met again with Principal\n\nDay and Samuel's teachers to discuss her concern about his\n\nphonics    instruction     under     his    Plan     and   the    effects   of\n\nmainstreaming.\n\n           After the conference, Weber remained dissatisfied with\n\nSamuel's phonics instruction.         She contacted the Director of the\n\nCranston      School   Committee's    Special      Education     Services   who\n\nassured her that CPS would schedule a meeting to discuss her\n\nconcerns following the series of three meetings required to\n\ncomplete Samuel's education evaluation and Plan.                  On February\n\n10,   1994,    after   attending     the   initial    meeting     to   evaluate\n\nSamuel's test results, Weber filed a complaint pursuant to the\n\nfederal complaint resolution procedure (\"CRP\") with the Office\n\nof Special Needs at the Rhode Island Department of Elementary\n\nand Secondary Education.3      The complaint alleged that CPS had not\n\n\n      3\n      The CRP regulations provide an administrative process to\nensure state and local compliance with IDEA. These regulations\nwere formerly known as the Education Department General\nAdministrative Regulations (\"EDGAR\").     The EDGAR procedures\nprovided \"an administrative mechanism for assuring that a state\ncomplies with state-administered federal programs, including the\n[IDEA, but were] distinguished from the specific administrative\nprocedures detailed in the [IDEA] itself.\" Christopher W. v.\nPortsmouth Sch. Comm., 877 F.2d 1089, 1090 n.2 (1st Cir. 1989).\nThe July 8, 1992 amendments to EDGAR relocated these regulations\nto 34 C.F.R. Part 300, the implementing regulations for IDEA.\nWhile the EDGAR procedures applied to many statutes, the CRP\nregulations provide a procedure (distinct from the IDEA due\nprocess hearing) for filing complaints under IDEA.      Under 34\nC.F.R. §§ 300.660 and 300.662, states must adopt a written\n\n                                     -5-\n\ffollowed Samuel's Individualized Education Plan with regard to\n\nphonics    instruction    or     the   provision   of   quarterly     progress\n\nreports.    Following an investigation, the Department found that\n\nCPS had complied with federal and state law.                 Weber did not\n\nappeal this decision to the Rhode Island Secretary of Education\n\nor pursue a due process hearing pursuant to IDEA.                   See infra\n\nPart III.\n\n            Weber next met with Principal Day, Cheryl Calvano,\n\nDirector of the Cranston School Committee's Special Education\n\nServices, and Samuel's teachers.              Pursuant to an agreement\n\nreached    at   that   meeting    that   Samuel    would   transfer    to   the\n\nNorwood Avenue School, he entered a standard curriculum third-\n\ngrade class in September 1994.               In October, Weber met with\n\nCalvano and other school staff to review Samuel's progress.\n\nFollowing this meeting, Weber filed a second CRP complaint\n\n\n\ncomplaint resolution procedure for receiving and resolving\ncomplaints that the state or a local agency is violating IDEA or\nits regulations. The state's procedure must limit the time for\nstate investigation and resolution of complaints to sixty days,\nwith extension only for \"exceptional circumstances.\" 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.661(a)-(c).   If either the complainant or the opposing\nschool body is not satisfied with the state's resolution, he or\nshe may request review of the state educational agency's\ndecision by the U.S. Secretary of Education. See 34 C.F.R. §\n300.661(d). Rhode Island implements the CRP mandates through\nthe Rhode Island Regulations of the Board of Regents for\nElementary and Secondary Education Governing the Special\nEducation of Students with Disabilities.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\falleging that CPS had denied her access to Samuel's educational\n\nrecords.         The    Rhode        Island        Department        of    Elementary    and\n\nSecondary Education once again found CPS to be in compliance\n\nwith the relevant state and federal regulations.\n\n            Shortly          after      Weber       filed      the   second    complaint,\n\nofficials at the Norwood Avenue School allowed her to inspect\n\nSamuel's cumulative record file and a confidential file.                              In the\n\nconfidential file, Weber found a handwritten note dated March\n\n24, 1994, stating, \"Agenda - Put parent on defensive,\" \"shut her\n\ndown,\"    and     a    reference        to     a     \"restraining         order.\"      Weber\n\nresponded    to       this    note      with    a    third     CRP    complaint      seeking\n\npermanent removal of the handwritten note from Samuel's file.\n\n            Defendants contended that the note was the product of\n\na meeting held to discuss \"legal avenues or other relief\" to\n\naddress    the    \"mounting          burden        of   time    imposed      [by    Weber's]\n\ntelephone        calls,           letters,           threats,         harassment,        and\n\nadministrative litigation.\"                  Weber alleged that the defendants\n\nadopted a \"secret agenda\" of intimidation and retaliation.                               She\n\nspecifically alleged that on March 28, 1994, a few days after\n\nthe date of the handwritten note, Cranston's Assistant City\n\nSolicitor       threatened         to    report         her    to    the    Rhode     Island\n\nDepartment of Children, Youth, and Families in an off-the-record\n\ndiscussion       during       a   due    process        hearing       for    her    disabled\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\fdaughter, D.W.     The Rhode Island Department of Elementary and\n\nSecondary Education ordered the removal of the note, as well as\n\nthe provision of a good faith hearing for Weber to express her\n\ngrievances.\n\n           Following the third complaint, Weber decided that she\n\nwanted Samuel “declassified” as a disabled student and requested\n\nmediation to accomplish this action. 4           One day prior to the\n\nscheduled mediation, Weber went to the Norwood Avenue School to\n\nsee Principal Laura Albanese.         Albanese's secretary directed\n\nWeber to a meeting room, where she found Calvano, Albanese, and\n\nSamuel's   teachers.        Weber     believed   that   this    was   an\n\nIndividualized Education Plan meeting to which she had not been\n\ninvited, and that this action indicated that CPS did not intend\n\nto provide a good faith hearing on her grievances.        The next day\n\nat the mediation, Weber offered to allow Cranston to provide any\n\nservices that they felt were necessary if they would agree to\n\ndeclassify Samuel as a disabled student.         CPS refused.\n\n           After   the   mediation,   Weber   alleged   that   Principal\n\nAlbanese denied her access to Samuel's records.          She filed one\n\n\n    4IDEA requires that, \"Any State educational agency or local\neducational  agency   that  receives   assistance   under  this\nsubchapter shall ensure that procedures are established and\nimplemented to allow parties to disputes . . . to resolve such\ndisputes through a mediation process which, at a minimum, shall\nbe available whenever a [due process] hearing is requested . .\n. . \" 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcomplaint with the Rhode Island Office of Equity and Access\n\nregarding access to Samuel's records, the refusal to terminate\n\nSamuel's Individualized Education Plan, and CPS's lack of good\n\nfaith; she also filed a second complaint on behalf of her\n\ndaughter.5   The Office of Equity and Access issued a written\n\n\n     5\n     The Office of Equity and Access complaint process is\nprovided for by the General Laws of Rhode Island § 42-87-5(c)\nand § 16-39-1.    Section 42-87-2 states that, \"No otherwise\nqualified person with a disability shall, solely by reason of\nhis or her disability, . . . be excluded from participation in\nor denied the benefits of any program, activity or service of,\nor, by any person or entity regulated, by the state or having\nreceived financial assistance from the state or under any\nprogram or activity conducted by the state . . . .\"          The\nstatutory complaint procedure does not refer to IDEA.        The\ninter-relationship between the Office of Equity and Access\nstatutory complaint process and the CRP regulations of the Board\nof Regents is not entirely clear.       Based on the materials\navailable to us, it appears that the Board of Regents\nregulations only implement IDEA, while the Office of Equity and\nAccess complaint procedure applies generally to the state's\nanti-discrimination law.\n\n     Rhode Island law provides that the state Department of\nEducation is \"empowered and directed to hear all complaints\nrelating to violations of this chapter in the area of elementary\nand secondary education . . . in accordance with the process set\nforth in chapter 39 of title 16.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-87-5(c).\nChapter 39 of title 16 specifies that the Commissioner of\nElementary and Secondary education will decide disputes arising\nunder any law relating to schools or education with no cost to\nthe parties involved.    See id. § 16-39-1.    Decisions of the\nCommissioner may be appealed to the Board of Regents for\nElementary and Secondary education (the same body that\npromulgates the regulations effectuating the federal complaint\nresolution procedure (\"CRP\")). See id. § 16-39-3. Decisions of\nthe commissioner and the board become final if judicial or\nadministrative review is not sought within thirty days. See id.\n§ 16-39-3.1.    Final decisions are not subject to further\njudicial or administrative review. See id.\n\n                              -9-\n\fdecision    finding   that   CPS's    actions   with    regard    to   Samuel\n\nconstituted prohibited retaliation.6         CPS appealed.       At the time\n\nthat the parties’ filed their briefs before us, this appeal was\n\nstill pending.\n\n            In   April    1995,   Weber     requested     an     independent\n\nevaluation of Samuel, who was now in third grade.                The testing\n\nrevealed that Samuel read at an eighth-grade level, spelled at\n\na seventh-grade level, and did arithmetic at a third-grade\n\nlevel.     In September 1995, Samuel's parents placed him in a\n\nprivate    school.       Subsequently,      Weber   requested     that    CPS\n\ndeclassify Samuel.       In March 1996, CPS concluded that Samuel was\n\nnot disabled under IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n    6     In relevant part, the decision stated:\n\n            The explanation of the denial to terminat[e]\n            . . . the Individualized Education Plan of\n            Samuel Weber could be justified by focusing\n            on the use of appropriate special education\n            procedures . . . . However, . . . [t]he\n            School   Department's   decision  that   the\n            student must continue to receive special\n            education   services,    coupled  with   the\n            complainant's [Weber's] use of procedural\n            safeguards and the [handwritten] note, when\n            it was found, its contents and the timing of\n            the complainant's request to terminate the\n            Individualized Education Plan, yields the\n            conclusion that the denial to terminate the\n            Individualized Education Plan constituted a\n            prohibited retaliation.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            In July 1996, Weber filed her complaint in the district\n\ncourt for the District of Rhode Island, including her Count IV\n\nclaim that CPS retaliated against her for enforcing her disabled\n\nchild's rights under IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct.    The disposition of Count IV is the only issue on appeal.\n\nThe defendants challenge Weber's standing under Section 504 to\n\npursue a claim of retaliation on her own behalf rather than on\n\nbehalf of her disabled son.              If Weber does have standing under\n\nSection 504, the defendants argue that she still cannot prevail\n\nbecause    she   failed      to    exhaust      administrative      remedies      as\n\nrequired by IDEA, which specifies that a party seeking relief\n\nunder the Rehabilitation Act must exhaust the administrative\n\nremedies    provided      by      IDEA    if    the     relief   sought   in   the\n\nRehabilitation Act claim is available under subchapter II of\n\nIDEA.     See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).              Weber maintains that she has\n\nstanding to bring her retaliation claim under Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act.          She further argues that her suit is not\n\nbarred by the IDEA requirement of exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies    because    she     would      not    have    standing   to    bring    a\n\nretaliation claim in her individual capacity pursuant to IDEA,\n\nand hence the relief she seeks under the Rehabilitation Act is\n\nnot available to her under subchapter II of IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f           We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, see\n\nEEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141 (1st Cir. 1997), and draw\n\nall reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, see\n\nChampagne v. Servistar Corp., 138 F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\nII.   A Parent’s Standing to Sue in Her Individual Capacity under\n      Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n           Weber alleges that CPS violated Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act by responding to her complaints relating to\n\nSamuel's education with a retaliatory policy to “put parent on\n\ndefensive” and to “shut her down,” restrictions on her access to\n\nschool records, and a threat to report her to the Rhode Island\n\nDepartment of Children, Youth, and Families.      Relying on the\n\nlanguage of the statute, the defendants insist that Weber lacks\n\nstanding under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act because she\n\nis not a \"qualified person with a disability\" as defined by\n\nSection 504.7   They argue that she cannot seek redress under\n\nSection 504 for retaliation that has harmed her rather than her\n\n\n\n      7\n      We note that Weber meets easily the constitutional standing\nrequirements of Article III: she alleges an actual injury, the\ninjury can fairly be traced to the challenged conduct, and the\ninjury can be redressed by the declaratory, injunctive, and\nmonetary relief requested. See Valley Forge Christian College\nv. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454\nU.S. 464, 472 (1982). In her complaint, Weber seeks declaratory\nand injunctive relief and damages for each count of her\ncomplaint.\n\n                               -12-\n\fdisabled child.         To assess this standing argument, we must\n\nevaluate the interaction between Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Department of\n\nEducation    regulations.     The    Rehabilitation     Act   prohibits\n\ndiscrimination    against   the    disabled.      Section   504   of   the\n\nRehabilitation    Act   mandates    that,   \"No   otherwise   qualified\n\nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of\n\nher or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be\n\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n\nany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance\n\n. . . .\"      29 U.S.C. § 794(a).         The Rehabilitation Act was\n\namended in 1978 to incorporate the \"remedies, procedures, and\n\nrights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42\n\nU.S.C.A. § 2000d et seq.].\" Id. § 794a(2).        The anti-retaliation\n\nregulation adopted pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n            No   recipient   or  other   person   shall\n            intimidate,     threaten,    coerce,     or\n            discriminate against any individual for the\n            purpose of interfering with any right or\n            privilege secured by Section 601 of [the\n            Civil Rights] Act or this part, or because\n            he   has  made   a  complaint,   testified,\n            assisted, or participated in any manner in\n            an investigation, proceeding or hearing\n            under this part.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e).     This regulation also applies to any right\n\nor privilege secured by the Rehabilitation Act.                See id. §\n\n104.61.\n\n           This broadly protective anti-retaliation regulation is\n\nfirmly grounded in the enforcement provisions of Title VI and\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act.      Title VI extends its remedies to \"any\n\nperson aggrieved\" by violations of the Act.           42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2\n\n(stating that \"any person aggrieved . . . may obtain judicial\n\nreview of [any department or agency] action in accordance with\n\nchapter 7 of Title 5.\").        The Rehabilitation Act extends its\n\nremedies to \"any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act\n\nby any recipient of Federal assistance . . . under section 794\n\nof this title.\"     29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2).       Courts have construed\n\nthe   phrase   \"any   person    aggrieved\"       as   an   expression     of\n\nCongressional intent to accord standing to the fullest extent\n\npermitted by the case and controversy provision of Article III.\n\nSee e.g., Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S.\n\n205, 208 (1972) (holding that the term \"aggrieved person\" in §\n\n810(a) of the Fair Housing Act, which the Act defined to include\n\n\"[a]ny    person    who   claims    to    have    been     injured   by    a\n\ndiscriminatory     housing   practice,\"   demonstrated      Congressional\n\nintent to confer standing to the fullest extent permitted by\n\nArticle III); Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., 445 F.2d 442, 446\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f(3d Cir. 1971) (reaching the same conclusion regarding Title\n\nVII's language of \"a person claiming to be aggrieved [under the\n\nAct].\"); see also Gray v. Greyhound Lines, East, 545 F.2d 169,\n\n176   (D.C.     Cir.      1976)     (same).        Consistent        with        the   broad\n\nconstruction of the statutory enforcement language of Title VI\n\nand the Rehabilitation Act, the anti-retaliation regulation\n\napplies    to       \"any      individual\"         who    has     been       intimidated,\n\nthreatened, coerced, or discriminated against “for the purpose\n\nof interfering with [protected rights]” under Title VI of the\n\nCivil    Rights     Act      or   the    Rehabilitation         Act.        34    C.F.R.    §\n\n100.7(e); see id. § 104.61 (incorporating the Title VI anti-\n\nretaliation regulation into the Rehabilitation Act).\n\n           Given the broad remedial provisions of Title VI and the\n\nRehabilitation         Act    and   the    breadth       of    the   anti-retaliation\n\nregulation adopted pursuant to those laws, it is not surprising\n\nthat courts have accorded standing to non-disabled individuals\n\nsuing because of retaliation for attempts to vindicate the\n\nrights    of    a    disabled           person.         In    Hoyt     v.    St.       Mary’s\n\nRehabilitation Center, 711 F.2d 864, 865 (8th Cir. 1983), the\n\nhospital shortened the plaintiff’s visiting time with a patient\n\nafter she complained about the patient’s care.                       The court stated\n\nthat the plaintiff, as the \"next friend and daily visitor\" of\n\nthe disabled patient, had standing under Section 504 to assert\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\fa claim of retaliation against her personally for complaints\n\nmade on behalf of the patient.            Id. at 867 (but ruling against\n\nthe plaintiff's Section 504 claim for insufficient evidence that\n\nthe retaliation was motivated by any complaints relating to\n\ndiscrimination against the patient); see also Ross v. Allen, 515\n\nF. Supp. 972, 976 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (granting standing to a school\n\npsychologist who was dismissed after she complained to the Board\n\nof    Education   about     the   suspension      of    a   deaf     student   for\n\nbehavioral    problems).          In   Whitehead       v.   School    Board    for\n\nHillsborough County, 918 F. Supp. 1515, 1522 (M.D. Fl. 1996),\n\nthe    court granted standing to the parents of a child with\n\nDown’s   Syndrome     who   sought      damages    under     Section     504   for\n\nretaliation against them in their capacity as parents, noting\n\nthat , \"There is no limitation under [34 C.F.R. 100.7(e)] that\n\nretaliatory acts are only prohibited against the handicapped\n\nindividual on whose behalf the § 504 complaint is being raised.”\n\nBut see Sanders v. Marquette Public Schs., 561 F. Supp. 1361,\n\n1370 (W.D. Mich. 1983)(allowing standing for a disabled child,\n\nbut denying it to her father who sought recovery for emotional\n\ndistress and the expense of alternative schooling).\n\n           Although    Congress        could   have    limited     the   remedial\n\nprovisions of the Rehabilitation Act to claims brought by or on\n\nbehalf of disabled individuals, it did not do so in apparent\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\frecognition of the fact that disabled individuals may need\n\nassistance in vindicating their rights from individuals who may\n\nhave their own claim to relief under the Act.             The anti-\n\nretaliation regulation set forth in 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e) is\n\nconsistent with this recognition.        It is a practical reality\n\nthat recipients of federal funds sometimes respond to complaints\n\nabout their treatment of a disabled child by retaliating against\n\nthe disabled child, the initiator of the complaint (who is often\n\na parent), or both.      We hold, therefore, that Weber has standing\n\nto pursue her retaliation claim under Section 504.       We now turn\n\nto the question of whether Weber must exhaust the administrative\n\nremedies provided by subchapter II of IDEA before filing a\n\nSection 504 retaliation claim in her individual capacity in\n\nfederal court.8\n\nIII.       IDEA Requirement of Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n\n\n\n       8\n     Weber brought her Count IV claim under Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act and § 1983. Our analysis has focused on the\nSection 504 claim because that was the focus of Weber's appeal.\nWithout addressing the merits of her § 1983 claim, which she\ndescribes as a claim intended \"to enforce the anti-retaliation\nprovision of IDEA,\" we note that any such claim will also be\nsubject to the IDEA requirement of exhaustion of administrative\nremedies as a claim \"seeking relief that is available under\n[IDEA]\" if Weber has standing to bring her retaliation claim\nunder IDEA.   20 U.S.C. § 1415 (l); N.B. v. Alachua County Sch.\nBd., 84 F.3d 1376, 1379 (11th Cir. 1996); Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi,\n832 F.2d 748, 756 (2d Cir. 1987).\n\n                                  -17-\n\f            The statutory provisions of subchapter II of IDEA are\n\nattentive to the details of administrative process.                                Section\n\n1415(b)(6)    requires        states        to     provide     the       \"opportunity     to\n\npresent complaints with respect to any matter relating to the\n\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of the\n\n[disabled]    child      .    .   .    .\"        The   IDEA    due       process   hearing\n\nprovision, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(1), mandates that parents who\n\nhave filed a complaint under IDEA \"shall have an opportunity for\n\nan impartial due process hearing . . . conducted by the State\n\neducational    agency        or   by       the    local   educational          agency,    as\n\ndetermined by State law or by the State educational agency.\"                              A\n\nparty to an IDEA due process hearing has the right to present\n\nevidence,    and    to       confront,           cross-examine,          and   compel    the\n\nattendance    of    witnesses;         the       right    to   be    accompanied         and\n\nadvised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or\n\ntraining     with   respect           to    the     problems        of    children      with\n\ndisabilities; the right to a written, or at the option of the\n\nparents, electronic verbatim record of such hearing; and the\n\nright to a written or, at the option of the parents, electronic\n\nfindings of fact and decisions.                   See id. § 1415(h). The hearing\n\nofficer may not be an employee of the state or local educational\n\nagency involved in the care or education of the disabled child.\n\nSee id. § 1415(f)(3).\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\f          IDEA requires recourse to this due process hearing when\n\nplaintiffs seek relief available under subchapter II of IDEA\n\neven if the suit is brought pursuant to a different statute. See\n\nid.   Section 1415(l) reads:\n\n          Nothing in this chapter shall be construed\n          to restrict or limit the rights, procedures,\n          and    remedies    available    under    the\n          Constitution,     the     Americans     with\n          Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the\n          Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal\n          statutes protecting the rights of children\n          and youth with disabilities, except that\n          before the filing of a civil action under\n          such laws seeking relief that is available\n          under this subchapter, the procedures under\n          subsections (f) and (g) of this section\n          shall be exhausted to the same extent as\n          would be required had the action been\n          brought under this subchapter.9\n\n\nWeber argues that she does not have to meet the IDEA exhaustion\n\nrequirement because, as a parent, she does not have standing to\n\nfile her own retaliation claim under IDEA, and hence the relief\n\n\n\n\n      9\n     Congress amended the EHA (the predecessor statute to IDEA)\nin response to the Supreme Court's decision in Smith v.\nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1012-13 (1984), holding that when EHA,\nsection 504, and Equal Protection claims overlap, the EHA was\nthe exclusive means for securing the provision of a free\nappropriate education. Congress added § 1415(l) to \"reaffirm,\nin light of [Smith], the viability of section 504, 42 U.S.C.\n1983, and other statutes as separate vehicles for ensuring the\nrights of handicapped children.\"    H.R. Rep. No. 99-296, 99th\nCong., 1st Sess. 4 (1985)(quoted in W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484,\n494 (3d Cir. 1995)).\n\n                               -19-\n\fshe seeks with her Section 504 claim is not available to her\n\nunder IDEA.      We reject her standing argument.\n\n          Unlike the Rehabilitation Act, IDEA lacks a broad\n\nenforcement      provision      granting        standing     to     \"any    person\n\naggrieved\"      by    violations    of    the    Act,   or    an    implementing\n\nregulation      that     protects     any       individual     who    has    been\n\nintimidated,         threatened,    coerced      or   discriminated        against\n\nbecause   she    made     a   complaint      under    the    Act.     The    issue\n\nconfronting us, therefore, is whether there is a basis in the\n\nlanguage and statutory framework of IDEA for Weber to file a\n\nretaliation claim in her individual capacity.                 We first look to\n\nthe basic principles of standing to determine whether Weber may\n\nfile such a retaliation claim under IDEA.\n\n          Standing doctrine encompasses both constitutional and\n\nprudential requirements.10          The constitutional standing rules\n\nensure the existence of a concrete \"case or controversy\" as\n\n\n\n    10There is some confusion as to how far ordinary standing\nprinciples apply to administrative proceedings.      See, e.g.,\nEnvirocare of Utah, Inc. v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 194 F.3d\n72, 74 (D.C. Cir. 1999)(Agencies . . . are not constrained by\nArticle III of the Constitution; nor are they governed by\njudially-created standing doctrines restricting access to the\nfederal courts. The criteria for establishing 'administrative\nstanding' therefore may permissibly be less demanding than the\ncriteria for 'judicial standing.'\"). Since no one has argued\nthat administrative proceedings under IDEA are subject to rules\ndifferent than those that apply to courts, we put this\npossibility aside in the present case.\n\n                                      -20-\n\frequired by Article III: \"[A]t an irreducible minimum, Art. III\n\nrequires the party who invokes the court's authority to show\n\nthat he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury\n\nas a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,\n\nand that the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged\n\naction and is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n\nValley   Forge    Christian       College    v.     Americans     United   for\n\nSeparation   of    Church     &    State,   Inc.,    454   U.S.    464,    472\n\n(1982)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).                   Weber\n\nmeets these constitutional requirements: the alleged retaliation\n\nresulted in \"injury in fact\" which can be redressed through the\n\ndeclaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief requested by Weber\n\nfor all counts of her complaint.\n\n          In addition to the constitutional requirements, the\n\nstanding inquiry encompasses prudential considerations aimed at\n\npreventing courts from adjudicating \"questions of broad social\n\nimport where no individual rights would be vindicated.\" Phillips\n\nPetroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 804 (1985).                To meet the\n\nprudential requirements, the plaintiff's challenge must rest on\n\nher own legal rights and interests, not the rights of third\n\nparties, see Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975), and the\n\nharm asserted cannot be a \"generalized grievance\" shared in\n\nequal measure by all or a large class of citizens, id.                     The\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fclaim   must    also   fall   within    \"the    zone     of   interests   to    be\n\nprotected      or   regulated   by     the     statute    or    constitutional\n\nguarantee in question,\" Association of Data Processing Serv.\n\nOrg., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970).                     The zone of\n\ninterests test does not require \"an indication of Congressional\n\npurpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff;\" instead, the \"proper\n\ninquiry is simply whether the interest sought to be protected by\n\nthe complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be\n\nprotected . . . by the statute.\"             National Credit Union Admin.\n\nv. First Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 492 (1998)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration and\n\nemphasis in original).          Only this last element, the zone of\n\ninterests, is at issue in this case.                              As noted, we\n\nreview the language and structure of IDEA to determine whether\n\nWeber's retaliation claim falls within the zone of interests\n\nprotected by IDEA.      That review reveals the central role played\n\nby parents in assuring that their disabled child receives a\n\n\"free appropriate public education,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A).\n\nThe   IDEA     statement   of   purposes       explicitly      recognizes      the\n\nstatute's mission \"to ensure that the rights of children with\n\ndisabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" Id. §\n\n1400(d)(1)(B)(emphasis added).          The centerpiece of IDEA is the\n\nIndividualized Education Plan, which describes the disabled\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fchild's academic goals and special education services.                        The\n\nstatute     establishes     an    elaborate        mechanism      for    parental\n\ninvolvement by designating parents as part of the Individualized\n\nEducation    Plan   team,   see   id.     §    1414(d)(1)(B)(i),        requiring\n\nrevision of the IEP to address information provided either by or\n\nto parents regarding the child's educational needs and services,\n\nsee id. § 1414(d)(4)(A)(ii)(III), and mandating that parents\n\nmust be \"members of any group that makes decisions on the\n\neducational    placement    of    their       child,\"   id.   §   1414(f).     In\n\naddition to extensive procedures for parental involvement in the\n\nIndividualized Education Plan, IDEA also ensures the central\n\nrole of parents by requiring parental consent to educational\n\nevaluations, see id. § 1414(a)(1)(c)(i) & (c)(3), assigning a\n\nsurrogate parent to \"protect the rights of the child\" when the\n\nchild's parents are not known or cannot be located, see 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(b)(2), and mandating \"an opportunity for the\n\nparents of a child with a disability to examine all records\n\nrelating to such child,\" id. § 1415(b)(1).              IDEA also authorizes\n\nthe Secretary of Education to make grants to support \"parent\n\ntraining and information centers\" to help parents understand\n\ntheir     child's   disability,      participate         in    decision-making\n\nprocesses    and    the   development         of   individualized       education\n\nprograms, and utilize IDEA's procedural safeguards.                     See id. §\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f1482.       In sum, Weber's claim easily meets the \"arguably within\n\nthe zone of interests\" standard, and she would have standing\n\nunder IDEA to bring her retaliation complaint.\n\n                 Furthermore, the IDEA complaint provision in subchapter\n\nII affords the \"opportunity to present complaints with respect\n\nto any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or\n\neducational placement of the child, or the provision of a free\n\nappropriate         public    education       to   such     child.\"    See    id.    §\n\n1415(b)(6) (emphasis added).                 Weber's claim of retaliation is\n\nliterally         \"related\"    to     the   \"identification,      evaluation,       or\n\neducational placement of [her] child,\" and to her efforts to\n\ngain    for      him   \"the   provision       of   a   free   appropriate     public\n\neducation.\"         As Weber has completely failed to explain to us why\n\nshe does not therefore have relief that is available through an\n\nIDEA due process hearing that must be exhausted, 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1445(k), (l), we conclude that Weber had to invoke the due\n\nprocess hearing procedures of IDEA before filing her retaliation\n\nclaim       in    federal     court    pursuant        to   Section   504    of   the\n\nRehabilitation Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.11\n\n                 We are tempted to leave it at that.             For the sake of\n\nclarity and completeness, however, we note that the relief\n\n\n       11\n      Once the state due process procedures were completed,\nWeber could have included in her array of federal claims a cause\nof action under IDEA itself. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n                                            -24-\n\favailable question might be a close one if Weber had presented\n\nany arguments on it.       That is so because there are exceptions to\n\nthe    IDEA   exhaustion    requirement      based    on    the    concept   of\n\nfutility.     A plaintiff does not have to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies if she can show that the agency's adoption of an\n\nunlawful general policy or practice would make resort to the\n\nagency futile, or that the administrative remedies afforded by\n\nsubchapter II of IDEA are inadequate given the relief sought.12\n\nSee Christopher W. v. Portsmouth Sch. Comm., 877 F.2d 1089, 1094\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).     This latter form of futility overlaps with the\n\n\"relief available\" language of § 1415(l) in the sense that\n\nrelief is not available within the meaning of § 1415(l) if the\n\ndue process hearing provided by subchapter II of IDEA does not\n\nprovide relief that addresses the claim of the complainant.\n\nThis    conclusion   follows    from   the    logic    of    the   exhaustion\n\nrequirement set forth in § 1415(l).           It would make no sense to\n\nrequire, in the language of § 1415(l), a party with a claim\n\n\n\n\n       12\n      The legislative history indicates a particular concern\nwith futility. Senator Williams, the principal author of the\nEducation of the Handicapped Act, the predecessor statute to\nIDEA, stated that \"exhaustion of the administrative procedures\nestablished under this part should not be required for any\nindividual complainant filing a judicial action in cases where\nsuch exhaustion would be futile either as a legal or practical\nmatter.\" 121 Cong. Rec. 37416 (1975)(quoted in Christopher W.,\n877 F.2d at 1094).\n\n                                   -25-\n\f“under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n\n1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other\n\nFederal statutes protecting the rights of children and youth\n\nwith disabilities” to first participate in an IDEA due process\n\nhearing if the relief available through such a hearing would not\n\naddress the claim of the party.\n\n         The district court found that Weber did not meet any\n\nof the futility exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.    On\n\nappeal, Weber does not challenge this conclusion despite the\n\nfact that the regulations regarding due process hearings under\n\nIDEA do not appear to read \"related\" broadly.     Instead, they\n\nseem to provide for due process hearings that directly challenge\n\nproposals or decisions about the child's educational situation.\n\nSee 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.503, 300.507; R.I. Code R. 08 010 002-47\n\n(prior notice), -50 (Impartial due process hearing).     In the\n\nface of these provisions, a hearing officer might refuse to\n\nconsider a claim of retaliation like Weber's.    Cf. Rockbridge\n\nCounty Public Schools, EHLR 401:248 (1987) (state review of\n\nhearing officer's decision holding that complaints about parent\n\naccess to records and other procedural violations were outside\n\nthe hearing officer's jurisdiction under Virginia regulations).\n\nThe difficult issue in this case is not    who has standing to\n\n\n\n\n                             -26-\n\fbring a complaint (the only issue that Weber raises), but rather\n\nwhat is the scope of the hearing provided.\n\n               Weber does not point to these regulations (or anything\n\nelse) to establish that the relief she seeks is not available\n\nbecause the regulations limit the scope of the due process\n\nhearing provided by IDEA.          Nor does she argue that pursuing a\n\ndue process hearing would be unduly burdensome due to the school\n\ndistrict's purportedly retaliatory tactics.             Cf. Honig v. Doe,\n\n484 U.S. 305, 326-27 (1988) (burden of demonstrating exception\n\nfrom        exhaustion   requirement     on   party    seeking     to    avoid\n\nrequirement); Christopher W. v. Portsmouth Sch. Comm., 877 F.2d\n\n1089, 1095 (1st Cir. 1989) (exceptions to exhaustion requirement\n\ninclude cases in which further agency proceedings may be futile,\n\nand in which exhaustion will work severe harm upon a litigant).\n\nWe   refuse     to   construct   these   arguments    for   her,   see   e.g.,\n\nMassachusetts School of Law at Andover v. American Bar Ass'n,\n\n142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998), and take no position on their\n\nmerits.13\n\n\n       13\n      Weber also failed to raise the argument on appeal that a\ndue process hearing was futile, or that exhaustion was not\nrequired by the terms of § 1415(l), because she could not\nrecover monetary damages through such a proceeding, despite a\ndemand in her complaint for compensatory and punitive damages\nand an assertion in her complaint that she could not recover\nsuch damages through a due process hearing. The Third Circuit\nhas held that \"in a § 1983 action to enforce IDEA, . . .\ncompensatory damages are available to remedy IDEA violations,\"\n\n                                    -27-\n\f           In light of the arguments made, therefore, we must\n\nconclude   that   Weber     had     to   comply   with   the   exhaustion\n\nrequirement of § 1415(l).         Anticipating the possibility of this\n\nruling, Weber suggests that she complied with this requirement\n\nthrough the numerous administrative complaints that she filed.\n\nThis argument fails.      Although Weber filed three CRP complaints\n\nwith the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation, two complaints with the Office of Equity and Access,\n\nand   participated     in     a      mediation    on     the   issue   of\n\ndeclassification, she never initiated the due process hearing\n\ndescribed in IDEA.   IDEA's mandate is explicit: plaintiffs must\n\n\n\nbut \"IDEA itself makes no mention of such relief. Hence by its\nplain terms § 1415(f) does not require exhaustion where the\nrelief sought is unavailable in an administrative proceeding.\"\nW.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 494, 496 (3d Cir. 1995). The Ninth\nCircuit held that a plaintiff seeking only monetary damages for\nviolations of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 did not have to comply\nwith the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement of\nIDEA because \"under the IDEA, monetary damages are not\navailable, so exhaustion is not required.\"      Witte v. Clark\nCounty Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir. 1999).       In\nCharlie F. v. Board of Educ. Of Skokie Sch. Dist. 68, 98 F.3d\n989, 991 (7th Cir. 1996), the Seventh Circuit concluded \"that\ndamages are not 'relief that is available under' the IDEA,\" but\nnevertheless required exhaustion where plaintiff sought only\nmonetary damages.     The court held that \"what relief is\n'available' does not necessarily depend on what the aggrieved\nparty wants.\" Id. at 991. We do not have to decide whether\ndamages are available for a violation of IDEA, and the\nrelationship of that determination to the exhaustion requirement\nof IDEA, because Weber never raised this exhaustion issue on\nappeal.\n\n                                    -28-\n\fexhaust IDEA's impartial due process hearing procedures in order\n\nto bring a civil action under subchapter II of IDEA or any \"such\n\nlaw[] seeking relief that is also available\" under subchapter II\n\nof IDEA.       20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).\n\n                     The   case    law    confirms   that      state   and     federal\n\ncomplaint procedures other than the IDEA due process hearing do\n\nnot suffice for exhaustion purposes.                 Even the CRP procedures\n\n(formerly known as EDGAR), which implement IDEA, are \"not an\n\nadequate alternative to exhausting administrative remedies under\n\nIDEA.\"       Association for Community Living in Colo. v. Romer, 992\n\nF.2d        1040,    1043-44      (10th   Cir.    1993)(analyzing        the     EDGAR\n\nprovisions); Megan v. Independent Sch. Dist., 57 F. Supp. 2d\n\n776, 790 (D. Minn. 1999)(reaching the same conclusion after the\n\namendments          that   converted      EDGAR   into   the    CRP    implementing\n\nregulations of IDEA).14             In Christopher W. v. Portsmouth School\n\nCommittee, 877 F.2d 1089, 1099 (1st Cir. 1989), we held that a\n\nplaintiff who had failed to pursue a due process hearing but had\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      The rationale for the strict exhaustion requirement has\nbeen variously explained.     In Christopher W. v. Portsmouth\nSchool Committee, 877 F.2d 1089, 1094 (1st Cir. 1989), we\nexplained that exhaustion \"enables the agency to develop a\nfactual record, to apply its expertise to the problem, to\nexercise its discretion, and to correct its own mistakes, and is\ncredited with promoting accuracy, efficiency, agency autonomy,\nand judicial economy.\"\n\n                                          -29-\n\ffiled   an   EDGAR   complaint   had   not   satisfactorily   exhausted\n\nadministrative remedies.\n\n             Therefore, based on the statutory language and case\n\nprecedent, we conclude that Weber's complaints pursuant to the\n\nfederal CRP and the Rhode Island complaint procedure did not\n\nfulfill the IDEA exhaustion requirement.           The district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment to defendants on Count IV of\n\nWeber's complaint, and we affirm without prejudice as to any\n\nfuture action Weber might bring after satisfying the exhaustion\n\nrequirement.\n\n             Affirmed.   Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\f",

Weber, filed a seven-count complaint in the district court for the District of Rhode Island against the Cranston School Committee, committee members, and Cranston city officials in their individual and official capacities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12131-12134, Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1400-1415. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants as to all counts in Weber's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber limited her appeal from the district court's decision to Count IV, a claim of illegal retaliation pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. Count IV of the complaint charges that the defendants retaliated against Weber for her complaints about the school district's failure to implement her son's Individualized Education Plan by denying her access to her son's school records, restricting her communications with his teachers, and threatening to report her to the state child welfare agency. The district court found that Weber's illegal retaliation claim merely rephrased prior claims that the district court had already rejected, namely her Count II claim that the defendants' retaliation infringed on her First Amendment rights and her Count III claim that she was denied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because other parents could access their children's records and teachers. Alternatively, the district court ruled that Weber's Count IV claim was barred because of her failure to exhaust administrative remedies specified by IDEA. IDEA requires such exhaustion prior to bringing a civil action pursuant to other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities if the relief sought is available under subchapter II of IDEA, entitled \"Assistance for Education of All Children with Disabilities.\" See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(l). Such relief is sought through the administrative due process hearing provided in subchapter II of IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f). Agreeing with this alternative ruling on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has a complicated and contentious history. Samuel Weber entered the Cranston public school system (\"CPS\") on January 6, 1993, identified as a disabled child in need of special education services under IDEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Samuel received an Individualized Education Plan (the \"Plan\") pursuant to IDEA that described his educational objectives for the school year and the services necessary to achieve these objectives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> One of the services specified in Samuel's Plan was phonics instruction. After Weber approved Samuel's 1993-94 Plan, Principal Margaret Day told Weber that the school system planned to \"mainstream\" Samuel by removing him from his special education classroom and integrating him into a standard curriculum class. In addition, Weber learned that CPS was instituting a new language curriculum which did not include phonics. Shortly after Samuel was moved into a standard curriculum class, Weber met again with Principal Day and Samuel's teachers to discuss her concern about his phonics instruction under his Plan and the effects of mainstreaming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the conference, Weber remained dissatisfied with Samuel's phonics instruction. She contacted the Director of the Cranston School Committee's Special Education Services who assured her that CPS would schedule a meeting to discuss her concerns following the series of three meetings required to complete Samuel's education evaluation and Plan. On February 10, 1994, after attending the initial meeting to evaluate Samuel's test results, Weber filed a complaint pursuant to the federal complaint resolution procedure (\"CRP\") with the Office of Special Needs at the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The complaint alleged that CPS had not followed Samuel's Individualized Education Plan with regard to phonics instruction or the provision of quarterly progress reports. Following an investigation, the Department found that CPS had complied with federal and state law. Weber did not appeal this decision to the Rhode Island Secretary of Education or pursue a due process hearing pursuant to IDEA. See infra Part III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber next met with Principal Day, Cheryl Calvano, Director of the Cranston School Committee's Special Education Services, and Samuel's teachers. Pursuant to an agreement reached at that meeting that Samuel would transfer to the Norwood Avenue School, he entered a standard curriculum third-grade class in September 1994. In October, Weber met with Calvano and other school staff to review Samuel's progress. Following this meeting, Weber filed a second CRP complaint alleging that CPS had denied her access to Samuel's educational records. The Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education once again found CPS to be in compliance with the relevant state and federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Weber filed the second complaint, officials at the Norwood Avenue School allowed her to inspect Samuel's cumulative record file and a confidential file. In the confidential file, Weber found a handwritten note dated March 24, 1994, stating, \"Agenda - Put parent on defensive,\" \"shut her down,\" and a reference to a \"restraining order.\" Weber responded to this note with a third CRP complaint seeking permanent removal of the handwritten note from Samuel's file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contended that the note was the product of a meeting held to discuss \"legal avenues or other relief\" to address the \"mounting burden of time imposed [by Weber's] telephone calls, letters, threats, harassment, and administrative litigation.\" Weber alleged that the defendants adopted a \"secret agenda\" of intimidation and retaliation. She specifically alleged that on March 28, 1994, a few days after the date of the handwritten note, Cranston's Assistant City Solicitor threatened to report her to the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families in an off-the-record discussion during a due process hearing for her disabled daughter, D.W. The Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education ordered the removal of the note, as well as the provision of a good faith hearing for Weber to express her grievances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the third complaint, Weber decided that she wanted Samuel \"declassified\" as a disabled student and requested mediation to accomplish this action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> One day prior to the scheduled mediation, Weber went to the Norwood Avenue School to see Principal Laura Albanese. Albanese's secretary directed Weber to a meeting room, where she found Calvano, Albanese, and Samuel's teachers. Weber believed that this was an Individualized Education Plan meeting to which she had not been invited, and that this action indicated that CPS did not intend to provide a good faith hearing on her grievances. The next day at the mediation, Weber offered to allow Cranston to provide any services that they felt were necessary if they would agree to declassify Samuel as a disabled student. CPS refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the mediation, Weber alleged that Principal Albanese denied her access to Samuel's records. She filed one complaint with the Rhode Island Office of Equity and Access regarding access to Samuel's records, the refusal to terminate Samuel's Individualized Education Plan, and CPS's lack of good faith; she also filed a second complaint on behalf of her daughter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Office of Equity and Access issued a written decision finding that CPS's actions with regard to Samuel constituted prohibited retaliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> CPS appealed. At the time that the parties' filed their briefs before us, this appeal was still pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1995, Weber requested an independent evaluation of Samuel, who was now in third grade. The testing revealed that Samuel read at an eighth-grade level, spelled at a seventh-grade level, and did arithmetic at a third-grade level. In September 1995, Samuel's parents placed him in a private school. Subsequently, Weber requested that CPS declassify Samuel. In March 1996, CPS concluded that Samuel was not disabled under IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, Weber filed her complaint in the district court for the District of Rhode Island, including her Count IV claim that CPS retaliated against her for enforcing her disabled child's rights under IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The disposition of Count IV is the only issue on appeal. The defendants challenge Weber's standing under Section 504 to pursue a claim of retaliation on her own behalf rather than on behalf of her disabled son. If Weber does have standing under Section 504, the defendants argue that she still cannot prevail because she failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by IDEA, which specifies that a party seeking relief under the Rehabilitation Act must exhaust the administrative remedies provided by IDEA if the relief sought in the Rehabilitation Act claim is available under subchapter II of IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(l). Weber maintains that she has standing to bring her retaliation claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She further argues that her suit is not barred by the IDEA requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies because she would not have standing to bring a retaliation claim in her individual capacity pursuant to IDEA, and hence the relief she seeks under the Rehabilitation Act is not available to her under subchapter II of IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, see EEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141 (1st Cir. 1997), and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, see Champagne v. Servistar Corp., 138 F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. A Parent's Standing to Sue in Her Individual Capacity under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber alleges that CPS violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by responding to her complaints relating to Samuel's education with a retaliatory policy to \"put parent on defensive\" and to \"shut her down,\" restrictions on her access to school records, and a threat to report her to the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families. Relying on the language of the statute, the defendants insist that Weber lacks standing under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act because she is not a \"qualified person with a disability\" as defined by Section 504.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> They argue that she cannot seek redress under Section 504 for retaliation that has harmed her rather than her disabled child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To assess this standing argument, we must evaluate the interaction between Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Department of Education regulations. The Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against the disabled. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates that, \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(a). The Rehabilitation Act was amended in 1978 to incorporate the \"remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2000d et seq.].\" Id. &#167; 794a(2). The anti-retaliation regulation adopted pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Section 601 of [the Civil Rights] Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">34 C.F.R. &#167; 100.7(e). This regulation also applies to any right or privilege secured by the Rehabilitation Act. See id. &#167; 104.61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This broadly protective anti-retaliation regulation is firmly grounded in the enforcement provisions of Title VI and the Rehabilitation Act. Title VI extends its remedies to \"any person aggrieved\" by violations of the Act. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-2 (stating that \"any person aggrieved . . . may obtain judicial review of [any department or agency] action in accordance with chapter 7 of Title 5.\"). The Rehabilitation Act extends its remedies to \"any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance . . . under section 794 of this title.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794a(a)(2). Courts have construed the phrase \"any person aggrieved\" as an expression of Congressional intent to accord standing to the fullest extent permitted by the case and controversy provision of Article III. See e.g., Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 208 (1972) (holding that the term \"aggrieved person\" in &#167; 810(a) of the Fair Housing Act, which the Act defined to include \"[a]ny person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice,\" demonstrated Congressional intent to confer standing to the fullest extent permitted by Article III); Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., 445 F.2d 442, 446 (3d Cir. 1971) (reaching the same conclusion regarding Title VII's language of \"a person claiming to be aggrieved [under the Act].\"); see also Gray v. Greyhound Lines, East, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (same). Consistent with the broad construction of the statutory enforcement language of Title VI and the Rehabilitation Act, the anti-retaliation regulation applies to \"any individual\" who has been intimidated, threatened, coerced, or discriminated against \"for the purpose of interfering with [protected rights]\" under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act or the Rehabilitation Act. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 100.7(e); see id. &#167; 104.61 (incorporating the Title VI anti-retaliation regulation into the Rehabilitation Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the broad remedial provisions of Title VI and the Rehabilitation Act and the breadth of the anti-retaliation regulation adopted pursuant to those laws, it is not surprising that courts have accorded standing to non-disabled individuals suing because of retaliation for attempts to vindicate the rights of a disabled person. In Hoyt v. St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center, 711 F.2d 864, 865 (8th Cir. 1983), the hospital shortened the plaintiff's visiting time with a patient after she complained about the patient's care. The court stated that the plaintiff, as the \"next friend and daily visitor\" of the disabled patient, had standing under Section 504 to assert a claim of retaliation against her personally for complaints made on behalf of the patient. Id. at 867 (but ruling against the plaintiff's Section 504 claim for insufficient evidence that the retaliation was motivated by any complaints relating to discrimination against the patient); see also Ross v. Allen, 515 F. Supp. 972, 976 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (granting standing to a school psychologist who was dismissed after she complained to the Board of Education about the suspension of a deaf student for behavioral problems). In Whitehead v. School Board for Hillsborough County, 918 F. Supp. 1515, 1522 (M.D. Fl. 1996), the court granted standing to the parents of a child with Down's Syndrome who sought damages under Section 504 for retaliation against them in their capacity as parents, noting that, \"There is no limitation under [34 C.F.R. 100.7(e)] that retaliatory acts are only prohibited against the handicapped individual on whose behalf the &#167; 504 complaint is being raised.\" But see Sanders v. Marquette Public Schs., 561 F. Supp. 1361, 1370 (W.D. Mich. 1983)(allowing standing for a disabled child, but denying it to her father who sought recovery for emotional distress and the expense of alternative schooling).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Congress could have limited the remedial provisions of the Rehabilitation Act to claims brought by or on behalf of disabled individuals, it did not do so in apparent recognition of the fact that disabled individuals may need assistance in vindicating their rights from individuals who may have their own claim to relief under the Act. The anti-retaliation regulation set forth in 34 C.F.R. &#167; 100.7(e) is consistent with this recognition. It is a practical reality that recipients of federal funds sometimes respond to complaints about their treatment of a disabled child by retaliating against the disabled child, the initiator of the complaint (who is often a parent), or both. We hold, therefore, that Weber has standing to pursue her retaliation claim under Section 504. We now turn to the question of whether Weber must exhaust the administrative remedies provided by subchapter II of IDEA before filing a Section 504 retaliation claim in her individual capacity in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. IDEA Requirement of Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory provisions of subchapter II of IDEA are attentive to the details of administrative process. Section 1415(b)(6) requires states to provide the \"opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the [disabled] child . . . .\" The IDEA due process hearing provision, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f)(1), mandates that parents who have filed a complaint under IDEA \"shall have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing . . . conducted by the State educational agency or by the local educational agency, as determined by State law or by the State educational agency.\" A party to an IDEA due process hearing has the right to present evidence, and to confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses; the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities; the right to a written, or at the option of the parents, electronic verbatim record of such hearing; and the right to a written or, at the option of the parents, electronic findings of fact and decisions. See id. &#167; 1415(h). The hearing officer may not be an employee of the state or local educational agency involved in the care or education of the disabled child. See id. &#167; 1415(f)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IDEA requires recourse to this due process hearing when plaintiffs seek relief available under subchapter II of IDEA even if the suit is brought pursuant to a different statute. See id. Section 1415(l) reads:Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of children and youth with disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is available under this subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and (g) of this section shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber argues that she does not have to meet the IDEA exhaustion requirement because, as a parent, she does not have standing to file her own retaliation claim under IDEA, and hence the relief she seeks with her Section 504 claim is not available to her under IDEA. We reject her standing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the Rehabilitation Act, IDEA lacks a broad enforcement provision granting standing to \"any person aggrieved\" by violations of the Act, or an implementing regulation that protects any individual who has been intimidated, threatened, coerced or discriminated against because she made a complaint under the Act. The issue confronting us, therefore, is whether there is a basis in the language and statutory framework of IDEA for Weber to file a retaliation claim in her individual capacity. We first look to the basic principles of standing to determine whether Weber may file such a retaliation claim under IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Standing doctrine encompasses both constitutional and prudential requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The constitutional standing rules ensure the existence of a concrete \"case or controversy\" as required by Article III: \"[A]t an irreducible minimum, Art. III requires the party who invokes the court's authority to show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant, and that the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Weber meets these constitutional requirements: the alleged retaliation resulted in \"injury in fact\" which can be redressed through the declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief requested by Weber for all counts of her complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the constitutional requirements, the standing inquiry encompasses prudential considerations aimed at preventing courts from adjudicating \"questions of broad social import where no individual rights would be vindicated.\" Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 804 (1985). To meet the prudential requirements, the plaintiff's challenge must rest on her own legal rights and interests, not the rights of third parties, see Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975), and the harm asserted cannot be a \"generalized grievance\" shared in equal measure by all or a large class of citizens, id. The claim must also fall within \"the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question,\" Association of Data Processing Serv. Org., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970). The zone of interests test does not require \"an indication of Congressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff;\" instead, the \"proper inquiry is simply whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected . . . by the statute.\" National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 492 (1998) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration and emphasis in original). Only this last element, the zone of interests, is at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, we review the language and structure of IDEA to determine whether Weber's retaliation claim falls within the zone of interests protected by IDEA. That review reveals the central role played by parents in assuring that their disabled child receives a \"free appropriate public education,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(A). The IDEA statement of purposes explicitly recognizes the statute's mission \"to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" Id. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(B)(emphasis added). The centerpiece of IDEA is the Individualized Education Plan, which describes the disabled child's academic goals and special education services. The statute establishes an elaborate mechanism for parental involvement by designating parents as part of the Individualized Education Plan team, see id. &#167; 1414(d)(1)(B)(i), requiring revision of the IEP to address information provided either by or to parents regarding the child's educational needs and services, see id. &#167; 1414(d)(4)(A)(ii)(III), and mandating that parents must be \"members of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of their child,\" id. &#167; 1414(f). In addition to extensive procedures for parental involvement in the Individualized Education Plan, IDEA also ensures the central role of parents by requiring parental consent to educational evaluations, see id. &#167; 1414(a)(1)(c)(i) &amp; (c)(3), assigning a surrogate parent to \"protect the rights of the child\" when the child's parents are not known or cannot be located, see 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(b)(2), and mandating \"an opportunity for the parents of a child with a disability to examine all records relating to such child,\" id. &#167; 1415(b)(1). IDEA also authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to support \"parent training and information centers\" to help parents understand their child's disability, participate in decision-making processes and the development of individualized education programs, and utilize IDEA's procedural safeguards. See id. &#167; 1482. In sum, Weber's claim easily meets the \"arguably within the zone of interests\" standard, and she would have standing under IDEA to bring her retaliation complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the IDEA complaint provision in subchapter II affords the \"opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\" See id. &#167; 1415(b)(6) (emphasis added). Weber's claim of retaliation is literally \"related\" to the \"identification, evaluation, or educational placement of [her] child,\" and to her efforts to gain for him \"the provision of a free appropriate public education.\" As Weber has completely failed to explain to us why she does not therefore have relief that is available through an IDEA due process hearing that must be exhausted, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1445(k), (l), we conclude that Weber had to invoke the due process hearing procedures of IDEA before filing her retaliation claim in federal court pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are tempted to leave it at that. For the sake of clarity and completeness, however, we note that the relief available question might be a close one if Weber had presented any arguments on it. That is so because there are exceptions to the IDEA exhaustion requirement based on the concept of futility. A plaintiff does not have to exhaust administrative remedies if she can show that the agency's adoption of an unlawful general policy or practice would make resort to the agency futile, or that the administrative remedies afforded by subchapter II of IDEA are inadequate given the relief sought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> See Christopher W. v. Portsmouth Sch. Comm., 877 F.2d 1089, 1094 (1st Cir. 1989). This latter form of futility overlaps with the \"relief available\" language of &#167; 1415(l) in the sense that relief is not available within the meaning of &#167; 1415(l) if the due process hearing provided by subchapter II of IDEA does not provide relief that addresses the claim of the complainant. This conclusion follows from the logic of the exhaustion requirement set forth in &#167; 1415(l). It would make no sense to require, in the language of &#167; 1415(l), a party with a claim \"under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of children and youth with disabilities\" to first participate in an IDEA due process hearing if the relief available through such a hearing would not address the claim of the party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Weber did not meet any of the futility exceptions to the exhaustion requirement. On appeal, Weber does not challenge this conclusion despite the fact that the regulations regarding due process hearings under IDEA do not appear to read \"related\" broadly. Instead, they seem to provide for due process hearings that directly challenge proposals or decisions about the child's educational situation. See 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.503, 300.507; R.I. Code R. 08 010 002-47 (prior notice), -50 (Impartial due process hearing). In the face of these provisions, a hearing officer might refuse to consider a claim of retaliation like Weber's. Cf. Rockbridge County Public Schools, EHLR 401:248 (1987) (state review of hearing officer's decision holding that complaints about parent access to records and other procedural violations were outside the hearing officer's jurisdiction under Virginia regulations). The difficult issue in this case is not who has standing to bring a complaint (the only issue that Weber raises), but rather what is the scope of the hearing provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber does not point to these regulations (or anything else) to establish that the relief she seeks is not available because the regulations limit the scope of the due process hearing provided by IDEA. Nor does she argue that pursuing a due process hearing would be unduly burdensome due to the school district's purportedly retaliatory tactics. Cf. Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 326-27 (1988) (burden of demonstrating exception from exhaustion requirement on party seeking to avoid requirement); Christopher W. v. Portsmouth Sch. Comm., 877 F.2d 1089, 1095 (1st Cir. 1989) (exceptions to exhaustion requirement include cases in which further agency proceedings may be futile, and in which exhaustion will work severe harm upon a litigant). We refuse to construct these arguments for her, see e.g., Massachusetts School of Law at Andover v. American Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998), and take no position on their merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the arguments made, therefore, we must conclude that Weber had to comply with the exhaustion requirement of &#167; 1415(l). Anticipating the possibility of this ruling, Weber suggests that she complied with this requirement through the numerous administrative complaints that she filed. This argument fails. Although Weber filed three CRP complaints with the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, two complaints with the Office of Equity and Access, and participated in a mediation on the issue of declassification, she never initiated the due process hearing described in IDEA. IDEA's mandate is explicit: plaintiffs must exhaust IDEA's impartial due process hearing procedures in order to bring a civil action under subchapter II of IDEA or any \"such law[] seeking relief that is also available\" under subchapter II of IDEA. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law confirms that state and federal complaint procedures other than the IDEA due process hearing do not suffice for exhaustion purposes. Even the CRP procedures (formerly known as EDGAR), which implement IDEA, are \"not an adequate alternative to exhausting administrative remedies under IDEA.\" Association for Community Living in Colo. v. Romer, 992 F.2d 1040, 1043-44 (10th Cir. 1993)(analyzing the EDGAR provisions); Megan v. Independent Sch. Dist., 57 F. Supp. 2d 776, 790 (D. Minn. 1999)(reaching the same conclusion after the amendments that converted EDGAR into the CRP implementing regulations of IDEA).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In Christopher W. v. Portsmouth School Committee, 877 F.2d 1089, 1099 (1st Cir. 1989), we held that a plaintiff who had failed to pursue a due process hearing but had filed an EDGAR complaint had not satisfactorily exhausted administrative remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, based on the statutory language and case precedent, we conclude that Weber's complaints pursuant to the federal CRP and the Rhode Island complaint procedure did not fulfill the IDEA exhaustion requirement. The district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on Count IV of Weber's complaint, and we affirm without prejudice as to any future action Weber might bring after satisfying the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

These regulations were formerly known as the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (\"EDGAR\"). The EDGAR procedures provided \"an administrative mechanism for assuring that a state complies with state-administered federal programs, including the [IDEA, but were] distinguished from the specific administrative procedures detailed in the [IDEA] itself.\" Christopher W. v. Portsmouth Sch. Comm., 877 F.2d 1089, 1090 n.2 (1st Cir. 1989). The July 8, 1992 amendments to EDGAR relocated these regulations to 34 C.F.R. Part 300, the implementing regulations for IDEA. While the EDGAR procedures applied to many statutes, the CRP regulations provide a procedure (distinct from the IDEA due process hearing) for filing complaints under IDEA. Under 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.660 and 300.662, states must adopt a written complaint resolution procedure for receiving and resolving complaints that the state or a local agency is violating IDEA or its regulations. The state's procedure must limit the time for state investigation and resolution of complaints to sixty days, with extension only for \"exceptional circumstances.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.661(a)-(c). If either the complainant or the opposing school body is not satisfied with the state's resolution, he or she may request review of the state educational agency's decision by the U.S. Secretary of Education.

The inter-relationship between the Office of Equity and Access statutory complaint process and the CRP regulations of the Board of Regents is not entirely clear. Based on the materials available to us, it appears that the Board of Regents regulations only implement IDEA, while the Office of Equity and Access complaint procedure applies generally to the state's anti-discrimination law.

Senator Williams, the principal author of the Education of the Handicapped Act, the predecessor statute to IDEA, stated that \"exhaustion of the administrative procedures established under this part should not be required for any individual complainant filing a judicial action in cases where such exhaustion would be futile either as a legal or practical matter.\" 121 Cong. Rec. 37416 (1975)(quoted in Christopher W., 877 F.2d at 1094).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Weber also failed to raise the argument on appeal that a due process hearing was futile, or that exhaustion was not required by the terms of &#167; 1415(l), because she could not recover monetary damages through such a proceeding, despite a demand in her complaint for compensatory and punitive damages and an assertion in her complaint that she could not recover such damages through a due process hearing. The Third Circuit has held that \"in a &#167; 1983 action to enforce IDEA, . . . compensatory damages are available to remedy IDEA violations,\" but \"IDEA itself makes no mention of such relief. Hence by its plain terms &#167; 1415(f) does not require exhaustion where the relief sought is unavailable in an administrative proceeding.\" W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 494, 496 (3d Cir. 1995). The Ninth Circuit held that a plaintiff seeking only monetary damages for violations of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 did not have to comply with the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement of IDEA because \"under the IDEA, monetary damages are not available, so exhaustion is not required.\" Witte v. Clark County Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir. 1999). In Charlie F. v. Board of Educ. Of Skokie Sch. Dist. 68, 98 F.3d 989, 991 (7th Cir. 1996), the Seventh Circuit concluded \"that damages are not 'relief that is available under' the IDEA,\" but nevertheless required exhaustion where plaintiff sought only monetary damages. The court held that \"what relief is 'available' does not necessarily depend on what the aggrieved party wants.\" Id. at 991. We do not have to decide whether damages are available for a violation of IDEA, and the relationship of that determination to the exhaustion requirement of IDEA, because Weber never raised this exhaustion issue on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The rationale for the strict exhaustion requirement has been variously explained. In Christopher W. v. Portsmouth School Committee, 877 F.2d 1089, 1094 (1st Cir. 1989), we explained that exhaustion \"enables the agency to develop a factual record, to apply its expertise to the problem, to exercise its discretion, and to correct its own mistakes, and is credited with promoting accuracy, efficiency, agency autonomy, and judicial economy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Weber, filed a seven-count complaint in the district court for the District of Rhode Island against the Cranston School Committee, committee members, and Cranston city officials in their individual and official capacities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12131-12134, Section 504 of the RehabilitationAct, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1400-1415. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants as to all counts in Weber's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber limited her appeal from the district court's decision to Count IV, a claim of illegal retaliation pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. Count IV of the complaint charges that the defendants retaliated against Weber for her complaints about the school district's failure to implement her son's Individualized Education Plan by denying her access to her son's school records, restricting her communications with his teachers, and threatening to report her to the state child welfare agency. The district court found that Weber's illegal retaliation claim merely rephrased prior claims that the district court had already rejected, namely her Count II claim that the defendants' retaliation infringed on her First Amendment rights and her Count III claim that she was denied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because other parents could access their children's records and teachers. Alternatively, the district court ruled that Weber's Count IV claim was barred because of her failure to exhaust administrative remedies specified by IDEA. IDEA requires such exhaustion prior to bringing a civil action pursuant to other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities if the relief sought is available under subchapter II of IDEA, entitled \"Assistance for Education of All Children with Disabilities.\" See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(l). Such relief is sought through the administrative due process hearing provided in subchapter II of IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f). Agreeing with this alternative ruling on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has a complicated and contentious history. Samuel Weber entered the Cranston public school system (\"CPS\") on January 6, 1993, identified as a disabled child in need of special education services under IDEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Samuel received an Individualized Education Plan (the \"Plan\") pursuant to IDEA that described his educational objectives for the school year and the services necessary to achieve these objectives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> One of the services specified in Samuel's Plan was phonics instruction. After Weber approved Samuel's 1993-94 Plan, Principal Margaret Day told Weber that the school system planned to \"mainstream\" Samuel by removing him from his special education classroom and integrating him into a standard curriculum class. In addition, Weber learned that CPS was instituting a new language curriculum which did not include phonics. Shortly after Samuel was moved into a standard curriculum class, Weber met again with Principal Day and Samuel's teachers to discuss her concern about his phonics instruction under his Plan and the effects of mainstreaming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the conference, Weber remained dissatisfied with Samuel's phonics instruction. She contacted the Director of the Cranston School Committee's Special Education Services who assured her that CPS would schedule a meeting to discuss her concerns following the series of three meetings required to complete Samuel's education evaluation and Plan. On February 10, 1994, after attending the initial meeting to evaluate Samuel's test results, Weber filed a complaint pursuant to the federal complaint resolution procedure (\"CRP\") with the Office of Special Needs at the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The complaint alleged that CPS had not followed Samuel's Individualized Education Plan with regard to phonics instruction or the provision of quarterly progress reports. Following an investigation, the Department found that CPS had complied with federal and state law. Weber did not appeal this decision to the Rhode Island Secretary of Education or pursue a due process hearing pursuant to IDEA. See infra Part III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber next met with Principal Day, Cheryl Calvano, Director of the Cranston School Committee's Special Education Services, and Samuel's teachers. Pursuant to an agreement reached at that meeting that Samuel would transfer to the Norwood Avenue School, he entered a standard curriculum third-grade class in September 1994. In October, Weber met with Calvano and other school staff to review Samuel's progress. Following this meeting, Weber filed a second CRP complaint alleging that CPS had denied her access to Samuel's educational records. The Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education once again found CPS to be in compliance with the relevant state and federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Weber filed the second complaint, officials at the Norwood Avenue School allowed her to inspect Samuel's cumulative record file and a confidential file. In the confidential file, Weber found a handwritten note dated March 24, 1994, stating, \"Agenda - Put parent on defensive,\" \"shut her down,\" and a reference to a \"restraining order.\" Weber responded to this note with a third CRP complaint seeking permanent removal of the handwritten note from Samuel's file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contended that the note was the product of a meeting held to discuss \"legal avenues or other relief\" to address the \"mounting burden of time imposed [by Weber's] telephone calls, letters, threats, harassment, and administrative litigation.\" Weber alleged that the defendants adopted a \"secret agenda\" of intimidation and retaliation. She specifically alleged that on March 28, 1994, a few days after the date of the handwritten note, Cranston's Assistant City Solicitor threatened to report her to the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families in an off-the-record discussion during a due process hearing for her disabled daughter, D.W. The Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education ordered the removal of the note, as well as the provision of a good faith hearing for Weber to express her grievances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the third complaint, Weber decided that she wanted Samuel \"declassified\" as a disabled student and requested mediation to accomplish this action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> One day prior to the scheduled mediation, Weber went to the Norwood Avenue School to see Principal Laura Albanese. Albanese's secretary directed Weber to a meeting room, where she found Calvano, Albanese, and Samuel's teachers. Weber believed that this was an Individualized Education Plan meeting to which she had not been invited, and that this action indicated that CPS did not intend to provide a good faith hearing on her grievances. The next day at the mediation, Weber offered to allow Cranston to provide any services that they felt were necessary if they would agree to declassify Samuel as a disabled student. CPS refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the mediation, Weber alleged that Principal Albanese denied her access to Samuel's records. She filed one complaint with the Rhode Island Office of Equity and Access regarding access to Samuel's records, the refusal to terminate Samuel's Individualized Education Plan, and CPS's lack of good faith; she also filed a second complaint on behalf of her daughter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Office of Equity and Access issued a written decision finding that CPS's actions with regard to Samuel constituted prohibited retaliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> CPS appealed. At the time that the parties' filed their briefs before us, this appeal was still pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1995, Weber requested an independent evaluation of Samuel, who was now in third grade. The testing revealed that Samuel read at an eighth-grade level, spelled at a seventh-grade level, and did arithmetic at a third-grade level. In September 1995, Samuel's parents placed him in a private school. Subsequently, Weber requested that CPS declassify Samuel. In March 1996, CPS concluded that Samuel was not disabled under IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, Weber filed her complaint in the district court for the District of Rhode Island, including her Count IV claim that CPS retaliated against her for enforcing her disabled child's rights under IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The disposition of Count IV is the only issue on appeal. The defendants challenge Weber's standing under Section 504 to pursue a claim of retaliation on her own behalf rather than on behalf of her disabled son. If Weber does have standing under Section 504, the defendants argue that she still cannot prevail because she failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by IDEA, which specifies that a party seeking relief under the Rehabilitation Act must exhaust the administrative remedies provided by IDEA if the relief sought in the Rehabilitation Act claim is available under subchapter II of IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(l). Weber maintains that she has standing to bring her retaliation claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She further argues that her suit is not barred by the IDEA requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies because she would not have standing to bring a retaliation claim in her individual capacity pursuant to IDEA, and hence the relief she seeks under the Rehabilitation Act is not available to her under subchapter II of IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, see EEOC v.

A Parent's Standing to Sue in Her Individual Capacity under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber alleges that CPS violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by responding to her complaints relating to Samuel's education with a retaliatory policy to \"put parent on defensive\" and to \"shut her down,\" restrictions on her access to school records, and a threat to report her to the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families. Relying on the language of the statute, the defendants insist that Weber lacks standing under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act because she is not a \"qualified person with a disability\" as defined by Section 504.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> They argue that she cannot seek redress under Section 504 for retaliation that has harmed her rather than her disabled child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To assess this standing argument, we must evaluate the interaction between Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Department of Education regulations. The Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against the disabled. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates that, \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(a). The Rehabilitation Act was amended in 1978 to incorporate the \"remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2000d et seq.].\" Id. &#167; 794a(2). The anti-retaliation regulation adopted pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Section 601 of [the Civil Rights] Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">34 C.F.R. &#167; 100.7(e). This regulation also applies to any right or privilege secured by the Rehabilitation Act. See id. &#167; 104.61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This broadly protective anti-retaliation regulation is firmly grounded in the enforcement provisions of Title VI and the Rehabilitation Act. Title VI extends its remedies to \"any person aggrieved\" by violations of the Act. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-2 (stating that \"any person aggrieved . . . may obtain judicial review of [any department or agency] action in accordance with chapter 7 of Title 5.\"). The Rehabilitation Act extends its remedies to \"any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance . . . under section 794 of this title.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794a(a)(2). Courts have construed the phrase \"any person aggrieved\" as an expression of Congressional intent to accord standing to the fullest extent permitted by the case and controversy provision of Article III. See e.g., Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108640\"><a href=\"/opinion/108640/trafficante-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 208 (1972) (holding that the term \"aggrieved person\" in &#167; 810(a) of the Fair Housing Act, which the Act defined to include \"[a]ny person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice,\" demonstrated Congressional intent to confer standing to the fullest extent permitted by Article III); Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297797\"><a href=\"/opinion/297797/ozzie-hackett-v-mcguire-brothers-inc-and-local-union-no-187/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 446 (3d Cir. 1971) (reaching the same conclusion regarding Title VII's language of \"a person claiming to be aggrieved [under the Act].\"); see also Gray v. Greyhound Lines, East, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340644\"><a href=\"/opinion/340644/elton-e-gray-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-other-persons-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 176 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (same). Consistent with the broad construction of the statutory enforcement language of Title VI and the Rehabilitation Act, the anti-retaliation regulation applies to \"any individual\" who has been intimidated, threatened, coerced, or discriminated against \"for the purpose of interfering with [protected rights]\" under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act or the Rehabilitation Act. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 100.7(e); see id. &#167; 104.61 (incorporating the Title VI anti-retaliation regulation into the Rehabilitation Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the broad remedial provisions of Title VI and the Rehabilitation Act and the breadth of the anti-retaliation regulation adopted pursuant to those laws, it is not surprising that courts have accorded standing to non-disabled individuals suing because of retaliation for attempts to vindicate the rights of a disabled person. In Hoyt v. St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421205\"><a href=\"/opinion/421205/jane-d-hoyt-next-friend-and-daily-visitor-to-sharon-l-siebert-v-st/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 865 (8th Cir. 1983), the hospital shortened the plaintiff's visiting time with a patient after she complained about the patient's care. The court stated that the plaintiff, as the \"next friend and daily visitor\" of the disabled patient, had standing under Section 504 to assert a claim of retaliation against her personally for complaints made on behalf of the patient. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421205\"><a href=\"/opinion/421205/jane-d-hoyt-next-friend-and-daily-visitor-to-sharon-l-siebert-v-st/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 867 </a></span>(but ruling against the plaintiff's Section 504 claim for insufficient evidence that the retaliation was motivated by any complaints relating to discrimination against the patient); see also Ross v.

In Whitehead v.

Marquette Public Schs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1894664\"><a href=\"/opinion/1894664/sanders-by-sanders-v-marquette-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mich. 1983)(allowing standing for a disabled child, but denying it to her father who sought recovery for emotional distress and the expense of alternative schooling).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Congress could have limited the remedial provisions of the Rehabilitation Act to claims brought by or on behalf of disabled individuals, it did not do so in apparent recognition of the fact that disabled individuals may need assistance in vindicating their rights from individuals who may have their own claim to relief under the Act. The anti-retaliation regulation set forth in 34 C.F.R. &#167; 100.7(e) is consistent with this recognition. It is a practical reality that recipients of federal funds sometimes respond to complaints about their treatment of a disabled child by retaliating against the disabled child, the initiator of the complaint (who is often a parent), or both. We hold, therefore, that Weber has standing to pursue her retaliation claim under Section 504. We now turn to the question of whether Weber must exhaust the administrative remedies provided by subchapter II of IDEA before filing a Section 504 retaliation claim in her individual capacity in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III.

Section 1415(b)(6) requires states to provide the \"opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the [disabled] child . . . .\" The IDEA due process hearing provision, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f)(1), mandates that parents who have filed a complaint under IDEA \"shall have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing . . . conducted by the State educational agency or by the local educational agency, as determined by State law or by the State educational agency.\" A party to an IDEA due process hearing has the right to present evidence, and to confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses; the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities; the right to a written, or at the option of the parents, electronic verbatim record of such hearing; and the right to a written or, at the option of the parents, electronic findings of fact and decisions.

Only this last element, the zone of interests, is at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, we review the language and structure of IDEA to determine whether Weber's retaliation claim falls within the zone of interests protected by IDEA. That review reveals the central role played by parents in assuring that their disabled child receives a \"free appropriate public education,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(A). The IDEA statement of purposes explicitly recognizes the statute's mission \"to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" Id. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(B)(emphasis added). The centerpiece of IDEA is the Individualized Education Plan, which describes the disabled child's academic goals and special education services. The statute establishes an elaborate mechanism for parental involvement by designating parents as part of the Individualized Education Plan team, see id. &#167; 1414(d)(1)(B)(i), requiring revision of the IEP to address information provided either by or to parents regarding the child's educational needs and services, see id. &#167; 1414(d)(4)(A)(ii)(III), and mandating that parents must be \"members of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of their child,\" id. &#167; 1414(f). In addition to extensive procedures for parental involvement in the Individualized Education Plan, IDEA also ensures the central role of parents by requiring parental consent to educational evaluations, see id. &#167; 1414(a)(1)(c)(i) &amp; (c)(3), assigning a surrogate parent to \"protect the rights of the child\" when the child's parents are not known or cannot be located, see 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(b)(2), and mandating \"an opportunity for the parents of a child with a disability to examine all records relating to such child,\" id. &#167; 1415(b)(1). IDEA also authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to support \"parent training and information centers\" to help parents understand their child's disability, participate in decision-making processes and the development of individualized education programs, and utilize IDEA's procedural safeguards. See id. &#167; 1482. In sum, Weber's claim easily meets the \"arguably within the zone of interests\" standard, and she would have standing under IDEA to bring her retaliation complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the IDEA complaint provision in subchapter II affords the \"opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.\" See id. &#167; 1415(b)(6) (emphasis added). Weber's claim of retaliation is literally \"related\" to the \"identification, evaluation, or educational placement of [her] child,\" and to her efforts to gain for him \"the provision of a free appropriate public education.\" As Weber has completely failed to explain to us why she does not therefore have relief that is available through an IDEA due process hearing that must be exhausted, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1445(k), (l), we conclude that Weber had to invoke the due process hearing procedures of IDEA before filing her retaliation claim in federal court pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are tempted to leave it at that. For the sake of clarity and completeness, however, we note that the relief available question might be a close one if Weber had presented any arguments on it. That is so because there are exceptions to the IDEA exhaustion requirement based on the concept of futility. A plaintiff does not have to exhaust administrative remedies if she can show that the agency's adoption of an unlawful general policy or practice would make resort to the agency futile, or that the administrative remedies afforded by subchapter II of IDEA are inadequate given the relief sought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> See Christopher W. v. Portsmouth Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525209\"><a href=\"/opinion/525209/christopher-w-v-portsmouth-school-committee-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span>, 1094 (1st Cir. 1989). This latter form of futility overlaps with the \"relief available\" language of &#167; 1415(l) in the sense that relief is not available within the meaning of &#167; 1415(l) if the due process hearing provided by subchapter II of IDEA does not provide relief that addresses the claim of the complainant. This conclusion follows from the logic of the exhaustion requirement set forth in &#167; 1415(l). It would make no sense to require, in the language of &#167; 1415(l), a party with a claim \"under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of children and youth with disabilities\" to first participate in an IDEA due process hearing if the relief available through such a hearing would not address the claim of the party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Weber did not meet any of the futility exceptions to the exhaustion requirement. On appeal, Weber does not challenge this conclusion despite the fact that the regulations regarding due process hearings under IDEA do not appear to read \"related\" broadly. Instead, they seem to provide for due process hearings that directly challenge proposals or decisions about the child's educational situation. See 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.503, 300.507; R.I. Code R. 08 010 002-47 (prior notice), -50 (Impartial due process hearing). In the face of these provisions, a hearing officer might refuse to consider a claim of retaliation like Weber's. Cf. Rockbridge County Public Schools, EHLR 401:248 (1987) (state review of hearing officer's decision holding that complaints about parent access to records and other procedural violations were outside the hearing officer's jurisdiction under Virginia regulations). The difficult issue in this case is not who has standing to bring a complaint (the only issue that Weber raises), but rather what is the scope of the hearing provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weber does not point to these regulations (or anything else) to establish that the relief she seeks is not available because the regulations limit the scope of the due process hearing provided by IDEA. Nor does she argue that pursuing a due process hearing would be unduly burdensome due to the school district's purportedly retaliatory tactics. Cf. Honig v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111982\"><a href=\"/opinion/111982/honig-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 326-27 (1988) (burden of demonstrating exception from exhaustion requirement on party seeking to avoid requirement); Christopher W. v.

We refuse to construct these arguments for her, see e.g., Massachusetts School of Law at Andover v. American Bar Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1998), and take no position on their merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the arguments made, therefore, we must conclude that Weber had to comply with the exhaustion requirement of &#167; 1415(l). Anticipating the possibility of this ruling, Weber suggests that she complied with this requirement through the numerous administrative complaints that she filed. This argument fails. Although Weber filed three CRP complaints with the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, two complaints with the Office of Equity and Access, and participated in a mediation on the issue of declassification, she never initiated the due process hearing described in IDEA. IDEA's mandate is explicit: plaintiffs must exhaust IDEA's impartial due process hearing procedures in order to bring a civil action under subchapter II of IDEA or any \"such law[] seeking relief that is also available\" under subchapter II of IDEA. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law confirms that state and federal complaint procedures other than the IDEA due process hearing do not suffice for exhaustion purposes.

Cir. 1999)(Agencies . . . are not constrained by Article III of the Constitution; nor are they governed by judially-created standing doctrines restricting access to the federal courts. The criteria for establishing 'administrative standing' therefore may permissibly be less demanding than the criteria for 'judicial standing.'\"). Since no one has argued that administrative proceedings under IDEA are subject to rules different than those that apply to courts, we put this possibility aside in the present case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Once the state due process procedures were completed, Weber could have included in her array of federal claims a cause of action under IDEA itself.

Senator Williams, the principal author of the Education of the Handicapped Act, the predecessor statute to IDEA, stated that \"exhaustion of the administrative procedures established under this part should not be required for any individual complainant filing a judicial action in cases where such exhaustion would be futile either as a legal or practical matter.\" 121 Cong.

The Third Circuit has held that \"in a &#167; 1983 action to enforce IDEA, . . . compensatory damages are available to remedy IDEA violations,\" but \"IDEA itself makes no mention of such relief. Hence by its plain terms &#167; 1415(f) does not require exhaustion where the relief sought is unavailable in an administrative proceeding.\" W.B. v.

The Ninth Circuit held that a plaintiff seeking only monetary damages for violations of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 did not have to comply with the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement of IDEA because \"under the IDEA, monetary damages are not available, so exhaustion is not required.\" Witte v.

The court held that \"what relief is 'available' does not necessarily depend on what the aggrieved party wants.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728121\"><a href=\"/opinion/728121/charlie-f-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-neil-and-bonnie-f-v-board-of/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 991. </a></span>We do not have to decide whether damages are available for a violation of IDEA, and the relationship of that determination to the exhaustion requirement of IDEA, because Weber never raised this exhaustion issue on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The rationale for the strict exhaustion requirement has been variously explained.
