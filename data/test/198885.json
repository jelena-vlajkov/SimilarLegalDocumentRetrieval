This case involves a claim for\n\nfalse imprisonment.      On December 11, 1996, Debra McCann and two\n\nof her children--Jillian, then 16, and Jonathan, then 12--were\n\nshopping at the Wal-Mart store in Bangor, Maine.                  After they\n\nreturned a Christmas tree and exchanged a CD player, Jonathan\n\nwent to the toy section and Jillian and Debra McCann went to\n\nshop in other areas of the store.           After approximately an hour\n\nand a half, the McCanns went to a register and paid for their\n\npurchases.     One of their receipts was time stamped at 10:10 p.m.\n\n            As the McCanns were leaving the store, two Wal-Mart\n\nemployees, Jean Taylor and Karla Hughes, stepped out in front of\n\nthe McCanns' shopping cart, blocking their path to the exit.\n\nTaylor   may    have   actually   put   her   hand   on    the   cart.     The\n\nemployees told Debra McCann that the children were not allowed\n\nin the store because they had been caught stealing on a prior\n\noccasion.      In fact, the employees were mistaken; the son of a\n\ndifferent family had been caught shoplifting in the store about\n\ntwo   weeks    before,   and   Taylor   and   Hughes      confused   the   two\n\nfamilies.\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           Despite Debra McCann's protestations, Taylor said that\n\nthey had the records, that the police were being called, and\n\nthat the McCanns \"had to go with her.\"                Debra McCann testified\n\nthat she did not resist Taylor's direction because she believed\n\nthat she had to go with Taylor and that the police were coming.\n\nTaylor and Hughes then brought the McCanns past the registers in\n\nthe store to an area near the store exit.              Taylor stood near the\n\nMcCanns   while    Hughes    purportedly      went     to    call   the    police.\n\nDuring    this   time,     Debra   McCann     tried    to    show       Taylor   her\n\nidentification, but Taylor refused to look at it.\n\n           After a few minutes, Hughes returned and switched\n\nplaces with Taylor.        Debra McCann told Hughes that she had proof\n\nof her identity and that there must be some proof about the\n\nidentity of the children who had been caught stealing.                      Hughes\n\nthen went up to Jonathan, pointed her finger at him, and said\n\nthat he had been caught stealing two weeks earlier.                       Jonathan\n\nbegan to cry and denied the accusation.                At some point around\n\nthis time Jonathan said that he needed to use the bathroom and\n\nHughes told him he could not go.            At no time during this initial\n\nhour or so did the Wal-Mart employees tell the McCanns that they\n\ncould leave.\n\n           Although      Wal-Mart's    employees       had       said    they    were\n\ncalling   the    police,    they   actually     called       a   store    security\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fofficer who would be able to identify the earlier shoplifter.\n\nEventually, the security officer, Rhonda Bickmore, arrived at\n\nthe store and informed Hughes that the McCanns were not the\n\nfamily whose son had been caught shoplifting.        Hughes then\n\nacknowledged her mistake to the McCanns, and the McCanns left\n\nthe store at approximately 11:15 p.m.       In due course, the\n\nMcCanns brought suit against Wal-Mart for false imprisonment (a\n\ndefamation claim was also made but was rejected by the jury).\n\n         The jury awarded the McCanns $20,000 in compensatory\n\ndamages on their claim that they were falsely imprisoned in the\n\nWal-Mart store by Wal-Mart employees.   Wal-Mart has now appealed\n\nthe district court's denial of its post-judgment motions for\n\njudgment as a matter of law and for a new trial pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 50(b) and 59, respectively, arguing that the McCanns\n\ndid not prove false imprisonment under Maine law and that the\n\ncourt's jury instructions on false imprisonment were in error.\n\nThe McCanns have cross-appealed from the district court's pre-\n\ntrial dismissal of their claim for punitive damages.\n\n         Both of Wal-Mart's claims of error depend on the proper\n\nelements of the tort of false imprisonment.     Although nuances\n\nvary from state to state, the gist of the common law tort is\n\nconduct by the actor which is intended to, and does in fact,\n\n\"confine\" another \"within boundaries fixed by the actor\" where,\n\n\n                              -4-\n\fin addition, the victim is either \"conscious of the confinement\n\nor is harmed by it.\"         Restatement (Second), Torts § 35 (1965).\n\nThe     few   Maine    cases   on    point       contain       no    comprehensive\n\ndefinition,      see   Knowlton     v.    Ross,    95     A.   281    (Me.   1915);\n\nWhittaker v. Sanford, 85 A. 399 (Me. 1912), and the district\n\ncourt's instructions (to which we will return) seem to have been\n\ndrawn from the Restatement.\n\n              While \"confinement\" can be imposed by physical barriers\n\nor physical force, much less will do--although how much less\n\nbecomes cloudy at the margins.                 It is generally settled that\n\nmere threats of physical force can suffice, Restatement, supra,\n\n§ 40; and it is also settled--although there is no Maine case on\n\npoint--that the threats may be implicit as well as explicit, see\n\nid. cmt. a; 32 Am. Jur. 2d               False Imprisonment § 18 (1995)\n\n(collecting cases), and that confinement can also be based on a\n\nfalse assertion of legal authority to confine.                        Restatement,\n\nsupra, § 41.     Indeed,     the Restatement provides that confinement\n\nmay occur by other unspecified means of \"duress.\"                      Id. § 40A.\n\n              Against this background, we examine Wal-Mart's claim\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient, taking the facts in the\n\nlight    most    favorable     to   the        McCanns,    drawing      reasonable\n\ninferences in their favor, and assuming that the jury resolved\n\ncredibility issues consistent with the verdict.                      See Gibson v.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fCity of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1994); Sanchez v.\n\nPuerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1994).               Using\n\nthis standard, we think that a reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat Wal-Mart's employees intended to \"confine\" the McCanns\n\n\"within boundaries fixed by\" Wal-Mart, that the employees' acts\n\ndid result in such a confinement, and that the McCanns were\n\nconscious of the confinement.\n\n          The evidence, taken favorably to the McCanns, showed\n\nthat Wal-Mart employees stopped the McCanns as they were seeking\n\nto exit the store, said that the children were not allowed in\n\nthe store, told the McCanns that they had to come with the Wal-\n\nMart employees and that Wal-Mart was calling the police, and\n\nthen stood guard over the McCanns while waiting for a security\n\nguard to arrive.    The direction to the McCanns, the reference to\n\nthe police, and the continued presence of the Wal-Mart employees\n\n(who at one point told Jonathan McCann that he could not leave\n\nto go to the bathroom) were enough to induce reasonable people\n\nto believe either that they would be restrained physically if\n\nthey sought to leave, or that the store was claiming lawful\n\nauthority to confine them until the police arrived, or both.\n\n          Wal-Mart asserts that under Maine law, the jury had to\n\nfind   \"actual,   physical   restraint,\"   a   phrase   it   takes    from\n\nKnowlton, 95 A. at 283; see also Whittaker, 85 A. at 402.            While\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthere is no complete definition of false imprisonment by Maine's\n\nhighest court, this is a good example of taking language out of\n\ncontext.      In Knowlton, the wife of a man who owed a hotel for\n\npast bills entered the hotel office and was allegedly told that\n\nshe   would      go    to   jail   if    she    did   not   pay   the   bill;      after\n\ndiscussion, she gave the hotel a diamond ring as security for\n\nthe bill.         She later won a verdict for false imprisonment\n\nagainst the hotel, which the Maine Supreme Judicial Court then\n\noverturned on the ground that the evidence was insufficient.\n\n              While     a   police      officer   was   in     the   room    and   Mrs.\n\nKnowlton said she thought that the door was locked, the SJC\n\nfound     that    the       plaintiff     had     not   been      confined    by    the\n\ndefendants.           The court noted that the defendants did not ask\n\nMrs. Knowlton into the room (another guest had sent for her),\n\ndid not touch her, and did not tell her she could not leave.\n\nThe court also said that any threat of jail to Mrs. Knowlton was\n\nonly \"evidence of an intention to imprison at some future time.\"\n\nKnowlton, 95 A. at 283. 1                In context, the reference to the\n\nnecessity of \"actual, physical restraint\" is best understood as\n\n\n\n\n      1\n     Although the distinction may seem a fine one, it is well\nsettled that a threat to confine at a future time, even if done\nto extract payment, is not itself false imprisonment.       See\nRestatement, supra, § 41 cmt. e.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fa reminder that a plaintiff must be actually confined--which\n\nMrs. Knowlton was not.\n\n           Taking    too   literally   the     phrase   \"actual,    physical\n\nrestraint\" would put Maine law broadly at odds with not only the\n\nRestatement but with a practically uniform body of common law in\n\nother states that accepts the mere threat of physical force, or\n\na claim of lawful authority to restrain, as enough to satisfy\n\nthe confinement requirement for false imprisonment (assuming\n\nalways that the victim submits).         It is true that in a diversity\n\ncase, we are bound by Maine law, as Wal-Mart reminds us; but we\n\nare not required to treat a descriptive phrase as a general rule\n\nor attribute to elderly Maine cases an entirely improbable\n\nbreadth.\n\n           More     interesting   is     Wal-Mart's      claim     that   the\n\ninstructions      were   inadequate.     The    district   court     largely\n\nborrowed the Restatement formulation by telling the jury that it\n\nmust find the following:\n\n                  One,   that   the   defendant   acted\n           intending to confine the plaintiffs within\n           boundaries fixed by the defendant; two, that\n           the acts of the defendant directly or\n           indirectly resulted in such a confinement of\n           the plaintiffs; and third, the plaintiffs\n           were conscious of the confinement or were\n           harmed by it.\n\nThe court added that the jury could find for the McCanns if it\n\nfound that \"the plaintiffs reasonably believed they were not\n\n                                   -8-\n\fpermitted to leave the store,\" and that the plaintiffs did not\n\nhave to prove that \"such restraint was accomplished through\n\nactual physical force against their bodies.\"\n\n          In assailing the instructions, Wal-Mart repeats its\n\nclaim, which we have already rejected, that the district court\n\nshould   have   charged   that   \"actual,   physical   restraint\"   is\n\nrequired to make out confinement.       A somewhat different claim by\n\nWal-Mart, citing Whittaker, 85 A. at 402, is that the district\n\ncourt's instruction was defective because it did not tell the\n\njury that the restraint must be a physical and not merely a\n\nmoral influence, and that influencing or convincing another to\n\nstay is not actual physical restraint.        In substance, Wal-Mart\n\nwanted a description of what was not confinement.\n\n          We think it is at least arguable that, if a proper\n\ninstruction were tendered, it might be appropriate or even\n\nobligatory (the latter is a nice point that we do not decide) to\n\nmake clear to the jury that there are outer boundaries to the\n\nconfinement concept and that a personal plea by the defendant to\n\nremain or the defendant's invocation of \"moral obligation\" alone\n\nwould not be sufficient to inflict a \"confinement.\"       There might\n\nbe special justification for such a clarification in a case in\n\nwhich the evidence was open to that interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f             However, in this case, Wal-Mart did not offer a proper\n\ninstruction:       in arguing for a different instruction, it said to\n\nthe district court that the restraint \"must be physical and not\n\nmerely a moral influence,\" implicating Wal-Mart's incorrect view\n\nthat actual physical restraint was required; and its further\n\nstatement that \"[i]nfluencing or convincing another to remain in\n\nplace is not actual physical restraint\" has the same fault and\n\nis also open to the criticism that \"[i]nfluencing or convincing\"\n\nis itself a misleading phrase, at least as presented by Wal-\n\nMart, because one could influence or convince by threats of\n\nforce   or   assertions      of   lawful      authority,      which   do    or   can\n\nconstitute false imprisonment.            In short, Wal-Mart did not offer\n\na proper instruction.\n\n             It    is   well-settled    that    a   district     court      is   not\n\nrequired to rewrite an improper instruction to capture a kernel\n\nthat may have some validity; it is counsel's job to present an\n\nunimpeachable instruction.             See Parker v. City of Nashua, 76\n\nF.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).         Wal-Mart was not faced with an all-\n\nor-nothing        choice:    it   could    have     pressed    for    its   actual\n\nphysical restraint instruction and also tendered an alternative\n\ninstruction framed so as to make clear that, for example, mere\n\nmoral suasion is not sufficient.                  Since it did not do the\n\nlatter, we are freed from the chore of deciding in the abstract\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwhether    and      when   such       a    limiting      instruction    would     be\n\nappropriate.\n\n           Finally, the McCanns cross-appeal from the district\n\ncourt's pre-trial dismissal of their claim for punitive damages.\n\nThe precedents say that punitive damages can only be awarded for\n\ntortious conduct where the defendant acts with malice.                        Tuttle\n\nv. Raymond, 494 A.2d 1353, 1361 (Me. 1985).                    Under Maine law,\n\nmalice can be express, as when the defendant is motivated by ill\n\nwill toward the plaintiff, or implied, where the defendant's\n\nactions are \"outrageous\" and not merely reckless or negligent.\n\nId.\n\n           In this case, the McCanns contend that Hughes's refusal\n\nto    permit   Jonathan     to       use    the    bathroom    was   sufficiently\n\noutrageous     to    support     a    claim       for   punitive   damages.      The\n\nMcCann's testimony was simply that Jonathan said once that he\n\nneeded to use the bathroom and Hughes told him he could not.                      At\n\nthat point, the issue was dropped and neither Jonathan nor his\n\nmother said another word to the Wal-Mart employees about it.\n\nWhile we think it was foolish for Hughes to tell the 12-year-old\n\nthat he could not go to the bathroom, the denial was not\n\n\"outrageous\" given the failure to press the request.                          We can\n\nimagine circumstances where a refusal to allow such a bathroom\n\nvisit would be outrageous.\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f             The McCanns insist that the refusal must be considered\n\nin conjunction with other facts, including an asserted violation\n\nby Wal-Mart of its own policy of asking prior shoplifters to\n\nleave the store rather than detaining them, Hughes's action of\n\npointing her finger at Jonathan while accusing him of stealing,\n\nand her failure to clear up the McCanns' identity at an earlier\n\nstage.      Whether taken separately or together, these actions may\n\nbe culpable but are short enough of \"outrageous\" to permit\n\nactual but not punitive damages.             To the extent extra harm was\n\ndone   to    Jonathan,   the   jury   had    no   difficulty   drawing   this\n\ndistinction; it awarded him $10,000 while awarding his mother\n\nand sister only $5,000 each.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f",

Hughes then acknowledged her mistake to the McCanns, and the McCanns left the store at approximately 11:15 p.m. In due course, the McCanns brought suit against Wal-Mart for false imprisonment (a defamation claim was also made but was rejected by the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded the McCanns $20,000 in compensatory damages on their claim that they were falsely imprisoned in the Wal-Mart store by Wal-Mart employees. Wal-Mart has now appealed the district court's denial of its post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) and 59, respectively, arguing that the McCanns did not prove false imprisonment under Maine law and that the court's jury instructions on false imprisonment were in error. The McCanns have cross-appealed from the district court's pre-trial dismissal of their claim for punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of Wal-Mart's claims of error depend on the proper elements of the tort of false imprisonment. Although nuances vary from state to state, the gist of the common law tort is conduct by the actor which is intended to, and does in fact, \"confine\" another \"within boundaries fixed by the actor\" where, in addition, the victim is either \"conscious of the confinement or is harmed by it.\" Restatement (Second), Torts &#167; 35 (1965). The few Maine cases on point contain no comprehensive definition, see Knowlton v. Ross, 95 A. 281 (Me. 1915); Whittaker v. Sanford, 85 A. 399 (Me. 1912), and the district court's instructions (to which we will return) seem to have been drawn from the Restatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"confinement\" can be imposed by physical barriers or physical force, much less will do--although how much less becomes cloudy at the margins. It is generally settled that mere threats of physical force can suffice, Restatement, supra, &#167; 40; and it is also settled--although there is no Maine case on point--that the threats may be implicit as well as explicit, see id. cmt. a; 32 Am. Jur. 2d False Imprisonment &#167; 18 (1995) (collecting cases), and that confinement can also be based on a false assertion of legal authority to confine. Restatement, supra, &#167; 41. Indeed, the Restatement provides that confinement may occur by other unspecified means of \"duress.\" Id. &#167; 40A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we examine Wal-Mart's claim that the evidence was insufficient, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the McCanns, drawing reasonable inferences in their favor, and assuming that the jury resolved credibility issues consistent with the verdict. See Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1994); Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1994). Using this standard, we think that a reasonable jury could conclude that Wal-Mart's employees intended to \"confine\" the McCanns \"within boundaries fixed by\" Wal-Mart, that the employees' acts did result in such a confinement, and that the McCanns were conscious of the confinement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, taken favorably to the McCanns, showed that Wal-Mart employees stopped the McCanns as they were seeking to exit the store, said that the children were not allowed in the store, told the McCanns that they had to come with the Wal-Mart employees and that Wal-Mart was calling the police, and then stood guard over the McCanns while waiting for a security guard to arrive. The direction to the McCanns, the reference to the police, and the continued presence of the Wal-Mart employees (who at one point told Jonathan McCann that he could not leave to go to the bathroom) were enough to induce reasonable people to believe either that they would be restrained physically if they sought to leave, or that the store was claiming lawful authority to confine them until the police arrived, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wal-Mart asserts that under Maine law, the jury had to find \"actual, physical restraint,\" a phrase it takes from Knowlton, 95 A. at 283; see also Whittaker, 85 A. at 402. While there is no complete definition of false imprisonment by Maine's highest court, this is a good example of taking language out of context. In Knowlton, the wife of a man who owed a hotel for past bills entered the hotel office and was allegedly told that she would go to jail if she did not pay the bill; after discussion, she gave the hotel a diamond ring as security for the bill. She later won a verdict for false imprisonment against the hotel, which the Maine Supreme Judicial Court then overturned on the ground that the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a police officer was in the room and Mrs. Knowlton said she thought that the door was locked, the SJC found that the plaintiff had not been confined by the defendants. The court noted that the defendants did not ask Mrs. Knowlton into the room (another guest had sent for her), did not touch her, and did not tell her she could not leave. The court also said that any threat of jail to Mrs. Knowlton was only \"evidence of an intention to imprison at some future time.\" Knowlton, 95 A. at 283.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In context, the reference to the necessity of \"actual, physical restraint\" is best understood as a reminder that a plaintiff must be actually confined--which Mrs. Knowlton was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking too literally the phrase \"actual, physical restraint\" would put Maine law broadly at odds with not only the Restatement but with a practically uniform body of common law in other states that accepts the mere threat of physical force, or a claim of lawful authority to restrain, as enough to satisfy the confinement requirement for false imprisonment (assuming always that the victim submits). It is true that in a diversity case, we are bound by Maine law, as Wal-Mart reminds us; but we are not required to treat a descriptive phrase as a general rule or attribute to elderly Maine cases an entirely improbable breadth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More interesting is Wal-Mart's claim that the instructions were inadequate. The district court largely borrowed the Restatement formulation by telling the jury that it must find the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One, that the defendant acted intending to confine the plaintiffs within boundaries fixed by the defendant; two, that the acts of the defendant directly or indirectly resulted in such a confinement of the plaintiffs; and third, the plaintiffs were conscious of the confinement or were harmed by it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court added that the jury could find for the McCanns if it found that \"the plaintiffs reasonably believed they were not permitted to leave the store,\" and that the plaintiffs did not have to prove that \"such restraint was accomplished through actual physical force against their bodies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assailing the instructions, Wal-Mart repeats its claim, which we have already rejected, that the district court should have charged that \"actual, physical restraint\" is required to make out confinement. A somewhat different claim by Wal-Mart, citing Whittaker, 85 A. at 402, is that the district court's instruction was defective because it did not tell the jury that the restraint must be a physical and not merely a moral influence, and that influencing or convincing another to stay is not actual physical restraint. In substance, Wal-Mart wanted a description of what was not confinement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is at least arguable that, if a proper instruction were tendered, it might be appropriate or even obligatory (the latter is a nice point that we do not decide) to make clear to the jury that there are outer boundaries to the confinement concept and that a personal plea by the defendant to remain or the defendant's invocation of \"moral obligation\" alone would not be sufficient to inflict a \"confinement.\" There might be special justification for such a clarification in a case in which the evidence was open to that interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in this case, Wal-Mart did not offer a proper instruction: in arguing for a different instruction, it said to the district court that the restraint \"must be physical and not merely a moral influence,\" implicating Wal-Mart's incorrect view that actual physical restraint was required; and its further statement that \"[i]nfluencing or convincing another to remain in place is not actual physical restraint\" has the same fault and is also open to the criticism that \"[i]nfluencing or convincing\" is itself a misleading phrase, at least as presented by Wal-Mart, because one could influence or convince by threats of force or assertions of lawful authority, which do or can constitute false imprisonment. In short, Wal-Mart did not offer a proper instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled that a district court is not required to rewrite an improper instruction to capture a kernel that may have some validity; it is counsel's job to present an unimpeachable instruction. See Parker v. City of Nashua, 76 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1996). Wal-Mart was not faced with an all-or-nothing choice: it could have pressed for its actual physical restraint instruction and also tendered an alternative instruction framed so as to make clear that, for example, mere moral suasion is not sufficient. Since it did not do the latter, we are freed from the chore of deciding in the abstract whether and when such a limiting instruction would be appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the McCanns cross-appeal from the district court's pre-trial dismissal of their claim for punitive damages. The precedents say that punitive damages can only be awarded for tortious conduct where the defendant acts with malice. Tuttle v. Raymond, 494 A.2d 1353, 1361 (Me. 1985). Under Maine law, malice can be express, as when the defendant is motivated by ill will toward the plaintiff, or implied, where the defendant's actions are \"outrageous\" and not merely reckless or negligent. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the McCanns contend that Hughes's refusal to permit Jonathan to use the bathroom was sufficiently outrageous to support a claim for punitive damages. The McCann's testimony was simply that Jonathan said once that he needed to use the bathroom and Hughes told him he could not. At that point, the issue was dropped and neither Jonathan nor his mother said another word to the Wal-Mart employees about it. While we think it was foolish for Hughes to tell the 12-year-old that he could not go to the bathroom, the denial was not \"outrageous\" given the failure to press the request. We can imagine circumstances where a refusal to allow such a bathroom visit would be outrageous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The McCanns insist that the refusal must be considered in conjunction with other facts, including an asserted violation by Wal-Mart of its own policy of asking prior shoplifters to leave the store rather than detaining them, Hughes's action of pointing her finger at Jonathan while accusing him of stealing, and her failure to clear up the McCanns' identity at an earlier stage. Whether taken separately or together, these actions may be culpable but are short enough of \"outrageous\" to permit actual but not punitive damages. To the extent extra harm was done to Jonathan, the jury had no difficulty drawing this distinction; it awarded him $10,000 while awarding his mother and sister only $5,000 each.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTE:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Although the distinction may seem a fine one, it is well settled that a threat to confine at a future time, even if done to extract payment, is not itself false imprisonment.

On December 11, 1996, Debra McCann and two of her children--Jillian, then 16, and Jonathan, then 12--were shopping at the Wal-Mart store in Bangor, Maine. After they returned a Christmas tree and exchanged a CD player, Jonathan went to the toy section and Jillian and Debra McCann went to shop in other areas of the store. After approximately an hour and a half, the McCanns went to a register and paid for their purchases. One of their receipts was time stamped at 10:10 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the McCanns were leaving the store, two Wal-Mart employees, Jean Taylor and Karla Hughes, stepped out in front of the McCanns' shopping cart, blocking their path to the exit. Taylor may have actually put her hand on the cart. The employees told Debra McCann that the children were not allowed in the store because they had been caught stealing on a prior occasion. In fact, the employees were mistaken; the son of a different family had been caught shoplifting in the store about two weeks before, and Taylor and Hughes confused the two families.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Debra McCann's protestations, Taylor said that they had the records, that the police were being called, and that the McCanns \"had to go with her.\" Debra McCann testified that she did not resist Taylor's direction because she believed that she had to go with Taylor and that the police were coming. Taylor and Hughes then brought the McCanns past the registers in the store to an area near the store exit. Taylor stood near the McCanns while Hughes purportedly went to call the police. During this time, Debra McCann tried to show Taylor her identification, but Taylor refused to look at it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a few minutes, Hughes returned and switched places with Taylor. Debra McCann told Hughes that she had proof of her identity and that there must be some proof about the identity of the children who had been caught stealing. Hughes then went up to Jonathan, pointed her finger at him, and said that he had been caught stealing two weeks earlier. Jonathan began to cry and denied the accusation. At some point around this time Jonathan said that he needed to use the bathroom and Hughes told him he could not go. At no time during this initial hour or so did the Wal-Mart employees tell the McCanns that they could leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Wal-Mart's employees had said they were calling the police, they actually called a store security officer who would be able to identify the earlier shoplifter. Eventually, the security officer, Rhonda Bickmore, arrived at the store and informed Hughes that the McCanns were not the family whose son had been caught shoplifting. Hughes then acknowledged her mistake to the McCanns, and the McCanns left the store at approximately 11:15 p.m. In due course, the McCanns brought suit against Wal-Mart for false imprisonment (a defamation claim was also made but was rejected by the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded the McCanns $20,000 in compensatory damages on their claim that they were falsely imprisoned in the Wal-Mart store by Wal-Mart employees. Wal-Mart has now appealed the district court's denial of its post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) and 59, respectively, arguing that the McCanns did not prove false imprisonment under Maine law and that the court's jury instructions on false imprisonment were in error.

Although nuances vary from state to state, the gist of the common law tort is conduct by the actor which is intended to, and does in fact, \"confine\" another \"within boundaries fixed by the actor\" where, in addition, the victim is either \"conscious of the confinement or is harmed by it.\" Restatement (Second), Torts &#167; 35 (1965).

In substance, Wal-Mart wanted a description of what was not confinement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is at least arguable that, if a proper instruction were tendered, it might be appropriate or even obligatory (the latter is a nice point that we do not decide) to make clear to the jury that there are outer boundaries to the confinement concept and that a personal plea by the defendant to remain or the defendant's invocation of \"moral obligation\" alone would not be sufficient to inflict a \"confinement.\" There might be special justification for such a clarification in a case in which the evidence was open to that interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in this case, Wal-Mart did not offer a proper instruction: in arguing for a different instruction, it said to the district court that the restraint \"must be physical and not merely a moral influence,\" implicating Wal-Mart's incorrect view that actual physical restraint was required; and its further statement that \"[i]nfluencing or convincing another to remain in place is not actual physical restraint\" has the same fault and is also open to the criticism that \"[i]nfluencing or convincing\" is itself a misleading phrase, at least as presented by Wal-Mart, because one could influence or convince by threats of force or assertions of lawful authority, which do or can constitute false imprisonment. In short, Wal-Mart did not offer a proper instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled that a district court is not required to rewrite an improper instruction to capture a kernel that may have some validity; it is counsel's job to present an unimpeachable instruction. See Parker v. City of Nashua, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196553\"><a href=\"/opinion/196553/parker-v-sheehan/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 1996). Wal-Mart was not faced with an all-or-nothing choice: it could have pressed for its actual physical restraint instruction and also tendered an alternative instruction framed so as to make clear that, for example, mere moral suasion is not sufficient. Since it did not do the latter, we are freed from the chore of deciding in the abstract whether and when such a limiting instruction would be appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the McCanns cross-appeal from the district court's pre-trial dismissal of their claim for punitive damages. The precedents say that punitive damages can only be awarded for tortious conduct where the defendant acts with malice. Tuttle v. Raymond, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1353</span></span>, 1361 (Me. 1985). Under Maine law, malice can be express, as when the defendant is motivated by ill will toward the plaintiff, or implied, where the defendant's actions are \"outrageous\" and not merely reckless or negligent. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the McCanns contend that Hughes's refusal to permit Jonathan to use the bathroom was sufficiently outrageous to support a claim for punitive damages. The McCann's testimony was simply that Jonathan said once that he needed to use the bathroom and Hughes told him he could not. At that point, the issue was dropped and neither Jonathan nor his mother said another word to the Wal-Mart employees about it. While we think it was foolish for Hughes to tell the 12-year-old that he could not go to the bathroom, the denial was not \"outrageous\" given the failure to press the request. We can imagine circumstances where a refusal to allow such a bathroom visit would be outrageous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The McCanns insist that the refusal must be considered in conjunction with other facts, including an asserted violation by Wal-Mart of its own policy of asking prior shoplifters to leave the store rather than detaining them, Hughes's action of pointing her finger at Jonathan while accusing him of stealing, and her failure to clear up the McCanns' identity at an earlier stage. Whether taken separately or together, these actions may be culpable but are short enough of \"outrageous\" to permit actual but not punitive damages. To the extent extra harm was done to Jonathan, the jury had no difficulty drawing this distinction; it awarded him $10,000 while awarding his mother and sister only $5,000 each.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTE:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Although the distinction may seem a fine one, it is well settled that a threat to confine at a future time, even if done to extract payment, is not itself false imprisonment.
