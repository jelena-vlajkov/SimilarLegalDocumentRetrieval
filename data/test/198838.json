Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Joshua L. Gordon on brief for appellant.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Kevin P. McGrath,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 24, 2000\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   After a thorough review of the record\r\nand of the parties' submissions, we affirm.  Drug quantity was\r\nnot an element of the offense, so the lower court's failure at\r\nthe Rule 11 hearing to explore the factual basis for the\r\nquantity specified in the plea agreement was not error.  United\r\nStates v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160 (1st Cir. 1996).  We see\r\nno clear error in the court's finding at sentencing that\r\nCamacho should be responsible for the quantity specified in the\r\nplea agreement, especially in light of Camacho's agreement to\r\nbe responsible for that amount, United States v. Marrero-\r\nRivera, 124 F.3d 342, 354 (1st Cir. 1997); his admission that\r\nhe was involved in the conspiracy during the times in question,\r\nUnited States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 524-25 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); and the benefits Camacho reaped from the agreement, id. \r\nCamacho's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not\r\ncognizable on direct appeal.  United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d\r\n6, 11 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\n          Affirmed.  1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c). \n",
