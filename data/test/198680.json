ANDREWS,\r\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n         [Hon. Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Robert E. Harvey, by appointment of the Court, and Dexter J.\r\nAndrews, on brief pro se, for appellant.\r\n   Jennifer Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nOCTOBER 14, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Defendant Dexter Andrews was convicted after\r\na jury trial of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of\r\n18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  He now appeals, challenging the district\r\ncourt's failure to: exclude a witness who had allegedly violated a\r\nsequestration order; grant a new trial due to allegedly improper\r\ncomments in the prosecutor's closing argument; give a requested\r\njury instruction; and depart downward from the sentencing\r\nguidelines.  Andrews has also filed pro se briefs raising arguments\r\nconcerning his sentence and the court's procedure for conducting\r\nvoir dire.  Finding no error, we affirm.\r\nAndrews, who had a prior criminal record including\r\nmultiple Massachusetts felony convictions, was arrested after a\r\npolice chase in the Mattapan section of Boston involving a car in\r\nwhich he was a passenger.  When the car stopped, Andrews fled on\r\nfoot.  Three police officers testified that as Andrews exited the\r\ncar two handguns fell from his waist.  Andrews, however, testified\r\nthat he had never touched the guns and claimed that they belonged\r\nto the driver of the car, Lumumba Roberson.  The jury found Andrews\r\nguilty and he was sentenced to 210 months in prison.\r\nI.  Witness Sequestration\r\nOn Andrews's motion the district court entered a\r\nsequestration order barring witnesses from the courtroom during the\r\ntestimony of other witnesses.  At trial, Andrews testified that he\r\nhad just been introduced to Roberson on the day in question and had\r\nnever spoken to him before.  The government called a rebuttal\r\nwitness, Officer Gregory Brown, who testified that he had seen\r\nAndrews and Roberson together on two occasions.  On cross-\r\nexamination, Officer Brown admitted that he had previously spoken\r\nwith his partner, Officer Craig Jones, about the fact that Officer\r\nJones was to testify at Andrews's trial.  Officer Brown denied that\r\nOfficer Jones had asked him to testify that he had seen Andrews\r\nwith Roberson.\r\nAndrews argues that Officer Brown violated the court's\r\nsequestration order and that the court committed plain error by not\r\nexcluding his testimony as a sanction for that violation.  We\r\ndisagree.  There was no violation of the sequestration order.  The\r\norder requested by Andrews required only that Officer Brown not be\r\nin the courtroom to hear Officer Jones testify, see Fed. R. Evid.\r\n615, and he was not.  Andrews was free to request further\r\nrestrictions covering out-of-court conversations between witnesses,\r\nbut he did not do so.  He cannot complain now that Officer Brown\r\nviolated an order that the court never entered and he never\r\nrequested.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1176 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).\r\nII.  Closing Argument\r\nAndrews argues that the district court erred in denying\r\nhis post-trial motion for a new trial based on allegedly improper\r\nremarks in the prosecutor's closing argument.  Andrews objected to\r\nsome of those remarks; the court sustained the objection, raised\r\nother objections sua sponte, and gave curative instructions. \r\nBecause Andrews did not move for a mistrial or request further\r\ncurative instructions in addition to those given by the court, we\r\nreview only for plain error.  See United States v. Grabiec, 96 F.3d\r\n549, 550 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nAndrews contends first that statements by the prosecutor\r\nimproperly suggested that Andrews had the burden to produce\r\nwitnesses to rebut the government's evidence. The prosecutor's\r\nrebuttal argument included the following passage:\r\n    [PROSECUTOR:] Where is Mr. Roberson? \r\nWe don't know where Mr. Roberson is, but Mr.\r\nRoberson would not be expected to testify at\r\nthis    \r\n\n    MR. COOPER: Objection, your Honor.\r\n\n    THE COURT: No, sustained.  There's no\r\nevidence about that at all, that's improper\r\nargument. . . .\r\n\n    I've got to   with respect to Mr.\r\nRoberson, you're to understand, as I told you\r\nbefore, that the defendant had no burden of\r\nproducing Mr. Roberson, even if he knew where\r\nMr. Roberson was.\r\n\n    The defendant has no duty to bring in\r\nany evidence.  The fact that the defendant\r\nbrings in one witness that happens to be\r\nhimself doesn't mean he has to bring a second\r\nwitness.\r\n\n    The government, on the other hand, has\r\nthe burden of convincing you beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.  And so if the government\r\nwanted to bring Mr. Roberson in here, it was\r\nthe government's burden to do so, not the\r\ndefendant's.\r\n\nWe agree with Andrews, and with the district court, that\r\nthe prosecutor's reference to Roberson may have improperly\r\nsuggested to the jury that Andrews had the burden to produce\r\nRoberson to rebut the government's case.  See United States v.\r\nRoberts, 119 F.3d 1006, 1015 (1st Cir. 1997).  In deciding whether\r\na new trial was required, we may consider, inter alia, \"whether the\r\njudge gave any curative instructions and the likely effect of such\r\ninstructions . . . .\"  United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 574\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  Here, as the quoted portion of the transcript\r\nindicates, the court intervened promptly and forcefully, in a way\r\nthat could have left no doubt in the jurors' minds that the burden\r\nof proof was solely the government's.  Because the curative\r\ninstruction rendered the misconduct harmless, the court's failure\r\nto grant a new trial was not plain error.\r\nAndrews complains of improper burden-shifting in other\r\nportions of the prosecutor's closing.  We find none, and we note\r\nthat those allegedly improper comments were also answered by strong \r\ninstructions by the court that dissipated any possible prejudice.\r\nAndrews further argues that the prosecutor improperly\r\nvouched for the credibility of the government's witnesses when he\r\nsaid, \"You had, on the other hand, three officers with absolutely\r\nno motive to come in here and tell you anything other than what\r\nthey saw that night.\"  Improper vouching consists of placing the\r\nprestige of the government behind a witness by offering personal\r\nassurances about his credibility or indicating that facts outside\r\nthe knowledge of the jury support the witness's credibility.  See\r\nUnited States v. Auch,187 F.3d 125, 130-31 (1st Cir. 1999).  Here\r\nthe prosecutor did neither; instead, he merely referred to the\r\nwitnesses' lack of motive to lie, which \"falls within the accepted\r\nbounds and was entirely proper.\"  Id. at 131.`\r\nIII.  Requested Jury Instruction\r\nAndrews argues that the court erred in failing to give\r\nhis requested jury instruction on constructive possession.  There\r\nwas no evidence, however, that generated constructive possession as\r\nan issue   the government alleged actual possession, and its\r\nprincipal witnesses testified that they saw Andrews in actual\r\npossession of the two guns.  A defendant is not entitled to an\r\ninstruction that is not generated by the evidence.  See United\r\nStates v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1495 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r\nIV.  Downward Departure from Sentencing Guidelines\r\nAndrews argues that the district court erred in failing\r\nto depart downward from the sentencing guidelines.  Claiming that\r\nthe court erroneously believed it had no authority to depart\r\ndownward, he invokes the exception to the general rule that failure\r\nto depart is not reviewable on appeal.  See United States v.\r\nMangos, 134 F.3d 460, 465 (1st Cir. 1998).  Andrews points to the\r\ncourt's statement at the sentencing hearing that \"what I am going\r\nto do is sentence you to the minimum under the Guidelines of 210\r\nmonths.  I have no authority to do anything else.\"   Without\r\nsignificantly more evidence than Andrews cites, we will not find\r\nthat a judge of vast experience in sentencing under the guidelines\r\nwas ignorant of his authority to depart downward in an appropriate\r\ncase.  Reading the judge's remark in context, we conclude that he\r\nwas merely expressing his view that he could not depart downward in\r\nthis case because there were no facts justifying such a departure. \r\nSee United States v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n(coming to same conclusion when district court stated, \"if I felt\r\nI had the authority to depart, I would\").\r\nAndrews raises additional arguments relating to his\r\nsentencing in a pro se brief.  Those arguments are clearly without\r\nmerit and we need not discuss them.  \r\nV.  Defendant's Presence During Voir Dire at the Bench \r\nAndrews asserts in a pro se brief that the court\r\ncommitted reversible error by conducting individual voir dire of\r\nprospective jurors at the bench, with the prosecutor and defense\r\nattorney present, while Andrews remained seated at the counsel\r\ntable.  We assume, without deciding, that Andrews had the right to\r\nbe present at such a bench conference.  See Cardinal v. Gorczyk, 81\r\nF.3d 18, 20 (2d Cir. 1996) (assuming that defendant had right to be\r\npresent at bench voir dire, but finding waiver); United States v.\r\nWashington, 705 F.2d 489, 497 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam)\r\n(recognizing defendant's right to be present but finding error\r\nharmless).  Andrews, however, waived that right when neither he nor\r\nhis attorney asserted it after the court explained that a marshal\r\nwould have to accompany Andrews to the bench and sit nearby.  See\r\nUnited States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S. 522, 528-29 (1985) (per curiam)\r\n(defendant or counsel must affirmatively assert right to be present\r\nat conferences, and express \"on the record\" waiver not required); \r\nsee also Washington, 705 F.2d at 497 (because right is\r\n\"infrequently exercised and usually delegated to counsel, unless a\r\nspecific request is made for the defendant to participate at bench\r\nexaminations of prospective jurors, such right shall be deemed to\r\nhave been waived.\").  The requirement that the marshal be present\r\nwas a reasonable one and did not invalidate the waiver.  See United\r\nStates v. Santiago-Lugo, 167 F.3d 81, 83-84 (1st Cir. 1999)\r\n(security arrangements, including placement of marshals in\r\ncourtroom, within trial court's \"broad discretion\").\r\nAffirmed.\n",
