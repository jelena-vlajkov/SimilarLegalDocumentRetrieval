Ever since Justice O'Connor\n\nhighlighted the importance of direct evidence of discrimination,\n\nsee Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 276-77 (1989)\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring), courts have struggled to determine\n\nwhether particular pieces of evidence can be so classified.\n\nFollowing the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 102-166, § 102, 105 Stat. 1071, 1073 (codified at 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981a(c)(1)), this struggle took on an added dimension:              the\n\nAct made jury trials widely available in discrimination cases,\n\nthus sparking interest in how juries were to be instructed when\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination had been introduced.             We have\n\napproached     these     subjects    cautiously,       eschewing    broad\n\ngeneralizations.       See, e.g., Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry,\n\n199 F.3d 572, 581-83 (1st Cir. 1999).          This appeal requires us\n\nto take an incremental step along the decisional path.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n          On   February     1,   1994,    Thomas   &   Betts   Corporation\n\n(Thomas) acquired the assets of Challenger Caribbean Corporation\n\n(CCC), a manufacturer of circuit breakers and switches.1            Thomas\n\ndecided to shut down CCC's production line at Canóvanas and\n\ntransfer the work to a Vega Baja facility operated by Thomas &\n\nBetts Caribe, Inc. (Caribe).        One virtue of this consolidation\n\n\n     1CCC is now known as Thomas & Betts Puerto Rico, Inc.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwas the opportunity to downsize.                Thomas placed a trio of\n\nexecutives   —   Frank    Domenech      (the   manager   of       the   Vega   Baja\n\nplant), Ojel Rodríguez (his Canóvanas counterpart), and Ramón\n\nBecker   (Caribe's   human      resources      director)      —    in   charge   of\n\ndeciding which CCC employees were to be transferred and which\n\nwere to be shown the door.           The triumvirate met several times to\n\ndetermine the employees' fate.\n\n          On December 2, 1994, Domenech announced the closing of\n\nthe Canóvanas plant.       He also disclosed that slightly less than\n\nhalf of CCC's administrative employees (17 out of 36) would be\n\ntransferred to Vega Baja.        The nine appellants — Michael Dalmau\n\n(age 47), Clemente Febres (age 53), Rafael Hiraldo (age 46),\n\nCarmen López (age 41), Jesús Ortiz (age 64), José Pomales (age\n\n54), Emma Rovira (age 43), Gloria Soto (age 47), and Luis Zayas\n\n(age 62) — were not part of that 17-member complement.\n\n          Invoking       the   Age    Discrimination     in       Employment     Act\n\n(ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, the appellants sued.                  CCC defended\n\non the ground that its decisions were based on legitimate, age-\n\nneutral criteria.    Following a lengthy trial, the jury returned\n\na verdict in CCC's favor.\n\n          The evidence at trial was a mixed bag, some favoring\n\nthe appellants and some favoring CCC.              Citing book and verse\n\nwould for the most part serve no useful purpose.                         The sole\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fexception concerns Becker's testimony that, as the triumvirs\n\nbegan mulling transfer decisions, Domenech advised him privately\n\nthat three criteria were used to determine which employees would\n\nbe moved to Vega Baja:          job performance, union identification,\n\nand \"in some cases, the age.\"          The critical questions raised by\n\nthis appeal concern the character of this bit of testimony and\n\nthe jury instructions related to it.               We shall return to those\n\nquestions shortly.       At this juncture, however, we pause to offer\n\na     quick   primer   on     the   effect    of    direct   evidence   in   a\n\ndiscrimination case.\n\nII.    THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\n\n              A   plaintiff    alleging     disparate   treatment   under    a\n\nstatute like the ADEA usually proceeds by means of the familiar\n\nframework engendered in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792, 802-05 (1973).            We have described the mechanics of\n\nthis approach (customarily called the \"pretext\" approach) in\n\nconsiderable detail, see, e.g., Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 579-81;\n\nMesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823-24 (1st Cir.\n\n1991), and need not elaborate upon it here.             What is significant\n\nfor present purposes is that, under pretext analysis, the burden\n\nof persuasion remains with the plaintiff throughout the case.\n\nSee Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 581; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            In    some      situations,     however,    a   plaintiff     may   be\n\nentitled     to     use    an    approach      that   relieves    her   of   this\n\nunremitting burden of persuasion.                 The key that unlocks this\n\ndoor is the existence of direct evidence that a proscribed\n\nfactor (such as age, gender, race, or national origin) played a\n\nmotivating part in the disputed employment decision.                    See Price\n\nWaterhouse,       490     U.S.   at   276-77   (O'Connor,   J.,    concurring);\n\nFernandes, 199 F.3d at 580.             Such evidence, if accepted by the\n\nfactfinder, shifts the burden of persuasion to the employer, who\n\nthen must establish that he would have reached the same decision\n\nregarding the plaintiff even if he had not taken the proscribed\n\nfactor into account.             See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 242;\n\nFernandes, 199 F.3d at 580.              Although the plaintiff's initial\n\nburden under this \"mixed-motive\" approach is heavier than the de\n\nminimis showing required to establish a prima facie case under\n\nthe pretext approach, see Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 60\n\n(2d Cir. 1997), most plaintiffs perceive the Price Waterhouse\n\nframework and its concomitant burden-shifting as conferring a\n\npronounced advantage.            In the average case, the employee thirsts\n\nfor access to it, while the employer regards it as anathema.\n\nSee Thomas v. Denny's, Inc., 111 F.3d 1506, 1512 (10th Cir.\n\n1997).\n\nIII.     ANALYSIS\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f                 We now return to the case at hand, focusing on the\n\nappellants'            principal         assignment       of    error.2     We    split    our\n\nanalysis into two segments.                      First, we evaluate the appellants'\n\nclaim — strenuously challenged by CCC — that they introduced\n\ndirect      evidence          sufficient         to     warrant    a    mixed-motive      jury\n\ninstruction.            Because we resolve that question favorably to the\n\nappellants, we then consider the appellants' follow-on claim\n\nthat       the        judge    failed       to     give    a     suitable     mixed-motive\n\ninstruction.\n\n\n\n                 A.    The Character of the Evidence Presented.\n\n                 The     appellants         assert       that     the    Becker   testimony\n\nqualifies as direct evidence, and that the lower court therefore\n\nwas    obliged         to     give   a    mixed-motive          jury    instruction.       CCC\n\ndisputes this assertion.                    The question of whether particular\n\nevidence warrants a mixed-motive instruction is a question of\n\nlaw, subject to de novo review.                         See Medlock v. Ortho Biotech,\n\nInc., 164 F.3d 545, 552 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 48\n\n(1999); see also United States v. Flores, 968 F.2d 1366, 1367-68\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      To the extent that the appellants advance other arguments,\nthose arguments are insubstantial and we reject them out of\nhand.\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f          As we recently had occasion to observe, the courts of\n\nappeals are in some disarray as to what constitutes direct\n\nevidence sufficient to provoke a mixed-motive instruction.          See\n\nFernandes, 199 F.3d at 582 (collecting cases).     We need not draw\n\noverly   fine   distinctions   today.   For   present   purposes,   it\n\nsuffices to say that evidence is \"direct\" (and thus justifies a\n\nmixed-motive jury instruction) when it consists of statements by\n\na decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and\n\nbear squarely on the contested employment decision.3      See, e.g.,\n\nTaylor v. Virginia Union Univ., 193 F.3d 219, 232 (4th Cir.\n\n1999) (en banc), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1243 (2000); Lambert\n\nv. Ackerly, 180 F.3d 997, 1008-09 (9th Cir.) (en banc), cert.\n\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 936 (1999); Thomas v. NFL Players Ass'n, 131\n\nF.3d 198, 204 (D.C. Cir. 1997).    Domenech's admission — that age\n\nwas one of three criteria used, at least in some cases, to\n\ndetermine which employees would be retained and which would not\n\n— is of this genre.     It therefore constitutes direct evidence\n\nwarranting a mixed-motive instruction.\n\n\n    3We think it prudent to add a caveat. The phrase \"direct\nevidence,\" by any definition, refers to evidence which, if\nbelieved by the factfinder, would warrant a burden shift. In a\ncase tried to a jury, the phrase does not require that the\nplaintiff produce evidence that the court finds persuasive. In\nother words, credibility determinations in respect to direct\nevidence are for a properly instructed jury, not for the judge.\nSee Thomas, 111 F.3d at 1512; Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins.\nCos., 968 F.2d 171, 184 (2d Cir. 1992).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f              Although CCC rails against this conclusion, its attacks\n\nlack force.         Domenech's statement was made by a decisionmaker,\n\npertained      to    the   decisional      process,      bore    squarely      on   the\n\nemployment decisions at issue (or, at least, on some of them),\n\nand     straightforwardly         conveyed      age     animus.        Given    these\n\nattributes, the statement cannot be dismissed as mere background\n\nnoise or as a stray remark.              See Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 583.\n\n              In a burst of optimistic surmise, CCC denies that\n\nDomenech's invocation of age as a criterion directly reflects\n\nage animus.         In its view, he may have been referring, say, to a\n\nplan to give older employees special (favorable) treatment.                         We\n\nreject     such      speculation.          Comments         which,    fairly    read,\n\ndemonstrate that a decisionmaker made, or intended to make,\n\nemployment decisions based on forbidden criteria constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination.               See Sheehan v. Donlen Corp.,\n\n173 F.3d 1039, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999) (observing that the term\n\n\"direct       evidence\"       covers    more    than    virtual      admissions      of\n\nillegality).         The mere fact that a fertile mind can conjure up\n\nsome innocent explanation for such a comment does not undermine\n\nits standing as direct evidence.                 See id.        To hold otherwise\n\nwould    be    to    narrow     the     definition     of    direct    evidence     so\n\ndrastically         as   to    render     the   Price       Waterhouse    framework\n\ninaccessible to all but the bluntest of admissions.                       We prefer\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fa more measured approach.                     Cf. Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 583\n\n(holding \"that a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two\n\ndifferent ways — one discriminatory and the other benign — does\n\nnot    directly          reflect       illegal      animus     and,     thus,    does     not\n\nconstitute direct evidence\") (emphasis supplied).\n\n                 Gauged against this benchmark, CCC's challenge falls\n\nshort.           In context, there is nothing inscrutable about the\n\nstatement attributed to Domenech.4                     Its meaning is plain.           Thus,\n\nwe    give       no     credence      to    CCC's     strained    attempt       to   create\n\nambiguity where none exists.\n\n                 Taking a somewhat different tack, CCC asseverates that\n\nthe evidence does not bear squarely on the contested employment\n\ndecisions because Domenech's remark, as reported, merely posited\n\nthat       age    was    used    as    a    criterion    \"in     some    cases\"      without\n\nspecifically mentioning the appellants.                        This argument assumes\n\nthat a statement cannot bear squarely on an employment decision\n\nunless it specifically refers to that decision.                           Both case law,\n\nsee, e.g., Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204 (stating that \"evidence may\n\n'bear       directly'       on     a       decision     without       referring      to   it\n\nspecifically\"),            and     common      sense     refute       that   assumption.\n\n\n\n       4\n     Becker, when queried about his response to Domenech's\narticulation of age as an employment criterion, testified that\nhe \"defended the older people\" and pointed out to Domenech that\n\"us older guys sometimes work better than the younger people.\"\n\n                                              -10-\n\fIndeed, a contrary rule would mean that the greater never could\n\nbe construed to include the lesser.\n\n            This case illustrates the wisdom of not requiring a\n\nspecific reference.      Becker testified that he asked Domenech\n\nabout the criteria that were to be used to determine who would\n\nbe   transferred   to   Vega    Baja   and   who   would   be   cut     loose.\n\nDomenech listed \"age\" among the pertinent criteria, signifying\n\nthat this protected characteristic would be used as a criterion\n\nin some of those transfer decisions.         The appellants were within\n\nthe relatively small pool of employees who were being considered\n\nfor transfer and were older than several of those who retained\n\ntheir     positions.    Under   the    circumstances,      it   would   blink\n\nreality to pretend that this evidence did not bear squarely on\n\nthe appellants' situations.\n\n            CCC's remaining assaults on the status of this evidence\n\nall relate, in one way or another, to Becker's credibility (or\n\nlack thereof).5    These animadversions confuse the predicate for\n\nobtaining a mixed-motive jury instruction — the existence of\n\ndirect evidence — with the predicate for shifting the burden of\n\n\n\n      5\n      For example, CCC notes that Domenech denied making the\n\"age\" remark and suggests that his testimony was more credible\nthan Becker's (especially since Becker never mentioned the\nmatter until after he himself had been fired). CCC also notes\nthat Becker was hardly a neutral party; at the time of trial, he\nwas suing Caribe for wrongful discharge and age discrimination.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fpersuasion under a mixed-motive analysis — proof establishing\n\nthat age played a motivating part in the challenged employment\n\ndecision.     See Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 162\n\n(2d Cir. 1997); Thomas, 111 F.3d at 1512; Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at\n\n182, 184.     Whether or not Becker's testimony was credible — a\n\nmatter on which we take no view — his recounting of Domenech's\n\nadmission nonetheless constituted direct evidence.\n\n                     B.   The Jury Instructions.\n\n            Because the appellants introduced direct evidence of\n\nage discrimination, the district court was obliged, upon the\n\nappellants'    seasonable    request,   to   give    the   jury   a   Price\n\nWaterhouse    instruction.     The   lingering      question,     then,   is\n\nwhether the court satisfied that obligation.               The appellants\n\ncontend that the court gave them short shrift.             We think not.\n\n            We briefly rehearse the controlling legal principles.\n\nA party has a right to an instruction on her theory of the case,\n\nprovided that her theory is both valid in law and supported by\n\nevidence in the record.      See United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d\n\n1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995); Rogers v. ACF Indus., Inc., 774 F.2d 814,\n\n818 (7th Cir. 1985).      But that right does not imply a corollary\n\nright to insist that the trial judge use particular verbiage.\n\nSee United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n\"Jury instructions are intended to furnish a set of directions\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fcomposing, in the aggregate, the proper legal standards to be\n\napplied by lay jurors in determining the issues that they must\n\nresolve   in   a   particular   case.   Provided   that   the   charge\n\nsatisfies this need, the court's choice of language is largely\n\na matter of discretion.\"        DeStefano, 59 F.3d at 2 (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            In this instance, the lower court deemed Becker's\n\ntestimony to be direct evidence and attempted to instruct the\n\njurors as to the effect of such evidence. 6          The appellants\n\n\n    6The court stated in material part:\n\n    In order for the plaintiffs to prove discrimination .\n    . . through direct evidence, each plaintiff must prove\n    by a preponderance of the evidence . . . the following\n    three elements: One, that he or she was 40 years or\n    older; and [two], he or she was qualified but was not\n    transferred to or offered a position at the Vega Baja\n    plant; and three, his or her age was a determinative\n    factor in defendant's decision not to offer the\n    plaintiffs a position in Vega Baja.\n\n            . . . .\n\n         If you find by a preponderance of the evidence\n    that the plaintiffs have established [these three\n    elements], then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover\n    . . . .\n\n         If, however, the plaintiffs fail to prove any of\n    these elements by a preponderance of the evidence, you\n    must decide that the plaintiffs have not proven age\n    discrimination.\n\n         Also, if you decide that the plaintiffs have\n    failed to prove that age was a determinative factor in\n    the defendant's decision, and would have suffered the\n\n                                 -13-\n\fcriticize the adequacy of this instruction.     We agree that it\n\nwas not a textbook model and do not recommend its emulation in\n\nother cases.     Yet the appellants, in their contemporaneous\n\nobjection, identified no specific flaw in the district court's\n\nlanguage.    We quote the colloquy that ensued, out of the jury's\n\nearshot, when counsel interposed his objection to the mixed-\n\nmotive instruction:\n\n  Appellants'\n  Counsel:        The plaintiffs specifically request from the\n                  Court to give a charge to the jury under Price\n                  Waterhouse.\n\n  Court:          But what is the specific charge that you want\n                  to give the jury?\n\n Appellants'\n Counsel:         [T]he specific charge that we are requesting is\n                  the following:      \"If you find that the\n                  plaintiffs have presented sufficient direct\n                  evidence to establish that age was a motivating\n                  factor in the decision to deny to them the\n                  opportunity to transfer to work at the Vega\n                  Baja plant, then the burden of persuasion\n                  shifts to the employer, who must prove that it\n\n\n\n    same consequences regardless of their ages, then you\n    must find that the plaintiffs have not proven age\n    discrimination.\n\n            . . . .\n\n         In other words, if plaintiffs have offered\n    evidence from which you conclude that defendant\n    discriminated against them because of their ages,\n    plaintiffs are entitled to recover, unless the\n    defendant proves that it would have taken the same\n    action regardless of plaintiff's ages. . . .\n\n                               -14-\n\f                would have made the same decision even if age\n                had not been taken into account.\"\n\n                . . . .\n\n Court:         Let me rule on that first. The objection is\n                denied.   I charged the jury as follows:    \"In\n                other   words,  if   plaintiffs  have   offered\n                evidence from which you can conclude that\n                defendant discriminated against them because of\n                their ages, plaintiffs are entitled to recover,\n                unless the defendant proves that it would have\n                taken the same action regardless of plaintiffs'\n                ages.\"    That's covered in my instruction.\n                That's denied. Next one.\n\n\n Appellants'\n Counsel:       To that we want to add that the case law is\n                specific that there is a shifting in the burden\n                of proof —\n\n Court:         Okay, you made your objection.    You save it.\n                You save it for appeal.\n\n Appellants'\n Counsel:       Yes, your Honor, but in order for the record to\n                be clear, that we are requesting that the jury\n                be charged that the burden of proof has shifted\n                once   the  plaintiff   has  presented   direct\n                evidence    of   discrimination,    and    very\n                respectfully submit that the testimony in this\n                case is sufficient to qualify it as direct\n                evidence.\n\n Court:         Very well.    I charged the   jury   that it is\n                direct evidence. I said so.\n\nThese comments voiced displeasure, but they did not delineate\n\nparticular language in the charge that the appellants deemed\n\nconfusing, internally inconsistent, or otherwise inconcinnous.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the appellants cannot now be heard to\n\n\n                             -15-\n\fcomplain about an overall lack of clarity or the potential for\n\nconfusion.     See Faigin v.   Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 196 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nsee also Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 (requiring parties objecting to\n\ninstructions to \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and\n\nthe grounds of that objection\").\n\n          This is not the end of the matter, for the appellants\n\nhave a more promising argument.        They did, in the course of\n\ntheir objection, request a further instruction.           They arguably\n\nwere entitled to that instruction as long as it constituted a\n\ncorrect statement of the law, integral to an important issue in\n\nthe case, that had not been substantially covered in the charge\n\nas rendered.    See Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87; McGill, 953 F.2d at\n\n13.\n\n          We   conclude,   however,    that   in   this   instance   the\n\ndistrict court's failure to accommodate the appellants' request\n\nfor a supplementary instruction did not constitute reversible\n\nerror.   It is hornbook law that a trial court does not commit\n\nerror when it instructs generally about a legal principle and\n\nthen declines a party's request for a further instruction that\n\nis misleading, legally incorrect, or incomplete.          See Lara, 181\n\nF.3d at 196; DeStefano, 59 F.3d at 4; United States v. David,\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f940 F.2d 722, 738 (1st Cir. 1991).7              This is such a case.       The\n\ncourt had attempted to give a Price Waterhouse instruction.                 See\n\nsupra note 6.      In objecting to it, the appellants had asserted\n\nthat more was needed.         To fill this perceived void, they urged\n\nthe court to instruct that the burden of persuasion shifted as\n\nlong as the appellants presented \"sufficient direct evidence to\n\nestablish that age was a motivating factor.\"             This was wrong as\n\na   matter   of   law. 8     In   a   mixed-motive   case,   the   burden    of\n\npersuasion    does     not    shift     merely    because    the   plaintiff\n\n\n\n      7\n     Wilson v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n1998), is not to the contrary.    There, we stated that if the\nrequest for a particular instruction \"directs the court's\nattention to a point upon which an instruction to the jury would\nbe helpful, the court's error in failing to charge may not be\nexcused by technical defects in the request.\" Id. at 10. But\nthat rule does not apply to substantial defects and, in all\nevents, we made the statement in a situation where the district\ncourt had completely failed to instruct the jury on an area of\nlaw central to the case. See id. at 8. In the matter at hand,\nthe instructions given did address the mixed-motive approach,\nand thus were subject to no such deficiency.\n      8\n     To be sure, the phrase \"sufficient direct evidence to\nestablish\" may be susceptible to the interpretation that the\nburden would shift if the appellants presented direct evidence\nthat established to the jury's satisfaction that age actually\nwas a motivating factor in the challenged employment decisions.\nThat would have been a correct statement of the law. But the\nphrase's more natural reading, especially in light of the\ncolloquy that followed, is a legally erroneous one, to the\neffect that the burden would shift if the appellants adduced\ndirect evidence sufficient to permit a finding that age was a\nmotivating factor.     In all events, a jury instruction's\nproponent has a duty to clarify ambiguities, see, e.g., David,\n940 F.2d at 738, and the appellants did not do so here.\n\n                                       -17-\n\fintroduces sufficient direct evidence to permit a finding that\n\na discriminatory motive was at work; the burden shifts only if\n\nthe   direct    evidence     in   fact      persuades    the    jury   that     a\n\ndiscriminatory motive was at work.            Put another way, the burden\n\nof persuasion does not shift unless and until the jury accepts\n\nthe \"direct evidence\" adduced by the plaintiff and draws the\n\ninference that the employer used an impermissible criterion in\n\nreaching the disputed employment decision.              See Kirsch, 148 F.3d\n\nat 162; Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 184.             The appellants' proposed\n\ninstruction blurred this distinction.\n\n          The     colloquy    that    followed     the     objection     shows\n\nconvincingly that the appellants were conflating the standard\n\ngoverning the giving of a mixed-motive instruction with the\n\nstandard governing the ensuing burden shift.              For example, their\n\ncounsel stated:      \"We are requesting that the jury be charged\n\nthat the burden of proof has shifted once the plaintiff has\n\npresented direct evidence of discrimination.\"                  He then opined\n\nthat \"the defendant has to carry a burden once there is a\n\npresentation of sufficient direct evidence to sustain a Price\n\nWaterhouse     charge.\"      Since   the     appellants    garbled     the    two\n\npropositions, they cannot fault the district court either for\n\nfailing to separate wheat from chaff or for refusing to give the\n\nrequested instruction.        See David, 940 F.2d at 738.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fIV.     CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.9         The short of it is that the\n\ndistrict       court    correctly    apprehended      the   character   of   the\n\nevidence       presented    and   charged    the   jury     accordingly.     The\n\ncourt's mixed-motive instruction was not letter perfect, but it\n\nsufficed to place the issue before the jury.                 In the absence of\n\neither a particularized objection to the instruction actually\n\ngiven     or    an     appropriate   request    for    a    more   enlightening\n\ninstruction, the jury verdict must stand.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n     The court below did not require the appellants to make an\nelection before submitting the case to the jury, and instead\nappears to have instructed on both the pretext approach and the\nmixed-motive approach. The appellants do not assign error to\nthe submission of these alternate theories to the jury, and we\nexpress no opinion on the practice.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f",

Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 276-77 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring), courts have struggled to determine whether particular pieces of evidence can be so classified. Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, &#167;&#167; 102, 105 Stat. 1071, 1073 (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981a(c)(1)), this struggle took on an added dimension: the Act made jury trials widely available in discrimination cases, thus sparking interest in how juries were to be instructed when direct evidence of discrimination had been introduced. We have approached these subjects cautiously, eschewing broad generalizations. See, e.g., Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, 199 F.3d 572, 581-83 (1st Cir. 1999). This appeal requires us to take an incremental step along the decisional path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1994, Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation (Thomas) acquired the assets of Challenger Caribbean Corporation (CCC), a manufacturer of circuit breakers and switches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thomas decided to shut down CCC's production line at Canoovanas and transfer the work to a Vega Baja facility operated by Thomas &amp; Betts Caribe, Inc. (Caribe). One virtue of this consolidation was the opportunity to downsize. Thomas placed a trio of executives - Frank Domenech (the manager of the Vega Baja plant), Ojel Rodrguez (his Canoovanas counterpart), and Ramoon Becker (Caribe's human resources director) - in charge of deciding which CCC employees were to be transferred and which were to be shown the door. The triumvirate met several times to determine the employees' fate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1994, Domenech announced the closing of the Canoovanas plant. He also disclosed that slightly less than half of CCC's administrative employees (17 out of 36) would be transferred to Vega Baja. The nine appellants - Michael Dalmau (age 47), Clemente Febres (age 53), Rafael Hiraldo (age 46), Carmen Loopez (age 41), Jes&#163;&#163;s Ortiz (age 64), Josee Pomales (age 54), Emma Rovira (age 43), Gloria Soto (age 47), and Luis Zayas (age 62) - were not part of that 17-member complement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 621-634, the appellants sued. CCC defended on the ground that its decisions were based on legitimate, age-neutral criteria. Following a lengthy trial, the jury returned a verdict in CCC's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence at trial was a mixed bag, some favoring the appellants and some favoring CCC. Citing book and verse would for the most part serve no useful purpose. The sole exception concerns Becker's testimony that, as the triumvirs began mulling transfer decisions, Domenech advised him privately that three criteria were used to determine which employees would be moved to Vega Baja: job performance, union identification, and \"in some cases, the age.\" The critical questions raised by this appeal concern the character of this bit of testimony and the jury instructions related to it. We shall return to those questions shortly. At this juncture, however, we pause to offer a quick primer on the effect of direct evidence in a discrimination case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under a statute like the ADEA usually proceeds by means of the familiar framework engendered in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973). We have described the mechanics of this approach (customarily called the \"pretext\" approach) in considerable detail, see, e.g., Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 579-81; Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823-24 (1st Cir. 1991), and need not elaborate upon it here. What is significant for present purposes is that, under pretext analysis, the burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff throughout the case. See Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 581; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some situations, however, a plaintiff may be entitled to use an approach that relieves her of this unremitting burden of persuasion. The key that unlocks this door is the existence of direct evidence that a proscribed factor (such as age, gender, race, or national origin) played a motivating part in the disputed employment decision. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 276-77 (O'Connor, J., concurring); Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 580. Such evidence, if accepted by the factfinder, shifts the burden of persuasion to the employer, who then must establish that he would have reached the same decision regarding the plaintiff even if he had not taken the proscribed factor into account. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 242; Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 580. Although the plaintiff's initial burden under this \"mixed-motive\" approach is heavier than the de minimis showing required to establish a prima facie case under the pretext approach, see Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 60 (2d Cir. 1997), most plaintiffs perceive the Price Waterhouse framework and its concomitant burden-shifting as conferring a pronounced advantage. In the average case, the employee thirsts for access to it, while the employer regards it as anathema. See Thomas v. Denny's, Inc., 111 F.3d 1506, 1512 (10th Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now return to the case at hand, focusing on the appellants' principal assignment of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We split our analysis into two segments. First, we evaluate the appellants' claim - strenuously challenged by CCC - that they introduced direct evidence sufficient to warrant a mixed-motive jury instruction. Because we resolve that question favorably to the appellants, we then consider the appellants' follow-on claim that the judge failed to give a suitable mixed-motive instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Character of the Evidence Presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants assert that the Becker testimony qualifies as direct evidence, and that the lower court therefore was obliged to give a mixed-motive jury instruction. CCC disputes this assertion. The question of whether particular evidence warrants a mixed-motive instruction is a question of law, subject to de novo review. See Medlock v. Ortho Biotech, Inc., 164 F.3d 545, 552 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 48 (1999); see also United States v. Flores, 968 F.2d 1366, 1367-68 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we recently had occasion to observe, the courts of appeals are in some disarray as to what constitutes direct evidence sufficient to provoke a mixed-motive instruction. See Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 582 (collecting cases). We need not draw overly fine distinctions today. For present purposes, it suffices to say that evidence is \"direct\" (and thus justifies a mixed-motive jury instruction) when it consists of statements by a decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and bear squarely on the contested employment decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See, e.g., Taylor v. Virginia UnionUniv., 193 F.3d 219, 232 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1243 (2000); Lambert v. Ackerly, 180 F.3d 997, 1008-09 (9th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 936 (1999); Thomas v. NFL Players Ass'n, 131 F.3d 198, 204 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Domenech's admission - that age was one of three criteria used, at least in some cases, to determine which employees would be retained and which would not - is of this genre. It therefore constitutes direct evidence warranting a mixed-motive instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although CCC rails against this conclusion, its attacks lack force. Domenech's statement was made by a decisionmaker, pertained to the decisional process, bore squarely on the employment decisions at issue (or, at least, on some of them), and straightforwardly conveyed age animus. Given these attributes, the statement cannot be dismissed as mere background noise or as a stray remark. See Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a burst of optimistic surmise, CCC denies that Domenech's invocation of age as a criterion directly reflects age animus. In its view, he may have been referring, say, to a plan to give older employees special (favorable) treatment. We reject such speculation. Comments which, fairly read, demonstrate that a decisionmaker made, or intended to make, employment decisions based on forbidden criteria constitute direct evidence of discrimination. See Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., 173 F.3d 1039, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999) (observing that the term \"direct evidence\" covers more than virtual admissions of illegality). The mere fact that a fertile mind can conjure up some innocent explanation for such a comment does not undermine its standing as direct evidence. See id. To hold otherwise would be to narrow the definition of direct evidence so drastically as to render the Price Waterhouse framework inaccessible to all but the bluntest of admissions. We prefer a more measured approach. Cf. Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 583 (holding \"that a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways - one discriminatory and the other benign - does not directly reflect illegal animus and, thus, does not constitute direct evidence\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gauged against this benchmark, CCC's challenge falls short. In context, there is nothing inscrutable about the statement attributed to Domenech.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Its meaning is plain. Thus, we give no credence to CCC's strained attempt to create ambiguity where none exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking a somewhat different tack, CCC asseverates that the evidence does not bear squarely on the contested employment decisions because Domenech's remark, as reported, merely posited that age was used as a criterion \"in some cases\" without specifically mentioning the appellants. This argument assumes that a statement cannot bear squarely on an employment decision unless it specifically refers to that decision. Both case law, see, e.g., Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204 (stating that \"evidence may 'bear directly' on a decision without referring to it specifically\"), and common sense refute that assumption. Indeed, a contrary rule would mean that the greater never could be construed to include the lesser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case illustrates the wisdom of not requiring a specific reference. Becker testified that he asked Domenech about the criteria that were to be used to determine who would be transferred to Vega Baja and who would be cut loose. Domenech listed \"age\" among the pertinent criteria, signifying that this protected characteristic would be used as a criterion in some of those transfer decisions. The appellants were within the relatively small pool of employees who were being considered for transfer and were older than several of those who retained their positions. Under the circumstances, it would blink reality to pretend that this evidence did not bear squarely on the appellants' situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CCC's remaining assaults on the status of this evidence all relate, in one way or another, to Becker's credibility (or lack thereof).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> These animadversions confuse the predicate for obtaining a mixed-motive jury instruction - the existence of direct evidence - with the predicate for shifting the burden of persuasion under a mixed-motive analysis - proof establishing that age played a motivating part in the challenged employment decision. See Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 162 (2d Cir. 1997); Thomas, 111 F.3d at 1512; Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182, 184. Whether or not Becker's testimony was credible - a matter on which we take no view - his recounting of Domenech's admission nonetheless constituted direct evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Jury Instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellants introduced direct evidence of age discrimination, the district court was obliged, upon the appellants' seasonable request, to give the jury a Price Waterhouse instruction. The lingering question, then, is whether the court satisfied that obligation. The appellants contend that the court gave them short shrift. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly rehearse the controlling legal principles. A party has a right to an instruction on her theory of the case, provided that her theory is both valid in law and supported by evidence in the record. See United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995); Rogers v. ACF Indus., Inc., 774 F.2d 814, 818 (7th Cir. 1985). But that right does not imply a corollary right to insist that the trial judge use particular verbiage. See United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 1992). \"Jury instructions are intended to furnish a set of directions composing, in the aggregate, the proper legal standards to be applied by lay jurors in determining the issues that they must resolve in a particular case. Provided that the charge satisfies this need, the court's choice of language is largely a matter of discretion.\" DeStefano, 59 F.3d at 2 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the lower court deemed Becker's testimony to be direct evidence and attempted to instruct the jurors as to the effect of such evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The appellants criticize the adequacy of this instruction. We agree that it was not a textbook model and do not recommend its emulation in other cases. Yet the appellants, in their contemporaneous objection, identified no specific flaw in the district court's language. We quote the colloquy that ensued, out of the jury's earshot, when counsel interposed his objection to the mixed-motive instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Counsel: The plaintiffs specifically request from the Court to give a charge to the jury under Price Waterhouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: But what is the specific charge that you want to give the jury?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Counsel: [T]he specific charge that we are requesting is the following: \"If you find that the plaintiffs have presented sufficient direct evidence to establish that age was a motivating factor in the decision to deny to them the opportunity to transfer to work at the Vega Baja plant, then the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer, who must prove that it would have made the same decision even if age had not been taken into account.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: Let me rule on that first. The objection is denied. I charged the jury as follows: \"In other words, if plaintiffs have offered evidence from which you can conclude that defendant discriminated against them because of their ages, plaintiffs are entitled to recover, unless the defendant proves that it would have taken the same action regardless of plaintiffs' ages.\" That's covered in my instruction. That's denied. Next one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Counsel: To that we want to add that the case law is specific that there is a shifting in the burden of proof -</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: Okay, you made your objection. You save it. You save it for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Counsel: Yes, your Honor, but in order for the record to be clear, that we are requesting that the jury be charged that the burden of proof has shifted once the plaintiff has presented direct evidence of discrimination, and very respectfully submit that the testimony in this case is sufficient to qualify it as direct evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: Very well. I charged the jury that it is direct evidence. I said so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These comments voiced displeasure, but they did not delineate particular language in the charge that the appellants deemed confusing, internally inconsistent, or otherwise inconcinnous. Under the circumstances, the appellants cannot now be heard to complain about an overall lack of clarity or the potential for confusion. See Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 196 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 (requiring parties objecting to instructions to \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of that objection\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the end of the matter, for the appellants have a more promising argument. They did, in the course of their objection, request a further instruction. They arguably were entitled to that instruction as long as it constituted a correct statement of the law, integral to an important issue in the case, that had not been substantially covered in the charge as rendered. See Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87; McGill, 953 F.2d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, however, that in this instance the district court's failure to accommodate the appellants' request for a supplementary instruction did not constitute reversible error. It is hornbook law that a trial court does not commit error when it instructs generally about a legal principle and then declines a party's request for a further instruction that is misleading, legally incorrect, or incomplete. See Lara, 181 F.3d at 196; DeStefano, 59 F.3d at 4; United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 738 (1st Cir. 1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This is such a case. The court had attempted to give a Price Waterhouse instruction. See supra note 6. In objecting to it, the appellants had asserted that more was needed. To fill this perceived void, they urged the court to instruct that the burden of persuasion shifted as long as the appellants presented \"sufficient direct evidence to establish that age was a motivating factor.\" This was wrong as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In a mixed-motive case, the burden of persuasion does not shift merely because the plaintiff introduces sufficient direct evidence to permit a finding that a discriminatory motive was at work; the burden shifts only if the direct evidence in fact persuades the jury that a discriminatory motive was at work. Put another way, the burden of persuasion does not shift unless and until the jury accepts the \"direct evidence\" adduced by the plaintiff and draws the inference that the employer used an impermissible criterion in reaching the disputed employment decision. See Kirsch, 148 F.3d at 162; Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 184. The appellants' proposed instruction blurred this distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The colloquy that followed the objection shows convincingly that the appellants were conflating the standard governing the giving of a mixed-motive instruction with the standard governing the ensuing burden shift. For example, their counsel stated: \"We are requesting that the jury be charged that the burden of proof has shifted once the plaintiff has presented direct evidence of discrimination.\" He then opined that \"the defendant has to carry a burden once there is a presentation of sufficient direct evidence to sustain a Price Waterhouse charge.\" Since the appellants garbled the two propositions, they cannot fault the district court either for failing to separate wheat from chaff or for refusing to give the requested instruction. See David, 940 F.2d at 738.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The short of it is that the district court correctly apprehended the character of the evidence presented and charged the jury accordingly. The court's mixed-motive instruction was not letter perfect, but it sufficed to place the issue before the jury. In the absence of either a particularized objection to the instruction actually given or an appropriate request for a more enlightening instruction, the jury verdict must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> CCC is now known as Thomas &amp; Betts Puerto Rico, Inc.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the appellants advance other arguments, those arguments are insubstantial and we reject them out of hand.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We think it prudent to add a caveat. The phrase \"direct evidence,\" by any definition, refers to evidence which, if believed by the factfinder, would warrant a burden shift. In a case tried to a jury, the phrase does not require that the plaintiff produce evidence that the court finds persuasive. In other words, credibility determinations in respect to direct evidence are for a properly instructed jury, not for the judge. See Thomas, 111 F.3d at 1512; Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Cos., 968 F.2d 171, 184 (2d Cir. 1992).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Becker, when queried about his response to Domenech's articulation of age as an employment criterion, testified that he \"defended the older people\" and pointed out to Domenech that \"us older guys sometimes work better than the younger people.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> For example, CCC notes that Domenech denied making the \"age\" remark and suggests that his testimony was more credible than Becker's (especially since Becker never mentioned the matter until after he himself had been fired).

There, we stated that if the request for a particular instruction \"directs the court's attention to a point upon which an instruction to the jury would be helpful, the court's error in failing to charge may not be excused by technical defects in the request.\" Id. at 10. But that rule does not apply to substantial defects and, in all events, we made the statement in a situation where the district court had completely failed to instruct the jury on an area of law central to the case. See id. at 8. In the matter at hand, the instructions given did address the mixed-motive approach, and thus were subject to no such deficiency.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the phrase \"sufficient direct evidence to establish\" may be susceptible to the interpretation that the burden would shift if the appellants presented direct evidence that established to the jury's satisfaction that age actually was a motivating factor in the challenged employment decisions. That would have been a correct statement of the law. But the phrase's more natural reading, especially in light of the colloquy that followed, is a legally erroneous one, to the effect that the burden would shift if the appellants adduced direct evidence sufficient to permit a finding that age was a motivating factor. In all events, a jury instruction's proponent has a duty to clarify ambiguities, see, e.g., David, 940 F.2d at 738, and the appellants did not do so here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The court below did not require the appellants to make an election before submitting the case to the jury, and instead appears to have instructed on both the pretext approach and the mixed-motive approach. The appellants do not assign error to the submission of these alternate theories to the jury, and we express no opinion on the practice.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We have approached these subjects cautiously, eschewing broad generalizations. See, e.g., Fernandes v. Costa Bros.

This appeal requires us to take an incremental step along the decisional path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1994, Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation (Thomas) acquired the assets of Challenger Caribbean Corporation (CCC), a manufacturer of circuit breakers and switches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thomas decided to shut down CCC's production line at Canoovanas and transfer the work to a Vega Baja facility operated by Thomas &amp; Betts Caribe, Inc. (Caribe). One virtue of this consolidation was the opportunity to downsize. Thomas placed a trio of executives - Frank Domenech (the manager of the Vega Baja plant), Ojel Rodrguez (his Canoovanas counterpart), and Ramoon Becker (Caribe's human resources director) - in charge of deciding which CCC employees were to be transferred and which were to be shown the door. The triumvirate met several times to determine the employees' fate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1994, Domenech announced the closing of the Canoovanas plant. He also disclosed that slightly less than half of CCC's administrative employees (17 out of 36) would be transferred to Vega Baja. The nine appellants - Michael Dalmau (age 47), Clemente Febres (age 53), Rafael Hiraldo (age 46), Carmen Loopez (age 41), Jes&#163;&#163;s Ortiz (age 64), Josee Pomales (age 54), Emma Rovira (age 43), Gloria Soto (age 47), and Luis Zayas (age 62) - were not part of that 17-member complement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 621-634, the appellants sued. CCC defended on the ground that its decisions were based on legitimate, age-neutral criteria. Following a lengthy trial, the jury returned a verdict in CCC's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence at trial was a mixed bag, some favoring the appellants and some favoring CCC. Citing book and verse would for the most part serve no useful purpose. The sole exception concerns Becker's testimony that, as the triumvirs began mulling transfer decisions, Domenech advised him privately that three criteria were used to determine which employees would be moved to Vega Baja: job performance, union identification, and \"in some cases, the age.\" The critical questions raised by this appeal concern the character of this bit of testimony and the jury instructions related to it. We shall return to those questions shortly. At this juncture, however, we pause to offer a quick primer on the effect of direct evidence in a discrimination case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under a statute like the ADEA usually proceeds by means of the familiar framework engendered in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-05 (1973). We have described the mechanics of this approach (customarily called the \"pretext\" approach) in considerable detail, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198793\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fernandes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198793/fernandes-v-costa-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">579-81</span></a></span>; Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 823-24 (1st Cir. 1991), and need not elaborate upon it here. What is significant for present purposes is that, under pretext analysis, the burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff throughout the case. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198793\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fernandes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198793/fernandes-v-costa-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mesnick,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some situations, however, a plaintiff may be entitled to use an approach that relieves her of this unremitting burden of persuasion. The key that unlocks this door is the existence of direct evidence that a proscribed factor (such as age, gender, race, or national origin) played a motivating part in the disputed employment decision.

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now return to the case at hand, focusing on the appellants' principal assignment of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We split our analysis into two segments. First, we evaluate the appellants' claim - strenuously challenged by CCC - that they introduced direct evidence sufficient to warrant a mixed-motive jury instruction. Because we resolve that question favorably to the appellants, we then consider the appellants' follow-on claim that the judge failed to give a suitable mixed-motive instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Character of the Evidence Presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants assert that the Becker testimony qualifies as direct evidence, and that the lower court therefore was obliged to give a mixed-motive jury instruction. CCC disputes this assertion. The question of whether particular evidence warrants a mixed-motive instruction is a question of law, subject to de novo review. See Medlock v. Ortho Biotech, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157353\"><a href=\"/opinion/157353/medlock-v-ortho-biotech-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 552 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198793\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fernandes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198793/fernandes-v-costa-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">582</span> </a></span>(collecting cases). We need not draw overly fine distinctions today. For present purposes, it suffices to say that evidence is \"direct\" (and thus justifies a mixed-motive jury instruction) when it consists of statements by a decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and bear squarely on the contested employment decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See, e.g., Taylor v. Virginia UnionUniv., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766372\"><a href=\"/opinion/766372/lynne-s-taylor-and-keisha-johnson-v-virginia-union-university-keisha/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 232 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Cir. 1997). Domenech's admission - that age was one of three criteria used, at least in some cases, to determine which employees would be retained and which would not - is of this genre. It therefore constitutes direct evidence warranting a mixed-motive instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although CCC rails against this conclusion, its attacks lack force. Domenech's statement was made by a decisionmaker, pertained to the decisional process, bore squarely on the employment decisions at issue (or, at least, on some of them), and straightforwardly conveyed age animus. Given these attributes, the statement cannot be dismissed as mere background noise or as a stray remark. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198793\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fernandes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198793/fernandes-v-costa-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a burst of optimistic surmise, CCC denies that Domenech's invocation of age as a criterion directly reflects age animus. In its view, he may have been referring, say, to a plan to give older employees special (favorable) treatment. We reject such speculation. Comments which, fairly read, demonstrate that a decisionmaker made, or intended to make, employment decisions based on forbidden criteria constitute direct evidence of discrimination. See Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763288\"><a href=\"/opinion/763288/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-540-75-empl-prac-dec-p-45791-regina/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span>, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999) (observing that the term \"direct evidence\" covers more than virtual admissions of illegality). The mere fact that a fertile mind can conjure up some innocent explanation for such a comment does not undermine its standing as direct evidence. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763288\"><a href=\"/opinion/763288/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-540-75-empl-prac-dec-p-45791-regina/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> To hold </a></span>otherwise would be to narrow the definition of direct evidence so drastically as to render the Price Waterhouse framework inaccessible to all but the bluntest of admissions. We prefer a more measured approach. Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198793\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fernandes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198793/fernandes-v-costa-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">583</span> </a></span>(holding \"that a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways - one discriminatory and the other benign - does not directly reflect illegal animus and, thus, does not constitute direct evidence\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gauged against this benchmark, CCC's challenge falls short. In context, there is nothing inscrutable about the statement attributed to Domenech.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Its meaning is plain. Thus, we give no credence to CCC's strained attempt to create ambiguity where none exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking a somewhat different tack, CCC asseverates that the evidence does not bear squarely on the contested employment decisions because Domenech's remark, as reported, merely posited that age was used as a criterion \"in some cases\" without specifically mentioning the appellants. This argument assumes that a statement cannot bear squarely on an employment decision unless it specifically refers to that decision. Both case law, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184382\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Thomas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/184382/thomas-valerie-v-natl-ftbl-leag-plyrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">204</span> </a></span>(stating that \"evidence may 'bear directly' on a decision without referring to it specifically\"), and common sense refute that assumption. Indeed, a contrary rule would mean that the greater never could be construed to include the lesser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case illustrates the wisdom of not requiring a specific reference. Becker testified that he asked Domenech about the criteria that were to be used to determine who would be transferred to Vega Baja and who would be cut loose. Domenech listed \"age\" among the pertinent criteria, signifying that this protected characteristic would be used as a criterion in some of those transfer decisions. The appellants were within the relatively small pool of employees who were being considered for transfer and were older than several of those who retained their positions. Under the circumstances, it would blink reality to pretend that this evidence did not bear squarely on the appellants' situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CCC's remaining assaults on the status of this evidence all relate, in one way or another, to Becker's credibility (or lack thereof).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> These animadversions confuse the predicate for obtaining a mixed-motive jury instruction - the existence of direct evidence - with the predicate for shifting the burden of persuasion under a mixed-motive analysis - proof establishing that age played a motivating part in the challenged employment decision.

Fleet Street, Ltd., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span>, 162 (2d Cir. 1997); <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"154757\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Thomas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/154757/thomas-v-dennys-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1512</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586808\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ostrowski,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/586808/united-states-v-joyce-lee-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 184. Whether or not Becker's testimony was credible - a matter on which we take no view - his recounting of Domenech's admission nonetheless constituted direct evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Jury Instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellants introduced direct evidence of age discrimination, the district court was obliged, upon the appellants' seasonable request, to give the jury a Price Waterhouse instruction. The lingering question, then, is whether the court satisfied that obligation. The appellants contend that the court gave them short shrift. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly rehearse the controlling legal principles. A party has a right to an instruction on her theory of the case, provided that her theory is both valid in law and supported by evidence in the record. See United States v. DeStefano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196179\"><a href=\"/opinion/196179/united-states-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 1995); Rogers v.

But that right does not imply a corollary right to insist that the trial judge use particular verbiage. See United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575209\"><a href=\"/opinion/575209/united-states-v-robert-l-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 1992). \"Jury instructions are intended to furnish a set of directions composing, in the aggregate, the proper legal standards to be applied by lay jurors in determining the issues that they must resolve in a particular case.

We agree that it was not a textbook model and do not recommend its emulation in other cases. Yet the appellants, in their contemporaneous objection, identified no specific flaw in the district court's language. We quote the colloquy that ensued, out of the jury's earshot, when counsel interposed his objection to the mixed-motive instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Counsel: The plaintiffs specifically request from the Court to give a charge to the jury under Price Waterhouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: But what is the specific charge that you want to give the jury?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Counsel: [T]he specific charge that we are requesting is the following: \"If you find that the plaintiffs have presented sufficient direct evidence to establish that age was a motivating factor in the decision to deny to them the opportunity to transfer to work at the Vega Baja plant, then the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer, who must prove that it would have made the same decision even if age had not been taken into account.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: Let me rule on that first. The objection is denied. I charged the jury as follows: \"In other words, if plaintiffs have offered evidence from which you can conclude that defendant discriminated against them because of their ages, plaintiffs are entitled to recover, unless the defendant proves that it would have taken the same action regardless of plaintiffs' ages.\" That's covered in my instruction.

Under the circumstances, the appellants cannot now be heard to complain about an overall lack of clarity or the potential for confusion. See Faigin v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.

They did, in the course of their objection, request a further instruction. They arguably were entitled to that instruction as long as it constituted a correct statement of the law, integral to an important issue in the case, that had not been substantially covered in the charge as rendered. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Faigin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575209\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">McGill,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/575209/united-states-v-robert-l-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, however, that in this instance the district court's failure to accommodate the appellants' request for a supplementary instruction did not constitute reversible error. It is hornbook law that a trial court does not commit error when it instructs generally about a legal principle and then declines a party's request for a further instruction that is misleading, legally incorrect, or incomplete.

The court had attempted to give a Price Waterhouse instruction. See supra note 6. In objecting to it, the appellants had asserted that more was needed. To fill this perceived void, they urged the court to instruct that the burden of persuasion shifted as long as the appellants presented \"sufficient direct evidence to establish that age was a motivating factor.\" This was wrong as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In a mixed-motive case, the burden of persuasion does not shift merely because the plaintiff introduces sufficient direct evidence to permit a finding that a discriminatory motive was at work; the burden shifts only if the direct evidence in fact persuades the jury that a discriminatory motive was at work. Put another way, the burden of persuasion does not shift unless and until the jury accepts the \"direct evidence\" adduced by the plaintiff and draws the inference that the employer used an impermissible criterion in reaching the disputed employment decision. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kirsch,</span> <span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">162</span></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586808\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ostrowski,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/586808/united-states-v-joyce-lee-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>.

For example, their counsel stated: \"We are requesting that the jury be charged that the burden of proof has shifted once the plaintiff has presented direct evidence of discrimination.\" He then opined that \"the defendant has to carry a burden once there is a presentation of sufficient direct evidence to sustain a Price Waterhouse charge.\" Since the appellants garbled the two propositions, they cannot fault the district court either for failing to separate wheat from chaff or for refusing to give the requested instruction.

In the absence of either a particularized objection to the instruction actually given or an appropriate request for a more enlightening instruction, the jury verdict must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> CCC is now known as Thomas &amp; Betts Puerto Rico, Inc.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the appellants advance other arguments, those arguments are insubstantial and we reject them out of hand.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We think it prudent to add a caveat. The phrase \"direct evidence,\" by any definition, refers to evidence which, if believed by the factfinder, would warrant a burden shift. In a case tried to a jury, the phrase does not require that the plaintiff produce evidence that the court finds persuasive. In other words, credibility determinations in respect to direct evidence are for a properly instructed jury, not for the judge.

There, we stated that if the request for a particular instruction \"directs the court's attention to a point upon which an instruction to the jury would be helpful, the court's error in failing to charge may not be excused by technical defects in the request.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756417\"><a href=\"/opinion/756417/eric-wilson-v-maritime-overseas-corporation-and-cambridge-tankers-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 10. </a></span>But that rule does not apply to substantial defects and, in all events, we made the statement in a situation where the district court had completely failed to instruct the jury on an area of law central to the case. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756417\"><a href=\"/opinion/756417/eric-wilson-v-maritime-overseas-corporation-and-cambridge-tankers-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 8. </a></span>In the matter at hand, the instructions given did address the mixed-motive approach, and thus were subject to no such deficiency.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the phrase \"sufficient direct evidence to establish\" may be susceptible to the interpretation that the burden would shift if the appellants presented direct evidence that established to the jury's satisfaction that age actually was a motivating factor in the challenged employment decisions. That would have been a correct statement of the law. But the phrase's more natural reading, especially in light of the colloquy that followed, is a legally erroneous one, to the effect that the burden would shift if the appellants adduced direct evidence sufficient to permit a finding that age was a motivating factor. In all events, a jury instruction's proponent has a duty to clarify ambiguities, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">David,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, and the appellants did not do so here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The court below did not require the appellants to make an election before submitting the case to the jury, and instead appears to have instructed on both the pretext approach and the mixed-motive approach. The appellants do not assign error to the submission of these alternate theories to the jury, and we express no opinion on the practice.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
