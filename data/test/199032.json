This appeal arises from a civil suit\n\nfiled by plaintiffs-appellants – The Lares Group II, John G. Laramee,\n\nand Sharon Laramee – against numerous defendants-appellees1 for an\n\nalleged violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\n\nAct, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968 (\"RICO\"). The district court determined\n\nthat appellants' RICO claim was barred by the applicable four-year\n\nstatute of limitations, see Lares Group II v. Tobin, 47 F. Supp. 2d\n\n223, 229-31 (D.R.I. 1999) (citing Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff\n\n& Assocs., Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 156 (1987), and Rodríguez v. Banco\n\nCentral, 917 F.2d 664, 665 (1st Cir. 1990)), and declined to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over appellants' remaining state law claims,\n\nsee id. at 235-36.    For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          The facts in this case were thoroughly addressed by the\n\ndistrict court. See id. at 225-28. For purposes of this appeal, we\n\nneed only briefly summarize that lengthy discussion.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n          In 1988, appellants attempted to lease an office building\n\nowned by them to the Rhode Island Department of Employment and\n\n\n1 Defendants-appellees are Bentley Tobin, Matthew T. Marcello, III,\nMichael B. Nulman, a Rhode Island law partnership known as Hinckley,\nAllen & Snyder, Joseph Mollicone, Jr., Joseph DiBattista, all\nindividually and as trustees of Pine Street Realty Trust under a\nDeclaration of Trust dated January 8, 1988, and as the General Partners\nof Pine Street Trust Limited Partnership; and Rodney M. Brusini, Edward\nD. Diprete, Henry W. Fazzano, Edward F. Ricci, and John S. Renza, Sr.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fTraining. The State, however, eventually elected to lease another\n\nbuilding, which was owned by several of the named defendants.\n\nAppellants regarded the circumstances surrounding the selection process\n\nas dubious and publicly demanded an official investigation.         In\n\naddition to writing letters to several newspapers calling into doubt\n\nthe propriety of the lease, appellants contacted numerous public\n\nofficials including representatives of the Governor's Office, the Rhode\n\nIsland Department of the Attorney General, the United States Attorney\n\nfor the District of Rhode Island, and Rhode Island's congressional\n\ndelegation. These pleas for investigation began in late 1988 and\n\ncontinued into 1989. Six years later, on August 30, 1995, appellants\n\ninitiated this law suit following public revelations of official\n\ncorruption reaching into the highest levels of the Rhode Island state\n\ngovernment.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n          Appellants seek civil damages resulting from the failed\n\nattempt to secure the state lease. The amended complaint names rival\n\nbuilding owners, officials of the State, as well as attorneys and\n\nbankers involved in the lease, as defendants in the suit. The sole\n\nfederal claim is for an alleged violation of RICO, see 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1961-1968, and is premised upon the allegation that appellants were\n\ndenied state business because the defendants were participants in a\n\ncomplex scheme of rigging the building selection process through\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbribery and extortion. In addition to appellants' RICO claim, the\n\namended complaint also contains numerous state law causes of action.\n\n          After conducting substantial discovery, appellees moved the\n\ndistrict court for summary judgment. On April 19, 1999, the court\n\ngranted appellees' motions, holding, in relevant part, that (1) the\n\nstatute of limitations had expired on appellants' RICO claim; and (2)\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over appellants' state law claims would be\n\ndenied, following dismissal of all federal claims. See generally Lares\n\nGroup II, 47 F. Supp. 2d 223.      This appeal followed.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          On February 23, 2000, the United States Supreme Court issued\n\nan opinion in Rotella v. Wood, 120 S. Ct. 1075 (2000). The dispositive\n\nquestion here is identical to that addressed in Rotella, namely,\n\nwhether the four-year statute of limitations applicable to civil RICO\n\nclaims is governed by (1) the \"injury discovery\" accrual rule, which\n\nstates that the statutory clock begins to run when a plaintiff knew, or\n\nshould have known, of his injury; or (2) the \"injury and pattern\n\ndiscovery\" rule favored by appellants, under which a civil RICO claim\n\naccrues only when the claimant discovers, or should have discovered,\n\nboth an injury and a pattern of RICO activity. See id. at 1079-80.\n\nResolving a circuit split, the Rotella Court rejected the injury and\n\npattern discovery rule applied by a minority of the courts of appeals.\n\nSee id. at 1080. While the Court declined to \"settle upon a final\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\frule,\" see id. at 1080 n.2, it nevertheless left intact – at least on\n\nfacts such as those presented here – the injury discovery accrual rule\n\nfollowed by the First Circuit, see Rodríguez v. Banco Central, 917 F.2d\n\n664, 665 (1st Cir. 1990), and correctly applied by the district court\n\nin this case, see generally Lares Group II, 47 F. Supp. 2d 223.\n\nAccordingly, we need not belabor the issue and may quickly dispose of\n\nthis case.\n\n           In Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., Inc., 483\n\nU.S. 143, 156 (1987), the Supreme Court held that a civil RICO claim is\n\nsubject to a four-year statute of limitations. See also Klehr v. A.O.\n\nSmith Corp., 521 U.S. 179, 183 (1997); Rodríguez, 917 F.2d at 665. The\n\nCourt, however, left open the question of accrual. See Klehr, 521 U.S.\n\nat 189. This left the federal appellate courts free to part company,\n\nwhich we invariably did.\n\n           The First Circuit, in addition to the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\n\nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits, \"applied an injury discovery accrual rule\n\nstarting the clock when a plaintiff knew or should have known of his\n\ninjury.\"   Rotella, 120 S. Ct. at 1080 (citing cases).     The Sixth,\n\nTenth, and Eleventh Circuits, on the other hand, \"applied the injury\n\nand pattern discovery rule . . . , under which a civil RICO claim\n\naccrues only when the claimant discovers, or should discover, both an\n\ninjury and a pattern of RICO activity.\" Id. (citing cases). The Third\n\nCircuit chose yet another approach, adopting a \"last predicate act\"\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\frule. Keystone Ins. Co. v. Houghton, 863 F.2d 1125, 1130 (3d Cir.\n\n1988).   Under the Third Circuit's formulation, the statute of\n\nlimitations \"began to run as soon as the plaintiff knew or should have\n\nknown of the injury and the pattern of racketeering activity, but began\n\nto run anew upon each predicate act forming part of the same pattern.\"\n\nRotella, 120 S. Ct. at 1080.\n\n          In Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., the Supreme Court \"cut the\n\npossibilities by one, in rejecting the last predicate act rule\"\n\nespoused by the Third Circuit. Rotella, 120 S. Ct. at 1080. The Court\n\nreasoned, in part, that \"[s]ince a pattern of predicate acts can\n\ncontinue indefinitely, with each separated by as many as 10 years, that\n\nrule might have extended the limitations period to many decades, and so\n\nbeyond any limit that Congress could have contemplated.\"          Id.\n\n          Following Klehr, two possibilities remained. As a result,\n\nthe Court was called upon to once again address the accrual question in\n\nRotella, where, as indicated, it rejected the injury and pattern\n\ndiscovery rule. The Court carefully explained its reasoning, stating:\n\n          By tying the start of the limitations period to\n          a plaintiff's reasonable discovery of a pattern\n          rather than to the point of injury or its\n          reasonable discovery, the [injury plus pattern]\n          rule would extend the potential limitations\n          period for most civil RICO cases well beyond the\n          time when a plaintiff's cause of action is\n          complete, as this case shows . . . .\n          [Accordingly, the injury plus pattern rule] would\n          bar repose, prove a godsend to stale claims, and\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          doom any hope of certainty in identifying\n          potential liability.\n\nId. at 1082-83 (footnote omitted).\n\n          Under the principles announced in Rotella, Rodríguez v. Banco\n\nCentral remains the law of this Circuit.       In Rodríguez, we held:\n\n          After considering the arguments, we find that we\n          agree with the majority view, which ties\n          \"accrual\" to the time a plaintiff knew or should\n          have known of his injury. We shall follow the\n          principles adopted by the Second Circuit in\n          Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 859 F.2d 1096 (2d\n          Cir. 1988).\n\n917 F.2d at 665. In Bankers Trust, the Second Circuit stated \"we . .\n\n. hold that each time a plaintiff suffers an injury caused by a\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a cause of action to recover damages\n\nbased on that injury accrues to plaintiff at the time he discovered or\n\nshould have discovered the injury.\"       859 F.2d at 1102.\n\n          In addition, we note that in Rotella the Supreme Court\n\nindicated that \"in applying a discovery accrual rule, . . . discovery\n\nof the injury, not discovery of the other elements of a claim, is what\n\nstarts the clock.\" 120 S. Ct. at 1081. While we recognize that in\n\nRotella the Supreme Court did not affirmatively adopt the injury\n\ndiscovery rule, we nonetheless believe that this passage is instructive\n\nand accurately reflects the law of this Circuit.\n\n          In this case, the record contains ample evidence that\n\nappellants knew of their injury prior to the statutory period. First,\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fappellants learned that they were not awarded the subject lease in\n\nNovember 1988.    Thereafter, in 1988 and continuing into 1989,\n\nappellants complained about the lease award to the Governor's office,\n\nto Cranston Mayor James Taft, to the State Director of Administration,\n\nto members of Congress, to the United States Attorney for the District\n\nof Rhode Island, to the Rhode Island Attorney General, to the\n\nProvidence Journal, to the Warwick Beacon, and to Eastland Bank. In\n\naddition, in 1990, The Lares Group II was placed into receivership and\n\nLaramee filed a lender liability action against Eastland Bank, accusing\n\nthe bank and its officials of complicity in the lease deal. Given this\n\nevidence, the district court correctly determined that appellants knew\n\nof their injury prior to August 30, 1991. Consequently, since this\n\naction was not filed until August 30, 1995, appellants' RICO claim is\n\nbarred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations as a matter\n\nof law.   See Rotella, 120 S. Ct. at 1080; Rodríguez, 917 F.2d at 665.\n\n          In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that the record\n\nin this case clearly indicates that appellants' cause of action was\n\ncomplete at the time of their injury.      Rotella was premised on a\n\nsimilar record, as the Supreme Court carefully explained:\n\n          Some Circuits apply injury and pattern discovery\n          out of fear that when the injury precedes a\n          second predicate act, the limitations period\n          might otherwise expire before the pattern is\n          created. Respondents argue that this overlooks\n          the cardinal principle that a limitations period\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          does not begin to run until the cause of action\n          is complete.\n\n          The quandary is hypothetical here; Rotella does\n          not dispute that his injury in 1986 completed the\n          elements of his cause of action. Hence, we need\n          not and do not decide whether civil RICO allows\n          for a cause of action when a second predicate act\n          follows the injury, or what limitations accrual\n          rule might apply in such a case.\n\n120 S. Ct. at 1083 n.4 (citations omitted).     We follow suit here,\n\nleaving open the possibility that a different accrual rule may apply\n\nwhere a plaintiff's injury does not complete her cause of action.\n\n          Finally, because appellants' federal RICO claim constituted\n\nthe sole basis for subject matter jurisdiction in this case, the\n\ndistrict court acted well within its broad discretion in dismissing\n\nwithout prejudice appellants' supplemental state law claims. See,\n\ne.g., Newman v. Burgin, 930 F.2d 955, 965 (1st Cir. 1991). Appellants'\n\ncontention that the district court intentionally delayed issuing its\n\ndecision until after the applicable state statutes of limitations may\n\nhave expired on many of appellants' state law claims is spurious.\n\nFurthermore, as a matter of law, \"[w]e are not prepared to say that,\n\nwhere other features of a case support dismissal, a federal district\n\ncourt (to dismiss the claim) also must be certain a plaintiff with\n\npendent state-law claims can proceed in state court.\" Id. We need not\n\nanalyze this claim any further.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fFor the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                   -12-\n\f",

Factual Background\n\n          In 1988, appellants attempted to lease an office building\n\nowned by them to the Rhode Island Department of Employment and\n\n\n1 Defendants-appellees are Bentley Tobin, Matthew T. Marcello, III,\nMichael B. Nulman, a Rhode Island law partnership known as Hinckley,\nAllen & Snyder, Joseph Mollicone, Jr., Joseph DiBattista, all\nindividually and as trustees of Pine Street Realty Trust under a\nDeclaration of Trust dated January 8, 1988, and as the General Partners\nof Pine Street Trust Limited Partnership; and Rodney M. Brusini, Edward\nD. Diprete, Henry W. Fazzano, Edward F. Ricci, and John S. Renza, Sr.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fTraining. The State, however, eventually elected to lease another\n\nbuilding, which was owned by several of the named defendants.\n\nAppellants regarded the circumstances surrounding the selection process\n\nas dubious and publicly demanded an official investigation.         In\n\naddition to writing letters to several newspapers calling into doubt\n\nthe propriety of the lease, appellants contacted numerous public\n\nofficials including representatives of the Governor's Office, the Rhode\n\nIsland Department of the Attorney General, the United States Attorney\n\nfor the District of Rhode Island, and Rhode Island's congressional\n\ndelegation. These pleas for investigation began in late 1988 and\n\ncontinued into 1989. Six years later, on August 30, 1995, appellants\n\ninitiated this law suit following public revelations of official\n\ncorruption reaching into the highest levels of the Rhode Island state\n\ngovernment.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n          Appellants seek civil damages resulting from the failed\n\nattempt to secure the state lease. The amended complaint names rival\n\nbuilding owners, officials of the State, as well as attorneys and\n\nbankers involved in the lease, as defendants in the suit. The sole\n\nfederal claim is for an alleged violation of RICO, see 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1961-1968, and is premised upon the allegation that appellants were\n\ndenied state business because the defendants were participants in a\n\ncomplex scheme of rigging the building selection process through\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbribery and extortion. In addition to appellants' RICO claim, the\n\namended complaint also contains numerous state law causes of action.\n\n          After conducting substantial discovery, appellees moved the\n\ndistrict court for summary judgment. On April 19, 1999, the court\n\ngranted appellees' motions, holding, in relevant part, that (1) the\n\nstatute of limitations had expired on appellants' RICO claim; and (2)\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over appellants' state law claims would be\n\ndenied, following dismissal of all federal claims.

This appeal followed.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          On February 23, 2000, the United States Supreme Court issued\n\nan opinion in Rotella v.

The dispositive\n\nquestion here is identical to that addressed in Rotella, namely,\n\nwhether the four-year statute of limitations applicable to civil RICO\n\nclaims is governed by (1) the \"injury discovery\" accrual rule, which\n\nstates that the statutory clock begins to run when a plaintiff knew, or\n\nshould have known, of his injury; or (2) the \"injury and pattern\n\ndiscovery\" rule favored by appellants, under which a civil RICO claim\n\naccrues only when the claimant discovers, or should have discovered,\n\nboth an injury and a pattern of RICO activity.

This left the federal appellate courts free to part company,\n\nwhich we invariably did.\n\n           The First Circuit, in addition to the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\n\nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits, \"applied an injury discovery accrual rule\n\nstarting the clock when a plaintiff knew or should have known of his\n\ninjury.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118341\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rotella,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118341/rotella-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under the Third Circuit's formulation, the statute of\n\nlimitations \"began to run as soon as the plaintiff knew or should have\n\nknown of the injury and the pattern of racketeering activity, but began\n\nto run anew upon each predicate act forming part of the same pattern.\"\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118341\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rotella,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118341/rotella-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Rodríguez, we held:\n\n          After considering the arguments, we find that we\n          agree with the majority view, which ties\n          \"accrual\" to the time a plaintiff knew or should\n          have known of his injury. We shall follow the\n          principles adopted by the Second Circuit in\n          Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513193\"><a href=\"/opinion/513193/bankers-trust-company-v-daniel-rhoades-herman-soifer-and-milton-braten/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(2d\n          Cir. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550644\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">1988).</span>\n\n<a href=\"/opinion/550644/raul-f-rodriguez-v-banco-central-raul-rodriguez-rodriguez-v-banco/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. While we recognize that in\n\nRotella the Supreme Court did not affirmatively adopt the injury\n\ndiscovery rule, we nonetheless believe that this passage is instructive\n\nand accurately reflects the law of this Circuit.\n\n          In this case, the record contains ample evidence that\n\nappellants knew of their injury prior to the statutory period. First,\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fappellants learned that they were not awarded the subject lease in\n\nNovember 1988.    Thereafter, in 1988 and continuing into 1989,\n\nappellants complained about the lease award to the Governor's office,\n\nto Cranston Mayor James Taft, to the State Director of Administration,\n\nto members of Congress, to the United States Attorney for the District\n\nof Rhode Island, to the Rhode Island Attorney General, to the\n\nProvidence Journal, to the Warwick Beacon, and to Eastland Bank. In\n\naddition, in 1990, The Lares Group II was placed into receivership and\n\nLaramee filed a lender liability action against Eastland Bank, accusing\n\nthe bank and its officials of complicity in the lease deal. Given this\n\nevidence, the district court correctly determined that appellants knew\n\nof their injury prior to August 30, 1991. Consequently, since this\n\naction was not filed until August 30, 1995, appellants' RICO claim is\n\nbarred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations as a matter\n\nof law.   See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118341\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rotella,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118341/rotella-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rotella was premised on a\n\nsimilar record, as the Supreme Court carefully explained:\n\n          Some Circuits apply injury and pattern discovery\n          out of fear that when the injury precedes a\n          second predicate act, the limitations period\n          might otherwise expire before the pattern is\n          created. Respondents argue that this overlooks\n          the cardinal principle that a limitations period\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          does not begin to run until the cause of action\n          is complete.\n\n          The quandary is hypothetical here; Rotella does\n          not dispute that his injury in 1986 completed the\n          elements of his cause of action. Hence, we need\n          not and do not decide whether civil RICO allows\n          for a cause of action when a second predicate act\n          follows the injury, or what limitations accrual\n          rule might apply in such a </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118341\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">case.</span>\n\n<a href=\"/opinion/118341/rotella-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1083</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">n.4 (citations omitted).     We follow suit here,\n\nleaving open the possibility that a different accrual rule may apply\n\nwhere a plaintiff's injury does not complete her cause of action.\n\n          Finally, because appellants' federal RICO claim constituted\n\nthe sole basis for subject matter jurisdiction in this case, the\n\ndistrict court acted well within its broad discretion in dismissing\n\nwithout prejudice appellants' supplemental state law claims. See,\n\ne.g., Newman v. Burgin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559503\"><a href=\"/opinion/559503/anny-newman-v-diana-burgin/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 965 (1st Cir. 1991). Appellants'\n\ncontention that the district court intentionally delayed issuing its\n\ndecision until after the applicable state statutes of limitations may\n\nhave expired on many of appellants' state law claims is spurious.\n\nFurthermore, as a matter of law, \"[w]e are not prepared to say that,\n\nwhere other features of a case support dismissal, a federal district\n\ncourt (to dismiss the claim) also must be certain a plaintiff with\n\npendent state-law claims can proceed in state court.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559503\"><a href=\"/opinion/559503/anny-newman-v-diana-burgin/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> We need </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">not\n\nanalyze this claim any further.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fFor the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                   -12-\n\f</pre>",
