Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Bonnie Scott Jones, with whom Simon Heller and Center for\nReproductive Law & Policy were on brief, for appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                        June 23, 2000\n\f\f           STAHL, Circuit Judge.               This appeal results from a\n\nlawsuit brought against a number of anti-abortion activists by\n\na women’s rights organization, three facilities that perform\n\nabortions in Puerto Rico (together with their directors), and\n\ntwo women who, as a result of defendants’ conduct, failed to\n\nsecure    desired   medical     treatment          at   the   facilities.        The\n\ndistrict court initially granted defendants summary judgment on\n\nall claims, but we reversed that decision in large part and\n\nremanded for a trial.       See Libertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d 428 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n           Following our remand, defendant-appellee Carlos Sanchez\n\nrefused to participate further in the proceedings, and in June\n\n1996, the district court entered a default judgment against him\n\non plaintiffs’ claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) and pendent\n\nPuerto    Rico   tort    law.     Eventually,            in    1998,     plaintiffs\n\nnegotiated a settlement with the other defendants, but sought,\n\ninter alia, an award of damages and attorney’s fees against\n\nSanchez, who took no part in the negotiations leading to the\n\nsettlement agreement.       In May 1999, the district court denied\n\nplaintiffs' request for damages and fees, stating that it based\n\nits   judgment   “upon    the   same    analysis        we    employed    when   [in\n\nconnection with the settlement agreement] we entered judgment\n\nagainst    [another      defendant]”         and    cross-referencing         three\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdocuments which the court believed would explain its ratio\n\ndecidendi.\n\n            Having read the cross-referenced documents and other\n\nrelevant portions of the record, we find ourselves unable to\n\nunderstand the district court’s reasoning.            Moreover, the record\n\nas a whole would seem to support plaintiffs’ claimed entitlement\n\nto both damages and an attorney fee award.                With respect to\n\ndamages,     the    default   judgment    requires      that     plaintiffs’\n\nallegations of fact against Sanchez “be taken as true and . . .\n\nbe considered established as a matter of law.”                 Brockton Sav.\n\nBank v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 771 F.2d 5, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1985); see also Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 52 (1983) (“[O]nce\n\nliability    is    found,   the   [factfinder]   is    required    to   award\n\ncompensatory damages in an amount appropriate to compensate the\n\nplaintiff for his loss.” (Emphasis supplied)).                  Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations, when credited as they must be, certainly seem to\n\nestablish that plaintiffs suffered a number of harms compensable\n\nunder § 1985(3) and Puerto Rico tort law.             Moreover, insofar as\n\nthe allegations establish that Sanchez acted intentionally and\n\nout of hostility towards women, they also seem sufficient to put\n\nthe question of punitive damages into play.            See Smith, 461 U.S.\n\nat 51; Hobson v. Wilson, 737 F.2d 1, 63 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (noting\n\nthat punitive damages can be awarded pursuant to § 1985(3)).\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f          Similarly, with respect to attorney’s fees, we note\n\nthat (1) such fees are to be awarded to \"prevailing parties\"\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (making fees available to claimants who\n\nprevail under § 1985) except in \"special circumstances,\"              see\n\nWilliams v. Hanover Hous. Auth., 113 F.3d 1294, 1300-01 (1st Cir.\n\n1997); (2) plaintiffs would seem to have “prevailed” in their §\n\n1985(3) claims against Sanchez;1 (3) no special circumstances\n\nmaking a fee award inappropriate are manifest in the record; and\n\n(4) the absence of a fee award against the settling defendants\n\n(per the terms of the settlement agreement) would not seem\n\nrelevant to the question of Sanchez's fee liability, cf. id. at\n\n1301-02 (emphasizing that fee liability under § 1988 turns not\n\non a defendant's conduct or circumstances but \"on the harm\n\nsuffered by the plaintiffs and the relief obtained through their\n\nlawsuit\").\n\n          All   that   said,   we    are   reluctant   to   remand   with\n\ndirections that damages and fees be awarded without first giving\n\nthe district court, which presided over this case for years, an\n\nopportunity to set forth any basis for its decision that we may\n\nhave overlooked.       We therefore vacate the judgment denying\n\n\n\n     1\n     Irrespective of damages, plaintiffs have obtained from the\ndistrict court an injunction permanently banning Sanchez from\ndisrupting the operation of the three facilities that perform\nabortions which have prosecuted this lawsuit.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fplaintiffs damages and fees and remand to the district court\n\nwith instructions that it either award plaintiffs damages and\n\nfees or explain why, despite the authority we have cited, an\n\naward of damages and/or fees is not warranted.\n\n         Vacated and remanded.
