Jirard, Assistant Federal Defender,\r\nwas on brief for appellant.\r\n    Diana K. Lloyd, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nDecember 14, 1999\r\n\n BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This is an appeal by Charles Lee\r\nfrom his sentence imposed after he pled guilty to being a felon in\r\npossession of a firearm and ammunition.  18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1)\r\n(1994).  It presents a narrow, but difficult, issue under the\r\nSentencing Guidelines as to the meaning of the term \"assault\" in a\r\nspecific context.  The facts are taken from the undisputed portions\r\nof the presentence report, the testimony at the sentencing hearing,\r\nand the district court's findings.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nVoccola, 99 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n On April 26, 1998, Sergeant Bulman of the Boston Police \r\nDepartment assisted in a traffic stop of a car in which Lee was a\r\npassenger.  Approaching the car, Bulman saw that Lee had a large\r\nbulge in his shirt above his waist; thinking that Lee might be\r\narmed, Bulman ordered Lee out of the car.  Lee exited but then\r\nsought to escape, striking both Bulman and another officer in the\r\nchest as he attempted to get past them.  Lee thrashed about as\r\nthree or four officers fought to subdue him and repeatedly reached\r\nfor his waist area; the officers screamed to each other that Lee\r\nwas reaching for his waist and they sought to grab his hands. \r\nAfter a minute or two, the officers handcuffed Lee and found a\r\nloaded gun in his front waistband.\r\n After his indictment and plea of guilty to being a felon\r\nin possession, Lee was sentenced on January 11, 1999.  At\r\nsentencing, the government sought a three-level upward adjustment\r\nfor Lee under U.S.S.G.  3A1.2(b).  That subsection, designed to\r\nprotect an \"Official Victim,\" provides for such an increase where\r\n   during the course of the offense or immediate\r\n flight therefrom, the defendant . . . knowing \r\n . . . that a person was a law enforcement . .\r\n . officer, assaulted such officer in a manner\r\n creating a substantial risk of serious bodily\r\n injury.\r\n\nThe district court found that the \"pushing and shoving\" did not\r\ncreate a risk of serious bodily injury to a trained police officer\r\nbut that Lee's efforts to reach for his gun did create apprehension\r\nand a substantial risk of such an injury.\r\n Accordingly, the court made the three level adjustment,\r\nleading to a guideline range of 51 to 63 months.  However, because\r\nLee was already subject to a related state sentence, the court\r\nimposed a consecutive sentence of only 42 months.  U.S.S.G. \r\n5G1.3.  Lee now appeals from his sentence, challenging only the\r\nthree level adjustment.  Since the government does not suggest\r\notherwise, we assume for present purposes that Lee's sentence might\r\nhave been lower if the three-level adjustment had not been made.\r\n The district court's factual findings, so far as they go,\r\ncannot be impeached under the clearly erroneous standard that\r\napplies to them.  United States v. Freeman, 176 F.3d 575, 578 (1st\r\nCir. 1999).  It is evident that Lee was reaching for his gun; apart\r\nfrom what the officers saw him doing, he himself told one of the\r\nofficers later that he had been trying to get his gun in order to\r\nthrow it away.  The officers' apprehension was obvious from their\r\nshouts and from testimony by Bulman.  And whatever Lee's purpose,\r\nhis efforts to seize his gun did create a substantial risk of\r\nbodily injury, whether from accidental discharge or the threat of\r\nfire from the police.  See United States v. Weaver, 8 F.3d 1240,\r\n1245-46 (7th Cir. 1993).\r\n There is thus no doubt that Lee's conduct satisfied most\r\nof the requirements of the guideline, including \"immediate flight,\"\r\nknowledge that the officers were police, and the creation of \"a\r\nsubstantial risk of serious bodily injury.\"  But the district court\r\nmade no finding that Lee had a purpose to shoot at the officers\r\n(his own hearsay statement was to the contrary) or to frighten them\r\n(there is no evidence on the point).  The question, then, is\r\nwhether the \"assault\" requirement of the adjustment is satisfied in\r\nthis case, the principal doubt revolving around the scienter\r\nrequirement for assault. \r\n The district court believed that the term \"assault\" in\r\nthe guideline should be read as a reference to common law criminal\r\nassault.  While the drafters may not have had this precise question\r\nin mind, we think that generally speaking this is the right\r\nconstruction; \"assault\"  is a standard common law concept and no\r\nother definition has been adopted by the guideline or commentary,\r\neither explicitly or by cross-reference.  Two possibilities should\r\nnevertheless be mentioned.\r\n First, there is a federal statute that includes as a\r\nfederal crime \"assault\" on a federal officer.  But the statute more\r\nbroadly encompasses the actions of anyone who \"forcibly assaults,\r\nresists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with\"\r\nspecified federal officers.  18 U.S.C.  111(a)(1) (1994).  And the\r\nstatute itself does not define the term \"assault,\" nor is it clear\r\nthat the case law interpreting the statute construes the term in\r\nany way that would assist us in resolving the matter before us.\r\n Second, a somewhat stronger case could be made for\r\nlooking instead to U.S.S.G.  2A2.2, which defines in some detail\r\nthe concept of aggravated assault for purposes of prescribing the\r\noffense level for the most serious of the various assaults covered\r\nby federal statutes.  The argument for looking to this definition\r\nis that U.S.S.G.  3A1.2(b), with which we are primarily concerned,\r\nsays in the commentary that the guideline applies \"in circumstances\r\ntantamount to aggravated assault.\"  U.S.S.G.  3A1.2, comment.\r\n(n.5).  But it turns out that the aggravated assault concept is\r\nslightly different and would not in any event resolve the problem\r\nbefore us.\r\n Aggravated assault is defined as a \"felonious assault\"\r\nthat involves either (a) use of a dangerous weapon with intent to\r\ndo bodily harm, or (b) serious bodily injury, or (c) an intent to\r\ncommit another felony.  U.S.S.G.  2A2.2, comment. (n.1).  Lee\r\nurges the use of this definition in interpreting the guideline at\r\nissue here because he falls outside of the first two categories,\r\nforgetting that he may qualify under the third.  Even so, the\r\nquestion remains whether his conduct was \"felonious assault\" at\r\nall, and on this issue--here, primarily turning on the scienter\r\nrequired for assault--the aggravated assault guideline and its\r\ncommentary provide no answer.\r\n That guideline is probably of most help in illuminating\r\nthe separate requirement in  3A1.2(b) that the assault create \"a\r\nsubstantial risk of serious bodily injury\"; conduct of the (a) and\r\n(b) types would usually satisfy the risk-of-harm requirement\r\n(although the (c) category conduct does not correspond to anything\r\nin our own guideline).  That may be all the commentary means in\r\nsaying that the conduct triggering the three level adjustment is\r\n\"tantamount\" to aggravated assault.  In all events, \"tantamount\"\r\ndoes not mean \"identical\"; and in this case Lee's conduct clearly\r\npresents the necessary risk of harm.\r\n This brings us back to the question whether Lee's conduct \r\ndid constitute \"assault\" as measured by common law standards. \r\nSurprisingly, the answer is far from clear.  Common law assault\r\nembraces two different crimes: one is attempted battery, that is,\r\nan intended effort to cause bodily harm to another which falls\r\nshort of success (an example would be striking at a police officer\r\nbut missing), regardless of whether the intended victim knows of\r\nthe attempt.  2 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law  7.16(a),\r\nat 313-14 (1986).  Here, the district court made no finding that\r\nLee intended to shoot the police officers; and it is not clear that\r\nthe evidence would readily lend itself to such a finding unless the\r\njudge discredited Lee's own statement as to his intent.\r\n The other branch of assault is an act which is intended\r\nto, and reasonably does, cause the victim to fear immediate bodily\r\nharm; such \"menacing\" constitutes assault even if no physical harm\r\nis attempted, achieved, or intended.  2 LaFave &amp; Scott, supra, \r\n7.16(b), at 315-17.  An example would be a bank robber pointing a\r\ngun at a teller.  Here, Bulman testified that Lee's efforts to free\r\nhis gun did cause Bulman fear--quite reasonably so, in our view--\r\nand the district judge so found.  Less certain is what is required\r\nas to Lee's \"intent\" to cause fear--and how the facts and evidence\r\nas to his intent stack up against that requirement.\r\n Unfortunately, the scienter requirement for common law\r\nassault is blurred by confusion and contradiction.  For both\r\nbranches of assault (and the authorities often do not distinguish),\r\nthe most common formulation--that \"intent\" is required--relies on\r\na term notoriously unclear in distinguishing between \"purpose\" to\r\ncause a result and mere \"knowledge\" of ordinary consequences.  See\r\nModel Penal Code  2.02(2) &amp; comment 2, at 233-36 (1985).  These\r\ntwo notions correspond, at least roughly, to what common law judges\r\ncalled specific and general intent, see United States v. Bailey,\r\n444 U.S. 394, 405 (1980), and some of the cases and commentaries on\r\nassault use these terms (or more modern counterparts).  But the\r\ncases and commentaries conflict as to which is required for\r\nassault.\r\n  This is not altogether surprising.  In the kind of\r\nassault by menace case likely to be prosecuted, the defendant\r\nusually (1) does have a purpose to cause fear or (2) is so aware\r\nthat his actions will cause fear--and is otherwise so blameworthy-\r\n-that no one much troubles about his lack of purpose.  The perfect\r\nexample of this blurring of specific and general intent is the\r\ncriminal who flees in a car and drives straight at a police\r\nofficer standing in his way; it is normally hard to tell whether\r\nthe criminal had a purpose to scare the officer or merely an\r\nindifferent awareness of the threat, incidental to an overriding\r\naim to escape.\r\n  What is telling is that in several such cases (obviously\r\nthe facts vary from cases to case) courts have imposed the three-\r\nlevel assault adjustment we are considering, while in several\r\nothers the courts have applied only a two-level adjustment for\r\nreckless endangerment during flight, U.S.S.G.  3C1.2; often this\r\nchoice has been made without much attention to the common law\r\ntechnicalities of assault or even an awareness of the issue. \r\nThus, while we still think that the common law definition of\r\nassault should generally govern the guideline whenever it supplies\r\nan answer, that definition does not clearly resolve the question\r\nwhat degree of scienter is required here:  awareness of\r\nconsequences or something more purposeful.\r\n  In the end, we think that the policy of this guideline--\r\nto protect official victims--embraces the case where an escaping\r\ncriminal drives straight at a police officer, knowing him to be\r\nthere, regardless of whether the criminal desires to hit him; so\r\nlong as the criminal has ample reason to know that fear will be\r\ncaused, the lack of purpose to cause fear should not matter.  At\r\nleast one case in this circuit may implicitly take this view, see\r\nGarcia, 34 F.3d at 12-13; others are consistent; and at least some\r\njudges who applied the reckless endangerment adjustment were\r\napparently not asked to consider the assault adjustment.  See note\r\n3 above. \r\n  Even if mere knowledge of consequences is enough, and we\r\nhold that it is for this guideline adjustment, this does not quite\r\nresolve our case.  One might argue that Lee's effort to draw his\r\ngun while struggling with the police does not entail, or at least\r\nnecessarily entail, his awareness that his conduct was practically\r\ncertain to alarm the officers.  But here Lee knew that the police\r\nwere shouting about his efforts to reach his gun and trying to\r\nstop him.  While awareness is perhaps a matter of degree, this\r\n\"feedback\" from the \"official victims\" during the assault itself\r\ntakes the case pretty far up the scale and justifies the\r\nadjustment.\r\n  Two further comments are in order.  The first is that the\r\nline between assault under this guideline and reckless\r\nendangerment under section 3C1.2 is often going to be a matter of\r\ndegree.  Provided that there is no clear error of law,  we are\r\nvery likely to sustain the choice of the district judge, who has\r\nthe best feel for the factual subtleties involved.  The choice is\r\nnot all that different from distinguishing between a minor and a\r\nminimal participant.  U.S.S.G.  3B1.2; United States v. Gonzalez-\r\nSoberal, 109 F.3d 64, 73 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n  The other, implicit in what has already been said, is\r\nthat at best Lee could have gotten no more than a one level\r\ndownward adjustment out of this appeal; if the assault adjustment\r\ndid not apply in this case, the reckless endangerment guideline\r\ncertainly would.  This would have reduced his guideline range from\r\n51-63 months to 46-57 months; as noted, his federal sentence was\r\nin fact 42 months.  In other words, it is at least possible that\r\nvictory in this very well argued appeal would not have made any\r\ndifference to Lee's sentence.\r\n  Affirmed.\n",

It presents a narrow, but difficult, issue under the Sentencing Guidelines as to the meaning of the term \"assault\" in a specific context. The facts are taken from the undisputed portions of the presentence report, the testimony at the sentencing hearing, and the district court's findings. See, e.g., United States v. Voccola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197057\"><a href=\"/opinion/197057/united-states-v-voccola/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 1998, Sergeant Bulman of the Boston Police Department assisted in a traffic stop of a car in which Lee was a passenger. Approaching the car, Bulman saw that Lee had a large bulge in his shirt above his waist; thinking that Lee might be armed, Bulman ordered Lee out of the car. Lee exited but then sought to escape, striking both Bulman and another officer in the chest as he attempted to get past them. Lee thrashed about as three or four officers fought to subdue him and repeatedly reached for his waist area; the officers screamed to each other that Lee was reaching for his waist and they sought to grab his hands. After a minute or two, the officers handcuffed Lee and found a loaded gun in his front waistband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his indictment and plea of guilty to being a felon in possession, Lee was sentenced on January 11, 1999. At sentencing, the government sought a three-level upward adjustment for Lee under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2(b). That subsection, designed to protect an \"Official Victim,\" provides for such an increase where</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant . . . knowing . . . that a person was a law enforcement . . . officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the \"pushing and shoving\" did not create a risk of serious bodily injury to a trained police officer but that Lee's efforts to reach for his gun did create apprehension and a substantial risk of such an injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court made the three level adjustment, leading to a guideline range of 51 to 63 months. However, because Lee was already subject to a related state sentence, the court imposed a consecutive sentence of only 42 months. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3. Lee now appeals from his sentence, challenging only the three level adjustment. Since the government does not suggest otherwise, we assume for present purposes that Lee's sentence might have been lower if the three-level adjustment had not been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's factual findings, so far as they go, cannot be impeached under the clearly erroneous standard that applies to them. United States v. Freeman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198465\"><a href=\"/opinion/198465/united-states-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 578 (1st Cir. 1999). It is evident that Lee was reaching for his gun; apart from what the officers saw him doing, he himself told one of the officers later that he had been trying to get his gun in order to throw it away. The officers' apprehension was obvious from their shouts and from testimony by Bulman. And whatever Lee's purpose, his efforts to seize his gun did create a substantial risk of bodily injury, whether from accidental discharge or the threat of fire from the police. See United States v. Weaver, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656602\"><a href=\"/opinion/656602/united-states-v-ronald-n-weaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></a></span>, 1245-46 (7th Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is thus no doubt that Lee's conduct satisfied most of the requirements of the guideline, including \"immediate flight,\" knowledge that the officers were police, and the creation of \"a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.\" But the district court made no finding that Lee had a purpose to shoot at the officers (his own hearsay statement was to the contrary) or to frighten them (there is no evidence on the point). The question, then, is whether the \"assault\" requirement of the adjustment is satisfied in this case, the principal doubt revolving around the scienter requirement for assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court believed that the term \"assault\" in the guideline should be read as a reference to common law criminal assault. While the drafters may not have had this precise question in mind, we think that generally speaking this is the right construction; \"assault\" is a standard common law concept and no other definition has been adopted by the guideline or commentary, either explicitly or by cross-reference. Two possibilities should nevertheless be mentioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there is a federal statute that includes as a federal crime \"assault\" on a federal officer. But the statute more broadly encompasses the actions of anyone who \"forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with\" specified federal officers. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 111(a)(1) (1994). And the statute itself does not define the term \"assault,\" nor is it clear that the case law interpreting the statute construes the term in any way that would assist us in resolving the matter before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a somewhat stronger case could be made for looking instead to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, which defines in some detail the concept of aggravated assault for purposes of prescribing the offense level for the most serious of the various assaults covered by federal statutes. The argument for looking to this definition is that U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2(b), with which we are primarily concerned, says in the commentary that the guideline applies \"in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2, comment. (n.5). But it turns out that the aggravated assault concept is slightly different and would not in any event resolve the problem before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aggravated assault is defined as a \"felonious assault\" that involves either (a) use of a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm, or (b) serious bodily injury, or (c) an intent to commit another felony. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, comment. (n.1). Lee urges the use of this definition in interpreting the guideline at issue here because he falls outside of the first two categories, forgetting that he may qualify under the third.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Even so, the question remains whether his conduct was \"felonious assault\" at all, and on this issue--here, primarily turning on the scienter required for assault--the aggravated assault guideline and its commentary provide no answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That guideline is probably of most help in illuminating the separate requirement in &#167; 3A1.2(b) that the assault create \"a substantial risk of serious bodily injury\"; conduct of the (a) and (b) types would usually satisfy the risk-of-harm requirement (although the (c) category conduct does not correspond to anything in our own guideline). That may be all the commentary means in saying that the conduct triggering the three level adjustment is \"tantamount\" to aggravated assault. In all events, \"tantamount\" does not mean \"identical\"; and in this case Lee's conduct clearly presents the necessary risk of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us back to the question whether Lee's conduct did constitute \"assault\" as measured by common law standards. Surprisingly, the answer is far from clear. Common law assault embraces two different crimes: one is attempted battery, that is, an intended effort to cause bodily harm to another which falls short of success (an example would be striking at a police officer but missing), regardless of whether the intended victim knows of the attempt. 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 7.16(a), at 313-14 (1986). Here, the district court made no finding that Lee intended to shoot the police officers; and it is not clear that the evidence would readily lend itself to such a finding unless the judge discredited Lee's own statement as to his intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other branch of assault is an act which is intended to, and reasonably does, cause the victim to fear immediate bodily harm; such \"menacing\" constitutes assault even if no physical harm is attempted, achieved, or intended. 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, supra, &#167; 7.16(b), at 315-17. An example would be a bank robber pointing a gun at a teller. Here, Bulman testified that Lee's efforts to free his gun did cause Bulman fear--quite reasonably so, in our view--and the district judge so found. Less certain is what is required as to Lee's \"intent\" to cause fear--and how the facts and evidence as to his intent stack up against that requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the scienter requirement for common law assault is blurred by confusion and contradiction. For both branches of assault (and the authorities often do not distinguish), the most common formulation--that \"intent\" is required--relies on a term notoriously unclear in distinguishing between \"purpose\" to cause a result and mere \"knowledge\" of ordinary consequences. See Model Penal Code &#167; 2.02(2) &amp; comment 2, at 233-36 (1985). These two notions correspond, at least roughly, to what common law judges called specific and general intent, see United States v. Bailey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110175\"><a href=\"/opinion/110175/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span>, 405 (1980), and some of the cases and commentaries on assault use these terms (or more modern counterparts).
