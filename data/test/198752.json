Plaintiff-appellant New\r\nEngland Cleaning Services, Inc. (\"NECS\") appeals from the district\r\ncourt's dismissal of its complaint for an injunction and damages\r\nagainst defendant-appellee American Arbitration Association (\"the\r\nAAA\").  NECS brought its complaint against the AAA as part of its\r\naction for declaratory relief against Local 254, Service Employees\r\nInternational Union, AFL-CIO (\"SEIU\" or \"the union\"), seeking to\r\nforestall the latter from proceeding to arbitrate a labor dispute\r\nwith NECS.  NECS contends that the AAA, by processing the SEIU's\r\ndemand for arbitration despite NECS's protestations that there was\r\nthen in force no valid agreement to arbitrate (a position\r\nsubsequently upheld by the district court), violated various\r\nprovisions of Massachusetts law.  The district court allowed the\r\nAAA's motion to dismiss NECS's complaint on the ground that the\r\nAAA's actions were protected by arbitral immunity.  We affirm.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nWe take the following facts from NECS's complaint and\r\nattached documents.  See LaChappelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,\r\n142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nNECS is a maintenance and service provider.  On March 14,\r\n1994, it entered into a collective bargaining agreement (\"the\r\nAgreement\") with the SEIU.  The Agreement contained a section\r\ntitled \"Grievances,\" which described a four-step procedure\r\ngoverning \"[a]ll disputes arising out of this Agreement or its\r\napplication to any situation that may arise during the term of this\r\nAgreement.\"  The final step of the grievance procedure provided for\r\nbinding arbitration under the rules of the AAA, a not-for-profit\r\norganization that provides voluntary dispute resolution services.\r\nBy its terms, the Agreement was effective until August\r\n31, 1996, and would continue in effect thereafter until terminated\r\nby either party.  A party could terminate the Agreement if it did\r\nso in writing more than 60 days before the stated expiration date. \r\nOn or about September 6, 1994, NECS sent the SEIU a letter stating\r\nthat it was terminating the Agreement.\r\nBeginning in early June, 1998, the SEIU filed several\r\ngrievances with NECS.  NECS denied the grievances as untimely,\r\narguing that it had effectively terminated the Agreement in 1994. \r\nOn August 3, 1998, the SEIU filed a demand for arbitration with the\r\nAAA, claiming that NECS had \"improperly\" terminated the Agreement. \r\nOn August 7, having received notice of this demand from the AAA,\r\nNECS wrote a letter to the AAA stating that no collective\r\nbargaining agreement between NECS and the SEIU existed, and that\r\ntherefore the AAA lacked jurisdiction or authority over NECS.  NECS\r\nattached to this letter copies of the Agreement and its termination\r\nletter of September 6, 1994.\r\nThe AAA continued to process the SEIU's demand, however,\r\nand sent NECS an invoice for services rendered in connection\r\ntherewith.  Despite NECS's written warning that it planned to file\r\na complaint in the federal district court, the AAA continued to\r\nproceed toward arbitration, and scheduled a hearing on the SEIU's\r\ndemand.\r\nOn September 17, 1998, NECS filed a complaint in the\r\ndistrict court against the SEIU and the AAA.  Against the SEIU, it\r\nsought a declaration pursuant to section 301 of the Taft-Hartley\r\nAct, 29 U.S.C.  185, that there was no collective bargaining\r\nagreement in force between NECS and the SEIU and that NECS was not\r\nobligated to submit to arbitration.  Against the AAA, NECS sought\r\nan injunction preventing further processing of the demand for\r\narbitration as well as damages under  M.G.L. c. 93A and c. 12,  11\r\nfor compelling NECS to arbitrate. \r\nFollowing an expedited evidentiary hearing, the district\r\ncourt held that NECS had properly terminated the Agreement, that\r\nthere was no collective bargaining agreement presently in effect\r\nbetween it and the SEIU, and that the issue of the existence of the\r\nAgreement was not arbitrable.  In a companion memorandum and order,\r\nthe court dismissed NECS's complaint against the AAA on the ground\r\nthat its decision to process SEIU's demand for arbitration was\r\nprotected by arbitral immunity.  NECS appeals from the latter\r\nruling.  \r\n                          DISCUSSION\r\nThe court of appeals applies a de novo standard of review\r\nto a district court's allowance of a motion to dismiss for failure\r\nto state a claim.  LaChappelle, 142 F.3d at 509.  Here, NECS\r\nmaintains that the district court erred in applying the standard\r\nprescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and in holding that the\r\nAAA's decision to process the demand for arbitration was protected\r\nby arbitral immunity.      Specifically, NECS argues that the trial\r\ncourt was obligated to take as true the facts pled in the\r\ncomplaint, which included the allegation that there was no\r\nagreement to arbitrate in effect at the relevant time.  Without\r\nsuch an agreement, it contends, the AAA had no jurisdiction to\r\nprocess the demand for arbitration.  And without jurisdiction, the\r\nAAA did not possess arbitral immunity.\r\nThe AAA argues that arbitral immunity protects its\r\nprocessing of a facially valid demand for arbitration pursuant to\r\na collective bargaining agreement that names it as the arbitral\r\nagency.  It maintains that the SEIU's demand for arbitration met\r\nthis standard, in that it (1) stated that NECS had \"improperly\r\nterminated\" the Agreement and \"failed to meet with the union\" in\r\naccordance with the prescribed grievance procedure, and (2)\r\nattached a copy of the Agreement, which explicitly provided for\r\nbinding arbitration under the rules of the AAA.  The AAA contends\r\nthat it followed its own internal rules and procedures in billing\r\nthe parties, notifying NECS of the demand, selecting an arbitrator,\r\nand scheduling a hearing date.  Moreover, it argues that the system\r\nfunctioned appropriately in this case: upon NECS's complaint, the\r\ndistrict court resolved the issue of the AAA's jurisdiction, and\r\nthe AAA heeded the ensuing court order and stayed the arbitration\r\nproceedings.\r\nSettled case law as well as federal policy encouraging\r\nlabor arbitration favors the AAA's position.  First, we reject\r\nNECS's assertion that the district court erroneously failed to\r\ncomply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) when it did not take as true\r\nall of NECS's allegations regarding the Agreement.  NECS cannot\r\npreclude dismissal of its complaint under that rule simply by\r\nalleging that it had terminated the Agreement and had no collective\r\nbargaining agreement with the SEIU in effect at the time of the\r\ngrievances.  Such allegations are not assertions of fact, but\r\nrather involve legal issues and conclusions--indeed, the ultimate\r\ndisputed issues presented in NECS's action against the SEIU.  The\r\ncourt is not required to accept legal conclusions as true when\r\nconsidering a motion to dismiss.  See Abbott v. U.S., 144 F.3d 1,\r\n2 (1st Cir.  1998); 2A Moore's Federal Practice,  12.34[1][b]. \r\nSecond, the district court correctly concluded that the\r\nAAA's decision to process the demand was protected by arbitral\r\nimmunity.  \"Because an arbitrator's role is functionally equivalent\r\nto a judge's role, courts of appeals have uniformly extended\r\njudicial and quasi-judicial immunity to arbitrators.\"  Olson v.\r\nNational Ass'n of Securities Dealers, 85 F.3d 381, 382-83 (8th Cir.\r\n1996).  As with judicial and quasi-judicial immunity, arbitral\r\nimmunity is essential to protect decision-makers from undue\r\ninfluence and protect the decision-making process from reprisals by\r\ndissatisfied litigants.  See id.  In proper circumstances,\r\norganizations that sponsor arbitrations, as well as arbitrators\r\nthemselves, enjoy this immunity from civil liability.  See Honn v.\r\nNational Ass'n of Securities Dealers, Inc., 182 F.3d 1014, 1017\r\n(8th Cir. 1999); Hawkins v. National Ass'n of Securities Dealers\r\nInc., 149 F.3d 330, 332 (5th Cir. 1998); Corey v. New York Stock\r\nExchange, 691 F.2d 1205, 1208-11 (6th Cir. 1982).   \r\nA sponsoring organization's immunity extends to the \r\nadministrative tasks it performs, insofar as these are integrally\r\nrelated to the arbitration.  See Austern v. Chicago Bd. Options\r\nExchange, Inc., 898 F.2d 882, 886 (2d Cir. 1990) (defective notice\r\nand improper selection of arbitration panel were sufficiently\r\nassociated with adjudicative phase of arbitration to justify\r\nimmunity).  See also Olson, 85 F.3d at 383 (immunity protects \"all\r\nacts within the scope of the arbitral process,\" even if arbitrator\r\nfails to follow its own internal rules).  Here, the AAA's\r\nadministrative acts of which NECS complains -including selecting an\r\narbitrator, billing NECS for its services, and scheduling a\r\nhearing -were sufficiently related to the arbitration to be\r\nprotected by immunity. \r\nNECS points out that the district court determined that\r\nthe AAA lacked jurisdiction or authority to adjudicate the dispute,\r\nand contends that therefore the AAA was not protected by arbitral\r\nimmunity.  Judicial immunity applies, however, unless there is a\r\n\"clear absence\" of jurisdiction.  See Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S.\r\n349, 356-57 (1978); Cok v. Cosentino, 876 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989). \r\nWe see no reason not to adopt the same parameter for arbitral\r\nimmunity.  See Tamari v. Conrad, 552 F.2d 778, 780-81 (7th Cir.\r\n1977) (\"arbitral immunity should be extended to cases where the\r\nauthority of an arbitrator to resolve a dispute is challenged\");\r\nDurden v. Lockheed-Georgia Co., 1985 WL 56794 (N.D. Ga., June 18,\r\n1985); Raitport v. Provident Nat. Bank, 451 F. Supp. 522, 527 (E.D.\r\nPa. 1978); Dennis R. Nolan &amp; Roger I. Abrams, Arbitral Immunity, 11\r\nIndus. Rel. L. J. 228, 239-40 (1989).  The demand presented by the\r\nSEIU stated that the Agreement had been wrongfully terminated and\r\nattached the Agreement referencing the AAA as arbitrator.  These\r\npapers were not so deficient on their face as to signal a \"clear\r\nabsence\" of jurisdiction.  That NECS ultimately secured a\r\ndeclaration that the Agreement had been effectively terminated does\r\nnot mean that the SEIU's demand was not facially valid so that\r\njurisdiction was clearly lacking.\r\nAdopting NECS's position would require arbitral\r\norganizations, not courts or arbitrators, to themselves resolve\r\nwhat might well turn out to be significant threshold legal issues\r\nlong before any hearing.  In this case, the AAA would have had to\r\ndecide not merely whether there was a facially valid demand, but\r\nthe legal effect of the demand and whether an arbitrator in fact\r\nhad jurisdiction to determine whether NECS's termination of the\r\nAgreement was effective.  To make such a judgment, the AAA would\r\nhave had to examine the breadth of the arbitration clause in the\r\nAgreement and the effectiveness of NECS's termination.  NECS\r\nimplies that the answers to these questions were so obvious as to\r\nenable the AAA to dispose of them routinely, saving NECS the time\r\nand trouble of litigating arbitrability in court.  Yet it took a\r\nnine-page memorandum and order by the district court and a full\r\nopinion of this court to deal with the legal issues involved.  We\r\nthink it abundantly clear that the resolution of the arbitrability\r\nissue was not facially obvious.  Forcing the AAA itself to\r\npreliminarily address potentially complex legal issues would not\r\nonly impose an unwelcome burden, but would interfere with the\r\norganization's neutrality and likely add further cost and delay to\r\nthe arbitral process.  See Ozark Air Lines, Inc. v. National\r\nMediation Bd., 797 F.2d 557, 564 (8th Cir. 1986).  The course\r\nfollowed by the AAA forced the arbitrability issue to be decided\r\neither by an arbitrator or, at NECS's instance, the court--the two\r\ntribunals logically equipped to handle the issue.\r\nNot least, failure to extend immunity to the AAA in these\r\ncircumstances could discourage it from sponsoring future\r\narbitrations.  See Austern, 898 F.2d at 886-87; Tamari, 552 F.2d at\r\n781.  Reluctance by the AAA or similar organizations to arrange\r\narbitrations would impede the implementation of federal policy\r\nfavoring arbitration of labor disputes.  See 9 U.S.C.  2, 3, 4;\r\nMoses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1,\r\n24 (1983) (\"Section 2 [of the Federal Arbitration Act] is a\r\ncongressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring\r\narbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or\r\nprocedural policies to the contrary.\").  Accordingly, we agree with\r\nthe district court that the AAA is protected by arbitral immunity\r\nfrom liability for its actions in this matter. \r\nBecause we decide on the basis of immunity, there is no\r\nneed to discuss the merits of NECS's claims under M.G.L. c. 93A and\r\nc. 12,  11. \r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

(\"NECS\") appeals from the district court's dismissal of its complaint for an injunction and damages against defendant-appellee American Arbitration Association (\"the AAA\"). NECS brought its complaint against the AAA as part of its action for declaratory relief against Local 254, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO (\"SEIU\" or \"the union\"), seeking to forestall the latter from proceeding to arbitrate a labor dispute with NECS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> NECS contends that the AAA, by processing the SEIU's demand for arbitration despite NECS's protestations that there was then in force no valid agreement to arbitrate (a position subsequently upheld by the district court), violated various provisions of Massachusetts law.

See LaChappelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197923\"><a href=\"/opinion/197923/lachapelle-v-berkshire-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 509 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NECS is a maintenance and service provider. On March 14, 1994, it entered into a collective bargaining agreement (\"the Agreement\") with the SEIU. The Agreement contained a section titled \"Grievances,\" which described a four-step procedure governing \"[a]ll disputes arising out of this Agreement or its application to any situation that may arise during the term of this Agreement.\" The final step of the grievance procedure provided for binding arbitration under the rules of the AAA, a not-for-profit organization that provides voluntary dispute resolution services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the Agreement was effective until August 31, 1996, and would continue in effect thereafter until terminated by either party. A party could terminate the Agreement if it did so in writing more than 60 days before the stated expiration date. On or about September 6, 1994, NECS sent the SEIU a letter stating that it was terminating the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in early June, 1998, the SEIU filed several grievances with NECS. NECS denied the grievances as untimely, arguing that it had effectively terminated the Agreement in 1994. On August 3, 1998, the SEIU filed a demand for arbitration with the AAA, claiming that NECS had \"improperly\" terminated the Agreement. On August 7, having received notice of this demand from the AAA, NECS wrote a letter to the AAA stating that no collective bargaining agreement between NECS and the SEIU existed, and that therefore the AAA lacked jurisdiction or authority over NECS. NECS attached to this letter copies of the Agreement and its termination letter of September 6, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AAA continued to process the SEIU's demand, however, and sent NECS an invoice for services rendered in connection therewith. Despite NECS's written warning that it planned to file a complaint in the federal district court, the AAA continued to proceed toward arbitration, and scheduled a hearing on the SEIU's demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 1998, NECS filed a complaint in the district court against the SEIU and the AAA. Against the SEIU, it sought a declaration pursuant to section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185, that there was no collective bargaining agreement in force between NECS and the SEIU and that NECS was not obligated to submit to arbitration. Against the AAA, NECS sought an injunction preventing further processing of the demand for arbitration as well as damages under M.G.L. c. 93A and c. 12, &#167; 11 for compelling NECS to arbitrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an expedited evidentiary hearing, the district court held that NECS had properly terminated the Agreement, that there was no collective bargaining agreement presently in effect between it and the SEIU, and that the issue of the existence of the Agreement was not arbitrable. In a companion memorandum and order, the court dismissed NECS's complaint against the AAA on the ground that its decision to process SEIU's demand for arbitration was protected by arbitral immunity. NECS appeals from the latter ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court of appeals applies a de novo standard of review to a district court's allowance of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197923\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">LaChappelle,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197923/lachapelle-v-berkshire-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>. Here, NECS maintains that the district court erred in applying the standard prescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and in holding that the AAA's decision to process the demand for arbitration was protected by arbitral immunity. Specifically, NECS argues that the trial court was obligated to take as true the facts pled in the complaint, which included the allegation that there was no agreement to arbitrate in effect at the relevant time. Without such an agreement, it contends, the AAA had no jurisdiction to process the demand for arbitration. And without jurisdiction, the AAA did not possess arbitral immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AAA argues that arbitral immunity protects its processing of a facially valid demand for arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that names it as the arbitral agency. It maintains that the SEIU's demand for arbitration met this standard, in that it (1) stated that NECS had \"improperly terminated\" the Agreement and \"failed to meet with the union\" in accordance with the prescribed grievance procedure, and (2) attached a copy of the Agreement, which explicitly provided for binding arbitration under the rules of the AAA. The AAA contends that it followed its own internal rules and procedures in billing the parties, notifying NECS of the demand, selecting an arbitrator, and scheduling a hearing date. Moreover, it argues that the system functioned appropriately in this case: upon NECS's complaint, the district court resolved the issue of the AAA's jurisdiction, and the AAA heeded the ensuing court order and stayed the arbitration proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settled case law as well as federal policy encouraging labor arbitration favors the AAA's position. First, we reject NECS's assertion that the district court erroneously failed to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) when it did not take as true all of NECS's allegations regarding the Agreement. NECS cannot preclude dismissal of its complaint under that rule simply by alleging that it had terminated the Agreement and had no collective bargaining agreement with the SEIU in effect at the time of the grievances. Such allegations are not assertions of fact, but rather involve legal issues and conclusions--indeed, the ultimate disputed issues presented in NECS's action against the SEIU. The court is not required to accept legal conclusions as true when considering a motion to dismiss. See Abbott v. U.S., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197921\"><a href=\"/opinion/197921/abbott-v-usa-local-4/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 1998); 2A Moore's Federal Practice, &#167; 12.34[1][b].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court correctly concluded that the AAA's decision to process the demand was protected by arbitral immunity. \"Because an arbitrator's role is functionally equivalent to a judge's role, courts of appeals have uniformly extended judicial and quasi-judicial immunity to arbitrators.\" Olson v. National Ass'n of Securities Dealers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718799\"><a href=\"/opinion/718799/ernest-d-olson-bud-v-national-association-of-securities-dealers-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 382-83 (8th Cir. 1996).

NECS prevailed in the district court on its contention, inter alia, that the collective bargaining agreement formerly existing between the parties had been effectively terminated prior to the union's demand for arbitration, vitiating the arbitration clause. The SEIU's appeal from the district court's determination that NECS had terminated the agreement was argued to us on the same day as the instant appeal, and is the subject of a separate opinion issued today.

For example, while the court must accept NECS's allegation that it sent a letter stating that the Agreement was thereby terminated, it was not bound under these facts by its statements as to the legal effectiveness of the termination.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  In its brief, the AAA points out: \"It would be no more appropriate for AAA, as a neutral administrative body, to make a determination of arbitrability than it would be for a court clerk's office to dismiss an action on jurisdictional grounds at the request of one of the parties, or without order of court.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
