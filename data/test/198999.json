Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Edgardo Rodriguez-Quilichini, Assistant Federal Public\nDefender, with whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public\nDefender, was on brief for appellant.\n     Camille Vélez-Rivé, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\fJuly 13, 2000\n\f            CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.             Like many before it, this\n\nappeal involves various violations of Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure     11(c)    &    (d). 1     Nevertheless,        appellant    has   not\n\ndemonstrated a total failure to comply with a “core” Rule 11\n\nconcern   and,      after    assessing       the   errors    committed    by   the\n\ndistrict court, we are satisfied that they are harmless or, in\n\none instance, conspicuously waived on this appeal.                  See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991);\n\nsee also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).\n\n            Appellant was charged by information, in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, with\n\nviolating     21    U.S.C.     §     841(a)(1)     by   knowingly   possessing\n\napproximately 1,692.8 grams of cocaine base, with intent to\n\ndistribute.        After pleading guilty pursuant to a written plea\n\nagreement, he was sentenced, inter alia, to a 188-month prison\n\nterm, the minimum prescribed under the applicable sentencing\n\nguidelines.\n\n            Appellant first contends that he did not know that the\n\nscheduled airline flight from Colombia to Spain, where he was to\n\n\n    1See, e.g., United States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7 (1st Cir.\n1997); United States v. Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d 693, 696 (1st Cir.\n1995); United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1995);\nUnited States v. Medina-Silverio, 30 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994);\nUnited States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                         3\n\fhave delivered the cocaine, would land in Puerto Rico en route.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1) (mandating that district court\n\ninform defendant of “the nature of the charge to which the\n\n[guilty] plea is offered”).                    Although the Rule 11 colloquy\n\nconducted       below      in    no    sense      foreclosed      it,     the   present\n\ncontention          inevitably        fails       since    it    misapprehends      the\n\ncontrolling law.           See, e.g., United States v. McKenzie, 818 F.2d\n\n115,       118-19   (1st    Cir.      1987)    (upholding       conviction      under   §\n\n841(a)(1) notwithstanding utter absence of evidence defendant\n\nintended to distribute drugs within United States).\n\n              Second,      the     district        court’s      failure    to   address\n\nappellant directly during important portions of the Rule 11\n\nproceeding, though contrary to Rule 11(c), violated no “core”\n\nRule 11 concern under our jurisprudence.2                       See Allard, 926 F.2d\n\nat 1244-45; see also Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4-5; cf. United\n\nStates v. Medina-Silverio, 30 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              Third, appellant points out that the district court\n\nfailed to inform him that the mandatory minimum prison term\n\nprescribed by statute is ten years.                       See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) &\n\n(b)(1)(A); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1).                      Furthermore, the\n\n\n\n       2\n     See Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4 (identifying “core concerns”\nas absence of coercion, understanding of charges, and knowledge\nof consequences of guilty plea).     There is no suggestion of\ncoercion. See also n.1 supra.\n\n                                              4\n\fplea agreement itself misstated the minimum prison term as five\n\nyears, rather than ten.        Nonetheless, since it is undisputed\n\nthat the 188-month prison term imposed by the district court is\n\nthe minimum required under the applicable sentencing guidelines,\n\nthese errors too must be deemed “harmless.”           See United States\n\nv. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding “harmless”\n\nthe district court’s failure to inform defendant of mandatory\n\nminimum sentence, as court ultimately imposed sentence lengthier\n\nthan mandatory statutory minimum, “without any reference to the\n\nmandatory minimum”).\n\n         Finally, before accepting the guilty plea, the district\n\ncourt did not address appellant directly in explaining the\n\nconstitutional rights to remain silent and confront adverse\n\nwitnesses at any trial.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(3).        The\n\ngovernment   responds   that   the   omission   was   harmless   because\n\nappellant signed the plea agreement itself, which accurately\n\nreflected the charges, as well as the basic constitutional\n\nrights waived under the plea agreement.3\n\n         In the “Statement of Facts” section of his appellate\n\nbrief, appellant offers the conclusory observation that the\n\ndistrict court violated Rule 11 in failing to advise that he\n\n\n    3Contrary to the government’s characterization, however, the\nthree-page plea agreement makes no mention of the two\nconstitutional rights addressed here.\n\n                                     5\n\fwould    have    the   right    to   confront    adverse    witnesses     and    to\n\nrefrain from testifying at any trial.              Then, at the very outset\n\nof the “Argument” section in his appellate brief, appellant\n\nexplicitly delimits his argumentation to but two issues:                        the\n\nalleged violation of Rule 11(c)(1) by the district court, in\n\nfailing to inform appellant of (i) the nature of the charges to\n\nwhich he was pleading guilty, and (ii) the correct mandatory\n\nminimum    sentence,      see    supra.       Moreover,     appellant     neither\n\npresents developed argumentation nor provides pertinent case\n\ncitations       respecting     the   asserted    Rule     11(c)(3)   omissions.\n\nConsequently, we deem these embryonic claims to have been waived\n\non appeal.        See, e.g., United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 199\n\nF.3d 552, 563 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999) (appellate court deems waived\n\nissues    presented      in    perfunctory      manner,    without      developed\n\nargumentation).\n\n            The present waiver is particularly conspicuous, in that\n\nappellant neither suggests nor contends that he was                      actually\n\nunaware    of    these   two    constitutional     rights    at   the    Rule    11\n\nhearing.    Rather, upon being asked by the district court whether\n\nhe had “discussed with [his] attorney the meaning of pleading\n\nguilty,” and whether he was “satisfied with [his] attorney’s\n\nrepresentation,” defendant responded in the affirmative, without\n\nlimitation or qualification.              (Emphasis added.)       Finally, our\n\n\n                                          6\n\findependent   research   reveals   that   the   caselaw   —   concerning\n\nwhether and in what circumstances a Rule 11(c)(3) omission may\n\nconstitute reversible error — is at best opaque,4 sufficient\n\nreason in itself to decline to reach an important question upon\n\nwhich appellant provides no elucidation whatsoever.\n\n         Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    4 Compare, e.g., United States v. Tursi, 576 F.2d 396, 399\n(1st Cir. 1978) (finding no reversible error in district court’s\nfailure to inform defendant of trial rights, but under pre-1976\nversion of Rule 11, which — unlike current Rule 11(c)(3) — did\nnot enumerate specific trial rights), and United States v.\nStead, 746 F.2d 355, 356-57 (6th Cir. 1984) (declining to vacate\nguilty plea though district court admittedly failed to warn\ndefendant of right against self-incrimination and right to\nconfront witnesses), with United States v. Carter, 619 F.2d 293,\n295 (2d Cir. 1980) (reversing where district court omitted\n“core” requirement that defendant be advised of confrontation\nrights).\n\n                                   7\n\f",

P. 11(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was charged by information, in the United  States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, with  violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) by knowingly possessing  approximately 1,692.8 grams of cocaine base, with intent to  distribute.  After pleading guilty pursuant to a written plea  agreement, he was sentenced, inter alia, to a 188-month prison  term, the minimum prescribed under the applicable sentencing  guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant first contends that he did not know that the  scheduled airline flight from Colombia to Spain, where he was to  have delivered the cocaine, would land in Puerto Rico en route. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1) (mandating that district court inform  defendant of \"the nature of the charge to which the [guilty] plea  is offered\").  Although the Rule 11 colloquy conducted below in no  sense foreclosed it, the present contention inevitably fails since  it misapprehends the controlling law.  See, e.g., United States v. McKenzie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488023\"><a href=\"/opinion/488023/united-states-v-ralph-mckenzie/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 118-19 (1st Cir. 1987) (upholding  conviction under &#167; 841(a)(1) notwithstanding utter absence of  evidence defendant intended to distribute drugs within United  States).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court's failure to address appellant  directly during important portions of the Rule 11 proceeding,  though contrary to Rule 11(c), violated no \"core\" Rule 11 concern  under our jurisprudence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556604\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Allard,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/556604/united-states-v-raymond-p-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1244-45</span></a></span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195871\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cotal-Crespo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195871/united-states-v-cotal-crespo/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4-5</span></a></span>; cf. United States v. Medina-Silverio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195500\"><a href=\"/opinion/195500/united-states-v-medina-silverio/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, appellant points out that the district court  failed to inform him that the mandatory minimum prison term prescribed by statute is ten years.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a) &amp;  (b)(1)(A); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1).  Furthermore, the  plea agreement itself misstated the minimum prison term as five  years, rather than ten.  Nonetheless, since it is undisputed that  the 188-month prison term imposed by the district court is the minimum required under the applicable sentencing guidelines, these  errors too must be deemed \"harmless.\"  See United States v. McDonald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744603\"><a href=\"/opinion/744603/united-states-v-cecilio-f-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding \"harmless\" the  district court's failure to inform defendant of mandatory minimum  sentence, as court ultimately imposed sentence lengthier than  mandatory statutory minimum, \"without any reference to the  mandatory minimum\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, before accepting the guilty plea, the district  court did not address appellant directly in explaining the  constitutional rights to remain silent and confront adverse  witnesses at any trial.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(3).  The  government responds that the omission was harmless because  appellant signed the plea agreementitself, which accurately  reflected the charges, as well as the basic constitutional rights  waived under the plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the \"Statement of Facts\" section of his appellate  brief, appellant offers the conclusory observation that the  district court violated Rule 11 in failing to advise that he would  have the right to confront adverse witnesses and to refrain from  testifying at any trial.  Then, at the very outset of the  \"Argument\" section in his appellate brief, appellant explicitly  delimits his argumentation to but two issues:  the alleged  violation of Rule 11(c)(1) by the district court, in failing to  inform appellant of (i) the nature of the charges to which he was  pleading guilty, and (ii) the correct mandatory minimum sentence, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra</span>.  Moreover, appellant neither presents developed  argumentation nor provides pertinent case citations respecting the  asserted Rule 11(c)(3) omissions.  Consequently, we deem these  embryonic claims to have been waived on appeal.  See, e.g., United  States v. Rosario-Peralta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198755\"><a href=\"/opinion/198755/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 563 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999)  (appellate court deems waived issues presented in perfunctory  manner, without developed argumentation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present waiver is particularly conspicuous, in that  appellant neither suggests nor contends that he was actually unaware of these two constitutional rights at the Rule 11 hearing. Rather, upon being asked by the district court whether he had  \"discussed with [his] attorney the meaning of pleading guilty,\" and  whether he was \"satisfied with [his] attorney's representation,\"  defendant responded in the affirmative, without limitation or  qualification.  (Emphasis added.)  Finally, our independent  research reveals that the caselaw -- concerning whether and in what  circumstances a Rule 11(c)(3) omission may constitute reversible  error -- is at best opaque,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> sufficient reason in itself to decline  to reach an important question upon which appellant provides no  elucidation whatsoever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., United States v.
