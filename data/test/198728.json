This case\r\ncalls upon us to decide whether notice of termination is effective\r\npursuant to the law of Rhode Island where: (1) the notice is\r\nmailed in advance of, but received after, the expiration of the\r\ncontractual notice period; and (2) a separate contractual notice\r\nprovision invites notice by mail to a certain address, but notice\r\nis sent to, and actually received by, the noticee at a different\r\naddress.  Because we agree with the trial court that such notice\r\nwas effective, we affirm. \r\n                              I.\r\nAs this is an appeal from an entry of summary judgment,\r\nwe recount the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the\r\nnon-moving party, the appellants.  See Reich v. John Alden Life\r\nIns. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).  Emergency Medicine is a\r\nnon-profit Rhode Island corporation that provides physicians'\r\nservices to emergency departments at several Rhode Island\r\nhospitals.  Pursuant to a series of contracts spanning more than\r\nten years, MBS, a subsidiary of Rapier, performed coding, billing,\r\ncollection and accounts receivable services for Emergency Medicine.\r\nOn October 1, 1995, Emergency Medicine and Rapier\r\nexecuted a contract (the \"Agreement\") calling for MBS to service\r\nEmergency Medicine for one year, and further providing that\r\n  this Agreement shall be automatically extended\r\nfor additional one (1) year period [sic]\r\n(\"additional terms\") unless and until either\r\nparty elects to terminate this Agreement as of\r\nthe end of the initial term or any additional\r\nterm by giving at least four (4) months\r\nwritten notice that it elects to have this\r\nAgreement terminated, without cause. \r\n\nA separate paragraph entitled \"Notices,\" (the \"notice paragraph\"),\r\nprescribes a method by which notice may be \"effectively given\":\r\n  Any notices given pursuant to this Agreement\r\nshall be deemed to have been effectively given\r\nif sent by registered or certified mail to the\r\nparty to whom the notice is directed at the\r\naddress set forth for such party herein above\r\nor at such other address as such party may\r\nhereafter specify in a notice given in\r\naccordance with this paragraph.\r\n\nThe only addresses \"set forth\" in the Agreement are Rapier's\r\nprincipal office, 7 Wells Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts, and\r\nEmergency Medicine's principal place of business, 593 Eddy Street,\r\nProvidence, Rhode Island.  \r\nDuring the contract's first year, neither party\r\nterminated, and it automatically renewed for an additional year,\r\nending September 30, 1997.  On Friday, May 30, 1997, Annamarie\r\nMonks of Emergency Medicine mailed two letters intended to notify\r\nRapier that Emergency Medicine planned to terminate the Agreement\r\nbefore it renewed for a third year.  She sent one letter certified\r\nmail to Alan Carr-Locke of Rapier at 1238 Chestnut Street, Newton,\r\nMassachusetts.  Because the letter was incorrectly addressed, it\r\nwas returned undelivered on June 10, at which point Emergency\r\nMedicine mailed the notice to 7 Wells Avenue, Newton,\r\nMassachusetts.  She sent the second letter certified mail to JoAnn\r\nBarato-Mills of MBS, the employee who had negotiated and signed the\r\nAgreement on behalf of Rapier, at her place of business, 20 Altieri\r\nWay, Warwick, Rhode Island.  Ms. Barato-Mills received the letter\r\nthe following Monday, June 2, 1997.\r\nIn the months following Emergency Medicine's notice of\r\nnon-renewal, MBS continued to perform services under the Agreement. \r\nMeanwhile, Emergency Medicine solicited bids for a new service\r\ncontract and, although MBS submitted a bid, Emergency Medicine\r\nawarded the new contract to a different service provider.  MBS then\r\nasserted that, because Emergency Medicine's termination notice had\r\nbeen invalid, the Agreement had already extended automatically for\r\nan additional year, ending September 30, 1998.\r\nEmergency Medicine filed a complaint seeking, inter alia,\r\na declaration that its notice had effectively terminated the\r\nAgreement.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment\r\non the validity of the termination notice, and the trial court\r\ngranted judgment in favor of Emergency Medicine.  This appeal\r\nensued. \r\n                            II.\r\nThe Agreement entered into by Emergency Medicine and\r\nRapier expressly reserved to either party the power to terminate\r\nthe contract before it automatically renewed.  Termination\r\nprovisions are standard fare in modern contracts, see 1A Corbin on\r\nContracts,  265, at 531, and such provisions often require that\r\nthe terminating party fulfill certain conditions before termination\r\nis effective, see 6 Corbin,  1266 at 55-56.  Where \"the power to\r\nterminate is a conditional power,\" termination is not effective\r\nuntil the party seeking termination can show that the condition has\r\nbeen fulfilled.  See id. at 56.  According to Rapier, Emergency\r\nMedicine did not fulfill the condition required for termination\r\nunder the Agreement because it failed to provide Rapier with at\r\nleast four months written notice.  We are asked therefore to\r\nevaluate the effectiveness of Emergency Medicine's termination\r\nnotice pursuant to the contract.  \r\nA. The Mailbox Rule\r\nThe Agreement expressly conditions a party's right to\r\nterminate on that party \"giving at least four (4) months written\r\nnotice\" to the other party.  Where, as here, such \"a condition is\r\nrequired by the agreement of the parties . . . a rule of strict\r\ncompliance traditionally applies.\"  Farnsworth, Contracts  8.3, at\r\n571 (1990) (emphasis added).  \"Strict compliance\" means that \"[t]he\r\nnotice to terminate, to be effective, must be given at the\r\nstipulated time.\" Fred Mosher-Grain, Inc. v. Kansas Co-op. Wheat\r\nMktg. Ass'n, 15 P.2d 421, 425 (Kan. 1932); see also 6 Corbin \r\n1266, at 65-66 (where the contract expresses a time period for\r\nnotice, it is presumed that \"time is of the essence\").  As one\r\ncourt cautioned more than seventy-five years ago, \"[t]he difference\r\nof one day in the giving of notice is small, in one view, but it is\r\nthe distance across a necessary boundary in relations under the\r\ncontract, and must be taken as decisive, or there can be no\r\nboundary.\"  Brown Method Co. v. Ginsberg, 138 A. 402, 403-04 (Md.\r\n1927).  Accordingly, we must strictly enforce the four-month notice\r\nperiod bargained for by Rapier and Emergency Medicine.   \r\nThe Agreement, as extended by renewal for one additional\r\nyear, was set to expire on September 30, 1997.  Counting back\r\nexactly four months, the last day on which Emergency Medicine had\r\nthe power to terminate was May 31, 1997.  Although Emergency\r\nMedicine mailed notice letters on May 30, these letters were not\r\nreceived until after the notice period had expired.  Thus, the\r\ntimeliness of Emergency Medicine's notice turns on whether notice\r\nof termination is effective upon mailing, or upon receipt. \r\nAt common law, the default rule -- i.e., the rule that\r\ngoverns unless the parties contract for different terms -- makes\r\nnotice effective only upon receipt, not mailing.  See 1A Corbin\r\n265, at 532 (\"If the agreement merely provides that one party may\r\nterminate by giving notice, the notice will be effective only when\r\nreceived, and not when it is started by mail or otherwise.\"); \r\nKantrowitz v. Dairymen's League Co-Op. Ass'n, Inc., 71 N.Y.S.2d\r\n821, 822 (N.Y. App. Div. 1947) (\"[W]here a contract requires\r\nnotice, but does not specify the manner in which the notice is to\r\nbe given, the mere mailing of notice is not sufficient unless it is\r\nreceived within the time specified.\").\r\nHowever, the parties may override the default rule by\r\ncontract. See 6 Corbin  1266, at 65 (\"The time and manner of\r\nexercising a power of termination may be specified in the contract\r\n. . . .\").  In particular, the parties may contract to permit\r\nnotice by mail. If they do, notice becomes effective upon mailing\r\npursuant to the time-honored \"mailbox rule.\"  See 1 Merrill on\r\nNotice  633 (1956); Kantrowitz, 71 N.Y.S.2d at 822; cf. Larocque\r\nv. Rhode Island Joint Reinsurance Ass'n, 536 A.2d 529, 531 (R.I.\r\n1988) (\"Where the [insurance] policy provides that cancellation may\r\nbe effected by mailing notice, the general rule is that\r\nnotification is fulfilled by proof of mailing.\").\r\nHere, the Agreement unquestionably authorizes notice by\r\nmail.  The notice paragraph expressly invites notice \"sent by\r\nregistered or certified mail.\"  This paragraph therefore triggers\r\nthe \"mailbox rule,\" making notice effective upon mailing. \r\nAccordingly, Emergency Medicine's notice letters, mailed on May 30,\r\n1997, took effect on that date, and were timely under the\r\nAgreement's four-month notice period, which did not expire until\r\nMay 31, unless the use of an address other than the one specified\r\nin the contract deprived Emergency Medicine of the benefit of the\r\nmailbox rule.\r\nB. The Mailing Address\r\nThe notice paragraph states that notice \"shall be deemed\r\nto have been effectively given if sent . . . to the party to whom\r\nthe notice is directed at the address set forth for such party\r\nherein above or at such other address as such party may hereafter\r\nspecify . . . .\"  The address \"set forth\" in the Agreement was\r\nRapier's principal office located at 7 Wells Avenue, Newton,\r\nMassachusetts.  Emergency Medicine, however, mailed its May 30\r\nnotices to Rapier at an incorrect Massachusetts address and to MBS\r\nat a Rhode Island address. \r\nThe trial court concluded that the notice paragraph,\r\nwritten in non-exclusive language, only set forth one method by\r\nwhich notice could be \"effectively given.\"  See University\r\nEmergency Med. Found. v. Rapier Inv., Ltd., No. 97-549-T, slip. op.\r\nat 4-5 (D.R.I. October 15, 1998) (order granting summary judgment). \r\nThe court then noted that, as a general rule, notice given by a\r\nmethod different from the one provided for in the contract \"is\r\neffective if it is actually received unless the method by which\r\nnotice is given is an essential element of the transaction.\"  Id.\r\n(citing 1 Merrill,  603, at 662-63).  Finding that Emergency\r\nMedicine's notice was actually received (and, impliedly, that the\r\ncontractual method for providing notice was not an \"essential\r\nelement\" of Rapier and Emergency Medicine's transaction), the court\r\nruled that notice was effective.  See id. at 6.\r\nWe accept the trial court's conclusion that the notice\r\nwas effective, but disagree slightly with its underlying reasoning. \r\nAlthough the notice paragraph is non-exclusive, permitting notice\r\nin any other way recognized by law, Emergency Medicine must rely on\r\nthe notice paragraph on the facts of this case because it is only\r\nthis paragraph that invites notice by mail, and, consequently, as\r\ndiscussed above, it is only by virtue of this paragraph that\r\nEmergency Medicine's notice was timely.  Because Emergency Medicine\r\nmust rely on the notice paragraph as its authority for invoking the\r\n\"mailbox rule,\" we must inquire whether Emergency Medicine's notice\r\nletters complied with the terms and conditions of valid notice\r\nunder that paragraph.\r\nIn doing so, we are mindful of the principle, so\r\nfundamental in the law of contracts, that we must give effect to\r\nthe intent of the parties.  See McCarthy v. Azure, 22 F.3d 351, 355\r\n(1st Cir. 1994); Brady v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Soc., Ltd., 133\r\nA. 799, 799 (R.I. 1926).  Here, the critical question is whether\r\nthe parties intended the use of the mailing address specified in\r\nthe contract to be a condition precedent to valid termination.  We\r\nconclude that they did not.  Rather, we find that the parties\r\nidentified specific addresses for the mailing of notice merely as\r\na convenient means of ensuring timely delivery.\r\nFirst, we note the obvious difference in import of the\r\nfour-month notice provision and the mailing address provision.  A\r\nnotice period reflects the amount of time deemed necessary by the\r\nparties to adapt to the other's termination.  For the service\r\nprovider, it includes the time needed to procure new clients or\r\nreallocate staff and equipment; for the service recipient, it\r\nincludes the time needed to replace its former service provider. \r\nBy contrast, the mailing address does not, in itself, confer any\r\nbenefit upon either party.  It is merely a collateral term intended\r\nto  enhance the probability that mailed notice will arrive promptly\r\nin the proper hands.  Cf. Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. v.\r\nBBTC Co., 521 P.2d 1097, 1100 (Cal. 1974) (in bank) (an option\r\ncontract's provision that notice be given personally or by prepaid\r\nregistered mail is a \"mere suggestion of a permissive method of\r\ncommunication,\" not \"a prescribed requirement or an absolute\r\ncondition.\").  Thus, by its very nature, the stipulation that\r\nnotice be sent to a particular address is not the type of term\r\nordinarily bargained-for, nor is it the type of term intended to\r\nallow one party to extinguish the other's contractual rights based\r\non a failure of strict compliance.  Indeed, courts have held that\r\nmailed termination notice is valid so long as it is actually\r\nreceived by the noticee, even where it is mailed to an incorrect\r\naddress, see U.S. Broad. Co. v. National Broad. Co., 439 F. Supp.\r\n8, 9-10 (D. Mass. 1977), or where the form of the mailing is\r\ntechnically defective, see Southern Sanitation Co. v. City of\r\nShreveport, 308 So. 2d 848, 849 (La. Ct. App. 1975) (letter\r\naddressed incorrectly to \"P.O. Box 3326\" rather than \"3328.\"); \r\nBarbier v. Barry, 345 S.W.2d 557, 562 (Tex. Civ. App. 1961) (letter\r\nsent by regular rather than registered mail).  But see Prudential\r\nCarolinas Realty v. Cambridge Dev. Corp., 872 F. Supp. 256, 261\r\n(D.S.C. 1994) aff'd, 42 F.3d 1386 (4th Cir. 1994) (per curiam).\r\nSecond, the overall structure of the Agreement indicates\r\nthat the parties did not intend the mailing address to be a\r\ncondition of valid termination.  See Aneluca Assoc. v. Lombardi,\r\n620 A.2d 88, 92 (R.I. 1993) (construing the parties' intent by\r\nlooking to the contract as a whole).  The paragraph of the\r\nAgreement delineating termination rights appears five pages before\r\nthe paragraph describing \"notice\" by mail.  The only conditions of\r\ntermination expressed within the paragraph on termination rights\r\nare that notice be given in writing and at least four months in\r\nadvance of the Agreement's year-end date.  Moreover, as the trial\r\ncourt correctly found, the notice by mail paragraph is written in\r\nnon-exclusive language, suggesting that any method of written\r\nnotice valid under law would be effective.  See University\r\nEmergency Med. Found., No. 97-549-T, slip. op. at 4-5; see also\r\nSouthern Region Indus. Realty, Inc. v. Chattanooga Warehouse and\r\nCold Storage Co., 612 S.W.2d 162, 164 (Tenn. 1980) (finding that\r\nthe contractual address \"merely suggests a permitted place and\r\nmethod of giving notice and does not preclude sending notice to\r\nother offices . . . .\").  If the parties had intended the use of\r\nthe address specified in the contract to be a condition of valid\r\ntermination, like the four-month notice period, they presumably\r\nwould have located the address requirement next to the notice\r\nperiod in the paragraph defining termination rights.  Moreover, if\r\nthe address was an essential term of the bargain, the parties would\r\nhave made notice sent to that address the exclusive means of\r\nproviding written notice, rather than just one method among many\r\nthat would have been effective.  Thus, the overall structure of the\r\nAgreement supports our conclusion that the parties intended the\r\nmailing address as a convenient means of effectuating delivery and\r\nnot as a condition precedent to valid termination.\r\nTo be sure, a party that fails to use the address\r\nidentified in the contract for mailing notice risks losing the\r\nbenefit of the mailbox rule.  The contract provision at issue in\r\nthis case, which states that notice of termination may be given\r\neffectively by registered or certified mail sent to a particular\r\naddress, allocated the risk of non-delivery of a notice sent in\r\nstrict compliance with the contract.  Cf. Worms v. Burgess, 620\r\nP.2d 455, 457 (Okla. Ct. App. 1980) (observing that in the offer-\r\nacceptance context the mailbox rule shifts the risk of loss during \r\ntransmission to the offeror);  Farnsworth, Contracts  3.22, at 184\r\n(\"The mailbox rule has been used to allocate the risk of\r\ntransmission . . . .\").  That is, if Emergency Medicine chose to\r\ngive timely notice of termination by registered or certified mail\r\nsent to the specified address, and the notice was undelivered\r\nbecause of a failure by the postal service, Emergency Medicine\r\nwould have still given timely notice of termination despite the\r\nnon-delivery.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts  63 (\"Unless\r\nan offer provides otherwise, . . . an acceptance made in a manner\r\nand by a medium invited by an offer is operative . . . without\r\nregard to whether it ever reaches the offeror . . . .\").  If,\r\nhowever, Emergency Medicine directed its otherwise timely notice of\r\ntermination to the wrong address and there were no delivery,\r\nEmergency Medicine would lose the benefit of the mailbox rule.  In\r\nsituations where there is delivery despite the use of a wrong\r\naddress, and the circumstances indicate that the parties intended\r\nthe address as merely a collateral term designed to enhance the\r\ntimely delivery of notice, the continuing availability of the\r\nmailbox rule to the sender requires an assessment of the particular\r\nfacts of the case. \r\n  In the case at hand, Emergency Medicine risked losing the\r\nbenefit of the mailbox rule with respect to both of its improperly\r\naddressed May 30 mailings.  That risk arguably materialized in the\r\ncase of the letter mailed to Rapier's Alan Carr-Locke, which was\r\nreturned undelivered, and finally arrived at Rapier more than 10\r\ndays after it was originally sent.  However, the letter mailed to\r\nMBS's JoAnn Barato-Mills arrived in her hands just one business day\r\nafter it was mailed (the letter was mailed on Friday and arrived on\r\nMonday),  within the ordinary time period expected for delivery by\r\nmail.  Under these circumstances, Emergency Medicine retained the\r\nbenefit of the mailbox rule despite the improper address, and this\r\nsecond letter placed Rapier on written notice of Emergency\r\nMedicine's intent to terminate the Agreement before it\r\nautomatically renewed for a third year.  Therefore, we conclude\r\nthat Emergency Medicine provided Rapier with four months written\r\nnotice of its intent to terminate as required under the Agreement.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Ms. Barato-Mills received the letter\r\nthe following Monday, June 2, 1997.\r\nIn the months following Emergency Medicine's notice of\r\nnon-renewal, MBS continued to perform services under the Agreement. \r\nMeanwhile, Emergency Medicine solicited bids for a new service\r\ncontract and, although MBS submitted a bid, Emergency Medicine\r\nawarded the new contract to a different service provider.  MBS then\r\nasserted that, because Emergency Medicine's termination notice had\r\nbeen invalid, the Agreement had already extended automatically for\r\nan additional year, ending September 30, 1998.\r\nEmergency Medicine filed a complaint seeking, inter alia,\r\na declaration that its notice had effectively terminated the\r\nAgreement.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment\r\non the validity of the termination notice, and the trial court\r\ngranted judgment in favor of Emergency Medicine.  This appeal\r\nensued. \r\n                            II.\r\nThe Agreement entered into by Emergency Medicine and\r\nRapier expressly reserved to either party the power to terminate\r\nthe contract before it automatically renewed.  Termination\r\nprovisions are standard fare in modern contracts, see 1A Corbin on\r\nContracts,  265, at 531, and such provisions often require that\r\nthe terminating party fulfill certain conditions before termination\r\nis effective, see 6 Corbin,  1266 at 55-56.  Where \"the power to\r\nterminate is a conditional power,\" termination is not effective\r\nuntil the party seeking termination can show that the condition has\r\nbeen fulfilled.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197565\"><a href=\"/opinion/197565/reich-v-john-alden/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 56. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> According to Rapier, Emergency\r\nMedicine did not fulfill the condition required for termination\r\nunder the Agreement because it failed to provide Rapier with at\r\nleast four months written notice.  We are asked therefore to\r\nevaluate the effectiveness of Emergency Medicine's termination\r\nnotice pursuant to the contract.  \r\nA. The Mailbox Rule\r\nThe Agreement expressly conditions a party's right to\r\nterminate on that party \"giving at least four (4) months written\r\nnotice\" to the other party.  Where, as here, such \"a condition is\r\nrequired by the agreement of the parties . . . a rule of strict\r\ncompliance traditionally applies.\"  Farnsworth, Contracts  8.3, at\r\n571 (1990) (emphasis added).  \"Strict compliance\" means that \"[t]he\r\nnotice to terminate, to be effective, must be given at the\r\nstipulated time.\" Fred Mosher-Grain, Inc. v.

As one\r\ncourt cautioned more than seventy-five years ago, \"[t]he difference\r\nof one day in the giving of notice is small, in one view, but it is\r\nthe distance across a necessary boundary in relations under the\r\ncontract, and must be taken as decisive, or there can be no\r\nboundary.\"  Brown Method Co. v. Ginsberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3489964\"><a href=\"/opinion/3491965/brown-method-co-v-ginsberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403-04 (Md.\r\n1927).  Accordingly, we must strictly enforce the four-month notice\r\nperiod bargained for by Rapier and Emergency Medicine.   \r\nThe Agreement, as extended by renewal for one additional\r\nyear, was set to expire on September 30, 1997.  Counting back\r\nexactly four months, the last day on which Emergency Medicine had\r\nthe power to terminate was May 31, 1997.  Although Emergency\r\nMedicine mailed notice letters on May 30, these letters were not\r\nreceived until after the notice period had expired.  Thus, the\r\ntimeliness of Emergency Medicine's notice turns on whether notice\r\nof termination is effective upon mailing, or upon receipt. \r\nAt common law, the default rule -- i.e., the rule that\r\ngoverns unless the parties contract for different terms -- makes\r\nnotice effective only upon receipt, not mailing.  See 1A Corbin\r\n265, at 532 (\"If the agreement merely provides that one party may\r\nterminate by giving notice, the notice will be effective only when\r\nreceived, and not when it is started by mail or otherwise.\"); \r\nKantrowitz v.

App. Div. 1947) (\"[W]here a contract requires\r\nnotice, but does not specify the manner in which the notice is to\r\nbe given, the mere mailing of notice is not sufficient unless it is\r\nreceived within the time specified.\").\r\nHowever, the parties may override the default rule by\r\ncontract. See 6 Corbin  1266, at 65 (\"The time and manner of\r\nexercising a power of termination may be specified in the contract\r\n. . . .\").  In particular, the parties may contract to permit\r\nnotice by mail. If they do, notice becomes effective upon mailing\r\npursuant to the time-honored \"mailbox rule.\"  See 1 Merrill on\r\nNotice  633 (1956); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kantrowitz,</span> <span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">822</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; cf.

The notice paragraph expressly invites notice \"sent by\r\nregistered or certified mail.\"  This paragraph therefore triggers\r\nthe \"mailbox rule,\" making notice effective upon mailing. \r\nAccordingly, Emergency Medicine's notice letters, mailed on May 30,\r\n1997, took effect on that date, and were timely under the\r\nAgreement's four-month notice period, which did not expire until\r\nMay 31, unless the use of an address other than the one specified\r\nin the contract deprived Emergency Medicine of the benefit of the\r\nmailbox rule.\r\nB. The Mailing Address\r\nThe notice paragraph states that notice \"shall be deemed\r\nto have been effectively given if sent . . . to the party to whom\r\nthe notice is directed at the address set forth for such party\r\nherein above or at such other address as such party may hereafter\r\nspecify . . . .\"  The address \"set forth\" in the Agreement was\r\nRapier's principal office located at 7 Wells Avenue, Newton,\r\nMassachusetts.  Emergency Medicine, however, mailed its May 30\r\nnotices to Rapier at an incorrect Massachusetts address and to MBS\r\nat a Rhode Island address. \r\nThe trial court concluded that the notice paragraph,\r\nwritten in non-exclusive language, only set forth one method by\r\nwhich notice could be \"effectively given.\"  See University\r\nEmergency Med. Found. v. Rapier Inv., Ltd., No. 97-549-T, slip. op.\r\nat 4-5 (D.R.I. October 15, 1998) (order granting summary judgment). \r\nThe court then noted that, as a general rule, notice given by a\r\nmethod different from the one provided for in the contract \"is\r\neffective if it is actually received unless the method by which\r\nnotice is given is an essential element of the transaction.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2350515\"><a href=\"/opinion/2350515/larocque-v-ri-joint-reinsurance-assn/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r\n(citing 1 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Merrill,  603, at 662-63).  Finding that Emergency\r\nMedicine's notice was actually received (and, impliedly, that the\r\ncontractual method for providing notice was not an \"essential\r\nelement\" of Rapier and Emergency Medicine's transaction), the court\r\nruled that notice was effective.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2350515\"><a href=\"/opinion/2350515/larocque-v-ri-joint-reinsurance-assn/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 6.\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nWe accept the trial court's conclusion that the notice\r\nwas effective, but disagree slightly with its underlying reasoning. \r\nAlthough the notice paragraph is non-exclusive, permitting notice\r\nin any other way recognized by law, Emergency Medicine must rely on\r\nthe notice paragraph on the facts of this case because it is only\r\nthis paragraph that invites notice by mail, and, consequently, as\r\ndiscussed above, it is only by virtue of this paragraph that\r\nEmergency Medicine's notice was timely.  Because Emergency Medicine\r\nmust rely on the notice paragraph as its authority for invoking the\r\n\"mailbox rule,\" we must inquire whether Emergency Medicine's notice\r\nletters complied with the terms and conditions of valid notice\r\nunder that paragraph.\r\nIn doing so, we are mindful of the principle, so\r\nfundamental in the law of contracts, that we must give effect to\r\nthe intent of the parties.  See McCarthy v. Azure, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195334\"><a href=\"/opinion/195334/mccarthy-v-azure/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355\r\n(1st Cir. 1994); Brady v.

Here, the critical question is whether\r\nthe parties intended the use of the mailing address specified in\r\nthe contract to be a condition precedent to valid termination.  We\r\nconclude that they did not.  Rather, we find that the parties\r\nidentified specific addresses for the mailing of notice merely as\r\na convenient means of ensuring timely delivery.\r\nFirst, we note the obvious difference in import of the\r\nfour-month notice provision and the mailing address provision.  A\r\nnotice period reflects the amount of time deemed necessary by the\r\nparties to adapt to the other's termination.  For the service\r\nprovider, it includes the time needed to procure new clients or\r\nreallocate staff and equipment; for the service recipient, it\r\nincludes the time needed to replace its former service provider. \r\nBy contrast, the mailing address does not, in itself, confer any\r\nbenefit upon either party.  It is merely a collateral term intended\r\nto  enhance the probability that mailed notice will arrive promptly\r\nin the proper hands.  Cf. Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. v.\r\nBBTC Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1358562\"><a href=\"/opinion/1358562/palo-alto-town-country-village-inc-v-bbtc-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1100 (Cal. 1974) (in bank) (an option\r\ncontract's provision that notice be given personally or by prepaid\r\nregistered mail is a \"mere suggestion of a permissive method of\r\ncommunication,\" not \"a prescribed requirement or an absolute\r\ncondition.\").  Thus, by its very nature, the stipulation that\r\nnotice be sent to a particular address is not the type of term\r\nordinarily bargained-for, nor is it the type of term intended to\r\nallow one party to extinguish the other's contractual rights based\r\non a failure of strict compliance.  Indeed, courts have held that\r\nmailed termination notice is valid so long as it is actually\r\nreceived by the noticee, even where it is mailed to an incorrect\r\naddress, see U.S. Broad. Co. v.

See Aneluca Assoc. v. Lombardi,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (R.I. 1993) (construing the parties' intent by\r\nlooking to the contract as a whole).  The paragraph of the\r\nAgreement delineating termination rights appears five pages before\r\nthe paragraph describing \"notice\" by mail.  The only conditions of\r\ntermination expressed within the paragraph on termination rights\r\nare that notice be given in writing and at least four months in\r\nadvance of the Agreement's year-end date.  Moreover, as the trial\r\ncourt correctly found, the notice by mail paragraph is written in\r\nnon-exclusive language, suggesting that any method of written\r\nnotice valid under law would be effective.  See University\r\nEmergency Med. Found., No. 97-549-T, slip. op. at 4-5; see also\r\nSouthern Region Indus. Realty, Inc. v. Chattanooga Warehouse and\r\nCold Storage Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164 (Tenn. 1980) (finding that\r\nthe contractual address \"merely suggests a permitted place and\r\nmethod of giving notice and does not preclude sending notice to\r\nother offices . . . .\").  If the parties had intended the use of\r\nthe address specified in the contract to be a condition of valid\r\ntermination, like the four-month notice period, they presumably\r\nwould have located the address requirement next to the notice\r\nperiod in the paragraph defining termination rights.  Moreover, if\r\nthe address was an essential term of the bargain, the parties would\r\nhave made notice sent to that address the exclusive means of\r\nproviding written notice, rather than just one method among many\r\nthat would have been effective.  Thus, the overall structure of the\r\nAgreement supports our conclusion that the parties intended the\r\nmailing address as a convenient means of effectuating delivery and\r\nnot as a condition precedent to valid termination.\r\nTo be sure, a party that fails to use the address\r\nidentified in the contract for mailing notice risks losing the\r\nbenefit of the mailbox rule.  The contract provision at issue in\r\nthis case, which states that notice of termination may be given\r\neffectively by registered or certified mail sent to a particular\r\naddress, allocated the risk of non-delivery of a notice sent in\r\nstrict compliance with the contract.  Cf. Worms v. Burgess, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196895\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196895/worms-v-burgess/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 457 (Okla. Ct. App. 1980) (observing that in the offer-\r\nacceptance context the mailbox rule shifts the risk of loss during \r\ntransmission to the offeror);  Farnsworth, Contracts  3.22, at 184\r\n(\"The mailbox rule has been used to allocate the risk of\r\ntransmission . . . .\").  That is, if Emergency Medicine chose to\r\ngive timely notice of termination by registered or certified mail\r\nsent to the specified address, and the notice was undelivered\r\nbecause of a failure by the postal service, Emergency Medicine\r\nwould have still given timely notice of termination despite the\r\nnon-delivery.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts  63 (\"Unless\r\nan offer provides otherwise, . . . an acceptance made in a manner\r\nand by a medium invited by an offer is operative . . . without\r\nregard to whether it ever reaches the offeror . . . .\").  If,\r\nhowever, Emergency Medicine directed its otherwise timely notice of\r\ntermination to the wrong address and there were no delivery,\r\nEmergency Medicine would lose the benefit of the mailbox rule.  In\r\nsituations where there is delivery despite the use of a wrong\r\naddress, and the circumstances indicate that the parties intended\r\nthe address as merely a collateral term designed to enhance the\r\ntimely delivery of notice, the continuing availability of the\r\nmailbox rule to the sender requires an assessment of the particular\r\nfacts of the case. \r\n  In the case at hand, Emergency Medicine risked losing the\r\nbenefit of the mailbox rule with respect to both of its improperly\r\naddressed May 30 mailings.  That risk arguably materialized in the\r\ncase of the letter mailed to Rapier's Alan Carr-Locke, which was\r\nreturned undelivered, and finally arrived at Rapier more than 10\r\ndays after it was originally sent.  However, the letter mailed to\r\nMBS's JoAnn Barato-Mills arrived in her hands just one business day\r\nafter it was mailed (the letter was mailed on Friday and arrived on\r\nMonday),  within the ordinary time period expected for delivery by\r\nmail.  Under these circumstances, Emergency Medicine retained the\r\nbenefit of the mailbox rule despite the improper address, and this\r\nsecond letter placed Rapier on written notice of Emergency\r\nMedicine's intent to terminate the Agreement before it\r\nautomatically renewed for a third year.  Therefore, we conclude\r\nthat Emergency Medicine provided Rapier with four months written\r\nnotice of its intent to terminate as required under the Agreement.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
