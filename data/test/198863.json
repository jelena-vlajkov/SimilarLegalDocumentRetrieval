Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Gerald M. Brown, Jr. on brief pro se.\n     Sheldon Whitehouse, Attorney General, and Elisabeth A.\nWallace, Special Assistant Attorney General, on Memorandum in\nSupport of their Motion to Dismiss or to Summarily Affirm the\nJudgment Below, for appellees.\n\f                                   March 24, 2000\n\n\n                  Per Curiam.      After the district court denied his\n\n petition for habeas corpus relief from his conviction, state\n\n prisoner          Brown   filed    a   complaint      attacking   the     same\n\n conviction by seeking damages, declaratory and injunctive\n\n relief against named defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n Following a hearing on defendants' motion to dismiss, the\n\n magistrate recommended a dismissal and the district court\n\n agreed.          Plaintiff appeals.\n\n                  Reviewing the dismissal de novo, we affirm.            Habeas\n\n corpus is the exclusive avenue of relief for a state prisoner\n\n seeking release from confinement, so plaintiff's claims for\n\n injunctive relief must be dismissed.                  Heck v. Humphrey, 512\n\n U.S. 477, 480 (1994) (explaining Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411\n\n U.S. 475 (1973)).            The claims for declaratory relief and\n\n damages also must be dismissed because the judgment plaintiff\n\n seeks       \"would    necessarily       imply   the     invalidity   of    his\n\n conviction,\" and he has not demonstrated that the conviction\n\n has       been    invalidated     by   any   proper    state   authority    or\n\n tribunal, nor has he obtained a federal writ of habeas\n\n corpus.1         Heck, 512 U.S. at 487.\n\n\n       1\n     In a separate order issued today, this court also denies a\ncertificate of appealability to challenge the dismissal of\nplaintiff's habeas petition.\n\f           We need not reach the merits of the claims because\n\nthis suit is not cognizable in federal court.               White v.\n\nGittens, 121 F.3d 803, 805 (1st Cir. 1997).         The judgment is\n\naffirmed   but   modified   to   reflect   that   the   dismissal   is\n\nwithout prejudice.      Id. at 806.        Appellant's \"motion to\n\nproduce\" is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
