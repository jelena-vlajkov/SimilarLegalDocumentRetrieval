Jesús A. Castellanos, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jane Becker Whitaker, with whom Troncoso & Becker was on\nbrief, for appellants.\n\n     Vanessa-Viera Rabelo, with whom Jeannette López-de Victoria\nand Pinto-Lugo & Rivera were on brief, for appellees.\n\f                          August 28, 2000\n\n\n            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.         Beneath the surface of this\n\nseemingly    simple   case,   there       are   issues   of   considerable\n\ncomplexity and import.    Strikingly, they were largely missed by\n\nthe parties.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            The plaintiffs, Donald Parker, his wife, their conjugal\n\npartnership,    and   their   two     daughters     (collectively,    the\n\n\"Parkers\"), brought suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico, seeking compensatory damages under\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12101 et seq., and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code,\n\n31 L.P.R.A. § 5141, for injuries suffered by Parker when his\n\nwheelchair overturned during a visit to the University of Puerto\n\nRico's Botanical Gardens.      After the Parkers concluded their\n\ncase-in-chief during a jury trial, the magistrate judge granted\n\njudgment as a matter of law in favor of the University and the\n\nother named defendants, concluding that the Parkers had failed\n\nto present sufficient evidence to establish that Parker had been\n\ndiscriminated against by reason of his disability.\n\n            Our review of the district court's ruling requires us\n\nto examine in some detail the requirements imposed by the ADA on\n\n                                    -2-\n\fpublic entities.          Finding the evidence sufficient to make out a\n\nprima facie case under the ADA, we vacate the judgment against\n\nthe   Parkers       and   remand        to   the    district      court     for   further\n\nproceedings.             To     avoid    any       misunderstandings         about      the\n\nsignificance        of    our    decision,       we     also    note   briefly     at   the\n\nconclusion of the decision two legal issues never addressed by\n\nthe parties:        (1) whether Title II of the ADA permits plaintiffs\n\nto recover compensatory damages for a personal injury that\n\nresults from a structural defect in a public facility which\n\nprevented the access of a disabled person to the services,\n\nprograms,      or    activities         of   a     public      entity;    and     (2)   the\n\npossibility of an Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity defense\n\nfor the University.\n\n                                             II.\n\n              We present the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe Parkers, the party opposing judgment as a matter of law.\n\nSee   Lynch v. City of Boston, 180 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThe Botanical Gardens of the University of Puerto Rico comprise\n\n300   acres    of    flora      that     serve     as    a     laboratory   for    study,\n\nresearch, and conservation, and are also open to the general\n\npublic for recreational use.                 The Girl Scouts of America hosted\n\nan awards ceremony at the Monet Garden, a site within the\n\nBotanical Gardens that recreates the original Monet Garden in\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fGiverny, France.          Parker and his wife, María Jesusa Vázquez,\n\ndecided    to    attend    the   ceremony    because      they    and   their   two\n\ndaughters were active in the Girl Scouts.              A prior stroke having\n\nleft Parker without the use of his legs, he planned to move\n\nabout the park using his motorized wheelchair.\n\n            Upon arrival at the park's front gate, park officials\n\ntold    Parker    and     Vázquez   that    there    was    handicap      parking\n\navailable.       The park officials instructed those planning to\n\nattend the Girl Scout ceremony to proceed to the Monet Garden.\n\nParker and Vázquez then drove to the parking lot adjacent to the\n\npark's    entrance.       Finding   that    lot   full,    they    proceeded     to\n\nanother parking area closer to their final destination in the\n\npark.     Vázquez asked park security guards to help unload her\n\nhusband's wheelchair from the van, and the guards obliged.\n\nRealizing that Parker and Vázquez were headed to the Monet\n\nGarden, one of the guards indicated that there was a pathway\n\n\"over there.\"\n\n            Parker took that path and descended toward the Monet\n\nGarden, Vázquez walking several steps in front to guide him, as\n\nwas her custom.         Parker noticed that the path had loose gravel\n\non it and was not designed to be a handicapped ramp.                    As Parker\n\nneared the bottom of the path, his wheelchair flipped and he\n\nlanded on his right side.           Although Parker could not say what\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fcaused his fall, and the Parkers presented no eyewitness account\n\nof the fall, Vázquez testified that she immediately turned\n\naround and noticed that there was a two-inch dropoff to the\n\nground at the end of the paved path at the place where her\n\nhusband had fallen and that, in her opinion, this two-inch\n\ndropoff     caused     the   fall.         After    getting     back    into   his\n\nwheelchair, Parker stayed to attend the awards ceremony, and\n\nthen left the Monet Garden by a different path.\n\n            Parker subsequently went to the hospital where it was\n\ndetermined that he had broken his clavicle as a result of the\n\naccident.     Prior to the accident, Parker had labored for two\n\nyears in physical therapy to regain the use of his right arm\n\nafter his debilitating stroke.                 Through his effort, he had\n\nrecovered to the point where he was able to dress himself and to\n\nuse the bathroom without his wife's assistance.                 The accident at\n\nthe Monet Garden destroyed all the progress Parker had made\n\nsince his stroke, rendering his right arm once again useless.\n\n            The Parkers filed suit against the University and the\n\nother named defendants primarily seeking compensatory damages\n\nfor   injuries    suffered     as    a    result    of   Parker's      fall.    In\n\nparticular,      the   complaint         asserted   that      the   University's\n\n\"failure to remedy its violations of the ADA, inter alia, the\n\nlack of signage, the failure to make all ramps flush to the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fground,      and    the    [park    guard's]         instructions       to    use     the\n\nnoncompliant ramp, provide the Parkers with a cause of action\n\nfor all remedies available in law and equity.\"                        At trial, five\n\nwitnesses      testified     for     the      Parkers:       Donald   Parker,       María\n\nVázquez, their two daughters, and Julie Escudero, a friend of\n\nthe Parkers who attended the Girl Scout event with her disabled\n\nson.     Of these witnesses, only Parker, Vázquez, and Escudero\n\nwere present at the park on the day of the accident.                          Escudero\n\ntestified that she and her son, who was disabled and used a\n\nwheelchair, had reached the Monet Garden using a different route\n\nthan   the    one    traveled      by   Mr.      Parker.        After   the    Parkers\n\nconcluded      their      case-in-chief,         the    district      court    granted\n\njudgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants.                              This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                         III.\n\n                           A.   Title II of the ADA\n\n              Congress     enacted      the    ADA     \"to    provide   a    clear    and\n\ncomprehensive        national       mandate          for      the    elimination       of\n\ndiscrimination       against       individuals         with    disabilities.\"          42\n\nU.S.C.    §    12101(b)(1).             Title      I    of     the    ADA    prohibits\n\ndiscrimination in employment.                    See id. § 12112.            Title III\n\nprohibits discrimination in access to public accommodations like\n\nhotels, restaurants, and theaters.                     See id. §§ 12182, 12184.\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fTitle II, the provision at issue here, prohibits discrimination\n\nagainst persons with disabilities by \"public entities,\"1 and is\n\nmodeled on § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Pub. L. No. 93-112,\n\n87 Stat. 355 (1973) (codified as amended in scattered sections\n\nof 29       U.S.C.). 2        In applying Title II, therefore, we rely\n\ninterchangeably on decisional law applying § 504.                  See Theriault\n\nv. Flynn, 162 F.3d 46, 48 n.3 (1st Cir. 1998); Gorman v. Bartch,\n\n152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998).\n\n              Title II incorporates by reference the enforcement\n\nscheme found in § 505 of the Rehabilitation Act.                   See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12133. Section 505, in turn, authorizes \"any person aggrieved\n\nby    any    act   or    failure    to   act\"     to   obtain   the   \"remedies,\n\nprocedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct    of     1964      [42    U.S.C.    §     2000d   et   seq.    (prohibiting\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin\n\nin any program receiving Federal financial assistance)]\"                      29\n\n\n\n\n      1   A \"public entity\" includes \"any department, agency,\nspecial purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or\nStates or local government.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B).        The\nUniversity of Puerto Rico does not contest that it is a \"public\nentity.\"\n      2   Title II essentially extends the reach of § 504 to\nstate and local governmental entities that do not receive\nfederal financial assistance. See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (limiting\nscope of the Rehabilitation Act to entities receiving Federal\nfunds).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fU.S.C. § 794a(a)(2).3               Although Title VI does not expressly\n\nauthorize a private cause of action, the Supreme Court has found\n\nan implied private cause of action under that statute.                        See\n\ngenerally Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582\n\n(1983).\n\n                     B.    Requisites of a Title II Claim\n\n               Our task in construing Title II's applicability in the\n\ncase at hand is a difficult one.                 Although Title II of the ADA\n\ntook       effect   on    January    26,   1992,4   there   is   sparse   caselaw\n\ninterpreting its scope and limits.                See Accessibility Under the\n\nAmericans With Disabilities Act and Other Laws 118 (Earl B.\n\nSlavitt & Donna J. Pugh eds., ABA 2000) (noting that few cases\n\nhave been decided to date under either Title II or Title III of\n\nthe ADA).       Neither party directs us to any case in which Title\n\nII has supported a claim for damages resulting from a personal\n\ninjury to a disabled person that occurred at a location operated\n\nby a public entity.          Our research likewise has produced no case\n\ndirectly on point.\n\n\n       3  Another part of § 505 applies in cases of employment\ndiscrimination and adopts by reference Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. See 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(1).\n       4  With certain exceptions, Titles I and II took effect\non January 26, 1992, and Title III took effect on July 26, 1990.\nSee 5 Cook & Sobieski, Civil Rights Actions ¶ 22A.02, at 22A-26,\n22A-28 (2000); First Bank Nat. Assoc. v. FDIC, 79 F.3d 362, 371\nn.9 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                                           -8-\n\f            We begin our analysis with the language of the statute.\n\nTitle II provides, inter alia, that\n\n            no qualified individual with a disability\n            shall, by reason of such disability, be\n            excluded from participation in or be denied\n            the benefits of the services, programs, or\n            activities of a public entity, or be\n            subjected to discrimination by any such\n            entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.     Pursuant to the plain language of Title II,\n\na   plaintiff   must   establish:   (1)    that       he   is   a   qualified\n\nindividual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded\n\nfrom participation in or denied the benefits of some public\n\nentity's services, programs, or activities or was otherwise\n\ndiscriminated against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of\n\nbenefits, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff's\n\ndisability.     The University does not dispute that Parker is a\n\n\"qualified individual with a disability.\"              See id. § 12131(2)\n\n(defining    \"qualified   individual      with    a   disability\"      as   an\n\n\"individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable\n\nmodifications . . . meets the essential eligibility requirements\n\nfor the receipt of services or the participation in programs or\n\nactivities provided by a public entity\").              To the extent that\n\nthe alleged defect in the path prevented Parker from using his\n\nwheelchair to access the Monet         Garden safely, it is self-\n\nevident that it did so \"by reason of\" his disability.\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f               That    leaves   us   to   decide   whether   the   Parkers\n\nestablished a prima facie case that Parker was denied access to\n\nthe University's \"services, programs, or activities\" within the\n\nmeaning of Title II. Having examined the duties imposed by Title\n\nII on public entities and the evidence presented by the Parkers,\n\nwe conclude that they did so.\n\n               C.     A Public Entity's Duties Under The ADA\n\n               The language of Title II does not elaborate on the\n\nobligation of a public entity to an individual with a disability\n\nin the provision of \"services, programs, or activities.\" We must\n\nrely for specifics on the regulations promulgated under Title\n\nII.5       The core \"accessibility\" standard set forth in Title II's\n\nregulations provides:\n\n               [N]o qualified individual with a disability\n               shall, because a public entity's facilities\n               are   inaccessible   to  or   unusable   by\n               individuals with disabilities, be excluded\n               from participation in, or be denied the\n               benefits of the services, programs, or\n               activities of a public entity, or be\n               subjected to discrimination by any public\n               entity.\n\n\n\n\n       5  Because Congress explicitly authorized the Attorney\nGeneral to promulgate regulations under the ADA, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12134(a), the regulations \"must [be given] legislative and\nhence controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious,\nor plainly contrary to the statute,\" United States v. Morton,\n467 U.S. 822, 834 (1984).\n\n                                     -10-\n\f28 C.F.R. § 35.149.             A public entity must make its service,\n\nprogram, or activity \"when viewed in its entirety,\" \"readily\n\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\" id.\n\n§   35.150(a),     except       where      compliance   would    result    in    a\n\n\"fundamental      alteration\"         or     an   \"undue   burden,\"       id.    §\n\n35.150(a)(3) (stating that the public entity has the burden of\n\nproving that compliance would require a \"fundamental alteration\"\n\nor \"undue burden\").          A public entity must \"give priority to\n\nthose methods that offer services, programs, and activities . .\n\n.   in   the   most      integrated        setting   appropriate.\"         Id.   §\n\n34.150(b)(1).         The public entity must also provide notice to\n\nindividuals      with    disabilities        of   the   \"protections      against\n\ndiscrimination assured them,\" id. § 35.106, and \"disseminate\n\nsufficient information\" to those individuals \"to inform them of\n\nthe rights and protections afforded by the ADA,\" 56 Fed. Reg.\n\n35694,   35702    (1991).         All      together,    \"the    program   access\n\nrequirement      of     title    II     should    enable   individuals       with\n\ndisabilities to participate in and benefit from the services,\n\nprograms, or activities of public entities in all but the most\n\nunusual cases.\"         Id. at 35708.\n\n           Addressing       specifically          access   to    an   \"existing\n\nfacility,\" the regulations give a high priority to mobility for\n\npersons in wheelchairs.

No. 101-485\n\n(1990), pt. 2, at 84.\n\n            Unlike Title III, however, which requires removal of\n\narchitectural barriers whenever to do so would be \"readily\n\nachievable,\"       28   C.F.R.   §   36.304,    a   public    entity      \"is    not\n\nrequired to make structural changes in existing facilities where\n\nother methods are effective in achieving compliance,\"                       id. §\n\n\n\n\n       6  Title III's regulations similarly emphasize \"installing\nramps,\" and \"making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrances.\" 28\nC.F.R. § 36.304.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f35.150(b)(1).7     If one facility is inaccessible, for example, a\n\npubic entity can achieve compliance with the ADA by moving its\n\nservices, programs, or activities to another facility that is\n\naccessible.      See United States Dep't of Justice, The Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act: Title II Technical Assistance Manual 10,\n\n19 (1992).       Title II's emphasis on \"program accessibility\"\n\nrather than \"facilities accessibility\" was intended to ensure\n\nbroad   access   to   public   services,   while,   at   the   same   time,\n\nproviding public entities with the flexibility to choose how\n\nbest to make access available.      See Accessibility Under the ADA,\n\nat 53-54; 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A § 35.150              (stating that\n\n\n\n    7      By contrast, Title II's regulations governing \"new\nconstruction and alterations\" provide that \"[n]ewly constructed\nor altered street level pedestrian walkways must contain curb\nramps or other sloped areas at intersections to streets, roads,\nor highways.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(e)(2).       In completing new\nconstruction or alterations, public entities may comply with one\nof two sets of technical accessibility standards: (1) the\nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS),      promulgated\nunder § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or (2) the Americans with\nDisabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and\nFacilities (ADAAG), accompanying Title III. See Accessibility\nUnder the ADA, supra, at 87-88.        The ADAAG provides, for\nexample, that any part of an access route with a slope greater\nthan 1:20 \"shall be considered a ramp,\" and such ramps \"shall\nhave level landings at the bottom and top.\" See 28 C.F.R. pt.\n36, App. A , at 4.8. They further state that \"Curb ramps\" should\nbe provided where access routes cross curbs, and \"transitions\nfrom ramps to walks, gutters, or streets shall be flush and free\nfrom abrupt changes.\" Id. at 4.7. We focus in this case on the\nregulations governing existing structures because the Parkers\npresented no evidence that the path at issue was newly\nconstructed or altered.\n\n                                  -13-\n\funder Title II, \"the concept of program access will continue to\n\napply with respect to facilities now in existence, because the\n\ncost of retrofitting existing facilities is often prohibitive\").\n\n\n\n            Pursuant to these requirements, the University was\n\nobligated to ensure that each service, program, or activity at\n\nthe   Botanical   Gardens    \"when   viewed   in   its   entirety,\"   was\n\naccessible to individuals with disabilities.         One purpose of the\n\nBotanical Gardens is to serve as a venue for group events.            The\n\nUniversity holds open the Monet Garden as a place for group\n\nconvocations, like the Girl Scouts awards ceremony that Parker\n\nattended.    The University, therefore, has a duty to make the\n\nMonet Garden \"readily accessible\" to and \"usable\" by individuals\n\nwith disabilities.    Such access must be provided in the \"most\n\nintegrated setting appropriate,\" meaning that the University has\n\nan obligation to ensure that individuals with disabilities--such\n\nas persons using wheelchairs--can travel to and from the Monet\n\nGarden using safe walkways, ramps, and curb cuts.          Although the\n\nUniversity is not required to make every passageway in and out\n\nof the Monet Garden accessible, it must provide at least one\n\nroute that a person in a wheelchair can use to reach the Monet\n\nGarden safely, absent a defense that excuses such performance.\n\n                     D.     The Parkers' Evidence\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f            Although Parker could not say what caused his fall, and\n\nthe   Parkers      presented   no    eyewitness       account,   Vázquez    and\n\nEscudero testified that the fall occurred at the spot on the\n\npath where it dropped two inches abruptly to the ground below.\n\nA   jury   could    infer   that    this    dropoff    caused    Mr.   Parker's\n\nwheelchair to overturn, or forced Parker to alter his course\n\ndown the path in such a way that caused his fall.                 Wheelchairs\n\ndo not typically overturn without some intervening cause.\n\n            A jury could also conclude that Parker was using the\n\npath intended for wheelchair use.            A park guard directed Parker\n\nto use the path at issue, after seeing that Parker would be\n\ntraveling by wheelchair.       Although there were at least two other\n\nroutes to the Monet Garden, there were no signs or other notices\n\nindicating that wheelchair users should take these other paths.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a jury could conclude that the two-\n\ninch dropoff at the end of the paved path denied Parker safe\n\naccess to the Monet Garden and caused his fall and injury.\n\n            In considering the defenses that the University could\n\noffer in response to this prima facie case, we first note that\n\nthe claim under Title II is similar in many respects to a tort\n\nclaim.     See   Pandazides v. Virginia Bd. of Educ., 13 F.3d 823,\n\n829 (4th Cir. 1994) (stating that a private cause of action\n\nunder § 504, \"is essentially a form of statutory tort\"); Wolsky\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fv. Medical College of Hampton Roads, 1 F.3d 222, 224 (4th Cir.\n\n1993) (\"Rehabilitation Act claims are injuries to individuals\n\nand analogous to personal injury claims.\"); Smith v. Barton, 914\n\nF.2d 1330, 1337 (9th Cir. 1990) (noting that although there were\n\nno discrimination actions at common law, a discrimination action\n\nunder the Rehabilitation Act \"is most closely analogous to an\n\n18th-century tort action or an action brought to enforce an\n\nexpress or implied employment contract\").    In most instances,\n\nthe injury alleged pursuant to Title II of the ADA is exclusion\n\nfrom participation in, or the denial of the benefits of the\n\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, because of\n\ndiscrimination against a person by reason of disability.   See,\n\ne.g., Easley v. Snider, 36 F.3d 297 (3d Cir. 1994) (seeking to\n\nenjoin state to include persons with certain types of mental\n\ndisabilities in state home care program); Kinney v. Yerusalim,\n\n9 F.3d 1067 (3d Cir. 1993) (seeking to enjoin municipality to\n\ninstall curb cuts as part of street resurfacing plan); Concerned\n\nParents to Save Dreher Park Ctr. v. City of West Palm Beach, 846\n\nF. Supp. 986 (S.D. Fla. 1994) (seeking to enjoin municipality\n\nfrom eliminating certain recreational programs for disabled\n\npersons).   Here, however, the injury alleged includes physical\n\ninjury as well as the denial of access to a public facility.\n\n\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f            Nevertheless, the inclusion of a physical injury in the\n\nTitle II claim does not convert the claim into a traditional\n\nnegligence action premised on the violation of a duty owed by a\n\nlandowner    such    as   the   University   to   members   of   the   public\n\ngenerally who are invited on to the premises.                    The primary\n\ninjury alleged and proven under Title II in a case such as this\n\nremains the alleged violation by the University of its statutory\n\nduty to disabled persons to prevent the discriminatory denial of\n\naccess to a service, program, or activity.            The physical injury\n\nis an additional consequence of the violation of that statutory\n\nduty, which is of a different character than a duty owed to the\n\ngeneral population.        That is, the University does not satisfy\n\nthe duties imposed by Title II merely by exercising reasonable\n\ncare to protect persons with disabilities, along with other\n\nmembers   of   the    public,     from   dangerous   conditions        on   the\n\npremises.      Rather, the University must act affirmatively to\n\neliminate barriers on the premises that would otherwise serve to\n\ndeny persons with disabilities access to services, programs, or\n\nactivities of the University--here, access to the Monet Garden.\n\n\n\n            Given that the liability issue under Title II is a\n\ndiscriminatory denial of access, not negligence, the University\n\ncould rebut the prima facie case of the Parkers by showing that\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fdisabled persons using wheelchairs were not denied access to the\n\nMonet Garden.        For example, the University could have produced\n\nevidence that, irrespective of the accident on this occasion,\n\nthe path at issue was actually safe for wheelchair use, thereby\n\nsuggesting     that    the    fall   resulted   from   Mr.       Parker's   own\n\nnegligence rather than a denial of access to disabled persons.\n\nThe University might have established that there was another\n\npath to the Monet Garden that was safe for wheelchair use,\n\nproperly noted with signs, but Parker and Vázquez missed the\n\nsigns and misconstrued the signal of the park guard.                 Finally,\n\nthe   University      could   have   argued   that   providing     wheelchair\n\naccess    to   the    Monet   Garden    would   require      a   \"fundamental\n\nalteration\" or \"undue burden.\"\n\n           These defenses were never offered because the trial\n\ncourt never required the defendants to defend.               That ruling was\n\nerroneous and it requires us to vacate and remand.\n\n\n\n                                       IV.\n\n           As we noted earlier, there were two important legal\n\nissues relevant to this lawsuit that were never raised by the\n\nparties below or on appeal.            We raise them here to avoid any\n\nsuggestion that our decision implies a resolution of these\n\nissues.    We express no opinion on the merits.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f          Although    Title   II   does   not   expressly   authorize   a\n\nprivate cause of action, it adopts the remedial scheme of Title\n\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, under which there is an\n\nimplied private cause of action.          See Guardians, 463 U.S. at\n\n594-95.   However, \"the question of what remedies are available\n\nunder a statute that provides a private right of action is\n\n'analytically distinct' from the issue of whether such a right\n\nexists in the first place.\"        Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public\n\nSchools, 503 U.S. 60, 65066 (1992).        Neither the Supreme Court\n\nnor this circuit has decided whether compensatory damages (other\n\nthan backpay) are available under § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct or Title II.     See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465\n\nU.S. 624, 630-31, 631 n.9, 637 (1984).8 The defendants, however,\n\nhave failed to contest the availability of compensatory damages\n\nunder Title II, either before the district court or on appeal.\n\nThey have waived the right to raise that issue as a defense\n\nduring the retrial.    cf. United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546,\n\n554 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell\n\nout his arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold\n\nhis peace.\").\n\n\n\n    8     A plaintiff may sue under § 504, and hence also under\nTitle II, for discriminatory treatment in employment, and, in\nthat context, might seek backpay. See Consolidated Rail, 465\nU.S. at 630.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f         We also note that the University may have an Eleventh\n\nAmendment sovereign immunity defense.   See University of Alabama\n\nat Birmingham Bd. of Trustees v. Garrett, 120 S. Ct. 1669 (April\n\n17, 2000) (granting certiorari to address whether states have\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity from claims brought under the ADA);\n\nKimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000) (holding\n\nthat Congress lacks power to abrogate state sovereign immunity\n\nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).    However, the\n\nUniversity did not raise the defense in the trial court, has not\n\nargued it on appeal, and we decline to address it sua sponte.\n\nSee Wisconsin Dep't of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U.S. 381, 388\n\n(1998) (\"Unless the State raises [sovereign immunity], a court\n\ncan ignore it.\").\n\n         We leave to the district court the question of whether\n\nsovereign immunity can be raised in subsequent proceedings.   If\n\nthe University asserts this defense, the district court would\n\nthen have to determine several questions, including whether the\n\nassertion was timely, cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 414 U.S. 651 (1974)\n\n(noting that sovereign immunity can be raised for the first time\n\nin the Court of Appeals), and whether the state effectively\n\nwaived the defense through the University's appearance in the\n\nfirst trial, cf. Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 396 n.2 (1975)\n\n(noting that question of whether state waives sovereign immunity\n\n\n                             -20-\n\f\"by entering a voluntary appearance and defending a suit on the\n\nmerits\" is one of state law); Justino v. Zayas, 875 F.2d 986,\n\n993 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that waiver by appearance is not\n\nreadily assumed).     Finally, the court would have to consider\n\nwhether   the   University   of   Puerto   Rico   is   an   arm   of   the\n\nCommonwealth for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity.              See\n\n13 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3524, at\n\n145, 160-62 (1984) (noting that most state universities are\n\n\"considered arms of the state and therefore immune\").\n\n          Vacated and remanded to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f",

After the Parkers concluded their case-in-chief during a jury trial, the magistrate judge granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the University and the other named defendants, concluding that the Parkers had failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that Parker had been discriminated against by reason of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's ruling requires us to examine in some detail the requirements imposed by the ADA on public entities. Finding the evidence sufficient to make out a prima facie case under the ADA, we vacate the judgment against the Parkers and remand to the district court for further proceedings. To avoid any misunderstandings about the significance of our decision, we also note briefly at the conclusion of the decision two legal issues never addressed by the parties: (1) whether Title II of the ADA permits plaintiffs to recover compensatory damages for a personal injury that results from a structural defect in a public facility which prevented the access of a disabled person to the services, programs, or activities of a public entity; and (2) the possibility of an Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity defense for the University.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the evidence in the light most favorable to the Parkers, the party opposing judgment as a matter of law. See Lynch v. City of Boston, 180 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1999). The Botanical Gardens of the University of Puerto Rico comprise 300 acres of flora that serve as a laboratory for study, research, and conservation, and are also open to the general public for recreational use. The Girl Scouts of America hosted an awards ceremony at the Monet Garden, a site within the Botanical Gardens that recreates the original Monet Garden in Giverny, France. Parker and his wife, Mara Jesusa Vaazquez, decided to attend the ceremony because they and their two daughters were active in the Girl Scouts. A prior stroke having left Parker without the use of his legs, he planned to move about the park using his motorized wheelchair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arrival at the park's front gate, park officials told Parker and Vaazquez that there was handicap parking available. The park officials instructed those planning to attend the Girl Scout ceremony to proceed to the Monet Garden. Parker and Vaazquez then drove to the parking lot adjacent to the park's entrance. Finding that lot full, they proceeded to another parking area closer to their final destination in the park. Vaazquez asked park security guards to help unload her husband's wheelchair from the van, and the guards obliged. Realizing that Parker and Vaazquez were headed to the Monet Garden, one of the guards indicated that there was a pathway \"over there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker took that path and descended toward the Monet Garden, Vaazquez walking several steps in front to guide him, as was her custom. Parker noticed that the path had loose gravel on it and was not designed to be a handicapped ramp. As Parker neared the bottom of the path, his wheelchair flipped and he landed on his right side. Although Parker could not say what caused his fall, and the Parkers presented no eyewitness account of the fall, Vaazquez testified that she immediately turned around and noticed that there was a two-inch dropoff to the ground at the end of the paved path at the place where her husband had fallen and that, in her opinion, this two-inch dropoff caused the fall. After getting back into his wheelchair, Parker stayed to attend the awards ceremony, and then left the Monet Garden by a different path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker subsequently went to the hospital where it was determined that he had broken his clavicle as a result of the accident. Prior to the accident, Parker had labored for two years in physical therapy to regain the use of his right arm after his debilitating stroke. Through his effort, he had recovered to the point where he was able to dress himself and to use the bathroom without his wife's assistance. The accident at the Monet Garden destroyed all the progress Parker had made since his stroke, rendering his right arm once again useless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Parkers filed suit against the University and the other named defendants primarily seeking compensatory damages for injuries suffered as a result of Parker's fall. In particular, the complaint asserted that the University's \"failure to remedy its violations of the ADA, inter alia, the lack of signage, the failure to make all ramps flush to the ground, and the [park guard's] instructions to use the noncompliant ramp, provide the Parkers with a cause of action for all remedies available in law and equity.\" At trial, five witnesses testified for the Parkers: Donald Parker, Mara Vaazquez, their two daughters, and Julie Escudero, a friend of the Parkers who attended the Girl Scout event with her disabled son. Of these witnesses, only Parker, Vaazquez, and Escudero were present at the park on the day of the accident. Escudero testified that she and her son, who was disabled and used a wheelchair, had reached the Monet Garden using a different route than the one traveled by Mr. Parker. After the Parkers concluded their case-in-chief, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Title II of the ADA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the ADA \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(b)(1). Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination in employment. See id. &#167; 12112. Title III prohibits discrimination in access to public accommodations like hotels, restaurants, and theaters. See id. &#167;&#167; 12182, 12184. Title II, the provision at issue here, prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities by \"public entities,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and is modeled on &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Pub.

See Theriault v. Flynn, 162 F.3d 46, 48 n.3 (1st Cir. 1998); Gorman v.

Section 505, in turn, authorizes \"any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act\" to obtain the \"remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d et seq. (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program receiving Federal financial assistance)]\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794a(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although Title VI does not expressly authorize a private cause of action, the Supreme Court has found an implied private cause of action under that statute. See generally Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Requisites of a Title II Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task in construing Title II's applicability in the case at hand is a difficult one. Although Title II of the ADA took effect on January 26, 1992,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> there is sparse caselaw interpreting its scope and limits. See Accessibility Under the Americans With Disabilities Act and Other Laws 118 (Earl B. Slavitt &amp; Donna J. Pugh eds., ABA 2000) (noting that few cases have been decided to date under either Title II or Title III of the ADA). Neither party directs us to any case in which Title II has supported a claim for damages resulting from a personal injury to a disabled person that occurred at a location operated by a public entity. Our research likewise has produced no case directly on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Title II provides, inter alia, thatno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132. Pursuant to the plain language of Title II, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of some public entity's services, programs, or activities or was otherwise discriminated against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff's disability. The University does not dispute that Parker is a \"qualified individual with a disability.\" See id. &#167; 12131(2) (defining \"qualified individual with a disability\" as an \"individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications . . . meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity\"). To the extent that the alleged defect in the path prevented Parker from using his wheelchair to access the Monet Garden safely, it is self-evident that it did so \"by reason of\" his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves us to decide whether the Parkers established a prima facie case that Parker was denied access to the University's \"services, programs, or activities\" within the meaning of Title II. Having examined the duties imposed by Title II on public entities and the evidence presented by the Parkers, we conclude that they did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. A Public Entity's Duties Under The ADA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of Title II does not elaborate on the obligation of a public entity to an individual with a disability in the provision of \"services, programs, or activities.\" We must rely for specifics on the regulations promulgated under Title II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The core \"accessibility\" standard set forth in Title II's regulations provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, because a public entity's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.149. A public entity must make its service, program, or activity \"when viewed in its entirety,\" \"readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\" id. &#167; 35.150(a), except where compliance would result in a \"fundamental alteration\" or an \"undue burden,\" id. &#167; 35.150(a)(3) (stating that the public entity has the burden of proving that compliance would require a \"fundamental alteration\" or \"undue burden\"). A public entity must \"give priority to those methods that offer services, programs, and activities . . . in the most integrated setting appropriate.\" Id. &#167; 34.150(b)(1). The public entity must also provide notice to individuals with disabilities of the \"protections against discrimination assured them,\" id. &#167; 35.106, and \"disseminate sufficient information\" to those individuals \"to inform them of the rights and protections afforded by the ADA,\" 56 Fed. Reg. 35694, 35702 (1991). All together, \"the program access requirement of title II should enable individuals with disabilities to participate in and benefit from the services, programs, or activities of public entities in all but the most unusual cases.\" Id. at 35708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addressing specifically access to an \"existing facility,\" the regulations give a high priority to mobility for persons in wheelchairs. If \"structural changes\" are necessary to achieve compliance, the regulations provide that \"such changes shall be made within three years of January 26, 1992,\" 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.150(c), and an entity employing more than 50 persons must detail its planned structural changes in a \"transition plan,\" id. &#167; 35.150(d)(1). \"If a public entity has responsibility or authority over streets, roads, or walkways, its transition plan shall include a schedule for providing curb ramps or other sloped areas where pedestrian walks cross curbs . . . .\" Id. &#167; 35.150(d)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Congress emphasized in enacting the ADA that \"[t]he employment, transportation, and public accommodations sections of [the ADA] would be meaningless if people who use wheelchairs were not afforded the opportunity to travel on and between the streets.\" H. Rep. No. 101-485 (1990), pt. 2, at 84, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 303, 367.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Title III, however, which requires removal of architectural barriers whenever to do so would be \"readily achievable,\" 28 C.F.R. &#167; 36.304, a public entity \"is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance,\" id. &#167; 35.150(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> If one facility is inaccessible, for example, a pubic entity can achieve compliance with the ADA by moving its services, programs, or activities to another facility that is accessible. See United States Dep't of Justice, The Americans with Disabilities Act: Title II Technical Assistance Manual 10, 19 (1992). Title II's emphasis on \"program accessibility\" rather than \"facilities accessibility\" was intended to ensure broad access to public services, while, at the same time, providing public entities with the flexibility to choose how best to make access available. See Accessibility Under the ADA, at 53-54; 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A &#167; 35.150 (stating that under Title II, \"the concept of program access will continue to apply with respect to facilities now in existence, because the cost of retrofitting existing facilities is often prohibitive\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to these requirements, the University was obligated to ensure that each service, program, or activity at the Botanical Gardens \"when viewed in its entirety,\" was accessible to individuals with disabilities. One purpose of the Botanical Gardens is to serve as a venue for group events. The University holds open the Monet Garden as a place for group convocations, like the Girl Scouts awards ceremony that Parker attended. The University, therefore, has a duty to make the Monet Garden \"readily accessible\" to and \"usable\" by individuals with disabilities. Such access must be provided in the \"most integrated setting appropriate,\" meaning that the University has an obligation to ensure that individuals with disabilities--such as persons using wheelchairs--can travel to and from the Monet Garden using safe walkways, ramps, and curb cuts. Although the University is not required to make every passageway in and out of the Monet Garden accessible, it must provide at least one route that a person in a wheelchair can use to reach the Monet Garden safely, absent a defense that excuses such performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Parkers' Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Parker could not say what caused his fall, and the Parkers presented no eyewitness account, Vaazquez and Escudero testified that the fall occurred at the spot on the path where it dropped two inches abruptly to the ground below. A jury could infer that this dropoff caused Mr. Parker's wheelchair to overturn, or forced Parker to alter his course down the path in such a way that caused his fall. Wheelchairs do not typically overturn without some intervening cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could also conclude that Parker was using the path intended for wheelchair use. A park guard directed Parker to use the path at issue, after seeing that Parker would be traveling by wheelchair. Although there were at least two other routes to the Monet Garden, there were no signs or other notices indicating that wheelchair users should take these other paths. Under these circumstances, a jury could conclude that the two-inch dropoff at the end of the paved path denied Parker safe access to the Monet Garden and caused his fall and injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the defenses that the University could offer in response to this prima facie case, we first note that the claim under Title II is similar in many respects to a tort claim. See Pandazides v. Virginia Bd. of Educ., 13 F.3d 823, 829 (4th Cir. 1994) (stating that a private cause of action under &#167; 504, \"is essentially a form of statutory tort\"); Wolsky v. Medical College of Hampton Roads, 1 F.3d 222, 224 (4th Cir. 1993) (\"Rehabilitation Act claims are injuries to individuals and analogous to personal injury claims.\"); Smith v. Barton, 914 F.2d 1330, 1337 (9th Cir. 1990) (noting that although there were no discrimination actions at common law, a discrimination action under the Rehabilitation Act \"is most closely analogous to an 18th-century tort action or an action brought to enforce an express or implied employment contract\"). In most instances, the injury alleged pursuant to Title II of the ADA is exclusion from participation in, or the denial of the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, because of discrimination against a person by reason of disability. See, e.g., Easley v. Snider, 36 F.3d 297 (3d Cir. 1994) (seeking to enjoin state to include persons with certain types of mental disabilities in state home care program); Kinney v. Yerusalim, 9 F.3d 1067 (3d Cir. 1993) (seeking to enjoin municipality to install curb cuts as part of street resurfacing plan); Concerned Parents to Save Dreher Park Ctr. v. City of West Palm Beach, 846 F. Supp. 986 (S.D. Fla. 1994) (seeking to enjoin municipality from eliminating certain recreational programs for disabled persons). Here, however, the injury alleged includes physical injury as well as the denial of access to a public facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the inclusion of a physical injury in the Title II claim does not convert the claim into a traditional negligence action premised on the violation of a duty owed by a landowner such as the University to members of the public generally who are invited on to the premises. The primary injury alleged and proven under Title II in a case such as this remains the alleged violation by the University of its statutory duty to disabled persons to prevent the discriminatory denial of access to a service, program, or activity. The physical injury is an additional consequence of the violation of that statutory duty, which is of a different character than a duty owed to the general population. That is, the University does not satisfy the duties imposed by Title II merely by exercising reasonable care to protect persons with disabilities, along with other members of the public, from dangerous conditions on the premises. Rather, the University must act affirmatively to eliminate barriers on the premises that would otherwise serve to deny persons with disabilities access to services, programs, or activities of the University--here, access to the Monet Garden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the liability issue under Title II is a discriminatory denial of access, not negligence, the University could rebut the prima facie case of the Parkers by showing that disabled persons using wheelchairs were not denied access to the Monet Garden. For example, the University could have produced evidence that, irrespective of the accident on this occasion, the path at issue was actually safe for wheelchair use, thereby suggesting that the fall resulted from Mr. Parker's own negligence rather than a denial of access to disabled persons. The University might have established that there was another path to the Monet Garden that was safe for wheelchair use, properly noted with signs, but Parker and Vaazquez missed the signs and misconstrued the signal of the park guard. Finally, the University could have argued that providing wheelchair access to the Monet Garden would require a \"fundamental alteration\" or \"undue burden.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These defenses were never offered because the trial court never required the defendants to defend. That ruling was erroneous and it requires us to vacate and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted earlier, there were two important legal issues relevant to this lawsuit that were never raised by the parties below or on appeal. We raise them here to avoid any suggestion that our decision implies a resolution of these issues. We express no opinion on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Title II does not expressly authorize a private cause of action, it adopts the remedial scheme of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, under which there is an implied private cause of action. See Guardians, 463 U.S. at 594-95. However, \"the question of what remedies are available under a statute that provides a private right of action is 'analytically distinct' from the issue of whether such a right exists in the first place.\" Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 65066 (1992). Neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has decided whether compensatory damages (other than backpay) are available under &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or Title II. See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 630-31, 631 n.9, 637 (1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The defendants, however, have failed to contest the availability of compensatory damages under Title II, either before the district court or on appeal. They have waived the right to raise that issue as a defense during the retrial. cf. United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 554 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out his arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold his peace.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the University may have an Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity defense. See University of Alabama at Birmingham Bd. of Trustees v. Garrett, 120 S. Ct. 1669 (April 17, 2000) (granting certiorari to address whether states have Eleventh Amendment immunity from claims brought under the ADA); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000) (holding that Congress lacks power to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act). However, the University did not raise the defense in the trial court, has not argued it on appeal, and we decline to address it sua sponte. See Wisconsin Dep't of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U.S. 381, 388 (1998) (\"Unless the State raises [sovereign immunity], a court can ignore it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We leave to the district court the question of whether sovereign immunity can be raised in subsequent proceedings. If the University asserts this defense, the district court would then have to determine several questions, including whether the assertion was timely, cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 414 U.S. 651 (1974) (noting that sovereign immunity can be raised for the first time in the Court of Appeals), and whether the state effectively waived the defense through the University's appearance in the first trial, cf. Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 396 n.2 (1975) (noting that question of whether state waives sovereign immunity \"by entering a voluntary appearance and defending a suit on the merits\" is one of state law); Justino v. Zayas, 875 F.2d 986, 993 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that waiver by appearance is not readily assumed). Finally, the court would have to consider whether the University of Puerto Rico is an arm of the Commonwealth for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See 13 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3524, at 145, 160-62 (1984) (noting that most state universities are \"considered arms of the state and therefore immune\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A \"public entity\" includes \"any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12131(1)(B).

See Accessibility Under the ADA, supra, at 87-88. The ADAAG provides, for example, that any part of an access route with a slope greater than 1:20 \"shall be considered a ramp,\" and such ramps \"shall have level landings at the bottom and top.\" See 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, App. A, at 4.8.

After the Parkers concluded their case-in-chief during a jury trial, the magistrate judge granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the University and the other named defendants, concluding that the Parkers had failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that Parker had been discriminated against by reason of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's ruling requires us to examine in some detail the requirements imposed by the ADA on public entities.

To avoid any misunderstandings about the significance of our decision, we also note briefly at the conclusion of the decision two legal issues never addressed by the parties: (1) whether Title II of the ADA permits plaintiffs to recover compensatory damages for a personal injury that results from a structural defect in a public facility which prevented the access of a disabled person to the services, programs, or activities of a public entity; and (2) the possibility of an Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity defense for the University.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the evidence in the light most favorable to the Parkers, the party opposing judgment as a matter of law.

The Botanical Gardens of the University of Puerto Rico comprise 300 acres of flora that serve as a laboratory for study, research, and conservation, and are also open to the general public for recreational use. The Girl Scouts of America hosted an awards ceremony at the Monet Garden, a site within the Botanical Gardens that recreates the original Monet Garden in Giverny, France. Parker and his wife, Mara Jesusa Vaazquez, decided to attend the ceremony because they and their two daughters were active in the Girl Scouts. A prior stroke having left Parker without the use of his legs, he planned to move about the park using his motorized wheelchair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arrival at the park's front gate, park officials told Parker and Vaazquez that there was handicap parking available. The park officials instructed those planning to attend the Girl Scout ceremony to proceed to the Monet Garden. Parker and Vaazquez then drove to the parking lot adjacent to the park's entrance. Finding that lot full, they proceeded to another parking area closer to their final destination in the park. Vaazquez asked park security guards to help unload her husband's wheelchair from the van, and the guards obliged. Realizing that Parker and Vaazquez were headed to the Monet Garden, one of the guards indicated that there was a pathway \"over there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker took that path and descended toward the Monet Garden, Vaazquez walking several steps in front to guide him, as was her custom. Parker noticed that the path had loose gravel on it and was not designed to be a handicapped ramp. As Parker neared the bottom of the path, his wheelchair flipped and he landed on his right side. Although Parker could not say what caused his fall, and the Parkers presented no eyewitness account of the fall, Vaazquez testified that she immediately turned around and noticed that there was a two-inch dropoff to the ground at the end of the paved path at the place where her husband had fallen and that, in her opinion, this two-inch dropoff caused the fall. After getting back into his wheelchair, Parker stayed to attend the awards ceremony, and then left the Monet Garden by a different path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker subsequently went to the hospital where it was determined that he had broken his clavicle as a result of the accident. Prior to the accident, Parker had labored for two years in physical therapy to regain the use of his right arm after his debilitating stroke. Through his effort, he had recovered to the point where he was able to dress himself and to use the bathroom without his wife's assistance. The accident at the Monet Garden destroyed all the progress Parker had made since his stroke, rendering his right arm once again useless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Parkers filed suit against the University and the other named defendants primarily seeking compensatory damages for injuries suffered as a result of Parker's fall. In particular, the complaint asserted that the University's \"failure to remedy its violations of the ADA, inter alia, the lack of signage, the failure to make all ramps flush to the ground, and the [park guard's] instructions to use the noncompliant ramp, provide the Parkers with a cause of action for all remedies available in law and equity.\" At trial, five witnesses testified for the Parkers: Donald Parker, Mara Vaazquez, their two daughters, and Julie Escudero, a friend of the Parkers who attended the Girl Scout event with her disabled son. Of these witnesses, only Parker, Vaazquez, and Escudero were present at the park on the day of the accident. Escudero testified that she and her son, who was disabled and used a wheelchair, had reached the Monet Garden using a different route than the one traveled by Mr. Parker. After the Parkers concluded their case-in-chief, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Requisites of a Title II Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task in construing Title II's applicability in the case at hand is a difficult one. Although Title II of the ADA took effect on January 26, 1992,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> there is sparse caselaw interpreting its scope and limits. See Accessibility Under the Americans With Disabilities Act and Other Laws 118 (Earl B. Slavitt &amp; Donna J. Pugh eds., ABA 2000) (noting that few cases have been decided to date under either Title II or Title III of the ADA). Neither party directs us to any case in which Title II has supported a claim for damages resulting from a personal injury to a disabled person that occurred at a location operated by a public entity. Our research likewise has produced no case directly on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Title II provides, inter alia, thatno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132. Pursuant to the plain language of Title II, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of some public entity's services, programs, or activities or was otherwise discriminated against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff's disability. The University does not dispute that Parker is a \"qualified individual with a disability.\" See id. &#167; 12131(2) (defining \"qualified individual with a disability\" as an \"individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications . . . meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity\"). To the extent that the alleged defect in the path prevented Parker from using his wheelchair to access the Monet Garden safely, it is self-evident that it did so \"by reason of\" his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves us to decide whether the Parkers established a prima facie case that Parker was denied access to the University's \"services, programs, or activities\" within the meaning of Title II. Having examined the duties imposed by Title II on public entities and the evidence presented by the Parkers, we conclude that they did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. A Public Entity's Duties Under The ADA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of Title II does not elaborate on the obligation of a public entity to an individual with a disability in the provision of \"services, programs, or activities.\" We must rely for specifics on the regulations promulgated under Title II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The core \"accessibility\" standard set forth in Title II's regulations provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, because a public entity's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.149.

A public entity must \"give priority to those methods that offer services, programs, and activities . . . in the most integrated setting appropriate.\" Id. &#167; 34.150(b)(1). The public entity must also provide notice to individuals with disabilities of the \"protections against discrimination assured them,\" id. &#167; 35.106, and \"disseminate sufficient information\" to those individuals \"to inform them of the rights and protections afforded by the ADA,\" 56 Fed.

See United States Dep't of Justice, The Americans with Disabilities Act: Title II Technical Assistance Manual 10, 19 (1992). Title II's emphasis on \"program accessibility\" rather than \"facilities accessibility\" was intended to ensure broad access to public services, while, at the same time, providing public entities with the flexibility to choose how best to make access available. See Accessibility Under the ADA, at 53-54; 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. A &#167; 35.150 (stating that under Title II, \"the concept of program access will continue to apply with respect to facilities now in existence, because the cost of retrofitting existing facilities is often prohibitive\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to these requirements, the University was obligated to ensure that each service, program, or activity at the Botanical Gardens \"when viewed in its entirety,\" was accessible to individuals with disabilities. One purpose of the Botanical Gardens is to serve as a venue for group events. The University holds open the Monet Garden as a place for group convocations, like the Girl Scouts awards ceremony that Parker attended. The University, therefore, has a duty to make the Monet Garden \"readily accessible\" to and \"usable\" by individuals with disabilities. Such access must be provided in the \"most integrated setting appropriate,\" meaning that the University has an obligation to ensure that individuals with disabilities--such as persons using wheelchairs--can travel to and from the Monet Garden using safe walkways, ramps, and curb cuts. Although the University is not required to make every passageway in and out of the Monet Garden accessible, it must provide at least one route that a person in a wheelchair can use to reach the Monet Garden safely, absent a defense that excuses such performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Parkers' Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Parker could not say what caused his fall, and the Parkers presented no eyewitness account, Vaazquez and Escudero testified that the fall occurred at the spot on the path where it dropped two inches abruptly to the ground below. A jury could infer that this dropoff caused Mr. Parker's wheelchair to overturn, or forced Parker to alter his course down the path in such a way that caused his fall. Wheelchairs do not typically overturn without some intervening cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could also conclude that Parker was using the path intended for wheelchair use. A park guard directed Parker to use the path at issue, after seeing that Parker would be traveling by wheelchair. Although there were at least two other routes to the Monet Garden, there were no signs or other notices indicating that wheelchair users should take these other paths. Under these circumstances, a jury could conclude that the two-inch dropoff at the end of the paved path denied Parker safe access to the Monet Garden and caused his fall and injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the defenses that the University could offer in response to this prima facie case, we first note that the claim under Title II is similar in many respects to a tort claim. See Pandazides v.

In most instances, the injury alleged pursuant to Title II of the ADA is exclusion from participation in, or the denial of the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, because of discrimination against a person by reason of disability. See, e.g., Easley v. Snider, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678816\"><a href=\"/opinion/678816/tracy-easley-by-her-next-friend-lucille-easley-florence-h-v-karen/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span> </a></span>(3d Cir. 1994) (seeking to enjoin state to include persons with certain types of mental disabilities in state home care program); Kinney v.

The primary injury alleged and proven under Title II in a case such as this remains the alleged violation by the University of its statutory duty to disabled persons to prevent the discriminatory denial of access to a service, program, or activity. The physical injury is an additional consequence of the violation of that statutory duty, which is of a different character than a duty owed to the general population. That is, the University does not satisfy the duties imposed by Title II merely by exercising reasonable care to protect persons with disabilities, along with other members of the public, from dangerous conditions on the premises. Rather, the University must act affirmatively to eliminate barriers on the premises that would otherwise serve to deny persons with disabilities access to services, programs, or activities of the University--here, access to the Monet Garden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the liability issue under Title II is a discriminatory denial of access, not negligence, the University could rebut the prima facie case of the Parkers by showing that disabled persons using wheelchairs were not denied access to the Monet Garden. For example, the University could have produced evidence that, irrespective of the accident on this occasion, the path at issue was actually safe for wheelchair use, thereby suggesting that the fall resulted from Mr. Parker's own negligence rather than a denial of access to disabled persons. The University might have established that there was another path to the Monet Garden that was safe for wheelchair use, properly noted with signs, but Parker and Vaazquez missed the signs and misconstrued the signal of the park guard. Finally, the University could have argued that providing wheelchair access to the Monet Garden would require a \"fundamental alteration\" or \"undue burden.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These defenses were never offered because the trial court never required the defendants to defend.
