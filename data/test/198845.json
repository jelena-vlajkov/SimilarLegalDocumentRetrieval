  "plain_text": "          United States Court of Appeals\n                    For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 98-1766\n\n                  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                          Appellee,\n\n                              v.\n\n          JAIME RIVERA ALICEA, a/k/a PITO PACHANGA,\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n         Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Vilma Maria Dapena, by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Jeanette Mercado-Ríos, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco   and  Nelson  Pérez-Sosa,   Assistant  United   States\nAttorneys, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 6, 2000\n\f\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge. A jury found defendant-appellant\n\nJaime Rivera-Alicea guilty of various offenses arising out of a\n\nsurveilled drug transaction and ensuing chase.               Rivera-Alicea\n\nappeals,   challenging    the   sufficiency     of   the    evidence,    the\n\ninternal consistency of the verdict, the jury instructions,\n\ncertain sentence-related rulings, and the denial of his motion\n\nfor a new trial.    Discerning no error, we affirm.\n\n           We present the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, consistent with record support.            See United States\n\nv. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir. 1997).                After receiving\n\nword from an informant that a large narcotics transaction was\n\nscheduled for May 23, 1996, a task force composed of federal\n\nagents and local police officers devised a plan to intercept the\n\ndrugs and apprehend the participants.           But as a Scottish poet\n\nwarned many years ago, \"[t]he best laid schemes o' mice an' men\n\ngang aft agley,\" Robert Burns, \"To a Mouse, On Turning Up Her\n\nNest With the Plough\" (1785), and the planned interdiction\n\nimploded when the transaction occurred approximately twenty\n\nminutes ahead of schedule.      Thus, only a lone Puerto Rico police\n\nofficer, Eliezer De Jesús, actually witnessed the exchange.\n\n           De   Jesús   sounded   the   alarm    and   a    cadre   of   law\n\nenforcement officers belatedly set out after a blue Toyota sedan\n\nthat De Jesús had observed leaving the scene.          Once the Toyota's\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\foccupants — five men, including the appellant — became aware\n\nthat    agents    were     in   hot    pursuit,       the    vehicle    accelerated,\n\nleading to a dangerous high-speed chase through a residential\n\narea.     In the course of the chase, shots were fired from the\n\nback seat of the Toyota in what proved to be a vain attempt to\n\ndeter the pursuers.         Eventually, the Toyota hit another vehicle,\n\nthen a gate, and ground to a stop.                      Officers arrested three\n\nsuspects on the spot.           They also recovered two firearms from the\n\nToyota's back seat and retrieved a white nylon bag containing\n\neighteen kilograms of cocaine from the trunk.                    The appellant and\n\nanother    man     fled,    exchanging            gunshots    with     two   of   their\n\npursuers, and eluded immediate capture.\n\n            In    due    season,       a    federal     grand    jury    returned     a\n\nmultiple-count indictment against a number of persons.                              The\n\nindictment charged the appellant with aiding and abetting the\n\npossession       with   intent    to       distribute       eighteen    kilograms    of\n\ncocaine (count 1); conspiracy to possess the same, intending to\n\ndistribute (count 2); aiding and abetting the use and carriage\n\nof a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a drug-\n\ntrafficking offense (count 3); and aiding and abetting the use\n\nof   dangerous      weapons      in    attempts       to     kill,   intimidate,     or\n\ninterfere with law enforcement agents in the performance of\n\ntheir official duties (counts 4 and 5).                          See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 111, 924(c), 1114.              After a\n\nfour-day trial, the jury returned a mixed verdict; it found the\n\nappellant guilty on the first three counts, but acquitted him on\n\nthe last two.\n\n            The appellant subsequently filed a timely motion for\n\na new trial based upon newly discovered evidence.            See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 33.       The district court denied this motion and imposed\n\na thirty-year incarcerative sentence on the drug-trafficking\n\ncounts and a five-year consecutive sentence on the firearms\n\ncount.   This appeal followed.         In it, the appellant advances\n\nseveral claims of error.         We address each of them.\n\n            1.     Sufficiency of the Evidence.       The appellant's\n\nprincipal challenge questions the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nIn reviewing for insufficiency, an appellate court must \"canvass\n\nthe evidence (direct and circumstantial) in the light most\n\nagreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,\n\nincluding    all     plausible    inferences   extractable   therefrom,\n\nenables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.\"             Noah,\n\n130 F.3d at 494.       We follow this prescription.\n\n            The government's case against the appellant hinged on\n\nthe testimony of two key witnesses.        A federal agent, Montalvo,\n\npositively identified the appellant as the right-front-seat\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fpassenger in the careening blue Toyota.   He also testified that,\n\nat the time of the crash, the appellant nimbly dismounted and\n\nfled, firing a black pistol at three pursuing agents (including\n\nMontalvo).    The other important witness against the appellant\n\nwas José Alberto Vásquez-Hernández (Vásquez), a cooperating\n\ncoconspirator.    Vásquez positively identified the appellant as\n\nthe principal in the operation (the buyer of the cocaine), and\n\ntestified that the appellant made the necessary arrangements for\n\nthe transaction at a meeting held three days prior to the\n\nexchange (in the course of which he threatened several of the\n\nother participants with dire consequences should the enterprise\n\nfounder).\n\n            This testimony was more than enough to ground the\n\njury's verdict.    To be sure, the appellant, ably represented,\n\nattacks Montalvo's and Vásquez's credibility, but these attacks\n\nconstitute more cry than wool.       Appellate courts routinely\n\nresolve credibility issues in favor of jury verdicts, see United\n\nStates v.    Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998);    United\n\nStates v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1127 (1st Cir. 1981), and the\n\nrecord here contains no principled basis for making an exception\n\nto this salutary rule.   Montalvo was a percipient witness to the\n\nevents of May 23, and two Puerto Rico police officers, Morales\n\nand Ortiz, although unable positively to identify the appellant,\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fnonetheless confirmed Montalvo's testimony in salient respects.\n\nFor his part, Vásquez was a member of the ring, whose turncoat\n\nstatus did not strip his testimony of probative value.     It is\n\nsettled beyond cavil that a defendant's former cohorts may\n\ntestify against him as long as all pertinent agreements with the\n\ngovernment are disclosed and the judge, if requested, instructs\n\nthe jury about the special care that must be taken in evaluating\n\naccomplice testimony.1   See United States v. Hernandez, 109 F.3d\n\n13, 15 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitía, 996\n\nF.2d 436, 438-39 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          The appellant makes a special entreaty in regard to\n\nMontalvo, arguing that the verdict on counts 4 and 5 evinces the\n\njury's negative appraisal of Montalvo's testimony.     We do not\n\nagree.   Except in the most unusual circumstances (not extant\n\nhere), credibility determinations are for the jury, not for an\n\nappellate court — and it is hazardous to attempt to intuit\n\nspecific judgments about credibility from a general verdict (or\n\nfrom a series of general verdicts, for that matter).      In all\n\nevents, a jury has the prerogative to credit some parts of a\n\n\n\n    1These preconditions were fully satisfied here.         The\ngovernment made full disclosure; the defense vigorously cross-\nexamined Vásquez as to promises that had been made and benefits\nthat he hoped to derive; and the district judge gave the jurors\na complete and correct explanation of the guiding legal\nprinciples.\n\n                               -7-\n\fwitness's         testimony        and     disregard         other   potentially\n\ncontradictory portions.             See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d\n\n183, 204 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703,\n\n707 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n             We see nothing to be gained by belaboring these points.\n\nRead,   as    need    be,     in    the    light      most   hospitable   to   the\n\ngovernment, the record contains more than enough evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's determination that the appellant committed\n\nthe two related drug-trafficking offenses and aided and abetted\n\nthe use and carriage of one or more firearms — those transported\n\nin the Toyota and/or the one that Montalvo said the appellant\n\nfired during the foot chase — during the commission of those\n\noffenses.     See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (stating that the court of appeals will not disturb\n\na jury verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the\n\nrecord).\n\n             2.   Inconsistent Verdicts.              The appellant perceives an\n\nirreconcilable       tension       between      the    guilty   verdict   on   the\n\nfirearms charge (count 3) and the acquittal on the intimidation\n\ncounts (counts 4 and 5).           Despite the appellant's hairsplitting,\n\nthis boils down to a straightforward claim that the jury verdict\n\nis internally inconsistent.               As such, the claim is essentially\n\nunreviewable.        See United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 66\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f(1984); Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393-94 (1932);\n\nLara,   181    F.3d   at    206.     In     a   single,   multi-count      trial,\n\nacquittal on one or more counts does not preclude conviction on\n\nother counts based upon the same evidence, as long as that\n\nevidence is legally sufficient to support a finding of guilt on\n\nthe count(s) of conviction.          See Powell, 469 U.S. at 67; United\n\nStates v. Bucuvalas, 909 F.2d 593, 597 (1st Cir. 1990); see also\n\n3 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 514 (1982 & Supp. 1999).               It would serve no useful\n\npurpose   to     repastinate       this    well-ploughed    ground,     and    we\n\ntherefore reject the appellant's claim on the basis of Powell\n\nand its progeny, without further elaboration.2\n\n            3.   Use and Carriage.          The appellant contends that the\n\nlower court improperly instructed the jury on the firearms count\n\nby failing to define the terms \"use\" and \"carry.\"                   Because the\n\nappellant      did    not   contemporaneously        object    to    the     jury\n\ninstructions on this basis, we review for plain error.                        See\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993); United States\n\n\n    2 In adopting this course, we note that there is ample\nevidence here to support the appellant's conviction on the\nfirearms count. See Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125,\n126-27 (1998) (holding that the phrase \"carries a firearm\"\napplies to persons who knowingly possess and transport firearms\nin a vehicle); United States v. Bailey, 516 U.S. 137, 148 (1995)\n(defining \"use\" as constituting active employment, including\n\"brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, firing or\nattempting to fire\" a gun).\n\n                                          -9-\n\fv. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir. 1987).        This type of\n\nreview entails inquiry into whether affirmance would \"skew[] the\n\nfundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below\n\nin some major respect,\" so as to result in a miscarriage of\n\njustice.   United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n           We need not linger over this assignment of error.\n\nAlthough explicit definition of statutory terms and other legal\n\nparlance sometimes may be helpful in jury instructions, we\n\nrepeatedly have held such elaboration to be unnecessary when,\n\ntaken in the context of the charge as a whole and the evidence\n\nin the case, the tenor of a word or phrase is reasonably clear.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. De La Cruz, 902 F.2d 121, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 1990); United States v. Littlefield, 840 F.2d 143, 146-47\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).      This precept applies with especial force\n\nwhere, as here, the defendant makes no contemporaneous request\n\nfor clarification.    In the circumstances of this case, we find\n\nno error, plain or otherwise, in the jury instructions.\n\n           4.   Sentencing.   The appellant alleges that the lower\n\ncourt committed three separate errors related to sentencing.    We\n\nconsider each allegation.\n\n                                  A\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f          In computing the guideline sentencing range (GSR), the\n\ndistrict court increased the appellant's aggregate offense level\n\nby three levels due to his role in the offense.              The appellant\n\nasserts   that   this   enhancement     was     arbitrary    and   without\n\nunderlying record support.\n\n          The    government   bears     the    burden   of   proving   the\n\nlegitimacy of an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.        See United States v. Cruz, 120\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc).          As we have noted, \"battles\n\nover a defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or\n\nlost in the district court.\"     United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d\n\n70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995).       Once the sentencing judge has ruled,\n\nfurther inquiry proceeds deferentially; appellate review of a\n\nsentencing court's fact-specific determination of a defendant's\n\nrole in the offense is limited to clear error.          See, e.g., Cruz,\n\n120 F.3d at 3; Graciani, 61 F.3d at 75.\n\n          To justify a three-level role-in-the-offense increase,\n\nthe government must show that the defendant was a manager or\n\nsupervisor of criminal activity that involved five or more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive.            See USSG §3B1.1(b).\n\nIn this instance, Judge Laffitte made detailed findings at the\n\ndisposition hearing.      He attached decretory significance to\n\nVásquez's testimony describing the appellant's behavior and\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fstatements   at   a   pre-transaction   meeting   with   some   of   his\n\nconfederates.3    We perceive no error.   The gang plainly numbered\n\nno fewer than five — after all, several witnesses testified\n\nwithout contradiction that five persons occupied the fleeing\n\nToyota — and the inference that the appellant was their leader\n\nflows rationally from the evidence that he owned the drugs, that\n\nhe gave orders freely, and that he was prepared to use extreme\n\nmeasures if anything went awry. 4         See Cruz, 120 F.3d at 4\n\n(holding that the sentencing judge is entitled to choose among\n\nany and all reasonable inferences that plausibly can be drawn\n\nfrom the record).\n\n                                  B\n\n\n    3Judge Laffitte stated in part:\n\n    The testimony of Jóse Alberto Vazquez clearly says\n    that \"Pito Pachanga\" — that's the defendant — \"arrived\n    in a blue and grey Mustang. He was carrying a firearm\n    in his hand. It was a long weapon. When he talked to\n    us, he asked who had the drug[s]. . . . [He then]\n    asked for the drugs, that he wanted the drugs because\n    he had to pay for it; that if the drugs were not\n    recovered, he had to pay for it and that we would pay\n    with our own lives or the lives of our families.\" So\n    that is evidently clear that he is the boss.\n    4 Citing USSG §3B1.1, comment. (n.4), the appellant argues\nthat merely characterizing an individual as the \"boss\" cannot\nsupport a role-in-the-offense enhancement. Here, however, the\ncourt did not rely on a naked conclusion, but spelled out the\nevidence from which it determined that the appellant occupied a\nposition of leadership in the felonious enterprise. The fact\nthat the court couched this determination in the vernacular does\nnot deprive it of persuasive force.\n\n                                -12-\n\f                At sentencing, the district court hiked the appellant's\n\naggregate offense level by three levels based on the court's\n\nfinding that he assaulted a law enforcement officer and thus\n\ncreated         a    substantial   risk    of    bodily   injury.        See   USSG\n\n§3A1.2(b).5             The   appellant      challenges     this    enhancement,\n\ncastigating           what    he   describes     as   the   district      court's\n\nimpermissible use of \"acquitted\" conduct to boost his offense\n\nlevel (and, thus, increase his eventual sentence).\n\n                The Supreme Court has stated with unmistakable clarity\n\nthat       \"a   sentencing     court   may   consider     conduct   of    which   a\n\ndefendant has been acquitted\" in determining the length of a\n\nsentence.           United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 154 (1997) (per\n\ncuriam).            We have consistently applied this principle,               see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Berrios, 132 F.3d 834, 839 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); United States v.              Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 203 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n       5This guideline reads in relevant part:\n\n       If — during the course of the offense or immediate\n       flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for whose\n       conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable,\n       knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a\n       person was a law enforcement or corrections officer,\n       assaulted such officer in a manner creating a\n       substantial risk of serious bodily injury, increase by\n       3 levels.\n\nUSSG §3A1.2(b).\n\n                                          -13-\n\f1997), and we are duty bound to apply it here.                Consequently,\n\nthe appellant's challenge fails.\n\n                                     C\n\n          The appellant accuses the district court of engaging\n\nin   impermissible    double-counting.             In   support    of     this\n\naccusation, the appellant notes that the court increased his\n\noffense level pursuant to USSG §3A1.2(b),               see supra note 5,\n\nwhile at the same time invoking USSG §3C1.2 to add two levels\n\nfor recklessly creating a substantial risk of bodily harm in the\n\ncourse of fleeing from the officers.6              Because the appellant\n\nfailed   to   raise   the      specter    of     double-counting    at    the\n\ndisposition    hearing,   we    review    this    asseveration    for    plain\n\nerror.   See United States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d 15, 18 n.6 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (noting the applicability of plain-error review to an\n\nunpreserved sentencing error).\n\n          At bottom, this contention posits that the sentencing\n\ncourt used the same conduct as the basis for both offense level\n\nincreases,    notwithstanding     that    the    Sentencing   Commission's\n\ncommentary contains an express contrary admonition.                See USSG\n\n\n\n     6USSG §3C1.2 provides:\n\n     If the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk\n     of death or serious bodily injury to another person in\n     the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer,\n     increase by 2 levels.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f§3C1.2, comment. (n.1) (directing courts not to apply this\n\nenhancement where, inter alia, another adjustment \"results in an\n\nequivalent or greater increase in offense level solely on the\n\nbasis of the same conduct\") (emphasis supplied).                    When, and\n\nunder what circumstances, double-counting may (or may not) be a\n\npermissible practice in calculating a defendant's GSR is a\n\ncomplicated question.7          Here, however, we need not enter that\n\nthicket.\n\n           The    district     court    had   before    it    evidence    of    two\n\ndistinct sets of facts.             On the one hand, the vehicle chase\n\nculminated in the firing of shots in a public plaza.                           This\n\nbehavior put at risk the safety of bystanders as well as law\n\nenforcement officers.          This set of events was distinct from the\n\nappellant's      firing   of    a   pistol    at   pursuing    officers    while\n\nfleeing from the scene of the crash.               The latter conduct, in and\n\nof itself, put others in harm's way.                    Each set of events\n\nindependently warranted an upward adjustment under either or\n\n\n    7We do not mean to imply, however, that double-counting is\nnever permissible. The contrary is true. See, e.g., Lilly, 13\nF.3d at 19-20 (approving double-counting not explicitly\nprohibited by the sentencing guidelines); United States v.\nZapata, 1 F.3d 46, 47-48 (1st Cir. 1993) (approving double-\ncounting consistent with particular guidelines \"as written\").\nIndeed, the Sentencing Commission has specifically endorsed the\ncumulative application of adjustments drawn from different\nguideline sections. See USSG §1B1.1, comment. (n.4); see also\nUnited States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 234-35 (1st\nCir. 1999).\n\n                                       -15-\n\fboth   of   the   guidelines   at    issue.   The   district   court's\n\ndiscerning use of these two sets of discrete events to fashion\n\nupward adjustments under both section 3C1.2 and section 3A1.2(b)\n\ndid not constitute impermissible double-counting.         See United\n\nStates v. Matos-Rodriguez, 188 F.3d 1300, 1312 (11th Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            5.    New Trial.   The appellant's last assignment of\n\nerror involves the denial of his motion for a new trial.            We\n\nreview such rulings for manifest abuse of discretion.              See\n\nUnited States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            The appellant's trial culminated in a jury verdict on\n\nJanuary 12, 1998.      Approximately eleven weeks later, he moved\n\nfor a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.        See\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 33.    He premised his motion on the statement of\n\nRaquelina Mejias, an inmate at M.D.C. Guaynabo, attesting to\n\n\"many\" conversations with Vázquez early in 1998, during which\n\nVázquez supposedly told her that he did not know the appellant,\n\nbut that he was going to testify against him and say what the\n\ngovernment wanted so that his sentence would be reduced.           The\n\ndistrict court weighed this proffer, envisioned no need to\n\nconvene an evidentiary hearing, and denied the motion.             See\n\nUnited States v. Rivera Alicea, Crim. No. 96-185 (HL), slip op.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f(D.P.R. May 22, 1998).     We conclude that the court acted within\n\nthe realm of its discretion.\n\n           In order to prevail on a motion for new trial based\n\nupon newly discovered evidence, a defendant must show that (1)\n\nthe evidence was either unknown or unavailable at the time of\n\ntrial; (2) the failure to unearth it was not attributable to a\n\nlack of diligence on his part; (3) the evidence is material (as\n\nopposed to being merely cumulative or impeaching); and (4) the\n\nevidence   is   sufficiently    compelling    that      it   would   probably\n\nresult in an acquittal should the court order a retrial.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited   States   v.   Slade,   980   F.2d   27,   29   (1st   Cir.   1992);\n\nNatanel, 938 F.2d at 313; United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d\n\n1017, 1019-20 (1st Cir. 1980).        In this instance, we need not go\n\nbeyond the first two prongs of the test.\n\n           With only one exception, the conversations described\n\nby Mejias were alleged to have occurred prior to trial;8 yet the\n\n\n\n     8The exception relates to a conversation in February 1998 in\nwhich Vázquez allegedly told Mejias that he had \"won.\" Although\nthis piece of evidence obviously could not have been discovered\nin advance of trial, it does not profit the appellant. As Judge\nLaffitte perspicaciously observed, even if this ambiguous remark\nreferred to the outcome of the appellant's trial, it merely\nreflected Vázquez's satisfaction with the verdict and did not\nbear upon the appellant's guilt or innocence.         See Rivera\nAlicea, slip op. at 3. Accordingly, it was not significantly\nprobative on any material issue in the case.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fappellant's motion papers said nothing about when or how he had\n\nlearned of them.   By the same token, the motion papers did not\n\nin any way describe what efforts (if any) the appellant had made\n\nto identify potential witnesses in preparation for trial.               In\n\nshort, the appellant's entreaty contained nothing that showed\n\nthat the evidence on which he relied was either unknown to him\n\nbefore trial or, at least, was not readily discoverable had he\n\nexercised due diligence.        Because the appellant offered the\n\ndistrict court no explanation for his belated proffer of Mejias\n\nas a potential witness, he failed to carry his burden of showing\n\nthat the evidence qualified as \"newly discovered\" within the\n\nfirst two prongs of the applicable test.         See United States v.\n\nFalu-Gonzalez, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-1749,\n\nslip op. at 17]; United States v. Lowder, 148 F.3d 548, 552 (5th\n\nCir. 1998); United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n          The appellant has a fallback position.         He asseverates\n\nthat, instead of denying his motion outright, the district court\n\nshould have held an evidentiary hearing to address all the\n\nissues,   including      knowledge   and      discoverability.         But\n\nevidentiary   hearings    on   motions   in   criminal   cases   are   the\n\nexception, not the rule.        Before either the government or a\n\ndefendant can assign error to the denial of an evidentiary\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fhearing on such a motion, the party seeking a hearing must make\n\n\"a sufficient threshold showing that material facts [are] in\n\ndoubt or dispute.\"       United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1273\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (collecting cases).              Here, the appellant's\n\nmotion did not set forth a factual predicate (even a minimal\n\nfactual predicate) to ground an inference that               the proffered\n\nevidence was unknown and unavailable prior to the trial.                   On\n\nthis scanty record, we can find no abuse of discretion in the\n\nlower court's refusal to convene an evidentiary hearing.                  See\n\nFranks v.    Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978) (requiring\n\n\"substantial      preliminary   showing\"     antecedent   to    evidentiary\n\nhearing on motion in criminal case); United States v. McAndrews,\n\n12 F.3d 273, 280 (1st Cir. 1993) (similar).\n\n            We need go no further.9       We have combed the record and\n\nuncovered    no   sign   of   error.   For    aught   that     appears,   the\n\nappellant was fairly tried, justly convicted, and appropriately\n\nsentenced.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    9We note in passing that the district court also measured\nthe substance of Mejias's statement and found it wanting under\nthe third and fourth prongs of the applicable test. We do not\nreach those issues.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f",

Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the facts in the light most favorable to the government, consistent with record support. See United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir. 1997). After receiving word from an informant that a large narcotics transaction was scheduled for May 23, 1996, a task force composed of federal agents and local police officers devised a plan to intercept the drugs and apprehend the participants. But as a Scottish poet warned many years ago, \"[t]he best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley,\" Robert Burns, \"To a Mouse, On Turning Up Her Nest With the Plough\" (1785), and the planned interdiction imploded when the transaction occurred approximately twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Thus, only a lone Puerto Rico police officer, Eliezer De Jes&#163;&#163;s, actually witnessed the exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jes&#163;&#163;s sounded the alarm and a cadre of law enforcement officers belatedly set out after a blue Toyota sedan that De Jes&#163;&#163;s had observed leaving the scene. Once the Toyota's occupants - five men, including the appellant - became aware that agents were in hot pursuit, the vehicle accelerated, leading to a dangerous high-speed chase through a residential area. In the course of the chase, shots were fired from the back seat of the Toyota in what proved to be a vain attempt to deter the pursuers. Eventually, the Toyota hit another vehicle, then a gate, and ground to a stop. Officers arrested three suspects on the spot. They also recovered two firearms from the Toyota's back seat and retrieved a white nylon bag containing eighteen kilograms of cocaine from the trunk. The appellant and another man fled, exchanging gunshots with two of their pursuers, and eluded immediate capture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a federal grand jury returned a multiple-count indictment against a number of persons. The indictment charged the appellant with aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute eighteen kilograms of cocaine (count 1); conspiracy to possess the same, intending to distribute (count 2); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a drug-trafficking offense (count 3); and aiding and abetting the use of dangerous weapons in attempts to kill, intimidate, or interfere with law enforcement agents in the performance of their official duties (counts 4 and 5). See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 111, 924(c), 1114. After a four-day trial, the jury returned a mixed verdict; it found the appellant guilty on the first three counts, but acquitted him on the last two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant subsequently filed a timely motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 33. The district court denied this motion and imposed a thirty-year incarcerative sentence on the drug-trafficking counts and a five-year consecutive sentence on the firearms count. This appeal followed. In it, the appellant advances several claims of error. We address each of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's principal challenge questions the sufficiency of the evidence. In reviewing for insufficiency, an appellate court must \"canvass the evidence (direct and circumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.\" Noah, 130 F.3d at 494. We follow this prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against the appellant hinged on the testimony of two key witnesses. A federal agent, Montalvo, positively identified the appellant as the right-front-seat passenger in the careening blue Toyota. He also testified that, at the time of the crash, the appellant nimbly dismounted and fled, firing a black pistol at three pursuing agents (including Montalvo). The other important witness against the appellant was Josee Alberto Vaasquez-Hernaandez (Vaasquez), a cooperating coconspirator. Vaasquez positively identified the appellant as the principal in the operation (the buyer of the cocaine), and testified that the appellant made the necessary arrangements for the transaction at a meeting held three days prior to the exchange (in the course of which he threatened several of the other participants with dire consequences should the enterprise founder).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This testimony was more than enough to ground the jury's verdict. To be sure, the appellant, ably represented, attacks Montalvo's and Vaasquez's credibility, but these attacks constitute more cry than wool. Appellate courts routinely resolve credibility issues in favor of jury verdicts, see United States v. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1127 (1st Cir. 1981), and the record here contains no principled basis for making an exception to this salutary rule. Montalvo was a percipient witness to the events of May 23, and two Puerto Rico police officers, Morales and Ortiz, although unable positively to identify the appellant, nonetheless confirmed Montalvo's testimony in salient respects. For his part, Vaasquez was a member of the ring, whose turncoat status did not strip his testimony of probative value. It is settled beyond cavil that a defendant's former cohorts may testify against him as long as all pertinent agreements with the government are disclosed and the judge, if requested, instructs the jury about the special care that must be taken in evaluating accomplice testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See United States v. Hernandez, 109 F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d 436, 438-39 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant makes a special entreaty in regard to Montalvo, arguing that the verdict on counts 4 and 5 evinces the jury's negative appraisal of Montalvo's testimony. We do not agree. Except in the most unusual circumstances (not extant here), credibility determinations are for the jury, not for an appellate court - and it is hazardous to attempt to intuit specific judgments about credibility from a general verdict (or from a series of general verdicts, for that matter). In all events, a jury has the prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions. See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 204 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 707 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see nothing to be gained by belaboring these points. Read, as need be, in the light most hospitable to the government, the record contains more than enough evidence to support the jury's determination that the appellant committed the two related drug-trafficking offenses and aided and abetted the use and carriage of one or more firearms -those transported in the Toyota and/or the one that Montalvo said the appellant fired during the foot chase - during the commission of those offenses. See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that the court of appeals will not disturb a jury verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Inconsistent Verdicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant perceives an irreconcilable tension between the guilty verdict on the firearms charge (count 3) and the acquittal on the intimidation counts (counts 4 and 5). Despite the appellant's hairsplitting, this boils down to a straightforward claim that the jury verdict is internally inconsistent. As such, the claim is essentially unreviewable. See United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 66 (1984); Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393-94 (1932); Lara, 181 F.3d at 206. In a single, multi-count trial, acquittal on one or more counts does not preclude conviction on other counts based upon the same evidence, as long as that evidence is legally sufficient to support a finding of guilt on the count(s) of conviction. See Powell, 469 U.S. at 67; United States v. Bucuvalas, 909 F.2d 593, 597 (1st Cir. 1990); see also 3 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 514 (1982 &amp; Supp. 1999). It would serve no useful purpose to repastinate this well-ploughed ground, and we therefore reject the appellant's claim on the basis of Powell and its progeny, without further elaboration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Use and Carriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the lower court improperly instructed the jury on the firearms count by failing to define the terms \"use\" and \"carry.\" Because the appellant did not contemporaneously object to the jury instructions on this basis, we review for plain error. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993); United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir. 1987). This type of review entails inquiry into whether affirmance would \"skew[] the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in some major respect,\" so as to result in a miscarriage of justice. United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger over this assignment of error. Although explicit definition of statutory terms and other legal parlance sometimes may be helpful in jury instructions, we repeatedly have held such elaboration to be unnecessary when, taken in the context of the charge as a whole and the evidence in the case, the tenor of a word or phrase is reasonably clear. See, e.g., United States v. De La Cruz, 902 F.2d 121, 123 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v. Littlefield, 840 F.2d 143, 146-47 (1st Cir. 1988). This precept applies with especial force where, as here, the defendant makes no contemporaneous request for clarification. In the circumstances of this case, we find no error, plain or otherwise, in the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Sentencing. The appellant alleges that the lower court committed three separate errors related to sentencing. We consider each allegation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In computing the guideline sentencing range (GSR), the district court increased the appellant's aggregate offense level by three levels due to his role in the offense. The appellant asserts that this enhancement was arbitrary and without underlying record support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government bears the burden of proving the legitimacy of an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment by a preponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc). As we have noted, \"battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995). Once the sentencing judge has ruled, further inquiry proceeds deferentially; appellate review of a sentencing court's fact-specific determination of a defendant's role in the offense is limited to clear error. See, e.g., Cruz, 120 F.3d at 3; Graciani, 61 F.3d at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To justify a three-level role-in-the-offense increase, the government must show that the defendant was a manager or supervisor of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. See USSG &#167;3B1.1(b). In this instance, Judge Laffitte made detailed findings at the disposition hearing. He attached decretory significance to Vaasquez's testimony describing the appellant's behavior and statements at a pre-transaction meeting with some of his confederates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We perceive no error. The gang plainly numbered no fewer than five - after all, several witnesses testified without contradiction that five persons occupied the fleeing Toyota - and the inference that the appellant was their leader flows rationally from the evidence that he owned the drugs, that he gave orders freely, and that he was prepared to use extreme measures if anything went awry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Cruz, 120 F.3d at 4 (holding that the sentencing judge is entitled to choose among any and all reasonable inferences that plausibly can be drawn from the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court hiked the appellant's aggregate offense level by three levels based on the court's finding that he assaulted a law enforcement officer and thus created a substantial risk of bodily injury. See USSG &#167;3A1.2(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The appellant challenges this enhancement, castigating what he describes as the district court's impermissible use of \"acquitted\" conduct to boost his offense level (and, thus, increase his eventual sentence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has stated with unmistakable clarity that \"a sentencing court may consider conduct of which a defendant has been acquitted\" in determining the length of a sentence. United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 154 (1997) (per curiam). We have consistently applied this principle, see, e.g., United States v. Berrios, 132 F.3d 834, 839 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 203 (1st Cir. 1997), and we are duty bound to apply it here. Consequently, the appellant's challenge fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant accuses the district court of engaging in impermissible double-counting. In support of this accusation, the appellant notes that the court increased his offense level pursuant to USSG &#167;3A1.2(b), see supra note 5, while at the same time invoking USSG &#167;3C1.2 to add two levels for recklessly creating a substantial risk of bodily harm in the course of fleeing from the officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Because the appellant failed to raise the specter of double-counting at the disposition hearing, we review this asseveration for plain error. See United States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d 15, 18 n.6 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting the applicability of plain-error review to an unpreserved sentencing error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, this contention posits that the sentencing court used the same conduct as the basis for both offense level increases, notwithstanding that the Sentencing Commission's commentary contains an express contrary admonition. See USSG &#167;3C1.2, comment. (n.1) (directing courts not to apply this enhancement where, inter alia, another adjustment \"results in an equivalent or greater increase in offense level solely on the basis of the same conduct\") (emphasis supplied). When, and under what circumstances, double-counting may (or may not) be a permissible practice in calculating a defendant's GSR is a complicated question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Here, however, we need not enter that thicket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had before it evidence of two distinct sets of facts. On the one hand, the vehicle chase culminated in the firing of shots in a public plaza. This behavior put at risk the safety of bystanders as well as law enforcement officers. This set of events was distinct from the appellant's firing of a pistol at pursuing officers while fleeing from the scene of the crash. The latter conduct, in and of itself, put others in harm's way. Each set of events independently warranted an upward adjustment under either or both of the guidelines at issue. The district court's discerning use of these two sets of discrete events to fashion upward adjustments under both section 3C1.2 and section 3A1.2(b) did not constitute impermissible double-counting. See United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, 188 F.3d 1300, 1312 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. New Trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's last assignment of error involves the denial of his motion for a new trial. We review such rulings for manifest abuse of discretion. See United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's trial culminated in a jury verdict on January 12, 1998. Approximately eleven weeks later, he moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 33. He premised his motion on the statement of Raquelina Mejias, an inmate at M.D.C. Guaynabo, attesting to \"many\" conversations with Vaazquez early in 1998, during which Vaazquez supposedly told her that he did not know the appellant, but that he was going to testify against him and say what the government wanted so that his sentence would be reduced. The district court weighed this proffer, envisioned no need to convene an evidentiary hearing, and denied the motion. See United States v. Rivera Alicea, Crim. No. 96-185 (HL), slip op. (D.P.R. May 22, 1998). We conclude that the court acted within the realm of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail on a motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, a defendant must show that (1) the evidence was either unknown or unavailable at the time of trial; (2) the failure to unearth it was not attributable to a lack of diligence on his part; (3) the evidence is material (as opposed to being merely cumulative or impeaching); and (4) the evidence is sufficiently compelling that it would probably result in an acquittal should the court order a retrial. See United States v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 1992); Natanel, 938 F.2d at 313; United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019-20 (1st Cir. 1980). In this instance, we need not go beyond the first two prongs of the test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With only one exception, the conversations described by Mejias were alleged to have occurred prior to trial;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> yet the appellant's motion papers said nothing about when or how he had learned of them. By the same token, the motion papers did not in any way describe what efforts (if any) the appellant had made to identify potential witnesses in preparation for trial. In short, the appellant's entreaty contained nothing that showed that the evidence on which he relied was either unknown to him before trial or, at least, was not readily discoverable had he exercised due diligence. Because the appellant offered the district court no explanation for his belated proffer of Mejias as a potential witness, he failed to carry his burden of showing that the evidence qualified as \"newly discovered\" within the first two prongs of the applicable test. See United States v. Falu-Gonzalez, 205 F.3d 436, 411 (1st Cir. 2000) United States v. Lowder, 148 F.3d 548, 552 (5th Cir. 1998); United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 40 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has a fallback position. He asseverates that, instead of denying his motion outright, the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to address all the issues, including knowledge and discoverability. But evidentiary hearings on motions in criminal cases are the exception, not the rule. Before either the government or a defendant can assign error to the denial of an evidentiary hearing on such a motion, the party seeking a hearing must make \"a sufficient threshold showing that material facts [are] in doubt or dispute.\" United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1273 (1st Cir. 1990) (collecting cases). Here, the appellant's motion did not set forth a factual predicate (even a minimal factual predicate) to ground an inference that the proffered evidence was unknown and unavailable prior to the trial. On this scanty record, we can find no abuse of discretion in the lower court's refusal to convene an evidentiary hearing. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978) (requiring \"substantial preliminary showing\" antecedent to evidentiary hearing on motion in criminal case); United States v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 280 (1st Cir. 1993) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We have combed the record and uncovered no sign of error.

See Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 126-27 (1998) (holding that the phrase \"carries a firearm\" applies to persons who knowingly possess and transport firearms in a vehicle); United States v. Bailey, 516 U.S. 137, 148 (1995) (defining \"use\" as constituting active employment, including \"brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, firing or attempting to fire\" a gun).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Judge Laffitte stated in part: The testimony of Joose Alberto Vazquez clearly says that \"Pito Pachanga\" - that's the defendant - \"arrived in a blue and grey Mustang. He was carrying a firearm in his hand. It was a long weapon. When he talked to us, he asked who had the drug[s]. . . . [He then] asked for the drugs, that he wanted the drugs because he had to pay for it; that if the drugs were not recovered, he had to pay for it and that we would pay with our own lives or the lives of our families.\" So that is evidently clear that he is the boss.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Citing USSG &#167;3B1.1, comment. (n.4), the appellant argues that merely characterizing an individual as the \"boss\" cannot support a role-in-the-offense enhancement. Here, however, the court did not rely on a naked conclusion, but spelled out the evidence from which it determined that the appellant occupied a position of leadership in the felonious enterprise. The fact that the court couched this determination in the vernacular does not deprive it of persuasive force.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This guideline reads in relevant part: If - during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, increase by 3 levels.

The contrary is true. See, e.g., Lilly, 13 F.3d at 19-20 (approving double- counting not explicitly prohibited by the sentencing guidelines); United States v. Zapata, 1 F.3d 46, 47-48 (1st Cir. 1993) (approving double-counting consistent with particular guidelines \"as written\"). Indeed, the Sentencing Commission has specifically endorsed the cumulative application of adjustments drawn from different guideline sections. See USSG &#167;1B1.1, comment. (n.4); see also United States v. Rivera- Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 234-35 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The exception relates to a conversation in February 1998 in which Vaazquez allegedly told Mejias that he had \"won.\" Although this piece of evidence obviously could not have been discovered in advance of trial, it does not profit the appellant. As Judge Laffitte perspicaciously observed, even if this ambiguous remark referred to the outcome of the appellant's trial, it merely reflected Vaazquez's satisfaction with the verdict and did not bear upon the appellant's guilt or innocence. See Rivera Alicea, slip op. at 3. Accordingly, it was not significantly probative on any material issue in the case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that the district court also measured the substance of Mejias's statement and found it wanting under the third and fourth prongs of the applicable test.

After receiving word from an informant that a large narcotics transaction was scheduled for May 23, 1996, a task force composed of federal agents and local police officers devised a plan to intercept the drugs and apprehend the participants. But as a Scottish poet warned many years ago, \"[t]he best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley,\" Robert Burns, \"To a Mouse, On Turning Up Her Nest With the Plough\" (1785), and the planned interdiction imploded when the transaction occurred approximately twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Thus, only a lone Puerto Rico police officer, Eliezer De Jes&#163;&#163;s, actually witnessed the exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jes&#163;&#163;s sounded the alarm and a cadre of law enforcement officers belatedly set out after a blue Toyota sedan that De Jes&#163;&#163;s had observed leaving the scene. Once the Toyota's occupants - five men, including the appellant - became aware that agents were in hot pursuit, the vehicle accelerated, leading to a dangerous high-speed chase through a residential area. In the course of the chase, shots were fired from the back seat of the Toyota in what proved to be a vain attempt to deter the pursuers. Eventually, the Toyota hit another vehicle, then a gate, and ground to a stop. Officers arrested three suspects on the spot. They also recovered two firearms from the Toyota's back seat and retrieved a white nylon bag containing eighteen kilograms of cocaine from the trunk. The appellant and another man fled, exchanging gunshots with two of their pursuers, and eluded immediate capture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a federal grand jury returned a multiple-count indictment against a number of persons. The indictment charged the appellant with aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute eighteen kilograms of cocaine (count 1); conspiracy to possess the same, intending to distribute (count 2); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a drug-trafficking offense (count 3); and aiding and abetting the use of dangerous weapons in attempts to kill, intimidate, or interfere with law enforcement agents in the performance of their official duties (counts 4 and 5). See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 111, 924(c), 1114.

In reviewing for insufficiency, an appellate court must \"canvass the evidence (direct and circumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197675\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Noah,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197675/united-states-v-noah/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>. We follow this prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against the appellant hinged on the testimony of two key witnesses. A federal agent, Montalvo, positively identified the appellant as the right-front-seat passenger in the careening blue Toyota. He also testified that, at the time of the crash, the appellant nimbly dismounted and fled, firing a black pistol at three pursuing agents (including Montalvo). The other important witness against the appellant was Josee Alberto Vaasquez-Hernaandez (Vaasquez), a cooperating coconspirator. Vaasquez positively identified the appellant as the principal in the operation (the buyer of the cocaine), and testified that the appellant made the necessary arrangements for the transaction at a meeting held three days prior to the exchange (in the course of which he threatened several of the other participants with dire consequences should the enterprise founder).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This testimony was more than enough to ground the jury's verdict. To be sure, the appellant, ably represented, attacks Montalvo's and Vaasquez's credibility, but these attacks constitute more cry than wool. Appellate courts routinely resolve credibility issues in favor of jury verdicts, see United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198160\"><a href=\"/opinion/198160/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.

Montalvo was a percipient witness to the events of May 23, and two Puerto Rico police officers, Morales and Ortiz, although unable positively to identify the appellant, nonetheless confirmed Montalvo's testimony in salient respects. For his part, Vaasquez was a member of the ring, whose turncoat status did not strip his testimony of probative value. It is settled beyond cavil that a defendant's former cohorts may testify against him as long as all pertinent agreements with the government are disclosed and the judge, if requested, instructs the jury about the special care that must be taken in evaluating accomplice testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See United States v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197246\"><a href=\"/opinion/197246/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v.

We do not agree. Except in the most unusual circumstances (not extant here), credibility determinations are for the jury, not for an appellate court - and it is hazardous to attempt to intuit specific judgments about credibility from a general verdict (or from a series of general verdicts, for that matter). In all events, a jury has the prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions. See United States v. Lara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.

Read, as need be, in the light most hospitable to the government, the record contains more than enough evidence to support the jury's determination that the appellant committed the two related drug-trafficking offenses and aided and abetted the use and carriage of one or more firearms -those transported in the Toyota and/or the one that Montalvo said the appellant fired during the foot chase - during the commission of those offenses.

Once the sentencing judge has ruled, further inquiry proceeds deferentially; appellate review of a sentencing court's fact-specific determination of a defendant's role in the offense is limited to clear error.

He attached decretory significance to Vaasquez's testimony describing the appellant's behavior and statements at a pre-transaction meeting with some of his confederates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We perceive no error. The gang plainly numbered no fewer than five - after all, several witnesses testified without contradiction that five persons occupied the fleeing Toyota - and the inference that the appellant was their leader flows rationally from the evidence that he owned the drugs, that he gave orders freely, and that he was prepared to use extreme measures if anything went awry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744197\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cruz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/744197/united-states-v-ceferino-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span> </a></span>(holding that the sentencing judge is entitled to choose among any and all reasonable inferences that plausibly can be drawn from the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court hiked the appellant's aggregate offense level by three levels based on the court's finding that he assaulted a law enforcement officer and thus created a substantial risk of bodily injury.

In support of this accusation, the appellant notes that the court increased his offense level pursuant to USSG &#167;3A1.2(b), see supra note 5, while at the same time invoking USSG &#167;3C1.2 to add two levels for recklessly creating a substantial risk of bodily harm in the course of fleeing from the officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Because the appellant failed to raise the specter of double-counting at the disposition hearing, we review this asseveration for plain error.

See USSG &#167;3C1.2, comment. (n.1) (directing courts not to apply this enhancement where, inter alia, another adjustment \"results in an equivalent or greater increase in offense level solely on the basis of the same conduct\") (emphasis supplied). When, and under what circumstances, double-counting may (or may not) be a permissible practice in calculating a defendant's GSR is a complicated question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Here, however, we need not enter that thicket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had before it evidence of two distinct sets of facts. On the one hand, the vehicle chase culminated in the firing of shots in a public plaza. This behavior put at risk the safety of bystanders as well as law enforcement officers. This set of events was distinct from the appellant's firing of a pistol at pursuing officers while fleeing from the scene of the crash. The latter conduct, in and of itself, put others in harm's way. Each set of events independently warranted an upward adjustment under either or both of the guidelines at issue. The district court's discerning use of these two sets of discrete events to fashion upward adjustments under both section 3C1.2 and section 3A1.2(b) did not constitute impermissible double-counting.

He premised his motion on the statement of Raquelina Mejias, an inmate at M.D.C. Guaynabo, attesting to \"many\" conversations with Vaazquez early in 1998, during which Vaazquez supposedly told her that he did not know the appellant, but that he was going to testify against him and say what the government wanted so that his sentence would be reduced. The district court weighed this proffer, envisioned no need to convene an evidentiary hearing, and denied the motion. See United States v. Rivera Alicea, Crim. No. 96-185 (HL), slip op. (D.P.R.

By the same token, the motion papers did not in any way describe what efforts (if any) the appellant had made to identify potential witnesses in preparation for trial. In short, the appellant's entreaty contained nothing that showed that the evidence on which he relied was either unknown to him before trial or, at least, was not readily discoverable had he exercised due diligence. Because the appellant offered the district court no explanation for his belated proffer of Mejias as a potential witness, he failed to carry his burden of showing that the evidence qualified as \"newly discovered\" within the first two prongs of the applicable test.

He asseverates that, instead of denying his motion outright, the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to address all the issues, including knowledge and discoverability. But evidentiary hearings on motions in criminal cases are the exception, not the rule. Before either the government or a defendant can assign error to the denial of an evidentiary hearing on such a motion, the party seeking a hearing must make \"a sufficient threshold showing that material facts [are] in doubt or dispute.\" United States v.

[He then] asked for the drugs, that he wanted the drugs because he had to pay for it; that if the drugs were not recovered, he had to pay for it and that we would pay with our own lives or the lives of our families.\" So that is evidently clear that he is the boss.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Citing USSG &#167;3B1.1, comment. (n.4), the appellant argues that merely characterizing an individual as the \"boss\" cannot support a role-in-the-offense enhancement. Here, however, the court did not rely on a naked conclusion, but spelled out the evidence from which it determined that the appellant occupied a position of leadership in the felonious enterprise. The fact that the court couched this determination in the vernacular does not deprive it of persuasive force.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This guideline reads in relevant part: If - during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom, the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement or corrections officer, assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, increase by 3 levels. USSG &#167;3A1.2(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> USSG &#167;3C1.2 provides: If the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer, increase by 2 levels.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We do not mean to imply, however, that double- counting is never permissible. The contrary is true. See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195133\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lilly,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195133/united-states-v-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">19-20</span> </a></span>(approving double- counting not explicitly prohibited by the sentencing guidelines); United States v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194834\"><a href=\"/opinion/194834/united-states-v-zapata-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47-48 (1st Cir. 1993) (approving double-counting consistent with particular guidelines \"as written\"). Indeed, the Sentencing Commission has specifically endorsed the cumulative application of adjustments drawn from different guideline sections. See USSG &#167;1B1.1, comment. (n.4); see also United States v. Rivera- Maldonado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198682\"><a href=\"/opinion/198682/united-states-v-rivera-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 234-35 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The exception relates to a conversation in February 1998 in which Vaazquez allegedly told Mejias that he had \"won.\" Although this piece of evidence obviously could not have been discovered in advance of trial, it does not profit the appellant. As Judge Laffitte perspicaciously observed, even if this ambiguous remark referred to the outcome of the appellant's trial, it merely reflected Vaazquez's satisfaction with the verdict and did not bear upon the appellant's guilt or innocence. See Rivera Alicea, slip op. at 3. Accordingly, it was not significantly probative on any material issue in the case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that the district court also measured the substance of Mejias's statement and found it wanting under the third and fourth prongs of the applicable test. We do not reach those issues.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
