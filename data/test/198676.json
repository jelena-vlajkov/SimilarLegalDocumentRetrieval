Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Frederick Alan Pierce on brief pro se.\r\n   Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and F. Mark Terison,\r\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on Motion for Summary Affirmance for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nOctober 8, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Petitioner, Frederick Alan Pierce,\r\nappeals from the district court's denial of his petition for\r\n\"Emergency Writ of Release,\" pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1651.  For the reasons stated by the district court in\r\nits order dated March 19, 1999, we agree that petitioner's\r\nclaims that the district court and this court lacked\r\njurisdiction over his case are entirely without merit.      \r\n          Petitioner's challenge to his indictment (on the\r\nground that it was obtained through fraud) is governed by 28\r\nU.S.C.  2255.  Therefore, the All Writs Act does not provide\r\na source of relief. See Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S.\r\n416, 429 (1996); United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 55 (1st\r\nCir. 1999).  That relief may not be available to petitioner\r\nunder  2255 (for inability to meet the requirements for filing\r\na successive petition under the statute), does not bring the\r\npetition within the scope of the All Writs Act. See id.  \"The\r\nAll Writs Act 'does not authorize [federal courts] to issue ad\r\nhoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears\r\ninconvenient or less appropriate.'\" Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v.\r\nMarkarian, 114 F.3d 346, 350 (1st Cir. 1997)(citation omitted). \r\n          The district court's order denying the Petition for\r\nEmergency Writ of Release and its order denying petitioner's\r\nMotion for Reconsideration are summarily affirmed.
