Klickstein and Abrams,\r\nRoberts, Klickstein &amp; Levy were on brief for appellant.\r\n   Maia Aparo Moran with whom F.J. McDonald and Law Offices of\r\nF.J. McDonald were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 26, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  In June 1997, plaintiff-appellant\r\nSamos Imex Corporation sued Nextel Communications, Inc. in the\r\nfederal district court in Massachusetts.  The gist of the complaint\r\nwas that in 1995, Nextel had constructed an antenna or \"monopole,\"\r\nover 100 feet high, within several feet of a building leased and\r\noccupied by Samos Imex under a lease that required Samos Imex to\r\nmake repairs to the building.  Samos Imex claimed that the antenna,\r\nwhich itself involved subsurface construction, had caused Samos\r\nImex's building to shift, resulting in structural damage and\r\nrendering its freight elevator inoperative.\r\nPrior to the suit being filed, John Carota, a structural\r\nengineering expert, gave Samos Imex a report evaluating the\r\ncondition of the building, recommending repairs, and identifying\r\n\"the probable cause\" of the damage to the building and the freight\r\nelevator.  The probable cause section of the report began by\r\nconcluding that \"[t]he probable cause of the recent movement and\r\nracking [i.e., shifting] [of] this three story brick building . .\r\n. can be directly attributed to the building responding to the\r\neffects of constructing the monopole project.\"  The report then\r\nidentified  various \"aspects\" of the antenna project that \"either\r\nsingularly or in combination could have caused the failed elevator\r\nand cracked building support columns and walls.\"\r\nThis document, which was prepared in advance of the\r\nlitigation, was the only disclosure of anticipated expert testimony\r\nmade by Samos Imex by the time of the discovery deadline for\r\nplaintiff's expert testimony.  Thereafter, Nextel moved to exclude\r\nCarota's testimony and for summary judgment.  It argued that the\r\nCarota report was not accompanied by other information required by\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B), such as exhibits to be used at trial\r\nby the expert, a list of his publications, disclosure of\r\ncompensation, and a list of other cases in which the expert has\r\ntestified within the preceding four years.  In the same motion,\r\nNextel sought summary judgment on the separate ground that the\r\nreport, even if believed, did not establish that the antenna had\r\nmore likely than not caused the harm complained of; rather,\r\naccording to Nextel, the report dwelt solely in \"could haves\" and\r\n\"possibilities.\"  \r\nIn August 1998, the district court heard oral argument\r\nand decided the matter from the bench.  It rejected the request to\r\nexclude the engineering report as a sanction for violation of\r\ndiscovery rules, but it entered summary judgment on the ground that\r\nthe report did not purport to establish that \"more probably than\r\nnot\" the antenna construction was the cause of the damage--the\r\nthreshold of proof that the court said was inherent in the\r\npreponderance of the evidence standard that generally applies in\r\ncivil cases.\r\nIn the hearing, counsel for Samos Imex responded to the\r\ncourt that Carota would testify that when he used the phrase \"the\r\nprobable cause\" in his report, he meant \"more likely than not.\" \r\nThe court said that it understood the proffer to mean that if\r\nCarota was called to the stand \"he would answer that more likely\r\nthan not the shifting of the building which caused the elevator to\r\nbind was [caused by] the Nextel pole.\"  However, the court said\r\nthat to accept this proffer as modifying the report would undermine\r\nproper case management and discovery rules and that the report\r\nitself remained \"inadequate given the required standard.\"\r\nSamos Imex now appeals and, reviewing the grant of\r\nsummary judgment de novo, see Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 960\r\n(1st Cir. 1997), we reverse.  The phrase \"probable cause\" is used,\r\nin the narrow confines of Fourth Amendment precedent, to establish\r\na standard less demanding than \"more probable than not.\"  For\r\nexample, arrests--made long before all proof is assembled for a\r\ntrial--can be justified as based on probable cause by showing a\r\nreasonable basis for belief that a suspect committed a crime; in\r\nmany cases such a basis exists without a 50 percent-plus likelihood\r\nthat the suspect is guilty.  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia,\r\n179 F.3d 265, 269 (5th Cir. 1999); cf. United States v. Sokolow,\r\n490 U.S. 1, 7 (1989).\r\nThe standard is obviously higher at trial where, in a\r\ncivil suit for negligence, the plaintiff must normally show both\r\nfault and causation.  To establish the latter, plaintiff must show\r\nthat it is more probable than not that the injury was caused by the\r\naction or event (or a combination of them) for which the defendant\r\nwas responsible.  See, e.g., Forlano v. Hughes, 471 N.E.2d 1315,\r\n1319-20 (Mass. 1984); Bigwood v. Boston &amp; N. St. Ry. Co., 95 N.E.2d\r\n751, 752 (Mass. 1911).  And laymen and many judges might easily\r\nrefer to such a cause as \"the probable cause\" of an accident,\r\nmeaning that it was the more likely than not cause.\r\nWords like \"probable\" and \"likely\" are highly elastic in\r\ncommon use, which is why they are often surrounded by other phrases\r\n(\"more probable than not\", \"a reasonable likelihood\"), that\r\nsometimes lend greater precision and sometimes do not.  When a\r\nmagistrate judge speaks of \"probable cause\" in a suppression\r\nhearing, we assume that he means a reasonable basis sufficient to\r\nsatisfy the Fourth Amendment; but if a doctor testified on the\r\nstand that the probable cause of death was a heart attack, he might\r\nbe expected to mean that the heart attack was more likely than not\r\nthe cause of death.  If the doctor meant only that a heart attack\r\nwas merely one possible cause among others, it would be up to the\r\nopposing counsel to draw this out on cross-examination.\r\nIn all events, counsel for the plaintiff made an\r\nimmediate proffer that the expert would testify that the monopole\r\nwas more likely than not the cause of the injury and that that was\r\nwhat he had intended by use of the phrase \"probable cause\" in the\r\nreport.  If there were any doubt, it would be easy enough to\r\nconduct a brief deposition of the witness.  It is one thing to\r\nallow counsel to contradict by proffer something the expert said in\r\nthe report or to supply a manifest omission; in that event, case\r\nmanagement and discovery concerns would be legitimate objections. \r\nBut it is hard to justify dismissal of a case on summary judgment,\r\nbased on what is at worst ambiguous language, in the face of an\r\nexplicit proffer by counsel that the witness meant just what many\r\nreaders would expect the witness to have intended.\r\nAdmittedly, further in the Carota report he used phrases\r\nlike \"could have caused\" and the like, and Nextel presses this\r\npoint on appeal.  But the main use of these phrases, which occur in\r\nthe same paragraph as the \"probable cause\" statement, are actually\r\nreferences to multiple causes all of which related to the\r\nconstruction or operation of the antenna and for all of which\r\nNextel would likely be responsible (absent some further\r\nexplanation).  So long as Nextel was responsible for all of the\r\npossible causes, it would not matter whether the precise causal\r\npath could be identified.  See, e.g., Solimene v. B. Grauel &amp; Co.,\r\n507 N.E.2d 662, 667 &amp; n.12 (Mass. 1987); Carey v. General Motors\r\nCorp., 387 Mass. N.E.2d 583, 585-86 (Mass. 1979).\r\nThis is not a case in which the witness mouths the proper\r\nconclusion but the detailed explanation in his report or proffered\r\ntestimony clearly contradicts or provides no arguable foundation\r\nfor the conclusion.  See, e.g., Colantuonis v. Alfred Calcagni &amp;\r\nSons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1994).  Nor does this appear to\r\nbe a case in which the expert was talking generally about why\r\nbuildings collapse without reaching a conclusion as to why this\r\nspecific building had shifted; on the contrary, the pivotal\r\nsentence in the probable cause section of the report (quoted above)\r\nspoke of \"the probable cause\" of the shifting of \"this three-story\r\nbrick building.\"  Nextel was free to depose Carota to clarify his\r\n\"could have\" references, but it was not entitled to summary\r\njudgment on the present state of the record. \r\nNextel asks us to affirm the district court's decision on\r\na distinct \"alternative\" ground, namely, the alleged failure of\r\nNextel to comply with discovery rules by furnishing required\r\ninformation about the expert.  At one point in the transcript the\r\ndistrict court appears squarely to have rejected such a claim of\r\nviolation as the basis for excluding Carota's testimony, hardly a\r\nchoice comprising a patent abuse of discretion.  In effect, Nextel\r\nis asking us to conclude that there was a violation of the\r\ndiscovery rules and that it was of such a character as to compel\r\nthe district court to exclude the report as a sanction for this\r\nviolation.\r\nIt is quite true that as amended, the civil procedure\r\nrules make clear that exclusion of evidence is a standard sanction\r\nfor a violation of duty of disclosure under Rule 26(a).  See Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 37(c); Klonoski v. Mahlab, 156 F.3d 255 (1st Cir. 1998). \r\nBut this is far from saying that the district court is obligated to\r\nexclude evidence based on a failure, long before trial and likely\r\nsubject to correction without much harm to the opposing party; nor\r\ndo we know whether there may be some \"justification\" for any\r\nfailure to disclose.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).  In all events, on\r\nremand the district court is free to enforce its discovery rules by\r\nordering compliance, sanctions, or any other appropriate remedy.\r\nWe have no bias whatever against summary judgment or\r\nagainst opinions from the bench, both of which are often marks of\r\nefficient management.  But where a building incurs harm after\r\nsignificant nearby construction and an expert calls the\r\nconstruction \"the probable cause,\" we think that more is needed to\r\nsupport summary judgment than an easily resolved doubt as to\r\nwhether the expert meant \"more probable than not.\"  There may well\r\nbe more to the story, but we can only act on what the record\r\ndiscloses.  Nothing precludes a renewed motion for summary judgment\r\nif and when Carota is deposed.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is reversed and the\r\nmatter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.\r\nIt is so ordered.\r\n",

The gist of the complaint was that in 1995, Nextel had constructed an antenna or \"monopole,\" over 100 feet high, within several feet of a building leased and occupied by Samos Imex under a lease that required Samos Imex to make repairs to the building. Samos Imex claimed that the antenna, which itself involved subsurface construction, had caused Samos Imex's building to shift, resulting in structural damage and rendering its freight elevator inoperative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the suit being filed, John Carota, a structural engineering expert, gave Samos Imex a report evaluating the condition of the building, recommending repairs, and identifying \"the probable cause\" of the damage to the building and the freight elevator. The probable cause section of the report began by concluding that \"[t]he probable cause of the recent movement and racking [i.e., shifting] [of] this three story brick building . . . can be directly attributed to the building responding to the effects of constructing the monopole project.\" The report then identified various \"aspects\" of the antenna project that \"either singularly or in combination could have caused the failed elevator and cracked building support columns and walls.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This document, which was prepared in advance of the litigation, was the only disclosure of anticipated expert testimony made by Samos Imex by the time of the discovery deadline for plaintiff's expert testimony. Thereafter, Nextel moved to exclude Carota's testimony and for summary judgment. It argued that the Carota report was not accompanied by other information required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B), such as exhibits to be used at trial by the expert, a list of his publications, disclosure of compensation, and a list of other cases in which the expert has testified within the preceding four years. In the same motion, Nextel sought summary judgment on the separate ground that the report, even if believed, did not establish that the antenna had more likely than not caused the harm complained of; rather, according to Nextel, the report dwelt solely in \"could haves\" and \"possibilities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1998, the district court heard oral argument and decided the matter from the bench. It rejected the request to exclude the engineering report as a sanction for violation of discovery rules, but it entered summary judgment on the ground that the report did not purport to establish that \"more probably than not\" the antenna construction was the cause of the damage--the threshold of proof that the court said was inherent in the preponderance of the evidence standard that generally applies in civil cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the hearing, counsel for Samos Imex responded to the court that Carota would testify that when he used the phrase \"the probable cause\" in his report, he meant \"more likely than not.\" The court said that it understood the proffer to mean that if Carota was called to the stand \"he would answer that more likely than not the shifting of the building which caused the elevator to bind was [caused by] the Nextel pole.\" However, the court said that to accept this proffer as modifying the report would undermine proper case management and discovery rules and that the report itself remained \"inadequate given the required standard.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Samos Imex now appeals and, reviewing the grant of summary judgment de novo, see Cadle Co. v. Hayes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197442\"><a href=\"/opinion/197442/cadle-v-hayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span>, 960 (1st Cir. 1997), we reverse. The phrase \"probable cause\" is used, in the narrow confines of Fourth Amendment precedent, to establish a standard less demanding than \"more probable than not.\" For example, arrests--made long before all proof is assembled for a trial--can be justified as based on probable cause by showing a reasonable basis for belief that a suspect committed a crime; in many cases such a basis exists without a 50 percent-plus likelihood that the suspect is guilty. See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764690\"><a href=\"/opinion/764690/united-states-v-juan-felipe-garcia-united-states-of-america-v-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 269 (5th Cir. 1999); cf. United States v. Sokolow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard is obviously higher at trial where, in a civil suit for negligence, the plaintiff must normally show both fault and causation. To establish the latter, plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that the injury was caused by the action or event (or a combination of them) for which the defendant was responsible. See, e.g., Forlano v. Hughes, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1315</span></span>, 1319-20 (Mass. 1984); Bigwood v. Boston &amp; N. St. Ry. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></span>, 752 (Mass. 1911).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> And laymen and many judges might easily refer to such a cause as \"the probable cause\" of an accident, meaning that it was the more likely than not cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Words like \"probable\" and \"likely\" are highly elastic in common use, which is why they are often surrounded by other phrases (\"more probable than not\", \"a reasonable likelihood\"), that sometimes lend greater precision and sometimes do not. When a magistrate judge speaks of \"probable cause\" in a suppression hearing, we assume that he means a reasonable basis sufficient to satisfy the Fourth Amendment; but if a doctor testified on the stand that the probable cause of death was a heart attack, he might be expected to mean that the heart attack was more likely than not the cause of death. If the doctor meant only that a heart attack was merely one possible cause among others, it would be up to the opposing counsel to draw this out on cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, counsel for the plaintiff made an immediate proffer that the expert would testify that the monopole was more likely than not the cause of the injury and that that was what he had intended by use of the phrase \"probable cause\" in the report. If there were any doubt, it would be easy enough to conduct a brief deposition of the witness. It is one thing to allow counsel to contradict by proffer something the expert said in the report or to supply a manifest omission; in that event, case management and discovery concerns would be legitimate objections. But it is hard to justify dismissal of a case on summary judgment, based on what is at worst ambiguous language, in the face of an explicit proffer by counsel that the witness meant just what many readers would expect the witness to have intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, further in the Carota report he used phrases like \"could have caused\" and the like, and Nextel presses this point on appeal. But the main use of these phrases, which occur in the same paragraph as the \"probable cause\" statement, are actually references to multiple causes all of which related to the construction or operation of the antenna and for all of which Nextel would likely be responsible (absent some further explanation). So long as Nextel was responsible for all of the possible causes, it would not matter whether the precise causal path could be identified. See, e.g., Solimene v. B. Grauel &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></span>, 667 &amp; n.12 (Mass. 1987); Carey v. General Motors Corp., 387 Mass. N.E.2d 583, 585-86 (Mass. 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case in which the witness mouths the proper conclusion but the detailed explanation in his report or proffered testimony clearly contradicts or provides no arguable foundation for the conclusion. See, e.g., Colantuonis v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1994). Nor does this appear to be a case in which the expert was talking generally about why buildings collapse without reaching a conclusion as to why this specific building had shifted; on the contrary, the pivotal sentence in the probable cause section of the report (quoted above) spoke of \"the probable cause\" of the shifting of \"this three-story brick building.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nextel was free to depose Carota to clarify his \"could have\" references, but it was not entitled to summary judgment on the present state of the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nextel asks us to affirm the district court's decision on a distinct \"alternative\" ground, namely, the alleged failure of Nextel to comply with discovery rules by furnishing required information about the expert. At one point in the transcript the district court appears squarely to have rejected such a claim of violation as the basis for excluding Carota's testimony, hardly a choice comprising a patent abuse of discretion. In effect, Nextel is asking us to conclude that there was a violation of the discovery rules and that it was of such a character as to compel the district court to exclude the report as a sanction for this violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that as amended, the civil procedure rules make clear that exclusion of evidence is a standard sanction for a violation of duty of disclosure under Rule 26(a). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c); Klonoski v. Mahlab, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198131\"><a href=\"/opinion/198131/klonoski-v-mahlab/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1998). But this is far from saying that the district court is obligated to exclude evidence based on a failure, long before trial and likely subject to correction without much harm to the opposing party; nor do we know whether there may be some \"justification\" for any failure to disclose. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). In all events, on remand the district court is free to enforce its discovery rules by ordering compliance, sanctions, or any other appropriate remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no bias whatever against summary judgment or against opinions from the bench, both of which are often marks of efficient management. But where a building incurs harm after significant nearby construction and an expert calls the construction \"the probable cause,\" we think that more is needed to support summary judgment than an easily resolved doubt as to whether the expert meant \"more probable than not.\" There may well be more to the story, but we can only act on what the record discloses. Nothing precludes a renewed motion for summary judgment if and when Carota is deposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts cases sometimes describe the standard as requiring the plaintiff to show that \"there was greater likelihood or probability that the harm complained of was due to causes for which the defendant was responsible than from any other cause.\" Carey v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></span>, 585 (Mass. 1979) (quoting McLaughlin v. Bernstein, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span>, 22 (Mass. 1969)). But it is highly doubtful that this would allow liability based on a less-likely-than-not cause merely because it is more likely than any other single cause.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> While the basis for the conclusion could certainly be explored in a deposition and may yet be vulnerable, this seems to us quite different than the situation--briefly adverted to by the district court--in which the Surgeon General speaks of smoking in general as the probable cause of cancer without reaching any conclusion as to a specific death.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
