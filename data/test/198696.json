Hallisey for appellants Edward E. Lombard, et al.\r\n   David S. Mackey, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nOctober 26, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This appeal arises out of a title\r\ndispute between a family and the United States over an 8.6 acre\r\nparcel, known as the Lombard lot, containing within it a family\r\ncemetery and located in the Bound Brook Island area of Wellfleet,\r\nCape Cod, Massachusetts.  The lot was once owned by Thomas Lombard,\r\nwho died in 1873, leaving it to his five children as tenants in\r\ncommon.  Then, in 1924, two of the children conveyed their\r\ninterests to one George Higgins, possibly saying that they owned\r\nthe entire parcel.  In all events, George Higgins thereafter\r\nclaimed ownership of the entire parcel and not just of the 40\r\npercent that the two children had actually owned.\r\nIn 1935, Higgins petitioned the Massachusetts Land Court\r\nto register and confirm his sole title to nearly 150 acres of land\r\nin the Bound Brook Island area, including the 8.6 acre Lombard lot. \r\nOne of Thomas Lombard's grandsons appeared in the suit, claiming an\r\ninterest, and at Higgins's request, the suit so far as it pertained\r\nto the Lombard lot was severed from the rest. The court then\r\nconfirmed Higgins's title to the other land, but the severed case\r\ninvolving the Lombard lot remained dormant until 1958, when it was\r\nordered dismissed without prejudice; through apparent error, the\r\ndismissal order was not properly docketed and, in 1976, the land\r\ncourt sua sponte docketed an order dismissing the severed case for\r\nlack of prosecution.\r\nIn the meantime, in the 1960s the United States\r\nestablished the Cape Cod National Seashore by acquiring large\r\namounts of land in Wellfleet and neighboring communities.  In 1962,\r\nHiggins agreed to sell the Lombard lot to the United States--all of\r\nit, not just a 40 percent interest--and the deed was recorded in\r\nthe Barnstable County Registry of Deeds on December 31, 1962.\r\nHowever, the government was aware of potential claims by Lombard\r\ndescendants--the title search report incident to the sale so\r\nindicated--and by agreement with Higgins, it withheld the purchase\r\nprice for the Lombard lot (apparently $13,500) so that Higgins\r\ncould clear up the defect.\r\nThis Higgins sought to do by a quiet title action,\r\nbrought in October 1963 in the Barnstable County Superior Court,\r\nnaming as defendants among others the heirs of Thomas Lombard. \r\nService was made by publication, and a deputy sheriff certified\r\nthat despite a diligent search he had found none of the heirs\r\nwithin his precinct.  A guardian ad litem, appointed to represent\r\nthe heirs, supported Higgins's assertion that he had acquired full\r\ntitle by a combination of adverse possession and the deed from two\r\nof Thomas Lombard's children.  In August 1964, the court confirmed\r\nHiggins's title, subject to the Lombard family's ownership of the\r\ncemetery and an easement to visit it.\r\nIn April 1997, eight descendants of Thomas Lombard\r\nbrought the present lawsuit against the United States in the\r\nfederal district court in Massachusetts under the partition\r\nstatute, 28 U.S.C.  2409.  The plaintiffs, claiming through two of\r\nthe three children of Thomas Lombard who had not conveyed their\r\ninterests to Higgins, asserted that the Lombard descendants still\r\nowned 60 percent of the Lombard lot as tenants in common with the\r\nUnited States, and sought to partition their interest.  The\r\ngovernment, in addition to asserting title based on the 1964\r\ndecree, argued that the partition statute did not extend to suits\r\nin which title was disputed.\r\nDiscovery ensued as to what various Lombard descendants\r\nknew at different times about title to the Lombard lot and related\r\nmatters.  The United States then moved for dismissal or summary\r\njudgment, and the plaintiffs countered with a motion for summary\r\njudgment to recognize their title and later a motion to amend the\r\ncomplaint to assert a claim under the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. \r\n2409a; this is a later-enacted companion to the partition statute\r\nthat permits a quiet title action against the United States,\r\nprovided it is brought within twelve years of the date that \"the\r\nplaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known\r\nof the claim of the United States.\"  Id.  2409a(g).\r\nIn November 1998, the district court granted the\r\ngovernment's motion for summary judgment as to the partition\r\nstatute claim, denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment\r\nas to title, denied as futile the plaintiffs' motion for leave to\r\namend, and entered final judgment for the United States.  Lombard\r\nv. United States, 28 F. Supp. 2d 44, 50 (D. Mass. 1998).  The court\r\nruled that the partition statute authorized division only of\r\nundisputed interests in common and did not permit the court to\r\nresolve title disputes.  As for the plaintiffs' motion to amend to\r\nassert a quiet title claim under the Quiet Title Act, the court\r\nheld that the amendment would be futile because the claims of the\r\nplaintiffs, and several additional heirs who had intervened, were\r\nbarred by the twelve-year statute of limitations governing section\r\n2409a.  This appeal followed.\r\nTwo circuits have held, consistent with the district\r\ncourt's view, that  the partition statute does not allow claims by\r\na citizen whose title is disputed.  See Stubbs v. United States,\r\n620 F.2d 775, 782 (10th Cir. 1980); Rambo v. United States, 145\r\nF.2d 670, 671 (5th Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 324 U.S. 848 (1945). \r\nRambo, the only decision that offers much analysis, 145 F.2d at\r\n671, reasoned that, historically, partition actions did not resolve\r\ntitle disputes; that waivers of sovereign immunity are strictly\r\nconstrued; and that (as of 1944) the United States had not\r\nconsented to suits against it to resolve title disputes as to\r\nproperty it purported to own.  145 F.2d at 671.  \r\nOf course, the last of these concerns was eliminated in\r\n1972 when Congress adopted the Quiet Title Act, explicitly\r\nauthorizing quiet title actions against the United States and\r\nthereby waiving sovereign immunity as to such claims.  See Act of\r\nOct. 25, 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-562,  3(a), 86 Stat. 1176 (codified\r\nas amended at 28 U.S.C.  2409a).  Conversely, even if we were to\r\nread the partition statute now to embrace cases of disputed title,\r\nwe could hardly ignore the explicit twelve-year statute of\r\nlimitations on quiet title disputes.  See 28 U.S.C.  2409a(g). \r\nThe rationale for limiting the partition statute to undisputed\r\ntitles may have vanished in 1972, but any effort to read the two\r\nstatutes in light of each other works both ways:  if the partition\r\nstatute allows the court to resolve incidental title disputes (a\r\npoint we need not decide), it is so only if the suit is brought\r\nwithin the twelve year limitations period.\r\nThis brings us to the statute of limitations issue. \r\nFormally, the district court merely denied the plaintiffs' motion\r\nto amend, which the government claims is a step reviewed solely for\r\n\"abuse of discretion.\"  This would be so if the district court had\r\nsaid that the amendment came too late based on concerns about case\r\nmanagement.  See Credit Francais Int'l v. Bio-Vita, 78 F.3d 698,\r\n704 n.9 (1st Cir. 1996).  But as we read the district court's\r\ndecision, it rests squarely on a finding that the amendment would\r\nbe futile because the plaintiffs' quiet title claim is barred by\r\nthe statute of limitations, a finding that it supports with a\r\ndetailed discussion of the facts.\r\nIf the same Lombard plaintiffs now brought a new action\r\nunder the quiet title statute, the United States would assert that\r\nthe district court's finding was res judicata on the limitations\r\nissue.  Thus, we treat the district court decision just as if the\r\ndistrict court had granted the motion to amend and then dismissed\r\nthe new claim on the ground that the statute of limitations had\r\nrun.  See Jones v. New York State Division of Military and Naval\r\nAffairs, 166 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir. 1999); Fisher v. Roberts, 125\r\nF.3d 974, 977 (6th Cir. 1997).  Ordinarily, a grant of summary\r\ndismissal invites de novo review on appeal.  See Cadle Co. v.\r\nHayes, 116 F.3d 957, 960 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nThe district court ruled that the Lombard heirs had\r\nenough information to alert them over twelve years ago to the\r\ngovernment's adverse claim to the Lombard lot and--this is a\r\nsomewhat different point--that many of the plaintiffs acknowledged\r\nby their admissions and actions that they thought that they had no\r\ninterest in the property.  Specifically, the district court found\r\nthe following as to some, or all, of the plaintiffs:\r\n    That \"most of the plaintiffs have\r\nbelieved for decades  that David Lombard had\r\nstolen [the Lombard lot] . . . and sold it to\r\nHiggins\" and \"[i]n light of the widespread\r\nfamily knowledge of the sale [to Higgins] over\r\nsuch a long period of time, they could easily\r\nhave learned the status of the property by\r\nmaking inquiry\";\r\n\n    That some of the plaintiffs recalled\r\nlearning of the Cape Cod National Seashore in\r\nthe 1960s, and that \"most knew that the United\r\nStates had acquired the Brook Bound (sic)\r\nIsland property for that purpose [the Cape Cod\r\nNational Seashore]\"; and \r\n\n    That the plaintiffs did not pay\r\nproperty taxes on the land surrounding the\r\ncemetery, did not maintain that land, did not\r\noccupy it and did not assert ownership to the\r\nNational Park Service or the Town of\r\nWellfleet, but at most \"occasionally visited\r\nthe family cemetery, picked blueberries, and\r\nhad picnics on the adjacent property.\"\r\nLombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49.\r\nThe district court's finding that as early as the 1960s,\r\n\"most [of the plaintiffs] knew that the United States had acquired\r\nthe Brook Bound (sic) Island property for that purpose,\" could be\r\ntaken as a reference to the Lombard lot itself.  If so read and\r\nadequately supported in the record, this would resolve this case in\r\nfavor of the United States:  it would mean that such plaintiffs had\r\nactual knowledge of the government's claim to the Lombard lot as\r\nfar back as the 1960s.  Yet we cannot find any unambiguous record\r\nevidence that any of the plaintiffs knew prior to this suit that\r\nthe government had acquired the Lombard lot or any interest in it.\r\nAmple evidence in the record shows that some plaintiffs\r\nknew that the government was purchasing property on Cape Cod for\r\nthe purpose of creating the National Seashore.  There is even some\r\nindication that individual plaintiffs had sold other property to\r\nthe government for this purpose, although it is unclear whether\r\nthis property was in the Bound Brook Island area.  In all\r\nlikelihood, the district court's quoted finding meant only that the\r\nplaintiffs knew that the government was buying property for the\r\nNational Seashore in Wellfleet, including property in the Bound\r\nBrook Island area.\r\nOf course, the statute of limitations does not require\r\nactual knowledge of the government's claim.  If other facts known\r\ntwelve or more years before this action was brought would have\r\nprompted a reasonable landowner to make further inquiries, which in\r\nturn would have led to knowledge of the government's claim, then\r\nthe statute bars the owner because he \"should have known\" of the\r\ngovernment's claim.  And had the plaintiffs' suspicions been\r\naroused, the government's claim would have been easy to discover,\r\neither by asking national seashore officials or looking at the\r\ntitle records at the Barnstable registry.\r\nBut what events fairly charged the plaintiffs with\r\nreasonable suspicions requiring further inquiry?  Merely to say\r\nthat the government was buying land somewhere in Wellfleet or the\r\nBound Brook Island area for its national park is hardly enough, and\r\nthere is little to show the location of government land purchases\r\nknown to individual plaintiffs.  About the most one can say is that\r\nthis background knowledge of purchases in the area might have added\r\nto suspicions of a government claim to the Lombard lot if there\r\nwere other, more specific indications suggesting that the\r\ngovernment was claiming ownership of the Lombard lot.  \r\nElsewhere in the opinion the district court noted that\r\nthe government had erected a locked gate somewhere on the road to\r\nthe family cemetery, see Lombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49-50, and there\r\nis also an indication in the record that at some point trees grew\r\nup around the road making it difficult for cars to pass.  At least\r\nsome of the plaintiffs knew that the gate was under the\r\ngovernment's control; one of the plaintiffs had complained and the\r\ngovernment had provided a key to the gate, although it did not\r\nremove the barrier.  We agree that, if the government puts a gate\r\nat the entrance to your property, this is ordinarily sufficient\r\nnotice to warrant inquiry.  Cf. Park County, Montana, 626 F.2d at\r\n721 n.6; Grosz, 556 F.2d at 975; Howell, 519 F. Supp. at 304-06.\r\nThe plaintiffs argue that any knowledge that the\r\ngovernment was exercising some proprietorship over the Lombard lot\r\nwould have been consistent with a belief that the government owned\r\n40 percent and would not suggest that the government was claiming\r\nownership of the 60 percent interest now claimed by the Lombard\r\nheirs.  Perhaps so if the plaintiffs knew that a 40 percent\r\nownership interest had been claimed by Higgins and that the\r\ngovernment had been dealing with him to acquire his interest.  But\r\nnone of the plaintiffs claim to have known anything about the sale\r\nby Higgins to the government of his Lombard lot interest.\r\nThe more serious problem with the gate argument is that\r\nnothing in the testimony or crude maps in the record indicates to\r\nus precisely where the gate was placed in relation to the property\r\nline of the Lombard lot.  For example, if the gate was just at the\r\nproperty line of the Lombard lot, this might support an inference\r\nthat the government was claiming ownership of the lot.  But if the\r\ngate were on a portion of the road leading to the Lombard lot but\r\nnot yet actually within the lot, it might have been put there\r\nsimply to limit access to other government property through which\r\nthe road ran before reaching the Lombard lot.  In that event, it\r\nwould not necessarily suggest that the government was claiming\r\nownership of the lot itself, and providing a key to the gate would\r\nbe consistent with recognizing an easement over the road to reach\r\nthe Lombard lot, cf. Schultz v. Department of Army, 886 F.2d 1157,\r\n1159-61 &amp; n.2 (9th Cir. 1989).\r\nIt is worth adding that the district court's opinion did\r\nnot rely at all on the gate in giving its reasons why the claim was\r\nbarred.  The gate was mentioned only briefly in setting out the\r\nfacts.  See Lombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49-50.  The government refers\r\nto it merely as part of a bouillabaisse description of all of the\r\npossible facts that it thinks in any way support an inference of\r\nknowledge or suspicion.  Only with more detailed and specific\r\nfindings by the district court could the gate help to show that the\r\nplaintiffs \"should have known\" of a government claim to own the\r\nLombard lot.\r\nThe district court pointed to two other sets of facts:\r\nthat a number of plaintiffs thought that the Lombard lot had been\r\nstolen by Higgins long ago and that the heirs did not pay property\r\ntaxes, maintain the lot, live there, assert ownership, or visit it\r\nexcept occasionally.  See Lombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49.  There is\r\nnot much information about taxation rates and enforcement but, this\r\naside, we agree with the district court that these facts support an\r\ninference that for some years the plaintiffs might well have\r\nthought that they had no claim at all to the Lombard lot.  Rising\r\nproperty prices, it may be supposed, have now prompted a closer\r\nlook.\r\nIf we were concerned with laches or other equitable\r\nlimitations, all this might be grist for the mill.  But the statute\r\nof limitations in this case is triggered only if the plaintiffs\r\nknew or should have known of the government's claim, compare United\r\nStates v. Beggerly, 118 S. Ct. 1862, 1868 (1998); that for other\r\nreasons they may have doubted their own title is beside the point\r\nunless this fact fits into a set of inferences suggesting that they\r\nbelieved or should have believed that the government claimed title. \r\nThis might well be the case if they had known of Higgins's sale to\r\nthe government, but the record is at best uncertain on this point.\r\nOne might ask why it matters whether the plaintiffs knew\r\nof the government's claim or merely lacked faith in their own.  The\r\nanswer is that an owner does not normally forfeit his ownership of\r\nreal property through ignorance of his title, unless adverse\r\npossession is established (and that requires a showing of notorious\r\npossession and often for more than twelve years).  See, e.g., Eno\r\n&amp; Hovey, 28 Massachusetts Practice  27.1, at 560-62 (3d ed. 1995). \r\nIn waiving sovereign immunity to quiet title actions against it,\r\nthe government established a special limitations period favorable\r\nto itself, but only where the property ownership knew or should\r\nhave known that the government claimed ownership (and then failed\r\nto dispute it within the period).\r\nThus far, we have treated the plaintiffs as a group and\r\nmade reference to the district court's findings of what \"most\" or\r\n\"many\" of the plaintiffs knew.  Strictly speaking, the Quiet Title\r\nAct, subject to certain qualifications, requires that each\r\nplaintiff's claim be assessed individually, meaning that some may\r\nlose their claims while others may not, depending on individual\r\nknowledge.  See, e.g., Klugh v. United States, 818 F.2d 294, 299\r\n(4th Cir. 1987).  The district court made some effort to\r\ndistinguish among groups of heirs based on their level of\r\nknowledge.\r\nIf the parties did not object to composite plaintiffs or\r\ntreatment of them collectively by group, this might be a reasonable\r\napproach for litigation, adopted by implicit agreement.  Here,\r\nclaimed shares of individual plaintiffs are rather minute (they\r\nappear in this case to range from 1/15 to 1/300); and an  heir-by-\r\nheir analysis might well be costly and productive of only minute\r\nvictories.  We mention the issue only to avoid any implicit\r\nendorsement of the composite or grouping approach as a general\r\nconstruction of the statute.\r\nWe turn now to plaintiffs' further claim that they were\r\nentitled to judgment in their favor on the issue of title.  Their\r\nargument is that the 1976 dismissal of  Higgins's original \"severed\r\ncase,\" in which he sought to acquire from the state land court a\r\ndeclaration of full ownership over the lot, was a dismissal \"with\r\nprejudice\" under state law; that this dismissal therefore\r\ndetermined that Higgins owned only 40 percent of the Lombard lot\r\nand the heirs owned the remainder; and that the federal district\r\ncourt was required under the Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1738, to accept this determination as binding in the\r\npresent action against the United States.\r\nBecause the original 1958 order of the land court made\r\nclear that the dismissal of the severed action was intended to be\r\nwithout prejudice, it would not normally result in claim\r\npreclusion, see Restatement (Second) of Judgments  20 (1982), and\r\nsince no facts were actually resolved in the case at all, there\r\ncannot be issue preclusion under ordinary doctrine.  See id.  27. \r\nStill, plaintiffs say that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185,  44 (1998)\r\nrequires a different conclusion because the 1976 cleanup order did\r\nnot say expressly that it was without prejudice.  The statute\r\nreads:\r\n  If the court finds that the plaintiff has not\r\ntitle proper for registration, a judgment\r\nshall be entered dismissing the complaint, and\r\nsuch judgment may be ordered to be without\r\nprejudice, in whole or in part, but unless so\r\nordered it shall bind the parties, their\r\nprivies and the land in respect of any issue\r\nof fact which has been tried and determined.\r\n\n Even if we assume that section 44 applies--which is\r\nunclear--the most one could say is that section 44 might then\r\ntreat a judgment of dismissal, where silent, as \"bind[ing] the\r\nparties, their privies and the land in respect of any issue of fact\r\nwhich has been tried and determined.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  But\r\nno issue of fact was tried and determined in the severed case.  At\r\nmost a dismissal with prejudice might mean that Higgins could not\r\nbring the same action again.\r\nThe plaintiffs also rely on McCarthy v. Town of Oak\r\nBluffs, 643 N.E.2d 1015 (Mass. 1994).  There, as here, a\r\nregistration case in the land court was thereafter severed into\r\ntwo--one for property claimed east of a specific mean low water\r\nline and the other for land west of the line.  See 643 N.E.2d at\r\n1018.  The former case was pursued and resulted in a decree of\r\nregistration in 1960; the latter was dismissed in 1977 for lack of\r\nprosecution.  See id.  Thereafter, privies of the plaintiffs\r\nbrought a new suit asserting title to the western portion, the\r\nsubject of the dismissed suit, and the court held that the new suit\r\ncould not be brought.  See id. at 1019.\r\nBut the court's reasons destroy the parallel with the\r\npresent case.  The land court held in the new suit that the earlier\r\none had made a factual determination of the western boundary of the\r\nproperty; and it was this finding to which the court gave\r\npreclusive effect.  See id. at 1018-19, 1021.  Further, it found\r\nthat the original plaintiffs had signed a stipulation stating that\r\nthey had no interest in land westward of the line, that licenses\r\nthey had taken confirmed that concession, and that state law made\r\nit illegal for them to own land westward of the line.  See id. at\r\n1018-19.  Thus McCarthy is not on point.\r\nTo sum up, we conclude that the rejection of the proposed\r\namendment to the complaint cannot on this record be supported on\r\nthe ground given for the denial.  However, the plaintiffs' full\r\nfaith and credit argument is without merit and to prevail\r\nultimately, the plaintiffs would have to avoid the 1964 quiet title\r\njudgment and defeat a likely claim by the government that Higgins\r\nhad obtained full title to the Lombard lot by adverse possession. \r\nAnd if title to fractional interests were established by\r\nplaintiffs, problems of remedy would remain.\r\nSuch issues could be costly and time consuming to\r\nlitigate on both sides.  And, while the government's hands are not\r\nperfectly clean (given its actual knowledge of Higgins's doubtful\r\npaper title to the whole), the plaintiffs are in some measure\r\nseeking a windfall from property widely thought to have been lost\r\nlong ago by the family.  All this suggests that both sides might be\r\nwell advised to renew their earlier, unsuccessful efforts to settle\r\nthe case.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is vacated and the\r\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.  Our judgment reinstates the partition statute claim\r\nmerely as a contingent remedy available if and when the plaintiffs\r\ncan establish ownership under the Quiet Title Act by satisfying the\r\nstatute of limitations and all other prerequisites.  Nothing in our\r\ndecision precludes a further motion for summary judgment by the\r\ngovernment on statute of limitations grounds (assuming a more\r\ndeveloped record) or any other ground available to it.\r\nIt is so ordered.\r\n",

Hallisey for appellants Edward E. Lombard, et al.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David S. Mackey, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Donald K.

The lot was once owned by Thomas Lombard, who died in 1873, leaving it to his five children as tenants in common. Then, in 1924, two of the children conveyed their interests to one George Higgins, possibly saying that they owned the entire parcel.  In all events, George Higgins thereafter claimed ownership of the entire parcel and not just of the 40 percent that the two children had actually owned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1935, Higgins petitioned the Massachusetts Land Court to register and confirm his sole title to nearly 150 acres of land in the Bound Brook Island area, including the 8.6 acre Lombard lot. One of Thomas Lombard's grandsons appeared in the suit, claiming an interest, and at Higgins's request, the suit so far as it pertained to the Lombard lot was severed from the rest. The court then confirmed Higgins's title to the other land, but the severed case involving the Lombard lot remained dormant until 1958, when it was ordered dismissed without prejudice; through apparent error, the dismissal order was not properly docketed and, in 1976, the land court sua sponte docketed an order dismissing the severed case for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, in the 1960s the United States established the Cape Cod National Seashore by acquiring large amounts of land in Wellfleet and neighboring communities. In 1962, Higgins agreed to sell the Lombard lot to the United States--all of it, not just a 40 percent interest--and the deed was recorded in the Barnstable  County Registry of Deeds on December 31, 1962. However, the government was aware of potential claims by Lombard descendants--the title search report incident to the sale so indicated--and by agreement with Higgins, it withheld the purchase price for the Lombard lot (apparently $13,500) so that Higgins could clear up the defect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Higgins sought to do by a quiet title action, brought in October 1963 in the Barnstable County Superior Court, naming as defendants among others the heirs of Thomas Lombard. Service was made by publication, and a deputy sheriff certified that despite a diligent search he had found none of the heirs within his precinct. A guardian ad litem, appointed to represent the heirs, supported Higgins's assertion that he had acquired full title by a combination of adverse possession and the deed from two of Thomas Lombard's children. In August 1964, the court confirmed Higgins's title, subject  to the Lombard family's ownership of the cemetery and an easement to visit it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1997, eight descendants of Thomas Lombard brought the present lawsuit against the United States in the federal district court in Massachusetts under the partition statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409. The plaintiffs, claiming through two of the three children of Thomas Lombard who had not conveyed their interests to Higgins, asserted that the Lombard descendants still owned 60 percent of the Lombard lot as tenants in common with the United States, and sought to partition their interest. The government, in addition to asserting title based on the 1964 decree, argued that the partition statute did not extend to suits in which title was disputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discovery ensued as to what various Lombard descendants knew at different times about title to the Lombard lot and related matters. The United States then moved for dismissal or summary judgment, and the plaintiffs countered with a motion for summary judgment to recognize their title and later a motion to amend the complaint to assert a claim under the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409a; this is a later-enacted companion to the partition statute that permits a quiet title action against the United States, provided it is brought within twelve years of the date that \"the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United States.\" Id. &#167; 2409a(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1998, the district court granted the government's motion for summary judgment as to the partition statute claim, denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to title, denied as futile the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend, and entered final judgment for the United States. Lombard v. United States, 28 F. Supp. 2d 44, 50 (D. Mass. 1998). The court ruled that the partition statute authorized division only of undisputed interests in common and did not permit the court to resolve title disputes. As for the plaintiffs' motion to amend to assert a quiet title claim under the Quiet Title Act, the court held that the amendment would be futile because the claims of the plaintiffs, and several additional heirs who had intervened, were barred by the twelve-year statute of limitations governing section 2409a. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuits have held, consistent with the district court's view, that the partition statute does not allow claims by a citizen whose title is disputed. See Stubbs v. United States, 620 F.2d 775, 782 (10th Cir. 1980);  Rambo v. United States, 145 F.2d 670, 671 (5th Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 324 U.S. 848 (1945). Rambo, the only decision that offers much analysis, 145 F.2d at 671, reasoned that, historically, partition actions did not resolve title disputes; that waivers of sovereign immunity are strictly construed; and that (as of 1944) the United States had not consented to suits against it to resolve title disputes as to property it purported to own. 145 F.2d at 671.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the last of these concerns was eliminated in 1972 when Congress adopted the Quiet Title Act, explicitly authorizing quiet title actions against the United States and thereby waiving sovereign immunity as to such claims. See Act of Oct. 25, 1972, Pub. L.  No. 92-562, &#167; 3(a), 86 Stat. 1176 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409a). Conversely, even if we were to read the partition statute now to embrace cases of disputed title, we could hardly ignore the explicit twelve-year statute of limitations on quiet title disputes. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409a(g). The rationale for limiting the partition statute to undisputed titles may have vanished in 1972, but any effort to read the two statutes in light of each other works both ways: if the partition statute allows the court to resolve incidental title disputes (a point we need not decide), it is so only if the suit is brought within the twelve year limitations period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the statute of limitations issue. Formally, the district court merely denied the plaintiffs' motion to amend, which the government claims is a step reviewed solely for \"abuse of discretion.\" This would be so if the district court had said that the amendment came too late based on concerns about case management.  See Credit Francais Int'l v. Bio-Vita, 78 F.3d 698, 704 n.9 (1st Cir. 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But as we read the district court's decision, it rests squarely on a finding that the amendment would be futile because the plaintiffs' quiet title claim is barred by the statute of limitations, a finding that it supports with a detailed discussion of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the same Lombard plaintiffs now brought a new action under the quiet title statute, the United States would assert that the district court's finding was res judicata on the limitations issue. Thus, we treat the district court decision just as if the district court had granted the motion to amend and then dismissed the new claim on the ground that the statute of limitations had run. See Jones v. New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs, 166 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir. 1999); Fisher v. Roberts, 125 F.3d 974, 977 (6th Cir. 1997). Ordinarily, a grant of summary dismissal invites de novo review on appeal. See Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 960 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that the Lombard heirs had enough information to alert them over twelve years ago to the government's adverse claim to the Lombard lot and--this is a somewhat different point--that many of the plaintiffs acknowledged by their admissions and actions that they thought that they had no interest in the property. Specifically, the district court found the following as to some, or all, of the plaintiffs:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\tThat \"most of the plaintiffs have believed for decades that David Lombard had stolen [the Lombard lot] . . . and sold it to Higgins\" and \"[i]n light of the widespread family knowledge of the sale [to Higgins] over such a long period of time, they could easily have learned the status of the property by making inquiry\";</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\tThat some of the plaintiffs recalled learning of the Cape Cod National Seashore in the 1960s, and that \"most knew that the United States had acquired the Brook Bound (sic) Island property for that purpose [the Cap e Cod National Seashore]\"; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\tThat the plaintiffs did not pay property taxes on the land surrounding the cemetery, did not maintain that land, did not occupy it and did not assert ownership to the National Park Service or the Town of Wellfleet, but at most \"occasionally visited the family cemetery, picked blueberries, and had picnics on the adjacent property.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's finding that as early as the 1960s, \"most [of the plaintiffs] knew that the United States had acquired the Brook Bound (sic) Island property for that purpose,\" could be taken as a reference to the Lombard lot itself. If so read and adequately supported in the record, this would resolve this case in favor of the United States: it would mean that such plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the government's claim to the Lombard lot as far back as the 1960s. Yet we cannot find any unambiguous record evidence that any of the plaintiffs knew prior to this suit that the government had acquired the Lombard lot or any interest in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ample evidence in the record shows that some plaintiffs knew that the government was purchasing property on Cape Cod for the purpose of creating the National Seashore. There is even some indication that individual plaintiffs had sold other property to the government for this purpose, although it is unclear whether this property was in the Bound Brook Island area. In all likelihood, the district court's quoted finding meant only that the plaintiffs knew that the government was buying property for the National Seashore in Wellfleet, including property in the Bound Brook Island area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the statute of limitations does not require actual knowledge of the government's claim. If other facts known twelve or more years before this action was brought would have prompted a reasonable landowner to make further inquiries, which in turn would have led to knowledge of the government's claim, then the statute bars the owner because he \"should have known\" of the government's claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> And had the plaintiffs' suspicions been aroused, the government's claim would have been easy to discover, either by asking national seashore officials or looking at the title records at the Barnstable registry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But what events fairly charged the plaintiffs with reasonable suspicions requiring further inquiry? Merely to say that the government was buying land somewhere in Wellfleet or the Bound Brook Island area for its national park is hardly enough, and there is little to show the location of government land purchases known to individual plaintiffs. About the most one can say is that this background knowledge of purchases in the area might have added to suspicions of a government claim to the Lombard lot if there were other, more specific indications suggesting that the government was claiming ownership of the Lombard lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elsewhere in the opinion the district court noted that the government had erected a locked gate somewhere on the road to the family cemetery, see Lombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49-50, and there is also an indication in the record that at some point trees grew up around the road making it difficult for cars to pass. At least some of the plaintiffs knew that the gate was under the government's control; one of the plaintiffs had complained and the government had provided a key to the gate, although it did not remove the barrier. We agree that, if the government puts a gate at the entrance to your property, this is ordinarily sufficient notice to warrant inquiry. Cf. Park County, Montana, 626 F.2d at 721 n.6; Grosz, 556 F.2d at 975; Howell, 519 F. Supp. at 304-06.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that any knowledge that the government was exercising some proprietorship over the Lombard lot would have been consistent with a belief that the government owned 40 percent and would not suggest that the government was claiming ownership of the 60 percent interest now claimed by the Lombard heirs. Perhaps so if the plaintiffs knew that a 40 percent ownership interest had been claimed by Higgins and that the government had been dealing with him to acquire his interest. But none of the plaintiffs claim to have known anything about the sale by Higgins to the government of his Lombard lot interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more serious problem with the gate argument is that nothing in the testimony or crude maps in the record indicates to us precisely where the gate was placed in relation to the property line of the Lombard lot. For example, if the gate was just at the property line of the Lombard lot, this might support an inference that the government was claiming ownership of the lot. But if the gate were on a portion of the road leading to the Lombard lot but not yet actually within the lot, it might have been put there simply to limit access to other government property through which the road ran before reaching the Lombard lot. In that event, it would not necessarily suggest that the government was claiming ownership of the lot itself, and providing a key to the gate would be consistent with recognizing an easement over the road to reach the Lombard lot, cf. Schultz v. Department of Army, 886 F.2d 1157, 1159-61 &amp; n.2 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is worth adding that the district court's opinion did not rely at all on the gate in giving its reasons why the claim was barred. The gate was mentioned only briefly in setting out the facts. See Lombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49-50. The government refers to it merely as part of a bouillabaisse description of all of the possible facts that it thinks in any way support an inference of knowledge or suspicion. Only with more detailed and specific findings by the district court could the gate help to show that the plaintiffs \"should have known\" of a government claim to own the Lombard lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court pointed to two other sets of facts: that a number of plaintiffs thought that the Lombard lot had been stolen by Higgins long ago and that the heirs did not pay property taxes, maintain the lot, live there, assert ownership, or visit it except occasionally. See Lombard, 28 F. Supp.2d at 49. There is not much information about taxation rates and enforcement but, this aside, we agree with the district court that these facts support an inference that for some years the plaintiffs might well have thought that they had no claim at all to the Lombard lot. Rising property prices, it may be supposed, have now prompted a closer look.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were concerned with laches or other equitable limitations, all this might be grist for the mill. But the statute of limitations in this case is triggered only if the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the government's claim, compare United States v. Beggerly, 118 S. Ct. 1862, 1868 (1998); that for other reasons they may have doubted their own title is beside the point unless this fact fits into a set of inferences suggesting that they believed or should have believed that the government claimed title. This might well be the case if they had known of Higgins's sale to the government, but the record is at best uncertain on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might ask why it matters whether the plaintiffs knew of the government's claim or merely lacked faith in their own. The answer is that an owner does not normally forfeit his ownership of real property through ignorance of his title, unless adverse possession is established (and that requires a showing of notorious possession and often for more than twelve years). See, e.g., Eno &amp; Hovey, 28 Massachusetts Practice &#167; 27.1, at 560-62 (3d ed. 1995). In waiving sovereign immunity to quiet title actions against it, the government established a special limitations period favorable to itself, but only where the property ownership knew or should have known that the government claimed ownership (and then failed to dispute it within the period).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far, we have treated the plaintiffs as a group and made reference to the district court's findings of what \"most\" or \"many\" of the plaintiffs knew. Strictly speaking, the Quiet Title Act, subject to certain qualifications, requires that each plaintiff's claim be assessed individually, meaning that some may lose their claims while others may not, depending on individual knowledge. See, e.g., Klugh v. United States, 818 F.2d 294, 299 (4th Cir. 1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court made some effort to distinguish among groups of heirs based on their level of knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the parties did not object to composite plaintiffs or treatment of them collectively by group, this might be a reasonable approach for litigation, adopted by implicit agreement. Here, claimed shares of individual plaintiffs are rather minute (they appear in this case to range from 1/15 to 1/300); and an heir-by-heir analysis might well be costly and productive of only minute victories. We mention the issue only to avoid any implicit endorsement of the composite or grouping approach as a general construction of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to plaintiffs' further claim that they were entitled to judgment in their favor on the issue of title. Their argument is that the 1976 dismissal of Higgins's original \"severed case,\" in which he sought to acquire from the state land court a declaration of full ownership over the lot, was a dismissal \"with prejudice\" under state law; that this dismissal therefore determined that Higgins owned only 40 percent of the Lombard lot and the heirs owned the remainder; and that the federal district court was required under the Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, to accept this determination as binding in the present action against the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the original 1958 order of the land court made clear that the dismissal of the severed action was intended to be without prejudice, it would not normally result in claim preclusion, see Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 20 (1982), and since no facts were actually resolved in the case at all, there cannot be issue preclusion under ordinary doctrine. See id. &#167; 27. Still, plaintiffs say that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185, &#167; 44 (1998) requires a different conclusion because the 1976 cleanup order did not say expressly that it was without prejudice. The statute reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court finds that the plaintiff has not title proper for registration, a judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint, and such judgment may be ordered to be without prejudice, in whole or in part, but unless so ordered it shall bind the parties, their privies and the land in respect of any issue of fact which has been tried and determined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that section 44 applies--which is unclear<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>--the most one could say is that section 44 might then treat a judgment of dismissal, where silent, as \"bind[ing] the parties, their privies and the land in respect of any issue of fact which has been tried and determined.\" Id. (emphasis added). But no issue of fact was tried and determined in the severed case. At most a dismissal with prejudice might mean that Higgins could not bring the same action again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also rely on McCarthy v. Town of Oak Bluffs, 643 N.E.2d 1015 (Mass. 1994). There, as here, a registration case in the land court was thereafter severed into two--one for property claimed east of a specific mean low water line and the other for land west of the line. See 643 N.E.2d at 1018. The former case was pursued and resulted in a decree of registration in 1960; the latter was dismissed in 1977 for lack of prosecution. See id. Thereafter, privies of the plaintiffs brought a new suit asserting title to the western portion, the subject of the dismissed suit, and the court held that the new suit could not be brought. See id. at 1019.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the court's reasons destroy the parallel with the present case. The land court held in the new suit that the earlier one had made a factual determination of the western boundary of the property; and it was this finding to which the court gave preclusive effect. See id. at 1018-19, 1021. Further, it found that the original plaintiffs had signed a stipulation stating that they had no interest in land westward of the line, that licenses they had taken confirmed that concession, and that state law made it ill egal for them to own land westward of the line. See id. at 1018-19. Thus McCarthy is not on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we conclude that  the rejectionof the proposed amendment to the complaint cannot on this record be supported on the ground given for the denial. However, the plaintiffs' full faith and credit argument is without merit and to prevail ultimately, the plaintiffs would have to avoid the 1964 quiet title judgment and defeat a likely claim by the government that Higgins had obtained full title to the Lombard lot by adverse possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> And if title to fractional interests were established by plaintiffs, problems of remedy would remain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such issues could be costly and time consuming to litigate on both sides. And, while the government's hands are not perfectly clean (given its actual knowledge of Higgins's doubtful paper title to the whole), the plaintiffs are in some measure seeking a windfall from property widely thought to have been lost long ago by the family. All this suggests that both sides might be well advised to renew their earlier, unsuccessful efforts to settle the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Our judgment reinstates the partition statute claim merely as a contingent remedy available if and when the plaintiffs can establish ownership under the Quiet Title Act by satisfying the statute of limitations and all other prerequisites.

The lot was once owned by Thomas Lombard, who died in 1873, leaving it to his five children as tenants in common. Then, in 1924, two of the children conveyed their interests to one George Higgins, possibly saying that they owned the entire parcel.  In all events, George Higgins thereafter claimed ownership of the entire parcel and not just of the 40 percent that the two children had actually owned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1935, Higgins petitioned the Massachusetts Land Court to register and confirm his sole title to nearly 150 acres of land in the Bound Brook Island area, including the 8.6 acre Lombard lot. One of Thomas Lombard's grandsons appeared in the suit, claiming an interest, and at Higgins's request, the suit so far as it pertained to the Lombard lot was severed from the rest. The court then confirmed Higgins's title to the other land, but the severed case involving the Lombard lot remained dormant until 1958, when it was ordered dismissed without prejudice; through apparent error, the dismissal order was not properly docketed and, in 1976, the land court sua sponte docketed an order dismissing the severed case for lack of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, in the 1960s the United States established the Cape Cod National Seashore by acquiring large amounts of land in Wellfleet and neighboring communities. In 1962, Higgins agreed to sell the Lombard lot to the United States--all of it, not just a 40 percent interest--and the deed was recorded in the Barnstable  County Registry of Deeds on December 31, 1962. However, the government was aware of potential claims by Lombard descendants--the title search report incident to the sale so indicated--and by agreement with Higgins, it withheld the purchase price for the Lombard lot (apparently $13,500) so that Higgins could clear up the defect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Higgins sought to do by a quiet title action, brought in October 1963 in the Barnstable County Superior Court, naming as defendants among others the heirs of Thomas Lombard. Service was made by publication, and a deputy sheriff certified that despite a diligent search he had found none of the heirs within his precinct. A guardian ad litem, appointed to represent the heirs, supported Higgins's assertion that he had acquired full title by a combination of adverse possession and the deed from two of Thomas Lombard's children. In August 1964, the court confirmed Higgins's title, subject  to the Lombard family's ownership of the cemetery and an easement to visit it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1997, eight descendants of Thomas Lombard brought the present lawsuit against the United States in the federal district court in Massachusetts under the partition statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409. The plaintiffs, claiming through two of the three children of Thomas Lombard who had not conveyed their interests to Higgins, asserted that the Lombard descendants still owned 60 percent of the Lombard lot as tenants in common with the United States, and sought to partition their interest. The government, in addition to asserting title based on the 1964 decree, argued that the partition statute did not extend to suits in which title was disputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discovery ensued as to what various Lombard descendants knew at different times about title to the Lombard lot and related matters. The United States then moved for dismissal or summary judgment, and the plaintiffs countered with a motion for summary judgment to recognize their title and later a motion to amend the complaint to assert a claim under the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409a; this is a later-enacted companion to the partition statute that permits a quiet title action against the United States, provided it is brought within twelve years of the date that \"the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United States.\" Id. &#167; 2409a(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1998, the district court granted the government's motion for summary judgment as to the partition statute claim, denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to title, denied as futile the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend, and entered final judgment for the United States.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 50 (D. Mass. 1998). The court ruled that the partition statute authorized division only of undisputed interests in common and did not permit the court to resolve title disputes. As for the plaintiffs' motion to amend to assert a quiet title claim under the Quiet Title Act, the court held that the amendment would be futile because the claims of the plaintiffs, and several additional heirs who had intervened, were barred by the twelve-year statute of limitations governing section 2409a. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuits have held, consistent with the district court's view, that the partition statute does not allow claims by a citizen whose title is disputed. See Stubbs v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377897\"><a href=\"/opinion/377897/lloyd-r-stubbs-individually-and-as-administrator-of-the-estates-of-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 782 (10th Cir. 1980);  Rambo v.

Rambo, the only decision that offers much <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1475976\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">analysis,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1475976/rambo-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, reasoned that, historically, partition actions did not resolve title disputes; that waivers of sovereign immunity are strictly construed; and that (as of 1944) the United States had not consented to suits against it to resolve title disputes as to property it purported to <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1475976\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">own.</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1475976/rambo-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the last of these concerns was eliminated in 1972 when Congress adopted the Quiet Title Act, explicitly authorizing quiet title actions against the United States and thereby waiving sovereign immunity as to such claims. See Act of Oct. 25, 1972, Pub. L.  No. 92-562, &#167; 3(a), 86 Stat. 1176 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409a). Conversely, even if we were to read the partition statute now to embrace cases of disputed title, we could hardly ignore the explicit twelve-year statute of limitations on quiet title disputes. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409a(g). The rationale for limiting the partition statute to undisputed titles may have vanished in 1972, but any effort to read the two statutes in light of each other works both ways: if the partition statute allows the court to resolve incidental title disputes (a point we need not decide), it is so only if the suit is brought within the twelve year limitations period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the statute of limitations issue. Formally, the district court merely denied the plaintiffs' motion to amend, which the government claims is a step reviewed solely for \"abuse of discretion.\" This would be so if the district court had said that the amendment came too late based on concerns about case management.  See Credit Francais Int'l v. Bio-Vita, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196607\"><a href=\"/opinion/196607/credit-francais-v-bio-vita-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 704 n.9 (1st Cir. 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But as we read the district court's decision, it rests squarely on a finding that the amendment would be futile because the plaintiffs' quiet title claim is barred by the statute of limitations, a finding that it supports with a detailed discussion of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the same Lombard plaintiffs now brought a new action under the quiet title statute, the United States would assert that the district court's finding was res judicata on the limitations issue. Thus, we treat the district court decision just as if the district court had granted the motion to amend and then dismissed the new claim on the ground that the statute of limitations had run. See Jones v. New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760940\"><a href=\"/opinion/760940/frank-d-jones-v-new-york-state-division-of-military-and-naval-affairs-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 49 (2d Cir. 1999); Fisher v.

Ordinarily, a grant of summary dismissal invites de novo review on appeal. See Cadle Co. v.

Specifically, the district court found the following as to some, or all, of the plaintiffs:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\tThat \"most of the plaintiffs have believed for decades that David Lombard had stolen [the Lombard lot] . . . and sold it to Higgins\" and \"[i]n light of the widespread family knowledge of the sale [to Higgins] over such a long period of time, they could easily have learned the status of the property by making inquiry\";</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\tThat some of the plaintiffs recalled learning of the Cape Cod National Seashore in the 1960s, and that \"most knew that the United States had acquired the Brook Bound (sic) Island property for that purpose [the Cap e Cod National Seashore]\"; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\tThat the plaintiffs did not pay property taxes on the land surrounding the cemetery, did not maintain that land, did not occupy it and did not assert ownership to the National Park Service or the Town of Wellfleet, but at most \"occasionally visited the family cemetery, picked blueberries, and had picnics on the adjacent property.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2531948\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lombard,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2531948/lombard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's finding that as early as the 1960s, \"most [of the plaintiffs] knew that the United States had acquired the Brook Bound (sic) Island property for that purpose,\" could be taken as a reference to the Lombard lot itself. If so read and adequately supported in the record, this would resolve this case in favor of the United States: it would mean that such plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the government's claim to the Lombard lot as far back as the 1960s. Yet we cannot find any unambiguous record evidence that any of the plaintiffs knew prior to this suit that the government had acquired the Lombard lot or any interest in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ample evidence in the record shows that some plaintiffs knew that the government was purchasing property on Cape Cod for the purpose of creating the National Seashore. There is even some indication that individual plaintiffs had sold other property to the government for this purpose, although it is unclear whether this property was in the Bound Brook Island area. In all likelihood, the district court's quoted finding meant only that the plaintiffs knew that the government was buying property for the National Seashore in Wellfleet, including property in the Bound Brook Island area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the statute of limitations does not require actual knowledge of the government's claim. If other facts known twelve or more years before this action was brought would have prompted a reasonable landowner to make further inquiries, which in turn would have led to knowledge of the government's claim, then the statute bars the owner because he \"should have known\" of the government's claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> And had the plaintiffs' suspicions been aroused, the government's claim would have been easy to discover, either by asking national seashore officials or looking at the title records at the Barnstable registry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But what events fairly charged the plaintiffs with reasonable suspicions requiring further inquiry? Merely to say that the government was buying land somewhere in Wellfleet or the Bound Brook Island area for its national park is hardly enough, and there is little to show the location of government land purchases known to individual plaintiffs. About the most one can say is that this background knowledge of purchases in the area might have added to suspicions of a government claim to the Lombard lot if there were other, more specific indications suggesting that the government was claiming ownership of the Lombard lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elsewhere in the opinion the district court noted that the government had erected a locked gate somewhere on the road to the family cemetery, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2531948\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lombard,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2531948/lombard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>-50, and there is also an indication in the record that at some point trees grew up around the road making it difficult for cars to pass. At least some of the plaintiffs knew that the gate was under the government's control; one of the plaintiffs had complained and the government had provided a key to the gate, although it did not remove the barrier. We agree that, if the government puts a gate at the entrance to your property, this is ordinarily sufficient notice to warrant inquiry. Cf. Park County, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Montana,</span> <span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">721</span> </span>n.6; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Grosz,</span> <span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">975</span></span>; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Howell,</span> <span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">304-06</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that any knowledge that the government was exercising some proprietorship over the Lombard lot would have been consistent with a belief that the government owned 40 percent and would not suggest that the government was claiming ownership of the 60 percent interest now claimed by the Lombard heirs. Perhaps so if the plaintiffs knew that a 40 percent ownership interest had been claimed by Higgins and that the government had been dealing with him to acquire his interest. But none of the plaintiffs claim to have known anything about the sale by Higgins to the government of his Lombard lot interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more serious problem with the gate argument is that nothing in the testimony or crude maps in the record indicates to us precisely where the gate was placed in relation to the property line of the Lombard lot. For example, if the gate was just at the property line of the Lombard lot, this might support an inference that the government was claiming ownership of the lot. But if the gate were on a portion of the road leading to the Lombard lot but not yet actually within the lot, it might have been put there simply to limit access to other government property through which the road ran before reaching the Lombard lot. In that event, it would not necessarily suggest that the government was claiming ownership of the lot itself, and providing a key to the gate would be consistent with recognizing an easement over the road to reach the Lombard lot, cf. Schultz v. Department of Army, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530031\"><a href=\"/opinion/530031/paul-g-shultz-v-department-of-army-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span>, 1159-61 &amp; n.2 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is worth adding that the district court's opinion did not rely at all on the gate in giving its reasons why the claim was barred. The gate was mentioned only briefly in setting out the facts. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2531948\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lombard,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2531948/lombard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>-50. The government refers to it merely as part of a bouillabaisse description of all of the possible facts that it thinks in any way support an inference of knowledge or suspicion. Only with more detailed and specific findings by the district court could the gate help to show that the plaintiffs \"should have known\" of a government claim to own the Lombard lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court pointed to two other sets of facts: that a number of plaintiffs thought that the Lombard lot had been stolen by Higgins long ago and that the heirs did not pay property taxes, maintain the lot, live there, assert ownership, or visit it except occasionally. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2531948\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lombard,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2531948/lombard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>. There is not much information about taxation rates and enforcement but, this aside, we agree with the district court that these facts support an inference that for some years the plaintiffs might well have thought that they had no claim at all to the Lombard lot. Rising property prices, it may be supposed, have now prompted a closer look.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were concerned with laches or other equitable limitations, all this might be grist for the mill. But the statute of limitations in this case is triggered only if the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the government's claim, compare United States v. Beggerly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118218\"><a href=\"/opinion/118218/united-states-v-beggerly/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1862</span></a></span>, 1868 (1998); that for other reasons they may have doubted their own title is beside the point unless this fact fits into a set of inferences suggesting that they believed or should have believed that the government claimed title. This might well be the case if they had known of Higgins's sale to the government, but the record is at best uncertain on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might ask why it matters whether the plaintiffs knew of the government's claim or merely lacked faith in their own. The answer is that an owner does not normally forfeit his ownership of real property through ignorance of his title, unless adverse possession is established (and that requires a showing of notorious possession and often for more than twelve years). See, e.g., Eno &amp; Hovey, 28 Massachusetts Practice &#167; 27.1, at 560-62 (3d ed. 1995). In waiving sovereign immunity to quiet title actions against it, the government established a special limitations period favorable to itself, but only where the property ownership knew or should have known that the government claimed ownership (and then failed to dispute it within the period).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far, we have treated the plaintiffs as a group and made reference to the district court's findings of what \"most\" or \"many\" of the plaintiffs knew. Strictly speaking, the Quiet Title Act, subject to certain qualifications, requires that each plaintiff's claim be assessed individually, meaning that some may lose their claims while others may not, depending on individual knowledge. See, e.g., Klugh v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488046\"><a href=\"/opinion/488046/margaret-klugh-katherine-klugh-maultsby-mary-klugh-garner-john-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 299 (4th Cir. 1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court made some effort to distinguish among groups of heirs based on their level of knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the parties did not object to composite plaintiffs or treatment of them collectively by group, this might be a reasonable approach for litigation, adopted by implicit agreement. Here, claimed shares of individual plaintiffs are rather minute (they appear in this case to range from 1/15 to 1/300); and an heir-by-heir analysis might well be costly and productive of only minute victories. We mention the issue only to avoid any implicit endorsement of the composite or grouping approach as a general construction of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to plaintiffs' further claim that they were entitled to judgment in their favor on the issue of title. Their argument is that the 1976 dismissal of Higgins's original \"severed case,\" in which he sought to acquire from the state land court a declaration of full ownership over the lot, was a dismissal \"with prejudice\" under state law; that this dismissal therefore determined that Higgins owned only 40 percent of the Lombard lot and the heirs owned the remainder; and that the federal district court was required under the Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, to accept this determination as binding in the present action against the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the original 1958 order of the land court made clear that the dismissal of the severed action was intended to be without prejudice, it would not normally result in claim preclusion, see Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 20 (1982), and since no facts were actually resolved in the case at all, there cannot be issue preclusion under ordinary doctrine. See id. &#167; 27. Still, plaintiffs say that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185, &#167; 44 (1998) requires a different conclusion because the 1976 cleanup order did not say expressly that it was without prejudice. The statute reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court finds that the plaintiff has not title proper for registration, a judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint, and such judgment may be ordered to be without prejudice, in whole or in part, but unless so ordered it shall bind the parties, their privies and the land in respect of any issue of fact which has been tried and determined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that section 44 applies--which is unclear<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>--the most one could say is that section 44 might then treat a judgment of dismissal, where silent, as \"bind[ing] the parties, their privies and the land in respect of any issue of fact which has been tried and determined.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added). </span>But no issue of fact was tried and determined in the severed case. At most a dismissal with prejudice might mean that Higgins could not bring the same action again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also rely on McCarthy v. Town of Oak Bluffs, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span> </span>(Mass. 1994). There, as here, a registration case in the land court was thereafter severed into two--one for property claimed east of a specific mean low water line and the other for land west of the line. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1018</span></span>. The former case was pursued and resulted in a decree of registration in 1960; the latter was dismissed in 1977 for lack of prosecution. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Thereafter, privies </span>of the plaintiffs brought a new suit asserting title to the western portion, the subject of the dismissed suit, and the court held that the new suit could not be brought. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1019.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the court's reasons destroy the parallel with the present case. The land court held in the new suit that the earlier one had made a factual determination of the western boundary of the property; and it was this finding to which the court gave preclusive effect. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1018-19, </span>1021. Further, it found that the original plaintiffs had signed a stipulation stating that they had no interest in land westward of the line, that licenses they had taken confirmed that concession, and that state law made it ill egal for them to own land westward of the line. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1018-19. </span>Thus McCarthy is not on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we conclude that  the rejectionof the proposed amendment to the complaint cannot on this record be supported on the ground given for the denial. However, the plaintiffs' full faith and credit argument is without merit and to prevail ultimately, the plaintiffs would have to avoid the 1964 quiet title judgment and defeat a likely claim by the government that Higgins had obtained full title to the Lombard lot by adverse possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> And if title to fractional interests were established by plaintiffs, problems of remedy would remain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such issues could be costly and time consuming to litigate on both sides. And, while the government's hands are not perfectly clean (given its actual knowledge of Higgins's doubtful paper title to the whole), the plaintiffs are in some measure seeking a windfall from property widely thought to have been lost long ago by the family. All this suggests that both sides might be well advised to renew their earlier, unsuccessful efforts to settle the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Our judgment reinstates the partition statute claim merely as a contingent remedy available if and when the plaintiffs can establish ownership under the Quiet Title Act by satisfying the statute of limitations and all other prerequisites. Nothing in our decision precludes a further motion for summary judgment by the government on statute of limitations grounds (assuming a more developed record) or any other ground available to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A month later the United States paid for the property. George Higgins had died during the proceeding but his wife, Katherine, was substituted and received the payment from the government.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It appears that the motion to amend was made with reasonable promptness after the government asserted that the partition statute did not reach disputed titles, and much of the discovery was in fact addressed to the statute of limitations issue. Moreover, the district court took care to separate out other proposed amendments by the plaintiffs, which it denied as untimely.

See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2409a(g). And whil e knowledge of one plaintiff is not normally imputed to another, there is some indication in this case that heirs located in or near Cape Cod effectively acted over the years as agents on behalf of other heirs located in distant locations throughout the country, which may make it appropriate to impute the knowledge of the agent-heirs to the principal heirs.
