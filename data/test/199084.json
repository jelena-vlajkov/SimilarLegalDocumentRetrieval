Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    Wilfred Evicci on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                      September 22, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam.      Evicci was convicted after jury trial in\n\na Massachusetts state court of rape, kidnapping and assault and\n\nbattery.      The   Massachusetts       Appeals   Court     confirmed     the\n\nconvictions on February 2, 1999, and the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC) declined further appellate review on April\n\n27, 1999.    Evicci then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the\n\nfederal district court, which dismissed the petition on the\n\nground that Evicci had failed to exhaust state remedies with\n\nrespect to three of the four claims set forth in his petition.\n\nSee Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 510 (1982).            Evicci now seeks\n\na certificate of appealability (\"COA\") from us under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253(c), which pertinently requires that an applicant make \"a\n\nsubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"\n\n            The   district    court's     dismissal   was   based   on    the\n\nprocedural bar of lack of exhaustion.         But in Slack v. McDaniel,\n\n120 S. Ct. 1595, 1603 (2000), the Supreme Court held that an\n\nerroneous procedural ruling does not necessarily preclude an\n\nappellate court from considering whether a substantial showing\n\nhas been made of the denial of a constitutional right.                  Under\n\nSlack, we must look further.\n\n            Evicci did not present three of his four claims to the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court or to the SJC in his application for\n\nfurther review, and, in that sense, Evicci did not exhaust his\n\n                                    -2-\n\fstate remedies.             But because the state courts would deem\n\ngrounds not raised on the direct appeal to have been waived,\n\nCommonwealth v. Gagliardi, 418 Mass. 562, 638 N.E.2d 20 (1994),\n\nstate remedies are no longer \"available\" within the meaning of\n\n§ 2254(b)(1)(A).       See O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 847-\n\n48 (1999); Carsetti v. Maine, 932 F.2d 1007, 1012 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).    There are, to be sure, exceptions to the waiver rule\n\nunder Massachusetts law, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Graham, 431\n\nMass. 282, 287, 727 N.E.2d 51, 56 (2000), but Evicci does not\n\nfit within any of them.             Lacking \"cause\" for failing to raise\n\nthese three claims in state court, Evicci cannot now present\n\nthem in federal court. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87-\n\n91 (1977); cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 748 (1991).\n\n               Ordinarily,    we    would       now    turn   to   Evicci's    Sixth\n\nAmendment claim, which he did present in the state proceedings.\n\nIt is in fact a two-part claim:              Evicci asserts that his rights\n\nunder    the    Confrontation       Clause      were    violated    by   the   trial\n\ncourt's refusal to allow his attorney fully to explore drug use\n\non the part of the complaining witness; and he also asserts that\n\nthe attorney provided inadequate assistance, in violation of his\n\nright to the effective assistance of counsel, by failing to\n\nformulate       and   act    upon    an    internally         consistent   defense\n\nstrategy.       However, Evicci has not fully fleshed out his claims,\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fand the Commonwealth, in opposition in the district court,\n\ndeclined to address the merits of any of Evicci's claims because\n\nit relied solely on its lack of exhaustion rationale.\n\n          Although we could now call for memoranda from Evicci\n\nand from the Commonwealth to illuminate the strength of the\n\nSixth Amendment claim, this would be an inefficient way to\n\nhandle the matter.    We are not only without the district court's\n\nassessment of the merits of the constitutional claim, but we\n\nalso lack most of the instruments that would be available to the\n\ndistrict court in making that assessment, including discovery,\n\na   possible   evidentiary     hearing,   and   a   possible   report    and\n\nrecommendation from a magistrate-judge.             We do not even have\n\nbefore us a transcript of the trial.\n\n          A very literal reading of section 2253(c) might lead\n\none to say that Evicci has therefore failed to justify the\n\nissuance of a COA.   Yet, in Slack v. McDaniel, the Supreme Court\n\ntook a practical approach to construing the statute and, after\n\nfinding that a procedural bar did not apply, itself remanded for\n\nfurther development of the constitutional issue.                Under the\n\npresent circumstances, we think that we have the authority to\n\ngrant the COA and to vacate the order dismissing the petition on\n\na   procedural   ground   we   find   erroneous,     leaving   it   to   the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdistrict court to reconsider Evicci's Sixth Amendment claim. 1\n\nIf this claim is resolved on the merits adversely to Evicci, he\n\nmay seek a COA in the district court and, failing that, in this\n\ncourt.\n\n             We would not hesitate to deny a COA if we were sure\n\nthat the applicant had no reasonable basis for claiming that he\n\nhad   been   denied   a   constitutional    right.      However,    in   this\n\ninstance     that   branch   of   his   claim   based    on   the   alleged\n\nlimitations on counsel's opportunity to explore drug use might\n\nor might not have substance but, so far as it is explained, it\n\nis not frivolous on its face.             If the inadequate assistance\n\nclaim stood alone, we might say that the applicant failed to\n\nprovide us enough information to make even a colorable showing,\n\nbut, out of an abundance of caution, we think the district court\n\nought to address both claims since the matter must go back in\n\nany event.\n\n             Nothing in this opinion is intended to suggest that the\n\napplicant has made out a constitutional claim so substantial\n\nthat, had the claim had been rejected by the district court on\n\nthe merits, we would necessarily have granted a COA.                 And it\n\n\n      1\n     See Roberts v. Sutton, 217 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir. 2000);\nJefferson v. Welborn, 2000 WL 862846 at *3 (7th Cir. June 29,\n2000); Lambright v. Stewart, 2000 WL 1118937 (9th Cir.

However, since the procedural\n\nruling cut short further proceedings and we think that ruling\n\nwas mistaken, further development of the issues should be done\n\nin the first instance in the district court.\n\n         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\f",

We do not even have before us a transcript of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A very literal reading of section 2253(c) might lead one to say that Evicci has therefore failed to justify the issuance of a COA. Yet, in Slack v. McDaniel, the Supreme Court took a practical approach to construing the statute and, after finding that a procedural bar did not apply, itself remanded for further development of the constitutional issue. Under the present circumstances, we think that we have the authority to grant the COA and to vacate the order dismissing the petition on a procedural ground we find erroneous, leaving it to the district court to reconsider Evicci's Sixth Amendment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> If this claim is resolved on the merits adversely to Evicci, he may seek a COA in the district court and, failing that, in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would not hesitate to deny a COA if we were sure that the applicant had no reasonable basis for claiming that he had been denied a constitutional right. However, in this instance that branch of his claim based on the alleged limitations on counsel's opportunity to explore drug use might or might not have substance but, so far as it is explained, it is not frivolous on its face. If the inadequate assistance claim stood alone, we might say that the applicant failed to provide us enough information to make even a colorable showing, but, out of an abundance of caution, we think the district court ought to address both claims since the matter must go back in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in this opinion is intended to suggest that the applicant has made out a constitutional claim so substantial that, had the claim had been rejected by the district court on the merits, we would necessarily have granted a COA. And it remains possible that there are other procedural or substantive problems with the petition that the respondent may have asserted or may wish to assert on remand. However, since the procedural ruling cut short further proceedings and we think that ruling was mistaken, further development of the issues should be done in the first instance in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Roberts v.
