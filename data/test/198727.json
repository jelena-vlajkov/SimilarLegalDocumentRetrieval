Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Jay P.\r\nMcCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 2, 1999\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  This appeal raises two important\r\nissues.  One requires us to determine for the first time whether\r\nthe police, equipped with a search warrant but not an arrest\r\nwarrant, may enter the home and immediately arrest a resident on\r\nthe basis of previously acquired probable cause.  The second\r\nrequires us to plot the line of demarcation between two closely\r\nrelated but poorly understood rules of evidence, Fed. R. Evid.\r\n608(b) and Fed. R. Evid. 613(b).  Concluding, as we do, that the\r\narrest and the search conducted incident thereto were\r\nconstitutionally permissible and that the trial court's admission\r\nof the challenged extrinsic evidence passes muster, we affirm the\r\njudgment of conviction.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nWe offer only a synopsis of the evidentiary record,\r\nborrowing liberally from the district court's more detailed\r\nrendition.  See United States v. Winchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d 159,\r\n160-62 (D. Me. 1998).  We later supplement our account in the\r\ncourse of discussing specific assignments of error. \r\nOver a period of approximately five months in mid-1997,\r\nthe Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA), working in concert with\r\na confidential informant named James Holmes, fomented a series of\r\n\"controlled\" drug transactions.  The first occurred in April. \r\nActing on the MDEA's instructions, Holmes gave Wendy Spinney (a\r\ntarget of the probe) $250 in exchange for Spinney's promise to\r\ndeliver cocaine.  Although Spinney told Holmes that she would\r\nprocure the cocaine in Rockland, agents followed her to the Ralph\r\nWink Road, a dead-end street in Waldoboro.  She disappeared for a\r\nbrief interval, but the agents then spied her returning from the\r\nRalph Wink Road and trailed her to a motel (where she delivered the\r\ncocaine to Holmes).\r\nOn May 30, Holmes called Spinney to arrange another\r\npurchase.  He then went to her abode and gave her $250.  Although\r\nSpinney again told Holmes that she would go to Rockland to obtain\r\ndrugs, agents followed her to Duck Puddle Road (a street leading to\r\nGenther Road, which accesses the Ralph Wink Road).  A short time\r\nlater, the agents spotted her coming from the direction of the\r\nRalph Wink Road.  Upon returning home, Spinney called Holmes and\r\ninformed him that she could not get any cocaine.\r\nOn June 5, Holmes again called Spinney and arranged to\r\nbuy an \"eight-ball\" of cocaine.  He visited her residence   as was\r\ntypically the case, the MDEA chauffeured him there   and in the\r\nensuing conversation, Spinney identified her supplier as \"Junior\"\r\nand specified that he was based in Waldoboro.  This time, the\r\nagents tracked Spinney to a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road in which\r\ndefendant-appellant Ralph Winchenbach, Jr. resided with his quondam\r\nparamour, Arlene Jones (formerly Arlene Winchenbach, by virtue of\r\nher earlier marriage to one of the appellant's brothers).  Spinney\r\nspent nearly ten minutes inside the trailer and then returned\r\ndirectly to her home.  When Holmes arrived, she gave him the\r\npromised eight-ball of cocaine.\r\nOn September 3, the MDEA again set Holmes into motion. \r\nOn this occasion, he gave Spinney $250 at her dwelling.  She said\r\nthat she would go \"to Duck Puddle\" to retrieve the cocaine and that\r\nher supplier was waiting for her \"at Junior's house.\"  Agents\r\nfollowed Spinney and a companion, later identified as William\r\nHolmstrom, to Duck Puddle Road.  They were last seen heading in the\r\ndirection of the Ralph Wink Road.  After a ten-minute interval, an\r\nagent observed the pair traveling from the direction of the Ralph\r\nWink Road.  At that point, the officers arrested both Spinney and\r\nHolmstrom.  Spinney had cocaine in her purse.\r\nUpon interrogation, Spinney told the agents that she\r\nbought the cocaine for $200 from \"Junior\" just prior to her arrest\r\nand that \"Junior\" lived in a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road.  She\r\nadded that she had purchased cocaine from \"Junior\" at his trailer\r\non about 30 occasions and referred to him at one point as \"Junior\r\nWinchenbach.\"  When asked whether \"Junior\" was Ralph Winchenbach,\r\nJr., Spinney replied that she thought so.\r\nThe MDEA promptly applied for a warrant to search, inter\r\nalia, \"[t]he Ralph Winchenbach Jr and Arlene Winchenbach residence\r\nin Waldoboro, located on the Ralph Wink [R]oad box # 277\" as well\r\nas \"[a]ny and all people present and arriving at the residence at\r\nthe time of the search, including but not limited to Ralph\r\nWinchenbach Jr and Arlene Winchenbach.\"  The affidavit supporting\r\nthe warrant described the location and appearance of the trailer at\r\nsome length and stated unequivocally that it was the same trailer\r\nthat Spinney had described to the arresting officers.  A state\r\nmagistrate granted the application and issued a warrant that\r\nauthorized a search of the premises.\r\nThe same evening, a team of officers went to the\r\nappellant's trailer on the Ralph Wink Road to execute the search\r\nwarrant.  When the appellant opened the door, the officers\r\nimmediately entered the trailer, arrested him, brought him outside,\r\nand searched him.  They discovered over $1,000 on his person,\r\nincluding $80 of the \"buy money\" that the MDEA had given to Holmes\r\nearlier that day.\r\nA federal grand jury indicted the appellant for\r\ndistribution of cocaine.  See 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1).  The district\r\ncourt denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a\r\nresult of the arrest and the ensuing search of his person, noting\r\nthat the officers had probable cause to effect an arrest and that\r\nthey were lawfully present in the appellant's home.  See\r\nWinchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 165-67.  A petit jury subsequently\r\nfound the appellant guilty, and the district court imposed a 37-\r\nmonth incarcerative sentence.  This appeal followed.  In it,\r\nWinchenbach challenges both the denial of his motion to suppress\r\nand an evidentiary ruling.  We address these questions seriatim.\r\nII.  THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS\r\nThe appellant argues that his arrest was unlawful and\r\nthat, therefore, the district court should have suppressed the\r\nevidence gleaned from the search of his person.  The second half of\r\nthis argument depends on the validity of the first:  it is settled\r\nbeyond peradventure that a search of an individual's person made\r\nincident to a valid arrest is itself valid, despite the absence of\r\nan arrest warrant.  See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S.\r\n218, 224 (1973); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762-73 (1969). \r\nPut another way, \"[t]he fact of a lawful arrest, standing alone,\r\nauthorizes a search.\"  Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 35\r\n(1979).  Hence, we turn directly to the legitimacy of the arrest.\r\nThe appellant does not contest the bona fides of the\r\nwarrant that authorized the search of his dwelling but, rather,\r\nasseverates that a search warrant, unaccompanied by an arrest\r\nwarrant, can never support an arrest of an individual in his own\r\nhome.  Building on this foundation, he posits that the fruits of\r\nthe subsequent search of his person must be suppressed.  The\r\ngovernment responds that because the search warrant enabled the\r\nofficers lawfully to enter the home and because probable cause\r\nexisted to believe that the appellant had committed a crime, the\r\nofficers had a right to effect an arrest without first pausing to\r\nsecure a separate arrest warrant.  The district court adhered to\r\nthe government's view and refused suppression.  See Winchenbach, 31\r\nF. Supp. 2d at 167.  We assess its conclusions of law de novo but\r\nscrutinize its factual findings only for clear error.  See United\r\nStates v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 565 (1st Cir. 1996); United States\r\nv. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994).  \"'[T]he decision\r\nwhether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an\r\nobjectively reasonable police officer, amount to . . . probable\r\ncause' presents a mixed question of law and fact which is subject\r\nto plenary review.\"   United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,\r\n696 (1996)).\r\nThe appellant's primary position, purportedly grounded in\r\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573,\r\n576 (1980), is that law enforcement officers can never arrest a\r\nperson in his home unless they first obtain an arrest warrant.  But\r\nPayton does not sweep so broadly.  To be sure, the Payton Court\r\nheld on particular facts that officers who did not possess an\r\narrest warrant could not enter the defendant's home to arrest him. \r\nSee id. at 590.  As subsequent cases demonstrate, however, Payton\r\ndoes not purport to declare an absolute rule.  One recognized\r\nexception involves exigent circumstances.  See, e.g., Hegarty v.\r\nSomerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st Cir. 1995).  Another\r\napplies to parolees and persons on probation.  See, e.g., United\r\nStates v. Cardona, 903 F.2d 60, 67, 69 (1st Cir. 1990).  A third,\r\nthe precise scope of which is here at issue, permits the police to\r\narrest an individual in his home, without an arrest warrant, as\r\nlong as they are lawfully on the premises (by reason, say, of a\r\nsearch warrant) and probable cause exists.  See, e.g., Mahlberg v.\r\nMentzer, 968 F.2d 772, 775 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v.\r\nHouston, 892 F.2d 696, 701-02 (8th Cir. 1989); Jones v. City of\r\nDenver, 854 F.2d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir. 1988).  In these cases, the\r\npolice discovered the evidence that gave rise to probable cause\r\nduring a lawful search of the premises and then arrested the\r\noccupant.  We have found one case, United States v. Price, 888 F.2d\r\n1206 (7th Cir. 1989), in which the court treated the arrest as\r\ntaking place (with probable cause) immediately upon entry by the\r\npolice, prior to any search.  See id. at 1208-09; see generally 3\r\nWayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure  6.1(c), at 245 (3d ed. 1996). \r\nWe deem both situations to be covered by the same principle.  We\r\nexplain briefly.\r\nCourts typically have predicated this exception on a\r\n\"greater subsumes the lesser\" analysis, reasoning that:\r\n  A search warrant represents a judicial\r\ndetermination that there is probable cause to\r\ninvade the privacy of the suspect's home.  The\r\nimpartial determination that supports the\r\nissuance of a search warrant justifies a\r\ngreater intrusion than that supporting the\r\nissuance of an arrest warrant.  Thus, once an\r\nofficer has procured a search warrant, the\r\nprivacy interests that led to the imposition\r\nof an arrest warrant requirement in Payton\r\nhave been protected.\r\n\nJones, 854 F.2d at 1209 (italics omitted).  This analysis does not\r\ncontradict Payton, as the Court there did not speak so much to the\r\nmatter of arrest as to the matter of unauthorized entry into a\r\ndwelling.  See Payton, 445 U.S. at 588-90; see also New York v.\r\nHarris, 495 U.S. 14, 17 (1990) (explaining that \"the rule in Payton\r\nwas designed to protect the physical integrity of the home\"). \r\nThus, the logic underpinning Mahlberg and Jones embraces equally\r\ncases where, as here, an arrest takes place immediately after the\r\nofficers' arrival at the dwelling and is based on previously-\r\nacquired probable cause.  After all, \"Payton is grounded (as the\r\nCourt put it) in 'the breach of the entrance to an individual's\r\nhome.'  That is, it is the otherwise unauthorized entry and not the\r\narrest which gives rise to the warrant requirement.\"  LaFave,\r\nsupra,  6.1(c) at 249 (emphasis supplied); accord 1 David S.\r\nRudstein et al., Criminal Constitutional Law  2.05[3], at 2-189 to\r\n2-190 (1998) (\"A police officer acting upon probable cause also may\r\nmake a warrantless arrest in premises not open to the general\r\npublic when he has lawfully entered the premises, for example,\r\npursuant to a search warrant . . . .\").\r\nWe believe it follows that, once the police gain lawful\r\nentry to residential premises (as by a search warrant), an\r\nimmediate arrest is permissible without a separate arrest warrant\r\nas long as evidence known to the officers before the search\r\nsupplies probable cause for the arrest.  See LaFave, supra, \r\n6.1(c), at 249 &amp; n.114 (citing, inter alia, the Mahlberg line of\r\ncases).  While the matter apparently is one that has received\r\nlittle attention in the federal appellate courts, a number of\r\nrespected state courts, applying federal constitutional principles,\r\nhave reached this conclusion.  See, e.g., State v. Ware, 365 N.W.2d\r\n418, 421 (Neb. 1985); People v. Kite, 423 N.E.2d 524, 526, 530-31\r\n(Ill. App. Ct. 1981); State v. Turner, 627 P.2d 1324, 1326-28\r\n(Wash. Ct. App. 1981); State v. Ruth, 435 A.2d 3, 6-7 (Conn. 1980);\r\ncf. People v. McCarter, 173 Cal. Rptr. 188, 193, 196 (Cal. Ct. App.\r\n1981) (applying California law and holding that \"[i]f officers have\r\nauthorization to enter the home, an arrest inside is of no greater\r\nconstitutional significance than an arrest elsewhere\").\r\nThe appellant, who cites no case (federal or state) that\r\nholds to the contrary, resists this view, complaining that it\r\ndiminishes the stature of arrest warrants and renders them\r\nvirtually obsolete.  There is a kernel of truth in this lament, but\r\nwarrantless felony arrests outside of the home routinely have\r\nsurvived constitutional attack as long as probable cause exists. \r\nSee, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 7 (1985); United States\r\nv. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 423-24 (1976).  From a Fourth Amendment\r\nstandpoint, there is no valid reason why the same principle should\r\nnot apply to arrests within a suspect's residence so long as the\r\npolice are there lawfully.  In that event, \"a warrantless arrest\r\nthere is no more objectionable than a warrantless arrest on the\r\nstreet.\"  LaFave, supra,  6.1(b), at 236 n.56.\r\nThe appellant also suggests that following this rule will\r\npermit the police to play cat and mouse with a suspected criminal,\r\nforgoing an arrest warrant despite the ascertained existence of\r\nprobable cause and postponing an arrest until the mood strikes. \r\nThis argument has been made and rejected before in analogous\r\ncontexts, see, e.g., Watson, 423 U.S. at 414, 423-24 (holding that\r\na warrantless arrest based on probable cause may be made in a\r\npublic place even though the officers had ample prior opportunity\r\nto obtain an arrest warrant, yet eschewed that course); United\r\nStates v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1312 (1st Cir. 1994) (refusing \"to\r\nattach significance to the fact that the government had ample time\r\nto obtain a warrant but declined to procure one\"), and we reject it\r\nhere.  Put simply, when probable cause exists, the timing of an\r\narrest is a matter that the Constitution almost invariably leaves\r\nto police discretion.  See, e.g., Watson, 423 U.S. at 423-24;\r\nUnited States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 216-17, 220 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nWe hold, therefore, that if the police have gained lawful\r\nentry to an individual's home based on a valid search warrant, they\r\nmay arrest the individual before commencing the search, provided\r\nthat they have probable cause to do so.  Consequently, the issue\r\nbefore us reduces to whether the facts and circumstances within the\r\nagents' knowledge at the time of Winchenbach's arrest were\r\nsufficient to yield probable cause.  Like the district court, see\r\nWinchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 165, we conclude that they were.\r\nPrior opinions guide this inquiry.  We begin with\r\nbedrock:  probable cause to effect an arrest does not require the\r\nsame level of certitude or quantum of proof that is necessary to\r\nconvict.  See United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st\r\nCir. 1987).  Instead, probable cause exists when, \"at th[e] moment\r\n[the arrest is made,] the facts and circumstances within [the\r\nofficers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy\r\ninformation were sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in\r\nbelieving that the [individual] had committed or was committing an\r\noffense.\"  Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964).  For this purpose,\r\nthe \"fellow officer\" rule applies, so that as a general matter\r\n(subject to exceptions not pertinent here), the focus is upon the\r\ncollective knowledge possessed by, and the aggregate information\r\navailable to, all the officers involved in the investigation.  See\r\nMeade, 110 F.3d at 193-94.\r\nWe need not dwell on generalities.  In the last analysis,\r\nprobable cause requires practical, context-specific determinations,\r\nmade case by case, that give due weight to the totality of the\r\ncircumstances and the trial court's superior coign of vantage.  See\r\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 232 (1983); United States v.\r\nAguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1988).  If the\r\ncircumstances supportably found \"warrant the officer's reasonable\r\nbelief that the action taken is appropriate, the arrest is\r\njustified.\"  Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1044 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nThus, the dispositive question here is whether the officers'\r\ncollective knowledge at the moment of the arrest justified a\r\nprudent person in believing that the appellant had distributed\r\ncocaine.\r\nHaving reviewed the stipulated record with care, we find\r\nthe answer to this question readily apparent.  The MDEA had\r\nreceived several tips that the appellant was selling drugs on the\r\nRalph Wink Road and had responded by enlisting Holmes's cooperation\r\nand placing Spinney under episodic surveillance.  Prior to each\r\n\"controlled\" purchase of cocaine, the agents searched Holmes to\r\nensure that he had no contraband   and on three of the four\r\noccasions, he returned with cocaine.  During each of the four\r\ncontemplated transactions, the authorities followed Spinney either\r\nto the Ralph Wink Road (where the appellant resided) or to Duck\r\nPuddle Road (which led to the Ralph Wink Road).  On the latter\r\noccasions, the lawmen witnessed her return from the direction of\r\nthe Ralph Wink Road.  Once, two MDEA agents actually followed\r\nSpinney to the appellant's trailer (where she apparently obtained\r\ncocaine).  In conversation, Spinney told Holmes, among other\r\nthings, that her cocaine source was \"Junior,\" who lived in\r\nWaldoboro.  To cap matters, at the time of the last transaction,\r\nSpinney (1) told Holmes that her supplier was waiting for her \"at\r\nJunior's\"; (2) informed her captors when arrested that she had just\r\npurchased the cocaine found in her purse from \"Junior Winchenbach,\"\r\nwho lived in a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road; and (3) described a\r\nlong course of dealing that involved roughly 30 purchases from\r\n\"Junior\" at that locus.  What Spinney had to say was corroborated\r\nnot only by Holmes and by the officers' own observations, but also\r\nby Holmstrom, who confirmed that he had accompanied Spinney to the\r\nRalph Wink Road to obtain cocaine on the day of her arrest.\r\nThe appellant counters this formidable factual array by\r\nsuggesting that the record does not foreclose other inferences. \r\nFor instance, Spinney might have purchased the cocaine from the\r\nappellant's brother, Dale Winchenbach, a known cocaine user who\r\npreviously had owned the trailer and who still lived on the Ralph\r\nWink Road, albeit in another mobile home.  Nor is this all; he\r\noffers several other possible scenarios.  No useful purpose would\r\nbe served by debating these alternatives.  The probable cause\r\nstandard does not require the officers' conclusion to be ironclad,\r\nor even highly probable.  Their conclusion that probable cause\r\nexists need only be reasonable.  See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730,\r\n742 (1983); United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir.\r\n1999), petition for cert. filed,     U.S.L.W.     (U.S. Sept. 23,\r\n1999) (No. 99-6383).\r\nThe same logic dooms the appellant's argument that,\r\nduring the final transaction, Spinney did not have sufficient time\r\nto drive to and from the Ralph Wink Road.  The appellant's\r\ncalculations are based on rough estimates and do no more than\r\nreveal a minor temporal disparity.  Given the facts as a whole,\r\nthis disparity does not suffice to render unreasonable the\r\nofficers' belief that Spinney purchased cocaine from the appellant.\r\nThe appellant also faults the controls employed by the\r\nagents and remonstrates that, as a result, Spinney's statements\r\nlacked corroboration.  In United States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d\r\n279 (1st Cir. 1997), however, we remarked that \"[t]he risk that\r\n[an] informant is lying or in error need not be wholly eliminated. \r\nRather, what is needed is that 'the probability of a lying or\r\ninaccurate informer has been sufficiently reduced by corroborative\r\nfacts and observations.'\"  Id. at 284 (citation omitted).  In our\r\nview, the evidence gathered here, including several recorded\r\nconversations between Holmes (who at times wore a body wire) and\r\nSpinney and the agents' own observations (especially those\r\npertinent to the third transaction), affords sufficient\r\ncorroboration to reduce the risk of error to an acceptable level.\r\nWe will not paint the lily.  Taking the totality of the\r\ncircumstances presented, the agents' belief that the appellant was\r\nengaged in the distribution of cocaine was eminently reasonable,\r\nand the facts as supportably found by the trial court, see\r\nWinchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 160-62, provide solid underpinning\r\nfor the court's conclusion that probable cause for the appellant's\r\narrest existed.  It follows inexorably that the lower court did not\r\nerr in denying the suppression motion.\r\nIII.  THE EVIDENTIARY QUESTION\r\nAt trial, the appellant called Arlene Jones's son, Robbie\r\nFlint, as an alibi witness.  Flint testified, inter alia, that the\r\nappellant was not in the trailer when Spinney arrived on September\r\n3.  On cross-examination, the following exchange took place:\r\n  Q: Do you have any knowledge of [the\r\nappellant's] selling drugs or being involved\r\nin drugs on September 3rd 1997?\r\n\n  A.  No.\r\n\n  Q:  None at all?\r\n\n  A:  No.\r\n\n  Q:  As far as you know he was not involved in\r\nanything?\r\n\n  A:  Right.\r\n\n  Q:  . . . [I]n that interview with [agent] Dan\r\nBradford, you did talk about [the appellant's]\r\ndrug activity that night, didn't you?\r\n\n  A:  No.\r\n\n  Q:  You didn't?  Well, isn't it true that what\r\nyou told Dan Bradford was that the night that\r\nMDEA searched the house . . . they missed\r\nseveral ounces of cocaine that were buried in\r\njars outside the residence?\r\n\n  A:  No.\r\n\n  Q:  You did not tell that to Dan Bradford?\r\n\n  A:  No I didn't.\r\n\nOn redirect examination, defense counsel ignored this testimony. \r\nIn rebuttal, however, the prosecutor called Bradford and sought to\r\ninterrogate him about the conversation.  The court overruled the\r\nappellant's objections, and Bradford testified that he spoke with\r\nFlint some months after the fact and that Flint, in an effort \"to\r\nredeem himself\" for assisting in a jailbreak, told him that the\r\nagents overlooked a quantity of buried cocaine during the search of\r\nWinchenbach's trailer.  The judge then instructed the jury to\r\nconsider Bradford's testimony only as it related to Flint's\r\ncredibility and not for the truth of the matter asserted.\r\nWe review the district court's admission of this evidence\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d\r\n1271, 1297 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1118 (1997). \r\nThe appellant maintains that such an abuse occurred because the\r\ncourt should have excluded Bradford's testimony under either Fed.\r\nR. Evid. 608(b) or Fed. R. Evid. 403.  We address both objections.\r\n                       A.  Rule 608(b).\r\nIn this court, as below, the government parries the\r\nappellant's Rule 608(b) objection by claiming that Rule 613(b), not\r\nRule 608(b), controls.  On a superficial level at least, an\r\napparent tension exists between these two rules.  Rule 608(b) bars\r\nthe credibility-related use of some extrinsic evidence, while Rule\r\n613(b), albeit by negative implication, permits the credibility-\r\nrelated use of some extrinsic evidence if the proponent satisfies\r\ncertain enumerated conditions.  In this instance, the appellant\r\ncharacterizes Bradford's testimony as extrinsic evidence relating\r\nto a specific instance of Flint's misconduct, offered by the\r\nprosecutor to attack Flint's credibility (and thus prohibited by\r\nRule 608(b)).  The government demurs, characterizing the testimony\r\nas extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement made by\r\nFlint, offered after Flint had been afforded an opportunity to\r\nexplain or deny the remark and in circumstances wherein the\r\nappellant had a full opportunity to interrogate both Flint and\r\nBradford on the matter (and thus admissible under Rule 613(b)).\r\nAt first blush, neither of these characterizations seems\r\nimplausible   but they cannot both be right.  There are, moreover,\r\ntwo wrinkles.  In the first place, the district court, though\r\ndeeming the evidence admissible, mistakenly relied on Rule 608(b). \r\nThis bevue need not detain us, for the trial court's use of an\r\nimproper ground for admission of evidence is harmless if the\r\nevidence was admissible for the same purpose on some other ground. \r\nSee United States v. Walsh, 928 F.2d 7, 10 n.10 (1st Cir. 1991);\r\nUnited States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1127 (1st Cir. 1989). \r\nThus, this wrinkle irons itself out.\r\nIn the second place, each party presses a theory that\r\nfails to fit.  The appellant seems to say that the evidence should\r\nbe excluded under Rule 608(b) simply because it was offered to\r\nimpugn Flint's credibility.  This is an overbroad generalization\r\nwhich, among its other vices, contradicts the time-honored tenet\r\nthat prior inconsistent statements ordinarily may be used to\r\nimpeach a witness's credibility.  See United States v. Hale, 422\r\nU.S. 171, 176 (1975); United States v. Martin, 694 F.2d 885, 888\r\n(1st Cir. 1982); see also 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger,\r\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence  613.02[1] (2d ed. 1997).  In the\r\nbargain, this interpretation of Rule 608(b) leaves no room at all\r\nfor the admission of extrinsic impeachment evidence under the\r\nauspices of Rule 613(b).  Thus, we reject it.\r\nFor its part, the government urges us to hold that a\r\nstrict statement/conduct dichotomy triggers the choice of rule. \r\nUnder this dichotomy, Rule 613(b) always would apply to statements\r\nand Rule 608(b) always would apply to conduct.  A glance at the\r\ncase law unmasks this gross oversimplification.  Cases invoking\r\nRule 608(b) in respect to statements, as opposed to conduct, are\r\nnot uncommon.  See, e.g., United States v. Cudlitz, 72 F.3d 992,\r\n996 (1st Cir. 1996) (dealing with prior perjurious statements);\r\nUnited States v. Brooke, 4 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1993) (dealing\r\nwith defendant's bogus claim to be suffering from terminal cancer\r\nin prosecution for manufacture of a destructive device); United\r\nStates v. Sellers, 906 F.2d 597, 602 (11th Cir. 1990) (dealing with\r\nwitness's lie to secure hospital admission, unrelated to ongoing\r\nprosecution).  The commentators likewise abjure the proffered\r\ndistinction.  See, e.g., 1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on\r\nEvidence  41, at 138 n.5 (4th ed. 1992) (citing cases listing\r\nperjury and false statements as among the instances of conduct\r\ncovered by Rule 608(b)).  We, too, reject it.\r\nAlthough we cannot accept either of the parties' self-\r\nserving taxonomies, we think that there is a principled distinction\r\nbetween the types of evidence covered by the two rules.  In our\r\nview, Rule 613(b) applies when two statements, one made at trial\r\nand one made previously, are irreconcilably at odds.  In such an\r\nevent, the cross-examiner is permitted to show the discrepancy by\r\nextrinsic evidence if necessary   not to demonstrate which of the\r\ntwo is true but, rather, to show that the two do not jibe (thus\r\ncalling the declarant's credibility into question).  See, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Higa, 55 F.3d 448, 451-52 (9th Cir. 1995); Kasuri\r\nv. St. Elizabeth Hosp. Med. Ctr., 897 F.2d 845, 853-54 (6th Cir.\r\n1990); United States v. Causey, 834 F.2d 1277, 1282-83 (6th Cir.\r\n1987); United States v. Lay, 644 F.2d 1087, 1090 (5th Cir. 1981). \r\nIn short, comparison and contradiction are the hallmarks of Rule\r\n613(b).  As one treatise puts it:\r\n  The theory of attack by prior inconsistent\r\nstatements is not based on the assumption that\r\nthe present testimony is false and the former\r\nstatement true but rather upon the notion that\r\ntalking one way on the stand and another way\r\npreviously is blowing hot and cold, and raises\r\na doubt as to the truthfulness of both\r\nstatements.\r\n\nMcCormick on Evidence, supra,  34, at 114.\r\nIn contrast, Rule 608(b) addresses situations in which a\r\nwitness's prior activity, whether exemplified by conduct or by a\r\nstatement, in and of itself casts significant doubt upon his\r\nveracity.  See Kasuri, 897 F.2d at 854.  Thus, Rule 608(b) applies\r\nto, and bars the introduction of, extrinsic evidence of specific\r\ninstances of a witness's misconduct if offered to impugn his\r\ncredibility.  See McCormick on Evidence, supra,  41, at 138.  So\r\nviewed, Rule 608(b) applies to a statement, as long as the\r\nstatement in and of itself stands as an independent means of\r\nimpeachment without any need to compare it to contradictory trial\r\ntestimony.  See, e.g., Cudlitz, 72 F.3d at 996; Brooke, 4 F.3d at\r\n1484; United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 37-38 (1st Cir. 1991);\r\nUnited States v. Jackson, 882 F.2d 1444, 1448 (9th Cir. 1989).\r\nApplying this analysis to the case at hand, Bradford's\r\ntestimony falls within the compass of Rule 613(b).  At trial, Flint\r\ndenied any knowledge of drug dealing at the premises, of the\r\nappellant's involvement with drugs, or of having told the agent\r\nabout jars of cocaine buried in the yard.  Bradford's testimony  \r\nthat Flint had told him that the MDEA, in searching the premises,\r\nhad overlooked several ounces of buried cocaine   directly\r\ncontradicted Flint's trial testimony in all three respects and\r\ntherefore constituted extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent\r\nstatement.\r\nThe appellant's contrary argument will not work unless\r\nthe statement attributed to Flint by Bradford, standing alone and\r\nwithout any reference to Flint's trial testimony, somehow calls\r\ninto question Flint's credibility.  The testimony fails this test: \r\nthe appellant does not squarely argue that the mere assertion that\r\nthe officers missed some buried jars of cocaine during their search\r\nof the premises, offered in an effort to cooperate with law\r\nenforcement, sinks to the level of an affirmative example of\r\nFlint's  misconduct such as would significantly affect Flint's\r\ncredibility, and such an argument, if made, would be unconvincing. \r\nIt is only the comparison of the earlier statement with Flint's\r\ntrial testimony that imbues the evidence with probative value for\r\nimpeachment purposes.\r\nThat ends the matter.  Inasmuch as Flint was afforded an\r\nopportunity to explain or deny the prior inconsistent statement and\r\nthe appellant had a chance to interrogate him about it, the\r\nconditions for the operation of Rule 613(b) were fully satisfied. \r\nUnless some other ground of objection looms   a matter to which we\r\nnow turn   Bradford's testimony was admissible under that rule. \r\nSee Causey, 834 F.2d at 1283; Lay, 644 F.2d at 1090.\r\n                        B.  Rule 403.\r\nAs a fallback, the appellant contends that the district\r\ncourt should have excluded Bradford's testimony on the ground that\r\nits unfairly prejudicial effect overbalanced its legitimate worth. \r\nThis contention rests on Fed. R. Evid. 403, which provides in\r\npertinent part that relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\"\r\nWe review the admission or exclusion of evidence under\r\nRule 403 for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Rivera-\r\nGomez, 67 F.3d 993, 997 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Ingraham,\r\n832 F.2d 229, 233 (1st Cir. 1987).  We afford wide latitude to\r\ntrial courts in these purlieus, taking care to \"evaluate the trial\r\ncourt's decision from its perspective when it had to rule and not\r\n[to] indulge in review by hindsight.\"  Old Chief v. United States,\r\n519 U.S. 172, 182 n.6 (1997).  \"Only rarely   and in\r\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances   will we, from the vista\r\nof a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot\r\njudgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and\r\nunfair effect.\"  Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340\r\n(1st Cir. 1988).\r\nVirtually all evidence is designed to be prejudicial\r\n(i.e., to help one side's case and to hurt the other's); therefore,\r\nRule 403 concerns itself not with prejudice per se but with unfair\r\nprejudice.  It guards against \"the capacity of some concededly\r\nrelevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a\r\nground different from proof specific to the offense charged.\"  Old\r\nChief, 519 U.S. at 180.  Attempting to wrap himself in this mantle,\r\nthe appellant hypothesizes that Bradford's testimony ineluctably\r\nled the jury to believe that the appellant was \"a big time drug\r\ndealer.\"  Appellant's Br. at 24.\r\nIn passing upon this objection at trial, the lower court\r\nmade a balanced apprisal of the situation.  In the process, the\r\ncourt noted the high probative value of the evidence   Flint, after\r\nall, was an alibi witness whose testimony, if credited, would have\r\nexonerated Winchenbach   and concluded that it was not unduly\r\nprejudicial.  In these circumstances, we discern no abuse of the\r\ncourt's discretion.\r\nWe add only two comments.  First, the prosecutor already\r\nhad brought the contents of the purported conversation to the\r\njury's attention when, without objection, he cross-examined Flint\r\nabout it.  This draws much of the sting from the appellant's claim. \r\nSee Ingraham, 832 F.2d at 236 (suggesting that the court, when\r\nperforming the requisite balancing under Rule 403, may take into\r\naccount the jury's familiarity with the substance of the evidence). \r\nSecond, the court prudently minimized any unfairly prejudicial\r\nimpact by an immediate instruction that directed the jury to\r\nconsider the statements attributed to Flint only \"for the limited\r\npurpose of whatever effect they may have in your judgment upon\r\n[his] credibility.\"  In that connection, the court explicitly\r\nwarned the jurors not to \"use [the evidence] for the purpose of\r\nproving the truth of what [Flint] said out-of-court.\"  We have\r\nfrequently remarked the prophylactic effect of such limiting\r\ninstructions, see, e.g., Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1285; United States\r\nv. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1993), and see no reason in\r\nthis instance to abandon the \"almost invariable assumption of the\r\nlaw that jurors follow their instructions,\" Richardson v. Marsh,\r\n481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987).\r\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  For the reasons stated, we uphold\r\nthe district court's denial of the appellant's motion to suppress\r\nand reject the appellant's claim that the jury should not have been\r\nallowed to hear extrinsic evidence anent Flint's prior inconsistent\r\nstatement to Bradford as an aid to evaluating Flint's credibility. \r\nFor aught that appears, Winchenbach was fairly tried and justly\r\nconvicted.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

One requires us to determine for the first time whether the police, equipped with a search warrant but not an arrest warrant, may enter the home and immediately arrest a resident on the basis of previously acquired probable cause. The second requires us to plot the line of demarcation between two closely related but poorly understood rules of evidence, Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) and Fed. R. Evid. 613(b). Concluding, as we do, that the arrest and the search conducted incident thereto were constitutionally permissible and that the trial court's admission of the challenged extrinsic evidence passes muster, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We offer only a synopsis of the evidentiary record, borrowing liberally from the district court's more detailed rendition. See United States v. Winchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d 159, 160-62 (D. Me. 1998). We later supplement our account in the course of discussing specific assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a period of approximately five months in mid-1997, the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA), working in concert with a confidential informant named James Holmes, fomented a series of \"controlled\" drug transactions. The first occurred in April. Acting on the MDEA's instructions, Holmes gave Wendy Spinney (a target of the probe) $250 in exchange for Spinney's promise to deliver cocaine. Although Spinney told Holmes that she would procure the cocaine in Rockland, agents followed her to the Ralph Wink Road, a dead-end street in Waldoboro. She disappeared for a brief interval, but the agents then spied her returning from the Ralph Wink Road and trailed her to a motel (where she delivered the cocaine to Holmes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, Holmes called Spinney to arrange another purchase. He then went to her abode and gave her $250. Although Spinney again told Holmes that she would go to Rockland to obtain drugs, agents followed her to Duck Puddle Road (a street leading to Genther Road, which accesses the Ralph Wink Road). A short time later, the agents spotted her coming from the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. Upon returning home, Spinney called Holmes and informed him that she could not get any cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, Holmes again called Spinney and arranged to buy an \"eight-ball\" of cocaine. He visited her residence -- as was typically the case, the MDEA chauffeured him there -- and in the ensuing conversation, Spinney identified her supplier as \"Junior\" and specified that he was based in Waldoboro. This time, the agents tracked Spinney to a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road in which defendant-appellant Ralph Winchenbach, Jr. resided with his quondam paramour, Arlene Jones (formerly Arlene Winchenbach, by virtue of her earlier marriage to one of the appellant's brothers).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Spinney spent nearly ten minutes inside the trailer and then returned directly to her home. When Holmes arrived, she gave him the promised eight-ball of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3, the MDEA again set Holmes into motion. On this occasion, he gave Spinney $250 at her dwelling. She said that she would go \"to Duck Puddle\" to retrieve the cocaine and that her supplier was waiting for her \"at Junior's house.\" Agents followed Spinney and a companion, later identified as William Holmstrom, to Duck Puddle Road. They were last seen heading in the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. After a ten-minute interval, an agent observed the pair traveling from the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. At that point, the officers arrested both Spinney and Holmstrom. Spinney had cocaine in her purse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon interrogation, Spinney told the agents that she bought the cocaine for $200 from \"Junior\" just prior to her arrest and that \"Junior\" lived in a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road. She added that she had purchased cocaine from \"Junior\" at his trailer on about 30 occasions and referred to him at one point as \"Junior Winchenbach.\" When asked whether \"Junior\" was Ralph Winchenbach, Jr., Spinney replied that she thought so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MDEA promptly applied for a warrant to search, inter alia, \"[t]he Ralph Winchenbach Jr and Arlene Winchenbach residence in Waldoboro, located on the Ralph Wink [R]oad box # 277\" as well as \"[a]ny and all people present and arriving at the residence at the time of the search, including but not limited to Ralph Winchenbach Jr and Arlene Winchenbach.\" The affidavit supporting the warrant described the location and appearance of the trailer at some length and stated unequivocally that it was the same trailer that Spinney had described to the arresting officers. A state magistrate granted the application and issued a warrant that authorized a search of the premises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same evening, a team of officers went to the appellant's trailer on the Ralph Wink Road to execute the search warrant. When the appellant opened the door, the officers immediately entered the trailer, arrested him, brought him outside, and searched him. They discovered over $1,000 on his person, including $80 of the \"buy money\" that the MDEA had given to Holmes earlier that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted the appellant for distribution of cocaine. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). The district court denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest and the ensuing search of his person, noting that the officers had probable cause to effect an arrest and that they were lawfully present in the appellant's home. See Winchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 165-67. A petit jury subsequently found the appellant guilty, and the district court imposed a 37-month incarcerative sentence. This appeal followed. In it, Winchenbach challenges both the denial of his motion to suppress and an evidentiary ruling. We address these questions seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that his arrest was unlawful and that, therefore, the district court should have suppressed the evidence gleaned from the search of his person. The second half of this argument depends on the validity of the first: it is settled beyond peradventure that a search of an individual's person made incident to a valid arrest is itself valid, despite the absence of an arrest warrant. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 224 (1973); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762-73 (1969). Put another way, \"[t]he fact of a lawful arrest, standing alone, authorizes a search.\" Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 35 (1979). Hence, we turn directly to the legitimacy of the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant does not contest the bona fides of the warrant that authorized the search of his dwelling but, rather, asseverates that a search warrant, unaccompanied by an arrest warrant, can never support an arrest of an individual in his own home. Building on this foundation, he posits that the fruits of the subsequent search of his person must be suppressed. The government responds that because the search warrant enabled the officers lawfully to enter the home and because probable cause existed to believe that the appellant had committed a crime, the officers had a right to effect an arrest without first pausing to secure a separate arrest warrant. The district court adhered to the government's view and refused suppression. See Winchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 167. We assess its conclusions of law de novo but scrutinize its factual findings only for clear error. See United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 565 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994). \"'[T]he decision whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to . . . probable cause' presents a mixed question of law and fact which is subject to plenary review.\" United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's primary position, purportedly grounded in the Supreme Court's decision in Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 576 (1980), is that law enforcement officers can never arrest a person in his home unless they first obtain an arrest warrant. But Payton does not sweep so broadly. To be sure, the Payton Court held on particular facts that officers who did not possess an arrest warrant could not enter the defendant's home to arrest him. See id. at 590. As subsequent cases demonstrate, however, Payton does not purport to declare an absolute rule. One recognized exception involves exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st Cir. 1995). Another applies to parolees and persons on probation. See, e.g., United States v. Cardona, 903 F.2d 60, 67, 69 (1st Cir. 1990). A third, the precise scope of which is here at issue, permits the police to arrest an individual in his home, without an arrest warrant, as long as they are lawfully on the premises (by reason, say, of a search warrant) and probable cause exists. See, e.g., Mahlberg v. Mentzer, 968 F.2d 772, 775 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Houston, 892 F.2d 696, 701-02 (8th Cir. 1989); Jones v. City of Denver, 854 F.2d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir. 1988).  In these cases, the police discovered the evidence that gave rise to probable cause during a lawful search of the premises and then arrested the occupant. We have found one case, United States v. Price, 888 F.2d 1206 (7th Cir. 1989), in which the court treated the arrest as taking place (with probable cause) immediately upon entry by the police, prior to any search. See id. at 1208-09; see generally 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 6.1(c), at 245 (3d ed. 1996). We deem both situations to be covered by the same principle. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts typically have predicated this exception on a \"greater subsumes the lesser\" analysis, reasoning that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search warrant represents a judicial determination that there is probable cause to invade the privacy of the suspect's home. The impartial determination that supports the issuance of a search warrant justifies a greater intrusion than that supporting the issuance of an arrest warrant. Thus, once an officer has procured a search warrant, the privacy interests that led to the imposition of an arrest warrant requirement in Payton have been protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jones, 854 F.2d at 1209 (italics omitted). This analysis does not contradict Payton, as the Court there did not speak so much to the matter of arrest as to the matter of unauthorized entry into a dwelling. See Payton, 445 U.S. at 588-90; see also New York v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 17 (1990) (explaining that \"the rule in Payton was designed to protect the physical integrity of the home\"). Thus, the logic underpinning Mahlberg and Jones embraces equally cases where, as here, an arrest takes place immediately after the officers' arrival at the dwelling and is based on previously-acquired probable cause. After all, \"Payton is grounded (as the Court put it) in 'the breach of the entrance to an individual's home.' That is, it is the otherwise unauthorized entry and not the arrest which gives rise to the warrant requirement.\" LaFave, supra, &#167; 6.1(c) at 249 (emphasis supplied); accord 1 David S. Rudstein et al., Criminal Constitutional Law &#182; 2.05[3], at 2-189 to 2-190 (1998) (\"A police officer acting upon probable cause also may make a warrantless arrest in premises not open to the general public when he has lawfully entered the premises, for example, pursuant to a search warrant . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe it follows that, once the police gain lawful entry to residential premises (as by a search warrant), an immediate arrest is permissible without a separate arrest warrant as long as evidence known to the officers before the search supplies probable cause for the arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See LaFave, supra, &#167; 6.1(c), at 249 &amp; n.114 (citing, inter alia, the Mahlberg line of cases). While the matter apparently is one that has received little attention in the federal appellate courts, a number of respected state courts, applying federal constitutional principles, have reached this conclusion. See, e.g., State v. Ware, 365 N.W.2d 418, 421 (Neb. 1985); People v. Kite, 423 N.E.2d 524, 526, 530-31 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981); State v. Turner, 627 P.2d 1324, 1326-28 (Wash. Ct. App. 1981); State v. Ruth, 435 A.2d 3, 6-7 (Conn. 1980); cf. People v. McCarter, 173 Cal. Rptr. 188, 193, 196 (Cal. Ct. App. 1981) (applying California law and holding that \"[i]f officers have authorization to enter the home, an arrest inside is of no greater constitutional significance than an arrest elsewhere\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant, who cites no case (federal or state) that holds to the contrary, resists this view, complaining that it diminishes the stature of arrest warrants and renders them virtually obsolete. There is a kernel of truth in this lament, but warrantless felony arrests outside of the home routinely have survived constitutional attack as long as probable cause exists. See, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 7 (1985); United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 423-24 (1976). From a Fourth Amendment standpoint, there is no valid reason why the same principle should not apply to arrests within a suspect's residence so long as the police are there lawfully. In that event, \"a warrantless arrest there is no more objectionable than a warrantless arrest on the street.\" LaFave, supra, &#167; 6.1(b), at 236 n.56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also suggests that following this rule will permit the police to play cat and mouse with a suspected criminal, forgoing an arrest warrant despite the ascertained existence of probable cause and postponing an arrest until the mood strikes. This argument has been made and rejected before in analogous contexts, see, e.g., Watson, 423 U.S. at 414, 423-24 (holding that a warrantless arrest based on probable cause may be made in a public place even though the officers had ample prior opportunity to obtain an arrest warrant, yet eschewed that course); United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1312 (1st Cir. 1994) (refusing \"to attach significance to the fact that the government had ample time to obtain a warrant but declined to procure one\"), and we reject it here. Put simply, when probable cause exists, the timing of an arrest is a matter that the Constitution almost invariably leaves to police discretion. See, e.g., Watson, 423 U.S. at 423-24; United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 216-17, 220 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that if the police have gained lawful entry to an individual's home based on a valid search warrant, they may arrest the individual before commencing the search, provided that they have probable cause to do so. Consequently, the issue before us reduces to whether the facts and circumstances within the agents' knowledge at the time of Winchenbach's arrest were sufficient to yield probable cause. Like the district court, see Winchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 165, we conclude that they were.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior opinions guide this inquiry. We begin with bedrock: probable cause to effect an arrest does not require the same level of certitude or quantum of proof that is necessary to convict. See United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir. 1987). Instead, probable cause exists when, \"at th[e] moment [the arrest is made,] the facts and circumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [individual] had committed or was committing an offense.\" Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964). For this purpose, the \"fellow officer\" rule applies, so that as a general matter (subject to exceptions not pertinent here), the focus is upon the collective knowledge possessed by, and the aggregate information available to, all the officers involved in the investigation. See Meade, 110 F.3d at 193-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell on generalities. In the last analysis, probable cause requires practical, context-specific determinations, made case by case, that give due weight to the totality of the circumstances and the trial court's superior coign of vantage. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 232 (1983); United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1988). If the circumstances supportably found \"warrant the officer's reasonable belief that the action taken is appropriate, the arrest is justified.\" Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1044 (1st Cir. 1997). Thus, the dispositive question here is whether the officers' collective knowledge at the moment of the arrest justified a prudent person in believing that the appellant had distributed cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the stipulated record with care, we find the answer to this question readily apparent. The MDEA had received several tips that the appellant was selling drugs on the Ralph Wink Road and had responded by enlisting Holmes's cooperation and placing Spinney under episodic surveillance. Prior to each \"controlled\" purchase of cocaine, the agents searched Holmes to ensure that he had no contraband -- and on three of the four occasions, he returned with cocaine. During each of the four contemplated transactions, the authorities followed Spinney either to the Ralph Wink Road (where the appellant resided) or to Duck Puddle Road (which led to the Ralph Wink Road). On the latter occasions, the lawmen witnessed her return from the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. Once, two MDEA agents actually followed Spinney to the appellant's trailer (where she apparently obtained cocaine). In conversation, Spinney told Holmes, among other things, that her cocaine source was \"Junior,\" who lived in Waldoboro. To cap matters, at the time of the last transaction, Spinney (1) told Holmes that her supplier was waiting for her \"at Junior's\"; (2) informed her captors when arrested that she had just purchased the cocaine found in her purse from \"Junior Winchenbach,\" who lived in a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road; and (3) described a long course of dealing that involved roughly 30 purchases from \"Junior\" at that locus. What Spinney had to say was corroborated not only by Holmes and by the officers' own observations, but also by Holmstrom, who confirmed that he had accompanied Spinney to the Ralph Wink Road to obtain cocaine on the day of her arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant counters this formidable factual array by suggesting that the record does not foreclose other inferences. For instance, Spinney might have purchased the cocaine from the appellant's brother, Dale Winchenbach, a known cocaine user who previously had owned the trailer and who still lived on the Ralph Wink Road, albeit in another mobile home. Nor is this all; he offers several other possible scenarios. No useful purpose would be served by debating these alternatives. The probable cause standard does not require the officers' conclusion to be ironclad, or even highly probable. Their conclusion that probable cause exists need only be reasonable. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983); United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ , 120 S.ct. 942, L.Ed.2d ___,(2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same logic dooms the appellant's argument that, during the final transaction, Spinney did not have sufficient time to drive to and from the Ralph Wink Road. The appellant's calculations are based on rough estimates and do no more than reveal a minor temporal disparity. Given the facts as a whole, this disparity does not suffice to render unreasonable the officers' belief that Spinney purchased cocaine from the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also faults the controls employed by the agents and remonstrates that, as a result, Spinney's statements lacked corroboration. In United States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279 (1st Cir. 1997), however, we remarked that \"[t]he risk that [an] informant is lying or in error need not be wholly eliminated. Rather, what is needed is that 'the probability of a lying or inaccurate informer has been sufficiently reduced by corroborative facts and observations.'\" Id. at 284 (citation omitted). In our view, the evidence gathered here, including several recorded conversations between Holmes (who at times wore a body wire) and Spinney and the agents' own observations (especially those pertinent to the third transaction), affords sufficient corroboration to reduce the risk of error to an acceptable level.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. Taking the totality of the circumstances presented, the agents' belief that the appellant was engaged in the distribution of cocaine was eminently reasonable, and the facts as supportably found by the trial court, see Winchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 160-62, provide solid underpinning for the court's conclusion that probable cause for the appellant's arrest existed. It follows inexorably that the lower court did not err in denying the suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE EVIDENTIARY QUESTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the appellant called Arlene Jones's son, Robbie Flint, as an alibi witness. Flint testified, inter alia, that the appellant was not in the trailer when Spinney arrived on September 3. On cross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you have any knowledge of [the appellant's] selling drugs or being involved in drugs on September 3rd 1997?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: None at all?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: As far as you know he was not involved in anything?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: . . . [I]n that interview with [agent] Dan Bradford, you did talk about [the appellant's] drug activity that night, didn't you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: You didn't? Well, isn't it true that what you told Dan Bradford was that the night that MDEA searched the house . . . they missed several ounces of cocaine that were buried in jars outside the residence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: You did not tell that to Dan Bradford?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No I didn't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On redirect examination, defense counsel ignored this testimony. In rebuttal, however, the prosecutor called Bradford and sought to interrogate him about the conversation. The court overruled the appellant's objections, and Bradford testified that he spoke with Flint some months after the fact and that Flint, in an effort \"to redeem himself\" for assisting in a jailbreak, told him that the agents overlooked a quantity of buried cocaine during the search of Winchenbach's trailer. The judge then instructed the jury to consider Bradford's testimony only as it related to Flint's credibility and not for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's admission of this evidence for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1297 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1118 (1997). The appellant maintains that such an abuse occurred because the court should have excluded Bradford's testimony under either Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) or Fed. R. Evid. 403. We address both objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 608(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, as below, the government parries the appellant's Rule 608(b) objection by claiming that Rule 613(b), not Rule 608(b), controls. On a superficial level at least, an apparent tension exists between these two rules. Rule 608(b) bars the credibility-related use of some extrinsic evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> while Rule 613(b), albeit by negative implication, permits the credibility-related use of some extrinsic evidence if the proponent satisfies certain enumerated conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In this instance, the appellant characterizes Bradford's testimony as extrinsic evidence relating to a specific instance of Flint's misconduct, offered by the prosecutor to attack Flint's credibility (and thus prohibited by Rule 608(b)). The government demurs, characterizing the testimony as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement made by Flint, offered after Flint had been afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the remark and in circumstances wherein the appellant had a full opportunity to interrogate both Flint and Bradford on the matter (and thus admissible under Rule 613(b)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, neither of these characterizations seems implausible -- but they cannot both be right. There are, moreover, two wrinkles. In the first place, the district court, though deeming the evidence admissible, mistakenly relied on Rule 608(b). This bevue need not detain us, for the trial court's use of an improper ground for admission of evidence is harmless if the evidence was admissible for the same purpose on some other ground. See United States v. Walsh, 928 F.2d 7, 10 n.10 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1127 (1st Cir. 1989). Thus, this wrinkle irons itself out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, each party presses a theory that fails to fit. The appellant seems to say that the evidence should be excluded under Rule 608(b) simply because it was offered to impugn Flint's credibility. This is an overbroad generalization which, among its other vices, contradicts the time-honored tenet that prior inconsistent statements ordinarily may be used to impeach a witness's credibility. See United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171, 176 (1975); United States v. Martin, 694 F.2d 885, 888 (1st Cir. 1982); see also 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 613.02[1] (2d ed. 1997). In the bargain, this interpretation of Rule 608(b) leaves no room at all for the admission of extrinsic impeachment evidence under the auspices of Rule 613(b). Thus, we reject it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, the government urges us to hold that a strict statement/conduct dichotomy triggers the choice of rule. Under this dichotomy, Rule 613(b) always would apply to statements and Rule 608(b) always would apply to conduct. A glance at the case law unmasks this gross oversimplification. Cases invoking Rule 608(b) in respect to statements, as opposed to conduct, are not uncommon. See, e.g., United States v. Cudlitz, 72 F.3d 992, 996 (1st Cir. 1996) (dealing with prior perjurious statements); United States v. Brooke, 4 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1993) (dealing with defendant's bogus claim to be suffering from terminal cancer in prosecution for manufacture of a destructive device); United States v. Sellers, 906 F.2d 597, 602 (11th Cir. 1990) (dealing with witness's lie to secure hospital admission, unrelated to ongoing prosecution). The commentators likewise abjure the proffered distinction. See, e.g., 1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence &#167; 41, at 138 n.5 (4th ed. 1992) (citing cases listing perjury and false statements as among the instances of conduct covered by Rule 608(b)). We, too, reject it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we cannot accept either of the parties' self-serving taxonomies, we think that there is a principled distinction between the types of evidence covered by the two rules. In our view, Rule 613(b) applies when two statements, one made at trial and one made previously, are irreconcilably at odds. In such an event, the cross-examiner is permitted to show the discrepancy by extrinsic evidence if necessary -- not to demonstrate which of the two is true but, rather, to show that the two do not jibe (thus calling the declarant's credibility into question). See, e.g., United States v. Higa, 55 F.3d 448, 451-52 (9th Cir. 1995); Kasuri v. St. Elizabeth Hosp. Med. Ctr., 897 F.2d 845, 853-54 (6th Cir. 1990); United States v. Causey, 834 F.2d 1277, 1282-83 (6th Cir. 1987); United States v. Lay, 644 F.2d 1087, 1090 (5th Cir. 1981). In short, comparison and contradiction are the hallmarks of Rule 613(b). As one treatise puts it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The theory of attack by prior inconsistent statements is not based on the assumption that the present testimony is false and the former statement true but rather upon the notion that talking one way on the stand and another way previously is blowing hot and cold, and raises a doubt as to the truthfulness of both statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormick on Evidence, supra, &#167; 34, at 114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, Rule 608(b) addresses situations in which a witness's prior activity, whether exemplified by conduct or by a statement, in and of itself casts significant doubt upon his veracity. See Kasuri, 897 F.2d at 854. Thus, Rule 608(b) applies to, and bars the introduction of, extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness's misconduct if offered to impugn his credibility. See McCormick on Evidence, supra, &#167; 41, at 138. So viewed, Rule 608(b) applies to a statement, as long as the statement in and of itself stands as an independent means of impeachment without any need to compare it to contradictory trial testimony. See, e.g., Cudlitz, 72 F.3d at 996; Brooke, 4 F.3d at 1484; United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 37-38 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Jackson, 882 F.2d 1444, 1448 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this analysis to the case at hand, Bradford's testimony falls within the compass of Rule 613(b). At trial, Flint denied any knowledge of drug dealing at the premises, of the appellant's involvement with drugs, or of having told the agent about jars of cocaine buried in the yard. Bradford's testimony -- that Flint had told him that the MDEA, in searching the premises, had overlooked several ounces of buried cocaine -- directly contradicted Flint's trial testimony in all three respects and therefore constituted extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's contrary argument will not work unless the statement attributed to Flint by Bradford, standing alone and without any reference to Flint's trial testimony, somehow calls into question Flint's credibility. The testimony fails this test: the appellant does not squarely argue that the mere assertion that the officers missed some buried jars of cocaine during their search of the premises, offered in an effort to cooperate with law enforcement, sinks to the level of an affirmative example of Flint's misconduct such as would significantly affect Flint's credibility, and such an argument, if made, would be unconvincing. It is only the comparison of the earlier statement with Flint's trial testimony that imbues the evidence with probative value for impeachment purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Inasmuch as Flint was afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the prior inconsistent statement and the appellant had a chance to interrogate him about it, the conditions for the operation of Rule 613(b) were fully satisfied. Unless some other ground of objection looms -- a matter to which we now turn -- Bradford's testimony was admissible under that rule. See Causey, 834 F.2d at 1283; Lay, 644 F.2d at 1090.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Rule 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback, the appellant contends that the district court should have excluded Bradford's testimony on the ground that its unfairly prejudicial effect overbalanced its legitimate worth. This contention rests on Fed. R. Evid. 403, which provides in pertinent part that relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the admission or exclusion of evidence under Rule 403 for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 997 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d 229, 233 (1st Cir. 1987). We afford wide latitude to trial courts in these purlieus, taking care to \"evaluate the trial court's decision from its perspective when it had to rule and not [to] indulge in review by hindsight.\" Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 182 n.6 (1997). \"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually all evidence is designed to be prejudicial (i.e., to help one side's case and to hurt the other's); therefore, Rule 403 concerns itself not with prejudice per se but with unfair prejudice. It guards against \"the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged.\" Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 180. Attempting to wrap himself in this mantle, the appellant hypothesizes that Bradford's testimony ineluctably led the jury to believe that the appellant was \"a big time drug dealer.\" Appellant's Br. at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing upon this objection at trial, the lower court made a balanced apprisal of the situation. In the process, the court noted the high probative value of the evidence -- Flint, after all, was an alibi witness whose testimony, if credited, would have exonerated Winchenbach -- and concluded that it was not unduly prejudicial. In these circumstances, we discern no abuse of the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add only two comments. First, the prosecutor already had brought the contents of the purported conversation to the jury's attention when, without objection, he cross-examined Flint about it. This draws much of the sting from the appellant's claim. See Ingraham, 832 F.2d at 236(suggesting that the court, when performing the requisite balancing under Rule 403, may take into account the jury's familiarity with the substance of the evidence). Second, the court prudently minimized any unfairly prejudicial impact by an immediate instruction that directed the jury to consider the statements attributed to Flint only \"for the limited purpose of whatever effect they may have in your judgment upon [his] credibility.\" In that connection, the court explicitly warned the jurors not to \"use [the evidence] for the purpose of proving the truth of what [Flint] said out-of-court.\" We have frequently remarked the prophylactic effect of such limiting instructions, see, e.g., Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1285; United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1993), and see no reason in this instance to abandon the \"almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions,\" Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we uphold the district court's denial of the appellant's motion to suppress and reject the appellant's claim that the jury should not have been allowed to hear extrinsic evidence anent Flint's prior inconsistent statement to Bradford as an aid to evaluating Flint's credibility. For aught that appears, Winchenbach was fairly tried and justly convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Spinney later told Holmes that she was unable to obtain cocaine from Rockland and that the people with whom she dealt in Waldoboro were \"out.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In a pro se submission, the appellant asserts for the first time that he did not reside in the trailer. This assertion contradicts the stipulated record. See Winchenbach, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 162 n.5. It is further belied by the fact that, although Arlene Jones owned the trailer, she maintained the telephone listing in the appellant's name. At any rate, arguments raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived. See Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The warrant, however, did not authorize a search of the person of any individual. The appellant translates this omission into a \"finding\" that the MDEA lacked probable cause to arrest anyone. Inasmuch as the agents did not apply for an arrest warrant, the magistrate's failure to issue one cannot be construed as any sort of finding concerning the existence vel non of probable cause to arrest the appellant. Moreover, the government categorizes the discrepancy between the warrant application and the warrant itself as the inadvertent product of the haste with which the agents drafted the latter for the magistrate's signature. Because the record sheds no light on how this anomaly arose, we would in any event decline to attach decretory significance to it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Of course, when the arrest occurs immediately, evidence acquired during the ensuing search may not be used to justify it retrospectively. See United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The appellant cites Khounsavanh for the proposition that probable cause does not exist where an individual has been identified only by a nickname. In that case, however, no evidence linked the defendants to the premises to be searched. See 113 F.3d at 281-82. The contrast is stark: here, the warrant application stated categorically that the trailer had been identified as that of Ralph Winchenbach, Jr., and at the time of the arrest, the officers knew the appellant's real name and had every reason to believe that he was the person from whom Spinney had been buying cocaine. Because sufficient evidence existed prior to the arrest to connect the appellant to the premises and to support a filing of probable cause, Khounsavanh does not assist the appellant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Rule 608(b) provides in pertinent part that \"[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility . . . may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Rule 613(b) provides that \"[e]xtrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

One requires us to determine for the first time whether the police, equipped with a search warrant but not an arrest warrant, may enter the home and immediately arrest a resident on the basis of previously acquired probable cause. The second requires us to plot the line of demarcation between two closely related but poorly understood rules of evidence, Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) and Fed. R. Evid. 613(b). Concluding, as we do, that the arrest and the search conducted incident thereto were constitutionally permissible and that the trial court's admission of the challenged extrinsic evidence passes muster, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We offer only a synopsis of the evidentiary record, borrowing liberally from the district court's more detailed rendition. See United States v. Winchenbach, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516181\"><a href=\"/opinion/2516181/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, 160-62 (D. Me. 1998). We later supplement our account in the course of discussing specific assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a period of approximately five months in mid-1997, the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA), working in concert with a confidential informant named James Holmes, fomented a series of \"controlled\" drug transactions. The first occurred in April. Acting on the MDEA's instructions, Holmes gave Wendy Spinney (a target of the probe) $250 in exchange for Spinney's promise to deliver cocaine. Although Spinney told Holmes that she would procure the cocaine in Rockland, agents followed her to the Ralph Wink Road, a dead-end street in Waldoboro. She disappeared for a brief interval, but the agents then spied her returning from the Ralph Wink Road and trailed her to a motel (where she delivered the cocaine to Holmes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, Holmes called Spinney to arrange another purchase. He then went to her abode and gave her $250. Although Spinney again told Holmes that she would go to Rockland to obtain drugs, agents followed her to Duck Puddle Road (a street leading to Genther Road, which accesses the Ralph Wink Road). A short time later, the agents spotted her coming from the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. Upon returning home, Spinney called Holmes and informed him that she could not get any cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, Holmes again called Spinney and arranged to buy an \"eight-ball\" of cocaine. He visited her residence -- as was typically the case, the MDEA chauffeured him there -- and in the ensuing conversation, Spinney identified her supplier as \"Junior\" and specified that he was based in Waldoboro. This time, the agents tracked Spinney to a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road in which defendant-appellant Ralph Winchenbach, Jr. resided with his quondam paramour, Arlene Jones (formerly Arlene Winchenbach, by virtue of her earlier marriage to one of the appellant's brothers).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Spinney spent nearly ten minutes inside the trailer and then returned directly to her home. When Holmes arrived, she gave him the promised eight-ball of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3, the MDEA again set Holmes into motion. On this occasion, he gave Spinney $250 at her dwelling. She said that she would go \"to Duck Puddle\" to retrieve the cocaine and that her supplier was waiting for her \"at Junior's house.\" Agents followed Spinney and a companion, later identified as William Holmstrom, to Duck Puddle Road. They were last seen heading in the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. After a ten-minute interval, an agent observed the pair traveling from the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. At that point, the officers arrested both Spinney and Holmstrom. Spinney had cocaine in her purse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon interrogation, Spinney told the agents that she bought the cocaine for $200 from \"Junior\" just prior to her arrest and that \"Junior\" lived in a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road. She added that she had purchased cocaine from \"Junior\" at his trailer on about 30 occasions and referred to him at one point as \"Junior Winchenbach.\" When asked whether \"Junior\" was Ralph Winchenbach, Jr., Spinney replied that she thought so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MDEA promptly applied for a warrant to search, inter alia, \"[t]he Ralph Winchenbach Jr and Arlene Winchenbach residence in Waldoboro, located on the Ralph Wink [R]oad box # 277\" as well as \"[a]ny and all people present and arriving at the residence at the time of the search, including but not limited to Ralph Winchenbach Jr and Arlene Winchenbach.\" The affidavit supporting the warrant described the location and appearance of the trailer at some length and stated unequivocally that it was the same trailer that Spinney had described to the arresting officers. A state magistrate granted the application and issued a warrant that authorized a search of the premises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same evening, a team of officers went to the appellant's trailer on the Ralph Wink Road to execute the search warrant. When the appellant opened the door, the officers immediately entered the trailer, arrested him, brought him outside, and searched him. They discovered over $1,000 on his person, including $80 of the \"buy money\" that the MDEA had given to Holmes earlier that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted the appellant for distribution of cocaine. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). The district court denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest and the ensuing search of his person, noting that the officers had probable cause to effect an arrest and that they were lawfully present in the appellant's home. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516181\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Winchenbach,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2516181/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">165-67</span></a></span>. A petit jury subsequently found the appellant guilty, and the district court imposed a 37-month incarcerative sentence. This appeal followed. In it, Winchenbach challenges both the denial of his motion to suppress and an evidentiary ruling. We address these questions seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that his arrest was unlawful and that, therefore, the district court should have suppressed the evidence gleaned from the search of his person. The second half of this argument depends on the validity of the first: it is settled beyond peradventure that a search of an individual's person made incident to a valid arrest is itself valid, despite the absence of an arrest warrant. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108893\"><a href=\"/opinion/108893/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 224 (1973); Chimel v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107979\"><a href=\"/opinion/107979/chimel-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 762-73 (1969). Put another way, \"[t]he fact of a lawful arrest, standing alone, authorizes a search.\" Michigan v. DeFillippo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110127\"><a href=\"/opinion/110127/michigan-v-defillippo/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (1979). Hence, we turn directly to the legitimacy of the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant does not contest the bona fides of the warrant that authorized the search of his dwelling but, rather, asseverates that a search warrant, unaccompanied by an arrest warrant, can never support an arrest of an individual in his own home. Building on this foundation, he posits that the fruits of the subsequent search of his person must be suppressed. The government responds that because the search warrant enabled the officers lawfully to enter the home and because probable cause existed to believe that the appellant had committed a crime, the officers had a right to effect an arrest without first pausing to secure a separate arrest warrant. The district court adhered to the government's view and refused suppression. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516181\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Winchenbach,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2516181/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>. We assess its conclusions of law de novo but scrutinize its factual findings only for clear error. See United States v. Schaefer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196839\"><a href=\"/opinion/196839/united-states-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 565 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v.

Meade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 193 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Ornelas v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 696 (1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's primary position, purportedly grounded in the Supreme Court's decision in Payton v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110235\"><a href=\"/opinion/110235/payton-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 576 (1980), is that law enforcement officers can never arrest a person in his home unless they first obtain an arrest warrant. But Payton does not sweep so broadly. To be sure, the Payton Court held on particular facts that officers who did not possess an arrest warrant could not enter the defendant's home to arrest him. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110235\"><a href=\"/opinion/110235/payton-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 590. </a></span>As subsequent cases demonstrate, however, Payton does not purport to declare an absolute rule. One recognized exception involves exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Hegarty v. Somerset County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196071\"><a href=\"/opinion/196071/hegarty-v-somerset-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1367</span></a></span>, 1374 (1st Cir. 1995). Another applies to parolees and persons on probation. See, e.g., United States v. Cardona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541733\"><a href=\"/opinion/541733/united-states-v-edward-cardona/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 67, 69 (1st Cir. 1990). A third, the precise scope of which is here at issue, permits the police to arrest an individual in his home, without an arrest warrant, as long as they are lawfully on the premises (by reason, say, of a search warrant) and probable cause exists. See, e.g., Mahlberg v. Mentzer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586382\"><a href=\"/opinion/586382/raymond-t-mahlberg-v-edward-j-mentzer-individually-and-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span>, 775 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Houston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534264\"><a href=\"/opinion/534264/united-states-v-robert-lee-houston-united-states-of-america-v-leonard-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span>, 701-02 (8th Cir. 1989); Jones v. City of Denver, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510317\"><a href=\"/opinion/510317/no-87-2167/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span>, 1209 (10th Cir. 1988).  In these cases, the police discovered the evidence that gave rise to probable cause during a lawful search of the premises and then arrested the occupant. We have found one case, United States v. Price, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531375\"><a href=\"/opinion/531375/united-states-v-kevin-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span> </a></span>(7th Cir. 1989), in which the court treated the arrest as taking place (with probable cause) immediately upon entry by the police, prior to any search. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531375\"><a href=\"/opinion/531375/united-states-v-kevin-price/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1208-09; </a></span>see generally 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 6.1(c), at 245 (3d ed. 1996). We deem both situations to be covered by the same principle. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts typically have predicated this exception on a \"greater subsumes the lesser\" analysis, reasoning that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search warrant represents a judicial determination that there is probable cause to invade the privacy of the suspect's home. The impartial determination that supports the issuance of a search warrant justifies a greater intrusion than that supporting the issuance of an arrest warrant. Thus, once an officer has procured a search warrant, the privacy interests that led to the imposition of an arrest warrant requirement in Payton have been protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510317\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jones,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/510317/no-87-2167/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1209</span> </a></span>(italics omitted). This analysis does not contradict Payton, as the Court there did not speak so much to the matter of arrest as to the matter of unauthorized entry into a dwelling.

Thus, the logic underpinning Mahlberg and Jones embraces equally cases where, as here, an arrest takes place immediately after the officers' arrival at the dwelling and is based on previously-acquired probable cause. After all, \"Payton is grounded (as the Court put it) in 'the breach of the entrance to an individual's home.' That is, it is the otherwise unauthorized entry and not the arrest which gives rise to the warrant requirement.\" LaFave, supra, &#167; 6.1(c) at 249 (emphasis supplied); accord 1 David S. Rudstein et al., Criminal Constitutional Law &#182; 2.05[3], at 2-189 to 2-190 (1998) (\"A police officer acting upon probable cause also may make a warrantless arrest in premises not open to the general public when he has lawfully entered the premises, for example, pursuant to a search warrant . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe it follows that, once the police gain lawful entry to residential premises (as by a search warrant), an immediate arrest is permissible without a separate arrest warrant as long as evidence known to the officers before the search supplies probable cause for the arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See LaFave, supra, &#167; 6.1(c), at 249 &amp; n.114 (citing, inter alia, the Mahlberg line of cases). While the matter apparently is one that has received little attention in the federal appellate courts, a number of respected state courts, applying federal constitutional principles, have reached this conclusion. See, e.g., State v. Ware, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1640468\"><a href=\"/opinion/1640468/state-v-ware/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span>, 421 (Neb. 1985); People v.

There is a kernel of truth in this lament, but warrantless felony arrests outside of the home routinely have survived constitutional attack as long as probable cause exists. See, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111397\"><a href=\"/opinion/111397/tennessee-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1985); United States v. Watson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></span>, 423-24 (1976). From a Fourth Amendment standpoint, there is no valid reason why the same principle should not apply to arrests within a suspect's residence so long as the police are there lawfully. In that event, \"a warrantless arrest there is no more objectionable than a warrantless arrest on the street.\" LaFave, supra, &#167; 6.1(b), at 236 n.56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also suggests that following this rule will permit the police to play cat and mouse with a suspected criminal, forgoing an arrest warrant despite the ascertained existence of probable cause and postponing an arrest until the mood strikes. This argument has been made and rejected before in analogous contexts, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Watson,</span> <span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">414</span></span>, 423-24 (holding that a warrantless arrest based on probable cause may be made in a public place even though the officers had ample prior opportunity to obtain an arrest warrant, yet eschewed that course); United States v. DeMasi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195694\"><a href=\"/opinion/195694/united-states-v-de-masi/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, 1312 (1st Cir. 1994) (refusing \"to attach significance to the fact that the government had ample time to obtain a warrant but declined to procure one\"), and we reject it here. Put simply, when probable cause exists, the timing of an arrest is a matter that the Constitution almost invariably leaves to police discretion. See, e.g., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Watson,</span> <span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">423-24</span></span>; United States v.

Consequently, the issue before us reduces to whether the facts and circumstances within the agents' knowledge at the time of Winchenbach's arrest were sufficient to yield probable cause. Like the district court, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516181\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Winchenbach,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2516181/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We begin with bedrock: probable cause to effect an arrest does not require the same level of certitude or quantum of proof that is necessary to convict. See United States v. Figueroa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488520\"><a href=\"/opinion/488520/united-states-v-raul-casiano-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1023 (1st Cir. 1987). Instead, probable cause exists when, \"at th[e] moment [the arrest is made,] the facts and circumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [individual] had committed or was committing an offense.\" Beck v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 91 (1964). For this purpose, the \"fellow officer\" rule applies, so that as a general matter (subject to exceptions not pertinent here), the focus is upon the collective knowledge possessed by, and the aggregate information available to, all the officers involved in the investigation. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Meade,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">193-94</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell on generalities. In the last analysis, probable cause requires practical, context-specific determinations, made case by case, that give due weight to the totality of the circumstances and the trial court's superior coign of vantage. See Illinois v. Gates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 232 (1983); United States v.

If the circumstances supportably found \"warrant the officer's reasonable belief that the action taken is appropriate, the arrest is justified.\" Logue v. Dore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197149\"><a href=\"/opinion/197149/logue-v-dore/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1044 (1st Cir. 1997). Thus, the dispositive question here is whether the officers' collective knowledge at the moment of the arrest justified a prudent person in believing that the appellant had distributed cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the stipulated record with care, we find the answer to this question readily apparent. The MDEA had received several tips that the appellant was selling drugs on the Ralph Wink Road and had responded by enlisting Holmes's cooperation and placing Spinney under episodic surveillance. Prior to each \"controlled\" purchase of cocaine, the agents searched Holmes to ensure that he had no contraband -- and on three of the four occasions, he returned with cocaine. During each of the four contemplated transactions, the authorities followed Spinney either to the Ralph Wink Road (where the appellant resided) or to Duck Puddle Road (which led to the Ralph Wink Road). On the latter occasions, the lawmen witnessed her return from the direction of the Ralph Wink Road. Once, two MDEA agents actually followed Spinney to the appellant's trailer (where she apparently obtained cocaine). In conversation, Spinney told Holmes, among other things, that her cocaine source was \"Junior,\" who lived in Waldoboro. To cap matters, at the time of the last transaction, Spinney (1) told Holmes that her supplier was waiting for her \"at Junior's\"; (2) informed her captors when arrested that she had just purchased the cocaine found in her purse from \"Junior Winchenbach,\" who lived in a trailer on the Ralph Wink Road; and (3) described a long course of dealing that involved roughly 30 purchases from \"Junior\" at that locus. What Spinney had to say was corroborated not only by Holmes and by the officers' own observations, but also by Holmstrom, who confirmed that he had accompanied Spinney to the Ralph Wink Road to obtain cocaine on the day of her arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant counters this formidable factual array by suggesting that the record does not foreclose other inferences. For instance, Spinney might have purchased the cocaine from the appellant's brother, Dale Winchenbach, a known cocaine user who previously had owned the trailer and who still lived on the Ralph Wink Road, albeit in another mobile home. Nor is this all; he offers several other possible scenarios. No useful purpose would be served by debating these alternatives. The probable cause standard does not require the officers' conclusion to be ironclad, or even highly probable. Their conclusion that probable cause exists need only be reasonable. See Texas v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110901\"><a href=\"/opinion/110901/texas-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, 742 (1983); United States v. Feliz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764988\"><a href=\"/opinion/764988/united-states-v-yanokura-f-eliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ , 120 S.ct. 942, L.Ed.2d ___,(2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same logic dooms the appellant's argument that, during the final transaction, Spinney did not have sufficient time to drive to and from the Ralph Wink Road. The appellant's calculations are based on rough estimates and do no more than reveal a minor temporal disparity. Given the facts as a whole, this disparity does not suffice to render unreasonable the officers' belief that Spinney purchased cocaine from the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also faults the controls employed by the agents and remonstrates that, as a result, Spinney's statements lacked corroboration. In United States v. Khounsavanh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197362\"><a href=\"/opinion/197362/united-states-v-khounsavanh/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1997), however, we remarked that \"[t]he risk that [an] informant is lying or in error need not be wholly eliminated. Rather, what is needed is that 'the probability of a lying or inaccurate informer has been sufficiently reduced by corroborative facts and observations.'\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197362\"><a href=\"/opinion/197362/united-states-v-khounsavanh/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 284 </a></span>(citation omitted). In our view, the evidence gathered here, including several recorded conversations between Holmes (who at times wore a body wire) and Spinney and the agents' own observations (especially those pertinent to the third transaction), affords sufficient corroboration to reduce the risk of error to an acceptable level.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. Taking the totality of the circumstances presented, the agents' belief that the appellant was engaged in the distribution of cocaine was eminently reasonable, and the facts as supportably found by the trial court, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516181\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Winchenbach,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2516181/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">160-62</span></a></span>, provide solid underpinning for the court's conclusion that probable cause for the appellant's arrest existed. It follows inexorably that the lower court did not err in denying the suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE EVIDENTIARY QUESTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the appellant called Arlene Jones's son, Robbie Flint, as an alibi witness. Flint testified, inter alia, that the appellant was not in the trailer when Spinney arrived on September 3. On cross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you have any knowledge of [the appellant's] selling drugs or being involved in drugs on September 3rd 1997?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

Well, isn't it true that what you told Dan Bradford was that the night that MDEA searched the house . . . they missed several ounces of cocaine that were buried in jars outside the residence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: You did not tell that to Dan Bradford?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No I didn't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On redirect examination, defense counsel ignored this testimony. In rebuttal, however, the prosecutor called Bradford and sought to interrogate him about the conversation. The court overruled the appellant's objections, and Bradford testified that he spoke with Flint some months after the fact and that Flint, in an effort \"to redeem himself\" for assisting in a jailbreak, told him that the agents overlooked a quantity of buried cocaine during the search of Winchenbach's trailer. The judge then instructed the jury to consider Bradford's testimony only as it related to Flint's credibility and not for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's admission of this evidence for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1297 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span> </span>(1997). The appellant maintains that such an abuse occurred because the court should have excluded Bradford's testimony under either Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) or Fed. R. Evid. 403. We address both objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 608(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, as below, the government parries the appellant's Rule 608(b) objection by claiming that Rule 613(b), not Rule 608(b), controls. On a superficial level at least, an apparent tension exists between these two rules. Rule 608(b) bars the credibility-related use of some extrinsic evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> while Rule 613(b), albeit by negative implication, permits the credibility-related use of some extrinsic evidence if the proponent satisfies certain enumerated conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In this instance, the appellant characterizes Bradford's testimony as extrinsic evidence relating to a specific instance of Flint's misconduct, offered by the prosecutor to attack Flint's credibility (and thus prohibited by Rule 608(b)). The government demurs, characterizing the testimony as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement made by Flint, offered after Flint had been afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the remark and in circumstances wherein the appellant had a full opportunity to interrogate both Flint and Bradford on the matter (and thus admissible under Rule 613(b)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, neither of these characterizations seems implausible -- but they cannot both be right. There are, moreover, two wrinkles. In the first place, the district court, though deeming the evidence admissible, mistakenly relied on Rule 608(b). This bevue need not detain us, for the trial court's use of an improper ground for admission of evidence is harmless if the evidence was admissible for the same purpose on some other ground. See United States v. Walsh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557359\"><a href=\"/opinion/557359/united-states-v-bartley-walsh-aka-barney-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 n.10 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v.

Thus, this wrinkle irons itself out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, each party presses a theory that fails to fit. The appellant seems to say that the evidence should be excluded under Rule 608(b) simply because it was offered to impugn Flint's credibility. This is an overbroad generalization which, among its other vices, contradicts the time-honored tenet that prior inconsistent statements ordinarily may be used to impeach a witness's credibility. See United States v. Hale, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109289\"><a href=\"/opinion/109289/united-states-v-hale/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 176 (1975); United States v.

Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 613.02[1] (2d ed. 1997). In the bargain, this interpretation of Rule 608(b) leaves no room at all for the admission of extrinsic impeachment evidence under the auspices of Rule 613(b). Thus, we reject it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, the government urges us to hold that a strict statement/conduct dichotomy triggers the choice of rule. Under this dichotomy, Rule 613(b) always would apply to statements and Rule 608(b) always would apply to conduct. A glance at the case law unmasks this gross oversimplification. Cases invoking Rule 608(b) in respect to statements, as opposed to conduct, are not uncommon. See, e.g., United States v. Cudlitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196509\"><a href=\"/opinion/196509/united-states-v-cudlitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 996 (1st Cir. 1996) (dealing with prior perjurious statements); United States v. Brooke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652907\"><a href=\"/opinion/652907/united-states-v-susan-brooke/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span>, 1484 (9th Cir. 1993) (dealing with defendant's bogus claim to be suffering from terminal cancer in prosecution for manufacture of a destructive device); United States v. Sellers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543684\"><a href=\"/opinion/543684/united-states-v-danny-sellers-and-terry-roach/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 602 (11th Cir. 1990) (dealing with witness's lie to secure hospital admission, unrelated to ongoing prosecution). The commentators likewise abjure the proffered distinction. See, e.g., 1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence &#167; 41, at 138 n.5 (4th ed. 1992) (citing cases listing perjury and false statements as among the instances of conduct covered by Rule 608(b)). We, too, reject it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we cannot accept either of the parties' self-serving taxonomies, we think that there is a principled distinction between the types of evidence covered by the two rules. In our view, Rule 613(b) applies when two statements, one made at trial and one made previously, are irreconcilably at odds. In such an event, the cross-examiner is permitted to show the discrepancy by extrinsic evidence if necessary -- not to demonstrate which of the two is true but, rather, to show that the two do not jibe (thus calling the declarant's credibility into question). See, e.g., United States v. Higa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696324\"><a href=\"/opinion/696324/united-states-v-zane-higa-united-states-of-america-v-zane-higa/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 451-52 (9th Cir. 1995); Kasuri v.

In short, comparison and contradiction are the hallmarks of Rule 613(b). As one treatise puts it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The theory of attack by prior inconsistent statements is not based on the assumption that the present testimony is false and the former statement true but rather upon the notion that talking one way on the stand and another way previously is blowing hot and cold, and raises a doubt as to the truthfulness of both statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormick on Evidence, supra, &#167; 34, at 114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, Rule 608(b) addresses situations in which a witness's prior activity, whether exemplified by conduct or by a statement, in and of itself casts significant doubt upon his veracity. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537654\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kasuri,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/537654/52-fair-emplpraccas-362-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39701-29-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>. Thus, Rule 608(b) applies to, and bars the introduction of, extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness's misconduct if offered to impugn his credibility. See McCormick on Evidence, supra, &#167; 41, at 138. So viewed, Rule 608(b) applies to a statement, as long as the statement in and of itself stands as an independent means of impeachment without any need to compare it to contradictory trial testimony. See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196509\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cudlitz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196509/united-states-v-cudlitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652907\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brooke,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/652907/united-states-v-susan-brooke/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1484</span></a></span>; United States v.

At trial, Flint denied any knowledge of drug dealing at the premises, of the appellant's involvement with drugs, or of having told the agent about jars of cocaine buried in the yard. Bradford's testimony -- that Flint had told him that the MDEA, in searching the premises, had overlooked several ounces of buried cocaine -- directly contradicted Flint's trial testimony in all three respects and therefore constituted extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's contrary argument will not work unless the statement attributed to Flint by Bradford, standing alone and without any reference to Flint's trial testimony, somehow calls into question Flint's credibility. The testimony fails this test: the appellant does not squarely argue that the mere assertion that the officers missed some buried jars of cocaine during their search of the premises, offered in an effort to cooperate with law enforcement, sinks to the level of an affirmative example of Flint's misconduct such as would significantly affect Flint's credibility, and such an argument, if made, would be unconvincing. It is only the comparison of the earlier statement with Flint's trial testimony that imbues the evidence with probative value for impeachment purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Inasmuch as Flint was afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the prior inconsistent statement and the appellant had a chance to interrogate him about it, the conditions for the operation of Rule 613(b) were fully satisfied. Unless some other ground of objection looms -- a matter to which we now turn -- Bradford's testimony was admissible under that rule. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Causey,</span> <span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1283</span></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388785\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lay,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/388785/united-states-v-james-john-lay/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

This contention rests on Fed. R. Evid. 403, which provides in pertinent part that relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the admission or exclusion of evidence under Rule 403 for abuse of discretion.

We afford wide latitude to trial courts in these purlieus, taking care to \"evaluate the trial court's decision from its perspective when it had to rule and not [to] indulge in review by hindsight.\" Old Chief v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 182 n.6 (1997). \"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v.

It guards against \"the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged.\" Old <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Chief,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>. Attempting to wrap himself in this mantle, the appellant hypothesizes that Bradford's testimony ineluctably led the jury to believe that the appellant was \"a big time drug dealer.\" Appellant's Br. at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing upon this objection at trial, the lower court made a balanced apprisal of the situation. In the process, the court noted the high probative value of the evidence -- Flint, after all, was an alibi witness whose testimony, if credited, would have exonerated Winchenbach -- and concluded that it was not unduly prejudicial. In these circumstances, we discern no abuse of the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add only two comments. First, the prosecutor already had brought the contents of the purported conversation to the jury's attention when, without objection, he cross-examined Flint about it. This draws much of the sting from the appellant's claim. See Ingraham, 832 F.2d at 236(suggesting that the court, when performing the requisite balancing under Rule 403, may take into account the jury's familiarity with the substance of the evidence). Second, the court prudently minimized any unfairly prejudicial impact by an immediate instruction that directed the jury to consider the statements attributed to Flint only \"for the limited purpose of whatever effect they may have in your judgment upon [his] credibility.\" In that connection, the court explicitly warned the jurors not to \"use [the evidence] for the purpose of proving the truth of what [Flint] said out-of-court.\" We have frequently remarked the prophylactic effect of such limiting instructions, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Houlihan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1285</span></a></span>; United States v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we uphold the district court's denial of the appellant's motion to suppress and reject the appellant's claim that the jury should not have been allowed to hear extrinsic evidence anent Flint's prior inconsistent statement to Bradford as an aid to evaluating Flint's credibility. For aught that appears, Winchenbach was fairly tried and justly convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Spinney later told Holmes that she was unable to obtain cocaine from Rockland and that the people with whom she dealt in Waldoboro were \"out.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In a pro se submission, the appellant asserts for the first time that he did not reside in the trailer. This assertion contradicts the stipulated record. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516181\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Winchenbach,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2516181/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">162</span> </a></span>n.5. It is further belied by the fact that, although Arlene Jones owned the trailer, she maintained the telephone listing in the appellant's name. At any rate, arguments raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived. See Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198453\"><a href=\"/opinion/198453/campos-orrego-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.

The appellant translates this omission into a \"finding\" that the MDEA lacked probable cause to arrest anyone. Inasmuch as the agents did not apply for an arrest warrant, the magistrate's failure to issue one cannot be construed as any sort of finding concerning the existence vel non of probable cause to arrest the appellant. Moreover, the government categorizes the discrepancy between the warrant application and the warrant itself as the inadvertent product of the haste with which the agents drafted the latter for the magistrate's signature. Because the record sheds no light on how this anomaly arose, we would in any event decline to attach decretory significance to it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Of course, when the arrest occurs immediately, evidence acquired during the ensuing search may not be used to justify it retrospectively. See United States v. Bizier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739671\"><a href=\"/opinion/739671/united-states-v-david-p-bizier/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 217 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The appellant cites Khounsavanh for the proposition that probable cause does not exist where an individual has been identified only by a nickname. In that case, however, no evidence linked the defendants to the premises to be searched. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197362\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197362/united-states-v-khounsavanh/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">281-82</span></a></span>. The contrast is stark: here, the warrant application stated categorically that the trailer had been identified as that of Ralph Winchenbach, Jr., and at the time of the arrest, the officers knew the appellant's real name and had every reason to believe that he was the person from whom Spinney had been buying cocaine. Because sufficient evidence existed prior to the arrest to connect the appellant to the premises and to support a filing of probable cause, Khounsavanh does not assist the appellant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Rule 608(b) provides in pertinent part that \"[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility . . . may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Rule 613(b) provides that \"[e]xtrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
