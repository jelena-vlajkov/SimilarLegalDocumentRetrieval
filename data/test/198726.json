Appellants argue\r\nthat the Commission exceeded its regulatory power under the\r\nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact, that it violated the Dormant\r\nCommerce Clause, and that it violated their due process rights. \r\nFor reasons stated below, we affirm.\r\nI.  FACTS\r\nOn this appeal from the grant of summary judgment in\r\nfavor of appellees, we recite the facts in the light most favorable\r\nto the appellants.  See Aponte Matos v. Toledo Davila, 135 F.3d\r\n182, 185 (1st Cir. 1998); Acosta-Orozco v. Rodriguez-de-Rivera, 132\r\nF.3d 97, 98 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nA.  The Parties\r\nAppellant New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. is a non-\r\nprofit trade association representing New York milk processors and\r\ndistributors of fluid milk products.  It is joined by five fluid\r\nmilk processors and distributors that procure raw milk from dairy\r\nfarms outside of New England and distribute fluid milk in New\r\nEngland, and two New York processors that purchase raw milk from\r\ndairy farms outside of New England but do not distribute within New\r\nEngland. \r\nAppellee, the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission,\r\nadministers the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact (the\r\n\"Compact\"), an agreement entered into by the six New England\r\nstates and approved by the Congress.  See 1996 Farm Bill, 7 U.S.C.\r\n7256 (1996).  The Commission's primary purpose is to regulate\r\nmilk prices in the signatory states.  \r\nB.  The Compact\r\nUnder the terms of the Compact, each state must appoint\r\na delegation to the Compact Commission consisting of between three\r\nand five members.  See Compact  4.  The delegation must include at\r\nleast one dairy farmer and one consumer representative.  See id. \r\nAt the time this suit began, the Commission included directors of\r\nWomen, Infants and Children's programs of various states, the Rhode\r\nIsland Attorney General's Chief of the Consumer Protection\r\nDivision, and state Agricultural Commissioners.  Delegation members\r\nmay not serve more than three consecutive terms, and no term may be\r\nmore than four years.  They may be removed from the Commission for\r\ncause.  The delegation members' compensation is determined and paid\r\nby the individual states, although the Commission pays their\r\nexpenses.  See Compact  4.  \r\nHistorically, the dairy industry has been subject to\r\nextensive regulation by the federal government.  Under the\r\nAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246, as\r\namended, 7 U.S.C.  601 et seq. (1933), the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture may set minimum prices that milk \"handlers\"\r\n(processors) pay to \"producers\" (farmers) for raw milk.  These\r\n\"Federal Milk Marketing Orders\" vary according to class of milk;\r\nthe highest prices are charged for \"Class I,\" fluid use milk.  See\r\ngenerally West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 188-89\r\n&amp; n.1 (1994) (describing regulatory scheme).  The primary purpose\r\nof the Compact is to set \"over-order\" prices in the Compact states,\r\ni.e., minimum prices at some level above those mandated by the\r\nfederal pricing orders.  See Compact  2(8), 9(b).\r\nThe Commission exercises broad authority, through notice\r\nand comment rulemaking, to set minimum prices that processors pay\r\nfor milk distributed within the Compact region.  See Compact  8-\r\n10.  Each party state has a single vote, see Compact  4, and price\r\nregulations must be approved by two-thirds of all party states.  A\r\nstate that dissents from a price regulation is not bound by it. \r\nSee Compact  5.  \r\nThe Commission's over-order pricing power applies to two\r\nkinds of Class I milk processors: \"pool plants\" and \"partially\r\nregulated plants.\"  \"Pool plants\" are milk plants physically\r\nlocated within the Compact region.  \"Partially regulated plants\"\r\nare plants that, while located outside the regulated area,\r\ndistribute Class I milk within the area, or receive milk from\r\nproducers in the area.  The Commission's powers with respect to\r\nminimum prices for pool plants and partially regulated plants are\r\ncoextensive.  See Compact  9(d) (\"The commission is hereby\r\nempowered to establish the minimum price for milk to be paid by\r\npool plants, partially regulated plants and all other handlers\r\nreceiving milk from producers located in a regulated area.\").  \r\nThe terms of the Compact allow milk processors to object\r\nto the over-order price regulation.  See Compact  16(b).  Handlers\r\nmay file a written petition and request a hearing with the\r\nCommission.  See id.; see also 7 C.F.R.  1381.1-1381.4(f) (1997). \r\nThe Chair of the Commission must appoint a hearing panel of one to\r\nthree Commission members to pass on this petition.  The panel must\r\nbe composed of \"Commission members who are not members of the state\r\ndelegation in which the Handler is incorporated or has its\r\nprincipal place of business, who have no pecuniary interest in the\r\noutcome, and who are otherwise fair and impartial.\"  7 C.F.R. at\r\n1381.4(a).  After considering the petition, the hearing panel\r\nissues a proposed decision, and, after considering handlers'\r\nobjections, issues a ruling.  See id. at  1381.4(g)-(h).  The\r\nCommission itself then reviews this ruling and issues its own\r\ndecision.  See id.  The regulations further dictate that:\r\n   Any commissioner shall (on either the Commissioner's own\r\n   motion or on motion of the petitioner) disqualify himself\r\n   or herself from consideration of the Commission's final\r\n   ruling on the panel's decision if that commissioner's\r\n   impartiality might reasonably be questioned.  \r\n\nSee id. at  1381.4(h)(3).  \r\n\nThe essence of the Commission's regulatory scheme is its\r\n\"pooling mechanism.\"  All handlers, whether pool plants or\r\npartially regulated ones, pay the same amount per hundredweight\r\n(cwt) into the pool, according to the volume of Class I milk\r\npurchased.  See 7 C.F.R.  1306.1.  Thereafter, they receive\r\nrebates from the pool.  While pool plants receive a rebate based on\r\nthe volume of all milk sold, whether Class I, II, or III, and\r\nwhether sold in the Compact region or elsewhere, partially\r\nregulated plants receive payment based solely on Class I milk\r\ndistributed in the Compact region.  See 7 C.F.R.  1304.5(c)(1),\r\n1307.4(f).  These rebates are not retained by the plants, but\r\nrather are returned to the dairy farmers.  See New York State Dairy\r\nFoods, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d at 256-57 (\"This money would be\r\ncollected and commingled in the producer-settlement fund, along\r\nwith all payment obligations of all other regulated handlers, for\r\ndistribution to producers.  The Commission would disburse from the\r\npool to dairy farmers through the handlers, acting in a conduit\r\ncapacity.\").  \r\nIt is this rebate system that appellants claim\r\ndisadvantages them.  Appellants claim that New York dairy farmers\r\nreceive a higher payback from, and therefore prefer to conduct\r\nbusiness with, New England pool plants.  This, appellants assert,\r\ncauses them to suffer competitive harm.\r\nII.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r\nA.  Issuance of the Regulation \r\nOn May 30, 1997, the Commission adopted an over-order\r\nprice regulation effective from July 1, 1997, to December 31, 1997. \r\nSee 7 C.F.R.  1300-08, 1381 (1997).  After the requisite notice\r\nin the Federal Register and subsequent public hearings, the six\r\nmember states voted unanimously in favor of the regulation. \r\nSimilarly, the regulation passed the producer referendum\r\noverwhelmingly.  See Northeast Dairy Compact Commission, Results of\r\nProducer Referendum on Compact Over-Order Price Regulation, 62 Fed.\r\nReg. 29,646, 29,647 (May 30, 1997).\r\nThe regulation established an over-order price of $16.94\r\nper hundredweight.  See Compact Over-order Class I Price and\r\nCompact Over-order Obligation, 7 C.F.R.  1305.1 (1997).  At the\r\ntime of adoption, the federally mandated minimum price was $13.94,\r\nresulting in an over-order obligation of $3.00 per hundredweight. \r\nAs the federal Class I price increased, the over-order obligation\r\ndecreased in order to keep the net price constant at $16.94 per\r\nhundredweight.  The Commission applied this over-order price\r\nregulation to all Class I fluid milk distributed within the\r\nregulated area, including milk produced and processed outside the\r\nregion by partially regulated plants.  \r\nThe over-order price regulation included an additional\r\nassessment of $.032 per hundredweight.  The Compact explicitly\r\ngrants this authority to the Commission to recover its\r\nadministrative costs.  See Compact  18(a) (\"[I]f regulations\r\nestablishing an over-order price or a compact marketing order are\r\nadopted, they may include an assessment for the specific purpose of\r\ntheir administration.\").  The Commission applied this assessment to\r\nall fluid milk products distributed in the regulated area, whether\r\nby pool plants or partially regulated plants.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1308.1 (1997).  \r\nB. The Administrative Petitions \r\nOn August 15, 1997, a subset of the instant appellants,\r\nled by Crowley Foods, Inc., filed administrative petitions (the\r\n\"Crowley petitions\") with the Commission that raised three\r\nvariegated challenges, all of which are at issue in this appeal. \r\nFirst, they challenged the lawfulness of the pricing regulations. \r\nSecond, they challenged the inclusion of a producer representative\r\nin each state's delegation to the Commission.  Third, they\r\nchallenged the participation on the Hearing Panel by any Commission\r\nmember who had participated in promulgating the regulations under\r\ndispute.  Finally, they challenged the imposition of the\r\nadministrative assessments on out-of-region handlers.  \r\nIn response to these challenges, the Chair of the\r\nCommission appointed three Commission members to serve as the\r\nhearing panel.  The panel was comprised of the Chair, who was also\r\nthe consumer representative from the Maine delegation, the Chief of\r\nthe Consumer Protection Division of the Rhode Island Attorney\r\nGeneral's Office, and the consumer representative from the New\r\nHampshire delegation.  See New York State Dairy Foods, Inc., 26 F.\r\nSupp. 2d at 258.  As the Commission's regulations require, none of\r\nthe hearing panel members were from a state in which any petitioner\r\nwas incorporated or has its principal place of business.  See id. \r\nThe panel issued a Proposed Decision on September 9,\r\n1997, recommending that the Commission deny the claims raised.  Ten\r\ndays later, the petitioners filed written objections.  On\r\nSeptember 23, the panel issued its Final Proposed Decision.  The\r\nCommission adopted this final proposed decision by a 6-0 vote.  See\r\nid.  The Commission held that:  (1) it has the authority to\r\nregulate (by imposing an over-order price and administrative\r\nassessment on all pool and partially regulated handlers) all milk\r\ndistributed in the New England region, regardless of where it is\r\nproduced; (2) application of the over-order pricing and pooling\r\nregulation to partially regulated plants does not constitute an\r\nimpermissible compensatory payment scheme; and (3) the\r\nparticipation of New England farmers and processors in setting the\r\nover-order price does not, absent specific allegations of bias,\r\nviolate the Due Process Clause.  See New York State Dairy Foods,\r\nInc., 26 F. Supp. 2d at 258, citing In re Crowley Foods, Inc., Nos.\r\nHEP-97-001, -002, -004 &amp; -005, at 9-20, 24-27.  \r\nSimultaneously, appellant Elmhurst Dairy, Inc., joined by\r\nByrne Dairy, Inc., filed its own administrative petition (the\r\n\"Elmhurst petition\") raising claims similar to the Crowley\r\npetitions.  In addition, the Elmhurst petition claimed that the\r\npricing regulations were unlawful as applied to Elmhurst because\r\nits distribution within the regulated area was solely through an\r\nunaffiliated distributor.  The Chair of the Commission appointed\r\nthe same hearing panel that heard the Crowley petitions to hear the\r\nElmhurst petition.  On October 15, 1997, the panel once again\r\nissued a proposed decision recommending that the Commission reject\r\nall claims.  The Elmhurst petitioners failed to file objections,\r\nand the proposed decision became final.  On December 3, 1997, the\r\nCommission, again by a 6-0 vote, adopted the panel's recommendation\r\nand rejected all claims.  It specifically rejected the claim that\r\nElmhurst was not subject to the regulation because it found that\r\nthe interposition of a third-party intermediary did not change the\r\nfact that Elmhurst \"'operates a partially regulated plant that\r\nreceives milk from producers providing the raw supply' for sales of\r\npackaged milk in the region.\"  New York State Dairy Foods, Inc., 26\r\nF. Supp. 2d at 258 (citing In re Elmhurst Dairy, Inc., Nos. HEP-97-\r\n007 &amp; -008, at 8-9).\r\nC.  The District Court  \r\nBoth the Elmhurst and Crowley petitioners sought review\r\nin the district court, under its equity jurisdiction, to determine\r\nwhether the rulings of the Commission were \"in accordance with\r\nlaw.\"  New York State Dairy Foods, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d at 259. \r\nSection 16(c) of the Compact grants such authority.  \r\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of\r\nthe Commission, holding that:\r\n(1) The Commission did not violate the Commerce Clause\r\nbecause Congress consented to the Commission's actions.  See New\r\nYork State Dairy Foods, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d at 262.\r\n(2) The Commission's actions did not violate Condition 7\r\nof the congressional consent.  See id.\r\n(3) The administrative assessment contained in the over-\r\norder price regulation was squarely authorized by the Compact.  See\r\nid. at 263.  \r\n(4) Neither the composition of the hearing panel nor the\r\ncomposition of the Commission violated due process.  See id. at\r\n263-64.\r\n(5) The plaintiffs were required to exhaust their\r\nadministrative remedies on all claims before bringing them to the\r\ndistrict court.  See id. at 259.\r\n(6) The administrative assessment did not violate the\r\nEqual Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.  See id.\r\nat 263.\r\n(7) The Commission had authority to impose prices and\r\nassessments on Elmhurst Dairy, Inc., despite the fact that its only \r\nconnection with the Compact is through an unaffiliated distributor. \r\nSee id. at 265. \r\nThe several appellants challenge each of these rulings,\r\nsave the last two, both of which appear to have been abandoned on\r\nappeal.  \r\nIn addition, the district court entered an order\r\napproving an escrow account, in which any producer price payment\r\nfrom plaintiff-appellants would be deposited.  See New York State\r\nDairy Foods, Inc. v. Northeast Dairy Compact Comm'n, No. 97-11576-\r\nPBS (D. Mass. Aug. 14, 1997) (order approving escrow of funds).\r\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOur review of the district court's decision is de novo. \r\nSee Siegal v. American Honda Motor Co., 921 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).  This is equally true of both the due process claims, see\r\nDominique v. Weld, 73 F.3d 1156, 1158 (1st Cir. 1998), and\r\nquestions of statutory interpretation.  See United States v. George\r\nHyman Constr. Co., 131 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We review de\r\nnovo questions of statutory interpretation that present pure\r\nquestions of law.\").  \r\nIV.  COMMERCE CLAUSE\r\nAppellants launch a frontal assault on the over-order\r\npricing regime (with its attendant pooling mechanism and\r\nadministrative assessment) based on the Commerce Clause, or more\r\nprecisely, on the so-called \"Dormant Commerce Clause.\"  See U.S.\r\nConst. art. I  8; South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467\r\nU.S. 82, 97 (1984); United Egg Producers v. Department of Agric.,\r\n77 F.3d 567, 569-70 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"The Supreme Court has\r\ninterpreted this affirmative grant of authority to Congress as also\r\nestablishing what has come to be called the Dormant Commerce Clause\r\na self-executing limitation on state authority to enact laws\r\nimposing substantial burdens on interstate commerce even in the\r\nabsence of Congressional action.\").  \r\nAppellants' claim is based on the indisputable truism\r\nthat \"[s]tate laws discriminating against interstate commerce are\r\nvirtually per se invalid.\"  Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U.S. 325,\r\n331 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As the Supreme\r\nCourt wrote in Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 527\r\n(1935):\r\n   Neither the power to tax nor the police power may be used\r\n   by the state of destination with the aim and effect of\r\n   establishing an economic barrier against competition with\r\n   the products of another state or the labor of its\r\n   residents.  Restrictions so contrived are an unreasonable\r\n   clog upon the mobility of commerce.  They set up what is\r\n   equivalent to a rampart of customs duties designed to\r\n   neutralize advantages belonging to the place of origin.\r\n\nDespite this seeming foundation of bedrock, appellants' Commerce\r\nClause challenge is ultimately based on little more than shifting\r\nsand.  This case, as distinct from Baldwin and the more recent West\r\nLynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186 (1994) (striking down\r\nstate milk pricing scheme as a violation of Commerce Clause),\r\ninvolves an affirmative congressional consent.  \r\nThere can be no dispute in this case that Congress\r\nexpressly consented to the Compact.  See Northeast Interstate Dairy\r\nCompact, 7 U.S.C.  7256 (1996) (\"Congress hereby consents to the\r\nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact . . . .\") (hereinafter \"the\r\nconsent\").  The question at issue is the scope of this consent.\r\n\nA.  Congressional Consent in General\r\nCongress undoubtedly has the power to regulate milk\r\nprices, see West Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 192 (\"The Commerce\r\nClause vests Congress with ample power to enact legislation\r\nproviding for the regulation of prices paid to farmers for their\r\nproducts\"), and can grant that power to the states, see Northeast\r\nBancorp v. Board of Governors, 472 U.S. 159, 174 (1985) (\"When\r\nCongress so chooses, state actions which it plainly authorizes are\r\ninvulnerable to constitutional attack under the Commerce Clause.\"). \r\nThe relevant initial question, then, is not whether the Compact\r\nviolates the Commerce Clause.  Instead, the starting point of the\r\ninquiry is whether Congress consented to the actions of the\r\nCommission.  We hold that Congress has provided such consent.\r\nThe standard for finding congressional consent is high. \r\nSuch consent must be either \"expressly stated,\" Sporhase v.\r\nNebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U.S. 941, 960 (1982), or \"made\r\nunmistakably clear,\" South-Central, 467 U.S. at 91.  See also\r\nUnited Egg Producers, 77 F.3d at 570 (quoting both Sporhase and\r\nSouth-Central).  The statute or legislative history relied on as\r\nconsent must \"evince[] a congressional intent to alter the limits\r\nof state power otherwise imposed by the Commerce Clause.\"  New\r\nEngland Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U.S. 331, 341 (1982)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The burden of showing consent\r\nlies with the Commission.  See Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437,\r\n458 (1992) (imposing burden on discriminating state).  \r\nWe are called, then, to decide whether Congress's consent\r\ngrants the Commission the power to undertake the regulatory action\r\nat issue in this case.  Because the consent altering the limits\r\nimposed by the Commerce Clause must be clear, our inquiry is\r\nlimited to determining whether Congress spoke \"directly . . . to\r\nthe precise issue in question.\"  See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.\r\nNational Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43\r\n(1984).  \r\nWe have previously held that, in conducting this inquiry,\r\n\"courts must look primarily to the plain meaning of the statute,\r\ndrawing its essence from the particular statutory language at\r\nissue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a\r\nwhole.\"  Strickland v. Commissioner, Dep't of Human Servs., 48 F.3d\r\n12, 16 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  With\r\nthis in mind, we consider appellants' specific claims seriatim.\r\n  1.  Congressional Consent to Regulation of\r\n      Handlers Outside the Region\r\n\nAppellants first argue that the Compact and its attendant\r\nconsent allows the Commission to regulate only those handlers who\r\nreceive milk produced within the Compact region.  We do not agree. \r\nThe Compact specifically authorizes the Commission to regulate the\r\n\"pricing and pooling of milk handled by partially regulated\r\nplants.\"  Compact  10(7).  Under the terms of the Compact, a\r\npartially regulated plant is one that is not located within the\r\nregulated area but distributes Class I milk within such area, or\r\nreceives milk from producers within the area.  See Compact  2(7). \r\nThe Compact further provides that \"[t]he Commission is hereby\r\nempowered to establish the minimum price for milk to be paid by\r\npool plants, partially regulated plants and all other handlers\r\nreceiving milk from producers located in a regulated area.\" \r\nCompact  9(d).  \r\nAppellants seize on this last provision, arguing that the\r\nlack of a serial comma after \"partially regulated plants\" and\r\nbefore \"and all other handlers\" suggests that the latter modifies\r\nthe former.  In other words, appellants contend that the Commission\r\nmay only establish a minimum price for milk handled by a partially\r\nregulated plant when it receives milk from producers located within\r\nthe regulated area.  The district court rejected this argument,\r\nnoting that \"[s]uch an interpretation would exempt from regulation\r\nthose plants that meet the first half of the disjunctive definition\r\nof a partially regulated plant in section 2(7) of the Compact.\" \r\nSee New York State Dairy Foods, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d at 261.  The\r\ndistrict court found this construction to be contrary to the logic\r\nof the Compact, and we agree.  Failure to construe the statute in\r\nthis way would leave a gaping hole in the regulatory regime.  See\r\nUnited States v. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, 744 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(\"Wherever possible, statutes should be construed in a commonsense\r\nmanner, honoring plain meaning, and avoiding absurd or counter-\r\nintuitive results.\") (internal citations omitted).\r\n  2.  Condition 7\r\nAppellants' better argument is based on Condition 7 of\r\nthe congressional consent, which states:  \"The Compact Commission\r\nshall not use compensatory payments under section 10(6) of the\r\nCompact as a barrier to the entry of milk into the Compact region\r\nor for any other purpose.\"  7 U.S.C.  7256(7) (1996).  Appellants\r\nurge that the pooling mechanism utilized by the Commission in its\r\nover-order pricing regulation amounts to a compensatory payment,\r\nthus violating the congressional consent.  The linchpin of this\r\nargument is that because the differential payments paid back to\r\nproducers (through the handlers) depend on whether the handlers are\r\npool plants, the pooling mechanism is in effect a subsidy and\r\ncompensatory payment which is a barrier to the entry of milk into\r\nthe Compact region.  \r\nCongress's command that \"[t]he Compact Commission shall\r\nnot use compensatory payments under section 10(6) of the Compact as\r\na barrier to the entry of milk into the Compact region or for any\r\nother purpose\" is not all Congress had to say on the matter.  The\r\nnext sentence states:  \"Establishment of a Compact over-order\r\nprice, in itself, shall not be considered a compensatory payment or\r\na limitation or prohibition in the marketing of milk.\"  7 U.S.C.\r\n7256(7).  The Commission rightly urges that these two sentences\r\nread together mean that the Commission may do virtually anything\r\n(within the contemplation of the Compact) with respect to over-\r\norder pricing, short of compensatory payments.  \r\nBoth the Commission and the district court distinguished\r\nbetween compensatory payments and pool payments.  The former\r\ninvolves a system not unlike the pool method at issue in the\r\ninstant case, save one crucial factor:  under a compensatory\r\npayment system, the partially regulated plants would receive no\r\ndisbursements whatsoever from the pool.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1304.5(c)(1), 1307.4(f).  This distinction is vital, because it\r\neliminates the primary objection to compensatory payments.  A\r\ncompensatory payment system forces handlers outside the pool to pay\r\nwhat amounts to a tariff upon entry into the regulated area.  See\r\nLehigh Valley Coop. Farmers, Inc. v. United States, 370 U.S. 76,\r\n83-90 (1962) (striking down a compensatory payment system and\r\ndescribing the above as the primary purpose and effect of a\r\ncompensatory payment system); see also New York State Dairy Foods,\r\nInc., 26 F. Supp. 2d at 262 n.10 (\"This description is consistent\r\nwith the use of the term 'compensatory payment' in the case law\r\ncited by the plaintiffs.\")(citing Lehigh Valley Coop. Farmers,\r\nInc., 370 U.S. at 82, and Farmland Dairies v. McGuire, 789 F. Supp.\r\n1243, 1247-48 (S.D.N.Y. 1992)).  The pool payment mechanism, on the\r\nother hand, does not bar the entry of milk from outside the Compact\r\nregion.  Rather, by allowing for payments back to the out-of-\r\ncompact producers for Class I milk distributed inside the Compact\r\nregion, the over-order price could be said to encourage the entry\r\nof such milk.  \r\nAdmittedly, pool plants and partially regulated plants\r\nare not treated with absolute similitude; while pool plants receive\r\na rebate based on the volume of all milk sold, whether Class I, II,\r\nor III, and whether sold in the Compact region or elsewhere,\r\npartially regulated plants receive payment based only on Class I\r\nmilk distributed in the Compact region.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1304.5(c)(1), 1307.4(f).  \r\nEven if there were to be some effect on entry of outside\r\nmilk or some competitive disadvantage, the fact remains that\r\nCongress barred only the peculiar regulatory device of compensatory\r\npayments.  From the language of the Compact, it appears that\r\nCongress distinguished between compensatory payments under  10(6),\r\nwhich Congress barred, and \"pricing and pooling of milk\" under\r\n10(7), which Congress allowed.  \r\nWe are left to conclude that Congress's language on the\r\nauthority of the Commission to regulate via the pooling mechanism\r\nis clear.  Admittedly, Congress could have outlined the very regime\r\nthe Commission implemented and approved it explicitly.  Congress's\r\nfailure to do so, however, does not render its intent ambiguous. \r\nCognizant of its inability to foresee every possible regulatory\r\naction, Congress chose to prohibit one action and allow all others.\r\n  3.  Administrative Assessment\r\nAppellants next argue that the Commission exceeded its\r\nauthority (and therefore the scope of consent) by imposing an\r\nadministrative assessment on all handlers distributing Class I milk\r\nin New England regardless of the point of origin of the milk.  See\r\n7 C.F.R.  1308.1.  We also reject this contention.  The Compact\r\nexplicitly gives the Commission the authority to include an\r\nadministrative assessment as part of an over-order price\r\nregulation.  See Compact  18(a) (\"[I]f regulations establishing an\r\nover-order price or a compact marketing order are adopted, they may\r\ninclude an assessment for the specific purpose of their\r\nadministration.\").  Because the Commission's over-order pricing\r\nauthority extends to partially-regulated plants, its assessment\r\nauthority does as well.\r\nB.  Finding of Consent\r\nBecause we hold that in all respects the Commission acted\r\npursuant to the terms of the congressional consent, we determine\r\nnext whether that consent meets the high standard mandated by the\r\nConstitution.  See Sporhase, 458 U.S. at 960 (must be \"expressly\r\nstated\"); South-Central, 467 U.S. at 91 (must be \"made unmistakably\r\nclear\").  The failure of Congress to expressly state that the\r\nCommission may take the challenged actions is not fatal.  As the\r\nSupreme Court stated in South Central:\r\n   There is no talismanic significance to the phrase\r\n   \"expressly stated,\" however; it merely states one way of\r\n   meeting the requirement that for a state regulation to be\r\n   removed from the reach of the dormant Commerce Clause,\r\n   congressional intent must be unmistakably clear.  The\r\n   requirement that Congress affirmatively contemplate\r\n   otherwise invalid state legislation is mandated by the\r\n   policies underlying dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.\r\n\nSouth Central, 467 U.S. at 91-92.  \r\nIn the instant case, there is no question that Congress\r\naffirmatively contemplated otherwise invalid state legislation. \r\nCongress explicitly consented to the Compact, marking in Condition\r\n7 the boundaries of the Commission's power.  This demonstrates\r\nconclusively that Congress read the Compact, and rejected one\r\npossible exercise of power, thereby approving the others contained\r\ntherein.  \r\nThis Court's decision in United Egg Producers v.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, 77 F.3d 567 (1st Cir. 1996), is not\r\ninconsistent with our holding today.  In that case, we considered\r\na regulation by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that all eggs\r\nimported into Puerto Rico from the mainland United States bear a\r\nstamp showing the two-letter postal code of the state of origin. \r\nSee id. at 569.  Puerto Rico argued that Congress had consented to\r\nits action by stating:  \"[N]o State or local jurisdiction other\r\nthan those in noncontiguous areas of the United States may require\r\nlabeling to show the State or other geographical area of production\r\nor origin.\"  21 U.S.C.  1052(b)(2), as quoted in United Egg\r\nProducers, 77 F.3d at 569.  In considering whether this met the\r\nhigh standard of consent to state regulation of interstate\r\ncommerce, we reasoned:\r\n   One can argue that as Congress had before it the whole\r\n   subject of egg-labeling, its exemption of noncontiguous\r\n   jurisdictions must be understood to signify, by\r\n   implication, Congressional approval of any and all egg-\r\n   labeling requirements in those places regardless whether\r\n   justified or unjustified by Dormant Commerce Clause\r\n   considerations.  But this seems to us a more extreme\r\n   reading than either the statutory language or legislative\r\n   history necessitates.  Absent, at least, an affirmatively\r\n   stated grant of permission to noncontiguous jurisdictions\r\n   of the United States to require egg-labeling, we are\r\n   unable to conclude that appellants have met their burden\r\n   of showing that Congress' intent to allow Puerto Rico to\r\n   enact protectionist egg-labeling regulations was\r\n   \"unmistakably clear.\"\r\n\nUnited Egg Producers, 77 F.3d at 570-71 (footnotes omitted).  \r\nThis case is fundamentally different.  This is not a case\r\nin which an \"affirmatively stated grant of permission\" is lacking. \r\nUndoubtedly in part due to the peculiar nature of this case as one\r\ninvolving both the Dormant Commerce Clause and the Compacts\r\nClause, Congress has provided affirmative consent; Congress read\r\nthe Compact and approved it.  See Central Midwest Interstate Low-\r\nLevel Waste v. Pena, 113 F.3d 1468, 1470 (7th Cir. 1997) (assuming\r\nthat ratification of an interstate compact by Congress obviated the\r\nneed for Dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny).  Accordingly, United\r\nEgg Producers, while instructive, is not precisely apposite. \r\nV.  DUE PROCESS\r\nAppellants urge that the composition of both the\r\nCommission and the Hearing Panel violates the Due Process Clauses\r\nof both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  They argue that the\r\ncommissioners who are dairy farmers or handlers have a pecuniary\r\ninterest in ruling and legislating against them.  \r\nA.  In General\r\nThe Supreme Court has long held that a \"fair trial in a\r\nfair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\"  In re\r\nMurchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955).  This basic requirement\r\napplies in the context of administrative agencies.  See Gibson v.\r\nBerryhill, 411 U.S. 564, 579 (1973). \r\nWhen an adjudicator has a direct, personal, and\r\nsubstantial pecuniary interest in the outcome of a case, due\r\nprocess is abrogated.  See Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 523 (1927). \r\nNot every interest, however, is substantial enough to amount to a\r\nviolation of due process.  In one formulation, an interest is\r\nsubstantial if it \"would offer a possible temptation to the average\r\n. . . judge to . . . lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear\r\nand true . . . .\"  Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 60\r\n(1972); see also Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U.S. 813, 822\r\n(1986).  Participation of adjudicators who \"might conceivably have\r\nhad a slight pecuniary interest,\" however, does not offend due\r\nprocess.  See Aetna Life Ins. Co., 475 U.S. at 825.  \r\nThe Due Process Clause sets a significantly lower bar for\r\nlegislative functions.  Compare Londoner v. Denver, 210 U.S. 373\r\n(1908), with Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239\r\nU.S. 441 (1915); see also Concerned Citizens of S. Ohio, Inc. v.\r\nPine Creek Conservancy Dist., 429 U.S. 651, 657 (1977) (Rehnquist,\r\nJ., dissenting) (\"As Mr. Justice Holmes recognized, the\r\ndetermination of legislative facts does not necessarily implicate\r\nthe same considerations as does the determination of adjudicative\r\nfacts.\").  \r\nB.  Legislative Functions\r\nIn Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1 (1979), the Supreme\r\nCourt considered a challenge to a statute establishing the Texas\r\nOptometry Board.  Like the Commission, the Board was comprised of\r\na pre-determined number of industry representatives.  Four of the\r\nsix members were so-called \"professional opticians,\" and the\r\nremaining two slots were available to be filled by \"commercial\r\nopticians.\"  See id. at 6.  The plaintiff, a commercial optician,\r\nchallenged the regulation of his profession by a board whose\r\nmembership (professional opticians) stood to gain directly by\r\nplacing onerous restrictions on practice by their competitors.  The\r\nCourt rejected this claim, stating: \"Although Rogers has no\r\nconstitutional right to be regulated by a Board that is sympathetic\r\nto the commercial practice of optometry, he does have a\r\nconstitutional right to a fair and impartial hearing in any\r\ndisciplinary proceeding conducted against him by the Board.\"  Id.\r\nat 18.  Finding the latter right not implicated, the Court upheld\r\nthe statute.\r\nIndustry representation on regulatory boards is a common\r\nand accepted practice.  See id. at 18 (upholding such a scheme); \r\nStivers v. Pierce, 71 F.3d 732, 743 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he system\r\nof industry representation on governing or licensing bodies is an\r\naccepted practice throughout the nation.\"); Abramson v. Gonzalez,\r\n949 F.2d 1567, 1579 (11th Cir. 1992).  \r\nFriedman involved a statutory scheme that posed a far\r\ngreater danger to due process than the one we are faced with here. \r\nIn that case, a \"schism,\" Friedman, 440 U.S. at 5, had arisen\r\nbetween commercial and professional opticians, and the professional\r\nopticians were, under the statutory scheme at issue, given\r\nsignificant power over their occupational rivals, see id. at 3-6. \r\nDespite this, the Supreme Court found no violation of the Due\r\nProcess Clause.  Accordingly, we are unable to hold that the\r\ncomposition of the Commission, without more, violates due process\r\nby allowing handlers and processors from Compact states to\r\nparticipate in the regulatory process.  Not only has the Supreme\r\nCourt approved a more problematic regulatory regime in Friedman,\r\nbut we are not convinced that, given the significant attenuation of\r\nthe commissioners' potential financial gain, their interest rises\r\nto the level of substantiality required by Tumey and its progeny. \r\nC.  Adjudicative Functions\r\nThe Due Process Clause inquiry is slightly more\r\ncomplicated with respect to the Hearing Panel.  This is not, in\r\ncontrast to the issuance of regulations, a mere legislative\r\nfunction.  The Hearing Panel sits as a quasi-judicial adjudicative\r\nbody, and thus must comport with a higher standard of due process. \r\nThe Hearing Panel meets this standard for four reasons. \r\nFirst, any potential financial interest on the part of individual\r\npanel members is highly attenuated.  See Aetna Life Ins. Co., 475\r\nU.S. at 825 (\"slight pecuniary interest\" on the part of the\r\nadjudicator does not violate due process).  In order to \"lead him\r\nnot to hold the balance nice, clear and true[,]\" Ward, 409 U.S. at\r\n60, a panel member would have to be swayed by his own pro rata\r\nshare in the additional profits (assuming that there are any) of a\r\nrelatively tiny proportion of the Compact milk receipts.  Partially\r\nregulated plants actually ship precious little milk into the\r\nregion.  See Compact Over-Order Price Regulation, 62 Fed. Reg.\r\n23,039 (April 28, 1997) (\"At present, approximately 98 percent of\r\nthe fluid milk products consumed in the region are produced by\r\nfluid processing plants located in New England.\").  See also Joint\r\nAppendix at 160; In re Petitions of Crowley Foods, Inc. Stewart's\r\nProcessing Corp., Farmland Dairies, Inc., and Cumberland Farms,\r\nInc., Nos. HEP-97-001, 002, 004, and 005, Final Decision of the\r\nCommission at 2,  5 (\"Petitioners, in aggregate, supply\r\napproximately three percent of all packaged, Class I, fluid milk\r\nsales in the regulated area of the six New England states.\").  \r\nThe Ninth Circuit has commented on an arguably analogous\r\nsituation.  The court stated:\r\n   A lawyer in a one-lawyer town, for example, would\r\n   probably have a \"direct\" and \"substantial\" pecuniary\r\n   interest in the licensing of a competitor planning to\r\n   hang a shingle across the street.  On the other hand, it\r\n   is unlikely that any attorney practicing in a city like\r\n   Los Angeles would have a competitive interest\r\n   sufficiently strong to require that he be disqualified\r\n   from considering the licensing of an additional lawyer.\r\n\nStivers, 71 F.3d at 743.  We agree with the Ninth Circuit that at\r\nsome level of attenuation, as here, the adjudicator's interest\r\nbecomes too remote to have a constitutionally deficient effect.  \r\nSecond, the Commission's own regulations provide a due\r\nprocess safeguard, placing stringent restrictions on the\r\ncomposition of hearing panels.  The regulations state: \r\n   (a) Appointment of Commission hearing panel.  Upon\r\n   receipt of a petition, the Chair shall appoint from one\r\n   to three Commission members who shall consider the\r\n   petition . . . .  The Commission panel chosen by the\r\n   Chair shall consist of Commission members who are not\r\n   members of the state delegation in which the Handler is\r\n   incorporated or has its principal place of business, who\r\n   have no pecuniary interest in the outcome, and who are\r\n   otherwise fair and impartial.\r\n\nConduct of Proceedings, 7 C.F.R.  1381.4(a).  Pursuant to this,\r\nthe Hearing Panel which heard appellants' petitions before the\r\nCommission did not include any handlers or farmers.  As noted\r\nabove, the Hearing Panel in this case consisted of the Commission\r\nChair, who was also the consumer representative from the Maine\r\ndelegation, the Chief of the Consumer Protection Division of the\r\nRhode Island Attorney General's Office, and the consumer\r\nrepresentative from the New Hampshire delegation.  See New York\r\nState Dairy Foods, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d at 258.  Given the\r\ncomposition of the Hearing Panel in this case, it will take more\r\nthan bare allegations to give rise to a finding of a deprivation of\r\ndue process.  We recognize that the composition of the hearing\r\npanel does not fully answer appellants' complaint about the\r\ncomposition of the Commission as a whole.  It is true that handlers\r\nand producers sit on the Commission, and as a result both issue\r\ninitial regulations and pass on the Hearing Panel's proposed\r\ndecisions.  The issuance of regulations, as we have said, involves\r\na lower due process bar.  With respect to the final decision on the\r\nHearing Panel's proposed decision, however, we need do little more\r\nthan note that the full Commission adopted the proposed decision of\r\nthis (unquestionably, we believe) disinterested panel.  \r\nThird, the Commission members vote as state delegations,\r\nnot individual members.  We recognize that this alone cannot cure\r\na due process violation.  See Cinderella Career &amp; Finishing Sch.,\r\nInc. v. FTC, 425 F.2d 583, 592 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (one biased member\r\nof even a sizable tribunal violates due process).  It is not,\r\nhowever, without relevance.  The possibility that the small number\r\nof handlers (with their already attenuated interest) on the\r\nCommission will influence their peers sufficiently to alter a vote\r\nis significantly more remote that it would be in a scheme in which\r\neach commissioner voted individually.\r\nFourth, and perhaps most important, the appellants could\r\nhave moved to disqualify all handlers and farmers from the\r\nCommission decision on their petitions.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1381.4(h)(3) (\"Any commissioner shall (on either the\r\nCommissioner's own motion or on motion of the petitioner)\r\ndisqualify himself or herself from consideration of the\r\nCommission's final ruling on the panel's decision if that\r\ncommissioner's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"). \r\nThey did not do so.\r\nAccordingly, there is no legal or factual basis for\r\nfinding a due process violation.  \r\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r\nFinding that the Commission violated neither the Commerce\r\nClause nor the Due Process Clauses, we affirm the district court's\r\nentry of summary judgment. \r\n\n                     - Addendum Follows -\n",

The Parties\r\nAppellant New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. is a non-\r\nprofit trade association representing New York milk processors and\r\ndistributors of fluid milk products.  It is joined by five fluid\r\nmilk processors and distributors that procure raw milk from dairy\r\nfarms outside of New England and distribute fluid milk in New\r\nEngland, and two New York processors that purchase raw milk from\r\ndairy farms outside of New England but do not distribute within New\r\nEngland. \r\nAppellee, the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission,\r\nadministers the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact (the\r\n\"Compact\"), an agreement entered into by the six New England\r\nstates and approved by the Congress.  See 1996 Farm Bill, 7 U.S.C.\r\n7256 (1996).  The Commission's primary purpose is to regulate\r\nmilk prices in the signatory states.  \r\nB.  The Compact\r\nUnder the terms of the Compact, each state must appoint\r\na delegation to the Compact Commission consisting of between three\r\nand five members.  See Compact  4.  The delegation must include at\r\nleast one dairy farmer and one consumer representative.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197706\"><a href=\"/opinion/197706/acosta-orozco-v-rodriguez-de-rivera/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \r\nAt the </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">time this suit began, the Commission included directors of\r\nWomen, Infants and Children's programs of various states, the Rhode\r\nIsland Attorney General's Chief of the Consumer Protection\r\nDivision, and state Agricultural Commissioners.  Delegation members\r\nmay not serve more than three consecutive terms, and no term may be\r\nmore than four years.  They may be removed from the Commission for\r\ncause.  The delegation members' compensation is determined and paid\r\nby the individual states, although the Commission pays their\r\nexpenses.  See Compact  4.  \r\nHistorically, the dairy industry has been subject to\r\nextensive regulation by the federal government.  Under the\r\nAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246, as\r\namended, 7 U.S.C.  601 et seq. (1933), the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture may set minimum prices that milk \"handlers\"\r\n(processors) pay to \"producers\" (farmers) for raw milk.  These\r\n\"Federal Milk Marketing Orders\" vary according to class of milk;\r\nthe highest prices are charged for \"Class I,\" fluid use milk.  See\r\ngenerally West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117855\"><a href=\"/opinion/117855/west-lynn-creamery-inc-v-healy/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188-89\r\n&amp; n.1 (1994) (describing regulatory scheme).  The primary purpose\r\nof the Compact is to set \"over-order\" prices in the Compact states,\r\ni.e., minimum prices at some level above those mandated by the\r\nfederal pricing orders.  See Compact  2(8), 9(b).\r\nThe Commission exercises broad authority, through notice\r\nand comment rulemaking, to set minimum prices that processors pay\r\nfor milk distributed within the Compact region.  See Compact  8-\r\n10.  Each party state has a single vote, see Compact  4, and price\r\nregulations must be approved by two-thirds of all party states.  A\r\nstate that dissents from a price regulation is not bound by it. \r\nSee Compact  5.  \r\nThe Commission's over-order pricing power applies to two\r\nkinds of Class I milk processors: \"pool plants\" and \"partially\r\nregulated plants.\"  \"Pool plants\" are milk plants physically\r\nlocated within the Compact region.  \"Partially regulated plants\"\r\nare plants that, while located outside the regulated area,\r\ndistribute Class I milk within the area, or receive milk from\r\nproducers in the area.  The Commission's powers with respect to\r\nminimum prices for pool plants and partially regulated plants are\r\ncoextensive.  See Compact  9(d) (\"The commission is hereby\r\nempowered to establish the minimum price for milk to be paid by\r\npool plants, partially regulated plants and all other handlers\r\nreceiving milk from producers located in a regulated area.\").  \r\nThe terms of the Compact allow milk processors to object\r\nto the over-order price regulation.  See Compact  16(b).  Handlers\r\nmay file a written petition and request a hearing with the\r\nCommission.  See id.; see also 7 C.F.R.  1381.1-1381.4(f) (1997). \r\nThe Chair of the Commission must appoint a hearing panel of one to\r\nthree Commission members to pass on this petition.  The panel must\r\nbe composed of \"Commission members who are not members of the state\r\ndelegation in which the Handler is incorporated or has its\r\nprincipal place of business, who have no pecuniary interest in the\r\noutcome, and who are otherwise fair and impartial.\"  7 C.F.R. at\r\n1381.4(a).  After considering the petition, the hearing panel\r\nissues a proposed decision, and, after considering handlers'\r\nobjections, issues a ruling.

See 7 C.F.R.  1306.1.  Thereafter, they receive\r\nrebates from the pool.  While pool plants receive a rebate based on\r\nthe volume of all milk sold, whether Class I, II, or III, and\r\nwhether sold in the Compact region or elsewhere, partially\r\nregulated plants receive payment based solely on Class I milk\r\ndistributed in the Compact region.  See 7 C.F.R.  1304.5(c)(1),\r\n1307.4(f).  These rebates are not retained by the plants, but\r\nrather are returned to the dairy farmers.  See New York State Dairy\r\nFoods, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Appellants claim that New York dairy farmers\r\nreceive a higher payback from, and therefore prefer to conduct\r\nbusiness with, New England pool plants.  This, appellants assert,\r\ncauses them to suffer competitive harm.\r\nII.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r\nA.  Issuance of the Regulation \r\nOn May 30, 1997, the Commission adopted an over-order\r\nprice regulation effective from July 1, 1997, to December 31, 1997. \r\nSee 7 C.F.R.  1300-08, 1381 (1997).  After the requisite notice\r\nin the Federal Register and subsequent public hearings, the six\r\nmember states voted unanimously in favor of the regulation. \r\nSimilarly, the regulation passed the producer referendum\r\noverwhelmingly.  See Northeast Dairy Compact Commission, Results of\r\nProducer Referendum on Compact Over-Order Price Regulation, 62 Fed.\r\nReg. 29,646, 29,647 (May 30, 1997).\r\nThe regulation established an over-order price of $16.94\r\nper hundredweight.  See Compact Over-order Class I Price and\r\nCompact Over-order Obligation, 7 C.F.R.  1305.1 (1997).  At the\r\ntime of adoption, the federally mandated minimum price was $13.94,\r\nresulting in an over-order obligation of $3.00 per hundredweight. \r\nAs the federal Class I price increased, the over-order obligation\r\ndecreased in order to keep the net price constant at $16.94 per\r\nhundredweight.  The Commission applied this over-order price\r\nregulation to all Class I fluid milk distributed within the\r\nregulated area, including milk produced and processed outside the\r\nregion by partially regulated plants.  \r\nThe over-order price regulation included an additional\r\nassessment of $.032 per hundredweight.  The Compact explicitly\r\ngrants this authority to the Commission to recover its\r\nadministrative costs.  See Compact  18(a) (\"[I]f regulations\r\nestablishing an over-order price or a compact marketing order are\r\nadopted, they may include an assessment for the specific purpose of\r\ntheir administration.\").  The Commission applied this assessment to\r\nall fluid milk products distributed in the regulated area, whether\r\nby pool plants or partially regulated plants.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1308.1 (1997).  \r\nB. The Administrative Petitions \r\nOn August 15, 1997, a subset of the instant appellants,\r\nled by Crowley Foods, Inc., filed administrative petitions (the\r\n\"Crowley petitions\") with the Commission that raised three\r\nvariegated challenges, all of which are at issue in this appeal. \r\nFirst, they challenged the lawfulness of the pricing regulations. \r\nSecond, they challenged the inclusion of a producer representative\r\nin each state's delegation to the Commission.  Third, they\r\nchallenged the participation on the Hearing Panel by any Commission\r\nmember who had participated in promulgating the regulations under\r\ndispute.  Finally, they challenged the imposition of the\r\nadministrative assessments on out-of-region handlers.  \r\nIn response to these challenges, the Chair of the\r\nCommission appointed three Commission members to serve as the\r\nhearing panel.  The panel was comprised of the Chair, who was also\r\nthe consumer representative from the Maine delegation, the Chief of\r\nthe Consumer Protection Division of the Rhode Island Attorney\r\nGeneral's Office, and the consumer representative from the New\r\nHampshire delegation.  See New York State Dairy Foods, Inc., 26 F.\r\nSupp. 2d at 258.  As the Commission's regulations require, none of\r\nthe hearing panel members were from a state in which any petitioner\r\nwas incorporated or has its principal place of business.  See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> \r\nThe panel </span><pre class=\"inline\">issued a Proposed Decision on September 9,\r\n1997, recommending that the Commission deny the claims raised.  Ten\r\ndays later, the petitioners filed written objections.  On\r\nSeptember 23, the panel issued its Final Proposed Decision.  The\r\nCommission adopted this final proposed decision by a 6-0 vote.  See\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  The Commission </span><pre class=\"inline\">held that:  (1) it has the authority to\r\nregulate (by imposing an over-order price and administrative\r\nassessment on all pool and partially regulated handlers) all milk\r\ndistributed in the New England region, regardless of where it is\r\nproduced; (2) application of the over-order pricing and pooling\r\nregulation to partially regulated plants does not constitute an\r\nimpermissible compensatory payment scheme; and (3) the\r\nparticipation of New England farmers and processors in setting the\r\nover-order price does not, absent specific allegations of bias,\r\nviolate the Due Process Clause.

In addition, the Elmhurst petition claimed that the\r\npricing regulations were unlawful as applied to Elmhurst because\r\nits distribution within the regulated area was solely through an\r\nunaffiliated distributor.  The Chair of the Commission appointed\r\nthe same hearing panel that heard the Crowley petitions to hear the\r\nElmhurst petition.  On October 15, 1997, the panel once again\r\nissued a proposed decision recommending that the Commission reject\r\nall claims.  The Elmhurst petitioners failed to file objections,\r\nand the proposed decision became final.  On December 3, 1997, the\r\nCommission, again by a 6-0 vote, adopted the panel's recommendation\r\nand rejected all claims.  It specifically rejected the claim that\r\nElmhurst was not subject to the regulation because it found that\r\nthe interposition of a third-party intermediary did not change the\r\nfact that Elmhurst \"'operates a partially regulated plant that\r\nreceives milk from producers providing the raw supply' for sales of\r\npackaged milk in the region.\"  New York State Dairy Foods, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">26</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

With\r\nthis in mind, we consider appellants' specific claims seriatim.\r\n  1.  Congressional Consent to Regulation of\r\n      Handlers Outside the Region\r\n\nAppellants first argue that the Compact and its attendant\r\nconsent allows the Commission to regulate only those handlers who\r\nreceive milk produced within the Compact region.  We do not agree. \r\nThe Compact specifically authorizes the Commission to regulate the\r\n\"pricing and pooling of milk handled by partially regulated\r\nplants.\"  Compact  10(7).  Under the terms of the Compact, a\r\npartially regulated plant is one that is not located within the\r\nregulated area but distributes Class I milk within such area, or\r\nreceives milk from producers within the area.  See Compact  2(7). \r\nThe Compact further provides that \"[t]he Commission is hereby\r\nempowered to establish the minimum price for milk to be paid by\r\npool plants, partially regulated plants and all other handlers\r\nreceiving milk from producers located in a regulated area.\" \r\nCompact  9(d).  \r\nAppellants seize on this last provision, arguing that the\r\nlack of a serial comma after \"partially regulated plants\" and\r\nbefore \"and all other handlers\" suggests that the latter modifies\r\nthe former.  In other words, appellants contend that the Commission\r\nmay only establish a minimum price for milk handled by a partially\r\nregulated plant when it receives milk from producers located within\r\nthe regulated area.  The district court rejected this argument,\r\nnoting that \"[s]uch an interpretation would exempt from regulation\r\nthose plants that meet the first half of the disjunctive definition\r\nof a partially regulated plant in section 2(7) of the Compact.\" \r\nSee New York State Dairy Foods, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">261</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  The\r\ndistrict court found this construction to be contrary to the logic\r\nof the Compact, and we agree.  Failure to construe the statute in\r\nthis way would leave a gaping hole in the regulatory regime.  See\r\nUnited States v. Carroll, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734111\"><a href=\"/opinion/734111/united-states-v-christopher-b-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(\"Wherever possible, statutes should be construed in a commonsense\r\nmanner, honoring plain meaning, and avoiding absurd or counter-\r\nintuitive results.\") (internal citations omitted).\r\n  2.  Condition 7\r\nAppellants' better argument is based on Condition 7 of\r\nthe congressional consent, which states:  \"The Compact Commission\r\nshall not use compensatory payments under section 10(6) of the\r\nCompact as a barrier to the entry of milk into the Compact region\r\nor for any other purpose.\"  7 U.S.C.  7256(7) (1996).  Appellants\r\nurge that the pooling mechanism utilized by the Commission in its\r\nover-order pricing regulation amounts to a compensatory payment,\r\nthus violating the congressional consent.  The linchpin of this\r\nargument is that because the differential payments paid back to\r\nproducers (through the handlers) depend on whether the handlers are\r\npool plants, the pooling mechanism is in effect a subsidy and\r\ncompensatory payment which is a barrier to the entry of milk into\r\nthe Compact region.  \r\nCongress's command that \"[t]he Compact Commission shall\r\nnot use compensatory payments under section 10(6) of the Compact as\r\na barrier to the entry of milk into the Compact region or for any\r\nother purpose\" is not all Congress had to say on the matter.  The\r\nnext sentence states:  \"Establishment of a Compact over-order\r\nprice, in itself, shall not be considered a compensatory payment or\r\na limitation or prohibition in the marketing of milk.\"  7 U.S.C.\r\n7256(7).  The Commission rightly urges that these two sentences\r\nread together mean that the Commission may do virtually anything\r\n(within the contemplation of the Compact) with respect to over-\r\norder pricing, short of compensatory payments.  \r\nBoth the Commission and the district court distinguished\r\nbetween compensatory payments and pool payments.  The former\r\ninvolves a system not unlike the pool method at issue in the\r\ninstant case, save one crucial factor:  under a compensatory\r\npayment system, the partially regulated plants would receive no\r\ndisbursements whatsoever from the pool.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1304.5(c)(1), 1307.4(f).  This distinction is vital, because it\r\neliminates the primary objection to compensatory payments.  A\r\ncompensatory payment system forces handlers outside the pool to pay\r\nwhat amounts to a tariff upon entry into the regulated area.  See\r\nLehigh Valley Coop. Farmers, Inc. v.

The pool payment mechanism, on the\r\nother hand, does not bar the entry of milk from outside the Compact\r\nregion.  Rather, by allowing for payments back to the out-of-\r\ncompact producers for Class I milk distributed inside the Compact\r\nregion, the over-order price could be said to encourage the entry\r\nof such milk.  \r\nAdmittedly, pool plants and partially regulated plants\r\nare not treated with absolute similitude; while pool plants receive\r\na rebate based on the volume of all milk sold, whether Class I, II,\r\nor III, and whether sold in the Compact region or elsewhere,\r\npartially regulated plants receive payment based only on Class I\r\nmilk distributed in the Compact region.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1304.5(c)(1), 1307.4(f).  \r\nEven if there were to be some effect on entry of outside\r\nmilk or some competitive disadvantage, the fact remains that\r\nCongress barred only the peculiar regulatory device of compensatory\r\npayments.  From the language of the Compact, it appears that\r\nCongress distinguished between compensatory payments under  10(6),\r\nwhich Congress barred, and \"pricing and pooling of milk\" under\r\n10(7), which Congress allowed.  \r\nWe are left to conclude that Congress's language on the\r\nauthority of the Commission to regulate via the pooling mechanism\r\nis clear.  Admittedly, Congress could have outlined the very regime\r\nthe Commission implemented and approved it explicitly.  Congress's\r\nfailure to do so, however, does not render its intent ambiguous. \r\nCognizant of its inability to foresee every possible regulatory\r\naction, Congress chose to prohibit one action and allow all others.\r\n  3.  Administrative Assessment\r\nAppellants next argue that the Commission exceeded its\r\nauthority (and therefore the scope of consent) by imposing an\r\nadministrative assessment on all handlers distributing Class I milk\r\nin New England regardless of the point of origin of the milk.  See\r\n7 C.F.R.  1308.1.  We also reject this contention.  The Compact\r\nexplicitly gives the Commission the authority to include an\r\nadministrative assessment as part of an over-order price\r\nregulation.  See Compact  18(a) (\"[I]f regulations establishing an\r\nover-order price or a compact marketing order are adopted, they may\r\ninclude an assessment for the specific purpose of their\r\nadministration.\").  Because the Commission's over-order pricing\r\nauthority extends to partially-regulated plants, its assessment\r\nauthority does as well.\r\nB.  Finding of Consent\r\nBecause we hold that in all respects the Commission acted\r\npursuant to the terms of the congressional consent, we determine\r\nnext whether that consent meets the high standard mandated by the\r\nConstitution.

The failure of Congress to expressly state that the\r\nCommission may take the challenged actions is not fatal.  As the\r\nSupreme Court stated in South Central:\r\n   There is no talismanic significance to the phrase\r\n   \"expressly stated,\" however; it merely states one way of\r\n   meeting the requirement that for a state regulation to be\r\n   removed from the reach of the dormant Commerce Clause,\r\n   congressional intent must be unmistakably clear.  The\r\n   requirement that Congress affirmatively contemplate\r\n   otherwise invalid state legislation is mandated by the\r\n   policies underlying dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.\r\n\nSouth </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111189\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Central,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111189/south-central-timber-development-inc-v-wunnicke/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">91-92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  \r\nIn the instant case, there is no question that Congress\r\naffirmatively contemplated otherwise invalid state legislation. \r\nCongress explicitly consented to the Compact, marking in Condition\r\n7 the boundaries of the Commission's power.  This demonstrates\r\nconclusively that Congress read the Compact, and rejected one\r\npossible exercise of power, thereby approving the others contained\r\ntherein.  \r\nThis Court's decision in United Egg Producers v.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713999\"><a href=\"/opinion/713999/united-egg-producers-v-department-of-agriculture-of-the-commonwealth-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1996), is not\r\ninconsistent with our holding today.

In considering whether this met the\r\nhigh standard of consent to state regulation of interstate\r\ncommerce, we reasoned:\r\n   One can argue that as Congress had before it the whole\r\n   subject of egg-labeling, its exemption of noncontiguous\r\n   jurisdictions must be understood to signify, by\r\n   implication, Congressional approval of any and all egg-\r\n   labeling requirements in those places regardless whether\r\n   justified or unjustified by Dormant Commerce Clause\r\n   considerations.  But this seems to us a more extreme\r\n   reading than either the statutory language or legislative\r\n   history necessitates.  Absent, at least, an affirmatively\r\n   stated grant of permission to noncontiguous jurisdictions\r\n   of the United States to require egg-labeling, we are\r\n   unable to conclude that appellants have met their burden\r\n   of showing that Congress' intent to allow Puerto Rico to\r\n   enact protectionist egg-labeling regulations was\r\n   \"unmistakably clear.\"\r\n\nUnited Egg </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713999\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Producers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/713999/united-egg-producers-v-department-of-agriculture-of-the-commonwealth-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">-71 (footnotes omitted).  \r\nThis case is fundamentally different.  This is not a case\r\nin which an \"affirmatively stated grant of permission\" is lacking. \r\nUndoubtedly in part due to the peculiar nature of this case as one\r\ninvolving both the Dormant Commerce Clause and the Compacts\r\nClause, Congress has provided affirmative consent; Congress read\r\nthe Compact and approved it.

Accordingly, United\r\nEgg Producers, while instructive, is not precisely apposite. \r\nV.  DUE PROCESS\r\nAppellants urge that the composition of both the\r\nCommission and the Hearing Panel violates the Due Process Clauses\r\nof both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  They argue that the\r\ncommissioners who are dairy farmers or handlers have a pecuniary\r\ninterest in ruling and legislating against them.  \r\nA.  In General\r\nThe Supreme Court has long held that a \"fair trial in a\r\nfair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\"  In re\r\nMurchison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105303\"><a href=\"/opinion/105303/in-re-murchison/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136 (1955).

Adjudicative Functions\r\nThe Due Process Clause inquiry is slightly more\r\ncomplicated with respect to the Hearing Panel.  This is not, in\r\ncontrast to the issuance of regulations, a mere legislative\r\nfunction.  The Hearing Panel sits as a quasi-judicial adjudicative\r\nbody, and thus must comport with a higher standard of due process. \r\nThe Hearing Panel meets this standard for four reasons. \r\nFirst, any potential financial interest on the part of individual\r\npanel members is highly attenuated.

Partially\r\nregulated plants actually ship precious little milk into the\r\nregion.  See Compact Over-Order Price Regulation, 62 Fed. Reg.\r\n23,039 (April 28, 1997) (\"At present, approximately 98 percent of\r\nthe fluid milk products consumed in the region are produced by\r\nfluid processing plants located in New England.\").

The court stated:\r\n   A lawyer in a one-lawyer town, for example, would\r\n   probably have a \"direct\" and \"substantial\" pecuniary\r\n   interest in the licensing of a competitor planning to\r\n   hang a shingle across the street.  On the other hand, it\r\n   is unlikely that any attorney practicing in a city like\r\n   Los Angeles would have a competitive interest\r\n   sufficiently strong to require that he be disqualified\r\n   from considering the licensing of an additional lawyer.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709238\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Stivers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/709238/95-cal-daily-op-serv-9034-95-daily-journal-dar-15866-martin-stivers/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  We agree with the Ninth Circuit that at\r\nsome level of attenuation, as here, the adjudicator's interest\r\nbecomes too remote to have a constitutionally deficient effect.  \r\nSecond, the Commission's own regulations provide a due\r\nprocess safeguard, placing stringent restrictions on the\r\ncomposition of hearing panels.  The regulations state: \r\n   (a) Appointment of Commission hearing panel.  Upon\r\n   receipt of a petition, the Chair shall appoint from one\r\n   to three Commission members who shall consider the\r\n   petition . . . .  The Commission panel chosen by the\r\n   Chair shall consist of Commission members who are not\r\n   members of the state delegation in which the Handler is\r\n   incorporated or has its principal place of business, who\r\n   have no pecuniary interest in the outcome, and who are\r\n   otherwise fair and impartial.\r\n\nConduct of Proceedings, 7 C.F.R.  1381.4(a).  Pursuant to this,\r\nthe Hearing Panel which heard appellants' petitions before the\r\nCommission did not include any handlers or farmers.  As noted\r\nabove, the Hearing Panel in this case consisted of the Commission\r\nChair, who was also the consumer representative from the Maine\r\ndelegation, the Chief of the Consumer Protection Division of the\r\nRhode Island Attorney General's Office, and the consumer\r\nrepresentative from the New Hampshire delegation.  See New York\r\nState Dairy Foods, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Given the\r\ncomposition of the Hearing Panel in this case, it will take more\r\nthan bare allegations to give rise to a finding of a deprivation of\r\ndue process.  We recognize that the composition of the hearing\r\npanel does not fully answer appellants' complaint about the\r\ncomposition of the Commission as a whole.  It is true that handlers\r\nand producers sit on the Commission, and as a result both issue\r\ninitial regulations and pass on the Hearing Panel's proposed\r\ndecisions.  The issuance of regulations, as we have said, involves\r\na lower due process bar.  With respect to the final decision on the\r\nHearing Panel's proposed decision, however, we need do little more\r\nthan note that the full Commission adopted the proposed decision of\r\nthis (unquestionably, we believe) disinterested panel.  \r\nThird, the Commission members vote as state delegations,\r\nnot individual members.  We recognize that this alone cannot cure\r\na due process violation.  See Cinderella Career &amp; Finishing Sch.,\r\nInc. v. FTC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"289851\"><a href=\"/opinion/289851/cinderella-career-and-finishing-schools-inc-stephen-corporation-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 592 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (one biased member\r\nof even a sizable tribunal violates due process).  It is not,\r\nhowever, without relevance.  The possibility that the small number\r\nof handlers (with their already attenuated interest) on the\r\nCommission will influence their peers sufficiently to alter a vote\r\nis significantly more remote that it would be in a scheme in which\r\neach commissioner voted individually.\r\nFourth, and perhaps most important, the appellants could\r\nhave moved to disqualify all handlers and farmers from the\r\nCommission decision on their petitions.  See 7 C.F.R.\r\n1381.4(h)(3) (\"Any commissioner shall (on either the\r\nCommissioner's own motion or on motion of the petitioner)\r\ndisqualify himself or herself from consideration of the\r\nCommission's final ruling on the panel's decision if that\r\ncommissioner's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"). \r\nThey did not do so.\r\nAccordingly, there is no legal or factual basis for\r\nfinding a due process violation.  \r\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r\nFinding that the Commission violated neither the Commerce\r\nClause nor the Due Process Clauses, we affirm the district court's\r\nentry of summary judgment. \r\n\n                     - Addendum Follows -\n</pre>",
