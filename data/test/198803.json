Briody for appellant.\r\nDonald C. Lockhart, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\r\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Zechariah Chafee,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n                       January 31, 2000\r\n                                           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.  This case concerns the\r\nadministration of justice for indigent defendants under the\r\nCriminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C.  3006A.  More particularly, it\r\nconcerns applications by indigent defendants for government funding\r\nof expert services \"necessary for adequate representation.\"  18\r\nU.S.C.  3006A(e)(1).  Because the district court violated the\r\nprovision of this statute providing that such applications be heard\r\nex parte, we vacate and remand.\r\nJoselito Abreu pled guilty to possession with intent to\r\ndistribute over 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.\r\n841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B).  Abreu is a citizen of the Dominican\r\nRepublic and required the assistance of an interpreter throughout\r\nthe legal proceedings.  He has a history of small criminal offenses \r\nand, in this case, was caught with about $30,000 worth of cocaine\r\nand related paraphernalia in his apartment.  After his arrest, the\r\nJustice Department notified the facility in which he was being held\r\nthat \"Abreu had some suicidal and mental health concerns.\"  During\r\nhis initial screening at the facility, Abreu indicated that he had\r\nattempted suicide the night before. \r\nIn preparation for Abreu's change of plea hearing, his\r\ncourt-appointed counsel asked him whether he was taking a certain\r\nmedication.  Abreu said he was; however, the nurse at the detention\r\nfacility said Abreu was not taking the medication and had not been\r\ndoing so for several weeks.  When asked about the medication at the\r\nplea hearing, Abreu contradicted the nurse and said that he had\r\ntaken the medication \"[a]bout four days ago\" (although he\r\nmaintained that this medication did not affect his ability to make\r\na plea).  When asked by the court whether he had been read the\r\nindictment, Abreu said he could not remember and that he sometimes\r\nhad problems remembering things. \r\nConcerned about these facts, about Abreu's difficulties\r\nin understanding certain things, and about inconsistent statements\r\nAbreu made to him (that counsel felt were protected by the\r\nattorney-client relationship), Abreu's counsel sought an evaluation\r\nby a licensed psychologist before sentencing.  Because Abreu is\r\nindigent, counsel utilized the procedure set forth in 18 U.S.C.\r\n3006A and filed an ex parte application for the funding of expert\r\nservices.  The sum sought was $550.  Counsel represented that while\r\nhe believed there was a basis to seek a psychological evaluation,\r\nit was not clear whether such an evaluation would support a request\r\nfor a downward departure for \"diminished capacity\" under U.S.S.G.\r\n5K2.13.  If the evaluation did, counsel indicated that he might\r\nseek such a departure at sentencing.  If it did not, he would not.\r\nThe district court first held an ex parte hearing to\r\ndetermine whether it should consider the application ex parte.  It\r\ndetermined that it would not.  At the court's direction, counsel\r\nfor Abreu then refiled the application for funding with notice to\r\nthe government and the government filed an opposition.  The\r\ndistrict court held a hearing at which the government was present. \r\nBecause the government was present, defense counsel declined to\r\nplace on the record certain confidential matters that formed part\r\nof the basis for the application.  The court denied the request for\r\nservices.  The defense, deprived of the expert examination it had\r\nrequested, did not argue for a lesser sentence on the basis of\r\ndiminished mental capacity.  Abreu was eventually sentenced to 70\r\nmonths imprisonment.  He now appeals.\r\nThis court has appellate jurisdiction over  3006A\r\ndeterminations that impact a defendant's trial or sentence.  See\r\nUnited States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 218-19 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n(reviewing a district court's denial of a request for expert\r\nservices for trial under  3006A); United States v. Mateos-Sanchez,\r\n864 F.2d 232, 239-40 (1st Cir. 1988) (reviewing a district court's\r\ndecision to deny travel expenses requested under  3006A for the\r\npurpose of interviewing potential witnesses); see also United\r\nStates v. Bloomer, 150 F.3d 146, 149 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting that\r\nappellate review is available for  3006A determinations \"that\r\nimpact a defendant's trial, sentence, or collateral challenge to a\r\nconviction or sentence\").\r\nAbreu says that the district court violated the plain\r\nterms of the statute -- which requires that applications for such\r\nfunding by indigent defendants be handled ex parte -- and requests\r\nthat the matter be remanded for reconsideration ex parte;\r\nalternatively, Abreu says that the court should review and reverse\r\nthe district court's ultimate determination that his request for\r\nthe $550 expenditure was not necessary.\r\nThe prosecution does not concede that the application was \r\nrequired to be heard ex parte by the statute, but neither does it\r\ndefend the trial court's decision to make the application the\r\nsubject of an adversary proceeding.  At oral argument, the\r\ngovernment said it had initially considered requesting a limited\r\nremand so that the court could hear ex parte the additional\r\ninformation that Abreu's counsel viewed as confidential and\r\nreconsider the matter.  The government decided to contest the\r\nmatter, however, since, it argues, a remand is not necessary\r\nbecause there was, in the end, no prejudice to the defendant. \r\nThere was no prejudice, the government says, because it was clear\r\nfrom the record and from the judge's own observations that the\r\ndefendant would never have been able to meet the high threshold\r\nnecessary for a \"diminished capacity\" adjustment.  See U.S.S.G.\r\n5K2.13; see also United States v. Nuez-Rodriguez, 92 F.3d 14, 24\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).\r\nThe government's first instincts were correct.  We think\r\nit premature to reach the question of prejudice or the merits of\r\nthe decision to deny funding.  As to the government's argument that\r\nwe should overlook any problem, it is true, as the government says,\r\nthat review of the merits of such a  3006A decision is\r\ndeferential.  See Manning, 79 F.3d at 218 (\"A district court's\r\ndenial of a request for such [expert] services [under  3006A] is\r\nreviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\").  But because the trial\r\ncourt did not follow the required procedures, material information\r\nis not in the record and reaching the merits would be\r\ninappropriate.\r\nThe district court committed error in refusing to\r\nentertain the application ex parte under 18 U.S.C.  3006A(e)(1). \r\nThe statutory provision says:\r\n  (e)  Services other than counsel. --\r\n           (1)  Upon request. -- Counsel for a person who is\r\n       financially unable to obtain investigative,\r\n       expert, or other services necessary for\r\n       adequate representation may request them in\r\n       an ex parte application.  Upon finding,\r\n       after appropriate inquiry in an ex parte\r\n       proceeding, that the services are necessary\r\n       and that the person is financially unable to\r\n       obtain them, the court . . . shall authorize\r\n       counsel to obtain the services.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  3006A(e)(1).  Although the statute expressly provides\r\nthat the proceeding be ex parte, the district court found the\r\nstatute's language to be \"very ambiguous.\"  The judge did not\r\nexplain why he viewed this language as ambiguous.  At the adversary\r\nhearing, the court simply said that \"it just didn't seem to make\r\nsense\" to hear the application ex parte where \"the Defendant had\r\nalready pled guilty, and what we were dealing with was a sentencing\r\nissue.\"\r\nThe distinction the district court drew, for  3006A\r\npurposes, between sentencing and trial strikes us as unsound.  To\r\nour knowledge, no reported decision has held that the ex parte\r\nprovisions of  3006A do not apply to the sentencing stage, and the\r\ngovernment does not argue that  3006A does not apply to\r\nsentencing.  Further, nothing in the statute limits its\r\napplicability to pre-sentencing proceedings.  Rather, the statutory\r\nstructure indicates that it does apply. Subsection (e) refers to\r\nservices \"necessary for adequate representation.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n3006A(e)(1).  Under the statute, appointed counsel represent\r\nindigent clients through sentencing and beyond.  In fact,\r\nsubsection (c) of the statute, provides that:\r\n  A person for whom counsel is appointed shall be\r\nrepresented at every stage of the proceedings from his\r\ninitial appearance before the United States magistrate or\r\nthe court through appeal, including ancillary matters\r\nappropriate to the proceedings. . . .\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  3006A(c).  The legislative history associated with this\r\nprovision reaffirms that \"adequate representation\" requires support\r\nthroughout all phases of the proceedings:  \"This provision\r\n[subsection (c)] is necessary to insure that the rights of the\r\nperson are fully protected.  Many times remedies technically\r\noutside the scope of the trial proper may be necessary . . . .\" \r\nH.R. Rep. 91-1546 (1970), reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3982,\r\n3989; see also H.R. Rep. 88-864 (1963), reprinted in 1964\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2990, 2992 (\"[A] defendant is entitled to\r\nrepresentation by counsel at every stage of the proceedings, from\r\nhis initial appearance through appeal.\").  Thus, reading the\r\nstatute as a whole, it appears that Congress intended the\r\nprovisions of subsection (e) to apply to sentencing.  While other\r\ncircuits have assumed this to be so, see e.g., Bloomer, 150 F.3d at\r\n148 (noting that \"applications for appointment of an expert are ex\r\nparte and nonadversarial\" in a case where expert fees for testimony\r\nat re-sentencing were sought); United States v. Roman, 121 F.3d\r\n136, 143 (3d Cir. 1997) (reviewing a  3006A application for a\r\npsychiatric evaluation to aid in requesting a downward departure at\r\nsentencing); United States v. Harden, 70 F.3d 1263 (unpublished\r\ntable decision), in 1995 WL 703543, at *1 (4th Cir. 1995) (same);\r\nUnited States v. Smith, 987 F.2d 888, 891 (2d Cir. 1993) (same), it\r\nappears that this may be the first circuit opinion to so hold.  It\r\nwas error for the district court to conclude that the \"ex parte\r\nproceeding\" language of subsection (e) did not apply to sentencing.\r\nNor do we see any ambiguity at all in subsection (e)'s\r\nuse of the term \"ex parte.\"  The statute says plainly that\r\nproceedings and applications should be ex parte.  The text is not\r\nambiguous in any sense and the meaning of \"ex parte proceeding\" is\r\nwell established.  See, e.g., United States v. Meriwether, 486 F.2d\r\n498, 506 (5th Cir. 1973).  Black's Law Dictionary defines it as a\r\n\"proceeding in which not all parties are present or given the\r\nopportunity to be heard.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed.\r\n1999).  It further defines \"ex parte\" as \"[d]one or made at the\r\ninstance and for the benefit of one party only, and without notice\r\nto, or argument by, any person adversely interested.\"  Id. at 597. \r\nThis lack of ambiguity is underscored by provisions in\r\nthe Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures, promulgated\r\npursuant to  3006A(h), which says that the Judicial Conference of\r\nthe United States \"may, from time to time, issue rules and\r\nregulations governing the operation of plans formulated under this\r\nsection.\"  18 U.S.C.  3006A(h).  The Guide provides:\r\n  Ex parte applications for services other than counsel\r\nunder subsection (e) shall be heard in camera, and shall\r\nnot be revealed without the consent of the defendant. \r\nThe application shall be placed under seal until the\r\nfinal disposition of the case in the trial court, subject\r\nto further order of the court.  Maintaining the secrecy\r\nof the application prevents the possibility that an open\r\nhearing may cause a defendant to reveal his or her\r\ndefense.\r\n\n7 Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Guide to\r\nJudiciary Policies and Procedures, ch. III, pt. A,  3.03.\r\nThis is consistent with the legislative history, which\r\nstates that an ex parte proceeding is provided for in subsection\r\n(e) so as to \"prevent[] the possibility that an open hearing may\r\ncause a defendant to reveal his defense.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 88-864\r\n(1963), reprinted in 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2990, 2990; see United\r\nStates v. Gonzales, 150 F.3d 1246, 1258 n.16 (10th Cir. 1998).  \r\nThe circuit courts have recognized the importance of such\r\napplications being ex parte in trial proceedings.  In United States\r\nv. Sutton, 464 F.2d 552 (5th Cir. 1972), the court reversed a\r\nconviction where the trial court heard a request for an\r\ninvestigator under  3006A(e) in the presence of the prosecution,\r\nsaying \"[t]he ex parte requirement could hardly be expressed in\r\nclearer language.\"  Id. at 553.  And in Marshall v. United States,\r\n423 F.2d 1315 (10th Cir. 1970), the court reversed the judgment\r\nwhere a  3006A(e) application was heard in an adversarial\r\nproceeding, noting that \"[t]he manifest purpose of requiring that\r\nthe inquiry be ex parte is to insure that the defendant will not\r\nhave to make a premature disclosure of his case.\"  Id. at 1318; see\r\nalso Lawson v. Dixon, 3 F.3d 743, 751 (4th Cir. 1993) (stating that\r\n3006A \"has been interpreted as virtually guaranteeing that\r\ndecisions on expert-appointment motions will be made, as that\r\nstatute requires, 'after appropriate inquiry in an ex parte\r\nproceeding'\"); United States v. Chavis, 476 F.2d 1137, 1144 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1973) (\"We agree that the statutory scheme means that not to\r\nprovide an opportunity for an ex parte hearing on the matter does\r\nconstitute error.\").\r\nWhile evidentiary rules at sentencing may be relaxed,\r\nsee, e.g., United States v. Cetina-Gomez, 951 F.2d 432, 435 (1st\r\nCir. 1991), sentencing is still an adversarial proceeding, see\r\nBurns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 135 (1991) (noting that the\r\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure \"contemplate[] full adversary\r\ntesting of the issues relevant to a Guidelines sentence\"); United\r\nStates v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1544 (1st Cir. 1989). \r\nDefendants do not give up their Fifth Amendment rights at\r\nsentencing.  See United States v. Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d 1060,\r\n1065 (1st Cir. 1997).  Given the extent to which sentencing\r\ndetermines a defendant's liberty, it is just as crucial that the\r\ndefendant have a fair opportunity to marshal a defense at the\r\nsentencing phase as at any other phase of the criminal proceedings. \r\nIn fact, the Supreme Court, in a capital case, has said that due\r\nprocess requires that, where \"the defendant's mental condition [is]\r\nrelevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might\r\nsuffer,\" the government provide to indigent defendants expert\r\npsychiatric testimony at \"the sentencing phase.\"  Ake v. Oklahoma,\r\n470 U.S. 68, 80, 83-84 (1985).\r\nThere is another principle at stake: fair treatment of\r\nindigents.  Defendants who are able to fund their own defenses need\r\nnot reveal to the government the grounds for seeking a psychiatrist\r\nwho might potentially testify at sentencing.  To require indigent\r\ndefendants to do so would penalize them for their poverty.  The\r\nwords of Judge Aldrich in an opinion of this court more than thirty\r\nyears ago still hold true:\r\n  [W]e would regard the purpose of the . . . rule as\r\napparent on its face to be in recognition of the\r\nprinciple that defendants are not to be avoidably\r\ndiscriminated against because of their indigency.\r\n\nHolden v. United States, 393 F.2d 276, 278 (1st Cir. 1968)\r\n(construing the requirement in Rule 17(b) that subpoenas issue on\r\nan ex parte application of a defendant).\r\nThe district court was in error in not handling the\r\nentire application on an ex parte basis.  The scope of the remand\r\nis narrow.  The district court must hear ex parte any matters that\r\nhave not already been presented by counsel and then reconsider\r\nwhether it should grant the application.  The only new matters that\r\ncounsel may present are those he refrained from presenting before\r\non grounds of privilege or confidentiality.  If the court decides\r\nto grant the application, then counsel for defendant must advise\r\nthe district court, after the psychological examination, whether\r\nAbreu seeks re-sentencing.  If the court denies the application,\r\nthen a sentence of the same term as the original sentence will be\r\nreinstated.  If Abreu wishes to take an appeal from the denial of\r\nthe application at that point, he must file a new notice of appeal. \r\nIn the interim, the sentence is vacated and the case remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings in light of this opinion.\r\nSo ordered.\n",

The court denied the request for\r\nservices.  The defense, deprived of the expert examination it had\r\nrequested, did not argue for a lesser sentence on the basis of\r\ndiminished mental capacity.  Abreu was eventually sentenced to 70\r\nmonths imprisonment.  He now appeals.\r\nThis court has appellate jurisdiction over  3006A\r\ndeterminations that impact a defendant's trial or sentence.

At oral argument, the\r\ngovernment said it had initially considered requesting a limited\r\nremand so that the court could hear ex parte the additional\r\ninformation that Abreu's counsel viewed as confidential and\r\nreconsider the matter.  The government decided to contest the\r\nmatter, however, since, it argues, a remand is not necessary\r\nbecause there was, in the end, no prejudice to the defendant. \r\nThere was no prejudice, the government says, because it was clear\r\nfrom the record and from the judge's own observations that the\r\ndefendant would never have been able to meet the high threshold\r\nnecessary for a \"diminished capacity\" adjustment.  See U.S.S.G.\r\n5K2.13; see also United States v.

We think\r\nit premature to reach the question of prejudice or the merits of\r\nthe decision to deny funding.  As to the government's argument that\r\nwe should overlook any problem, it is true, as the government says,\r\nthat review of the merits of such a  3006A decision is\r\ndeferential.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196640\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Manning,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196640/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">218</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(\"A district court's\r\ndenial of a request for such [expert] services [under  3006A] is\r\nreviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\").  But because the trial\r\ncourt did not follow the required procedures, material information\r\nis not in the record and reaching the merits would be\r\ninappropriate.\r\nThe district court committed error in refusing to\r\nentertain the application ex parte under 18 U.S.C.  3006A(e)(1). \r\nThe statutory provision says:\r\n  (e)  Services other than counsel. --\r\n           (1)  Upon request. -- Counsel for a person who is\r\n       financially unable to obtain investigative,\r\n       expert, or other services necessary for\r\n       adequate representation may request them in\r\n       an ex parte application.  Upon finding,\r\n       after appropriate inquiry in an ex parte\r\n       proceeding, that the services are necessary\r\n       and that the person is financially unable to\r\n       obtain them, the court . . . shall authorize\r\n       counsel to obtain the services.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  3006A(e)(1).  Although the statute expressly provides\r\nthat the proceeding be ex parte, the district court found the\r\nstatute's language to be \"very ambiguous.\"  The judge did not\r\nexplain why he viewed this language as ambiguous.  At the adversary\r\nhearing, the court simply said that \"it just didn't seem to make\r\nsense\" to hear the application ex parte where \"the Defendant had\r\nalready pled guilty, and what we were dealing with was a sentencing\r\nissue.\"\r\nThe distinction the district court drew, for  3006A\r\npurposes, between sentencing and trial strikes us as unsound.  To\r\nour knowledge, no reported decision has held that the ex parte\r\nprovisions of  3006A do not apply to the sentencing stage, and the\r\ngovernment does not argue that  3006A does not apply to\r\nsentencing.  Further, nothing in the statute limits its\r\napplicability to pre-sentencing proceedings.  Rather, the statutory\r\nstructure indicates that it does apply. Subsection (e) refers to\r\nservices \"necessary for adequate representation.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n3006A(e)(1).  Under the statute, appointed counsel represent\r\nindigent clients through sentencing and beyond.  In fact,\r\nsubsection (c) of the statute, provides that:\r\n  A person for whom counsel is appointed shall be\r\nrepresented at every stage of the proceedings from his\r\ninitial appearance before the United States magistrate or\r\nthe court through appeal, including ancillary matters\r\nappropriate to the proceedings. . . .\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  3006A(c).  The legislative history associated with this\r\nprovision reaffirms that \"adequate representation\" requires support\r\nthroughout all phases of the proceedings:  \"This provision\r\n[subsection (c)] is necessary to insure that the rights of the\r\nperson are fully protected.  Many times remedies technically\r\noutside the scope of the trial proper may be necessary . . . .\" \r\nH.R. Rep. 91-1546 (1970), reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3982,\r\n3989; see also H.R. Rep. 88-864 (1963), reprinted in 1964\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2990, 2992 (\"[A] defendant is entitled to\r\nrepresentation by counsel at every stage of the proceedings, from\r\nhis initial appearance through appeal.\").  Thus, reading the\r\nstatute as a whole, it appears that Congress intended the\r\nprovisions of subsection (e) to apply to sentencing.

Given the extent to which sentencing\r\ndetermines a defendant's liberty, it is just as crucial that the\r\ndefendant have a fair opportunity to marshal a defense at the\r\nsentencing phase as at any other phase of the criminal proceedings. \r\nIn fact, the Supreme Court, in a capital case, has said that due\r\nprocess requires that, where \"the defendant's mental condition [is]\r\nrelevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might\r\nsuffer,\" the government provide to indigent defendants expert\r\npsychiatric testimony at \"the sentencing phase.\"  Ake v.

Defendants who are able to fund their own defenses need\r\nnot reveal to the government the grounds for seeking a psychiatrist\r\nwho might potentially testify at sentencing.  To require indigent\r\ndefendants to do so would penalize them for their poverty.  The\r\nwords of Judge Aldrich in an opinion of this court more than thirty\r\nyears ago still hold true:\r\n  [W]e would regard the purpose of the . . . rule as\r\napparent on its face to be in recognition of the\r\nprinciple that defendants are not to be avoidably\r\ndiscriminated against because of their indigency.\r\n\nHolden v.

The only new matters that\r\ncounsel may present are those he refrained from presenting before\r\non grounds of privilege or confidentiality.
