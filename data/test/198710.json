Petitioner, Maria Dulce\r\nPena Luis (\"Luis\"), seeks judicial review of what is essentially\r\nthe final administrative decision regarding deportation in this\r\ncase.  This case comes before us in a tortured procedural posture. \r\nAfter an adverse ruling at her deportation hearing, Luis appealed\r\nthe decision and filed a motion to remand the case to the\r\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") so that she could apply for adjustment of\r\nstatus.  The appeal was dismissed and the motion to remand was\r\ndenied.  Luis then moved to reopen the proceedings.  Failing at\r\nthat, she moved to reconsider that denial.  The Board of\r\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denied Luis's motion to reconsider on\r\nthe undisputed ground that is was untimely.  It is this decision\r\nfrom which she now appeals.\r\nLuis claims that the BIA abused its discretion in denying\r\nthe motion to reconsider and that it failed to follow its own\r\nprocedures in reviewing such a motion.  Luis further claims that\r\nthe BIA's refusal to consider the motion to reconsider on the\r\nmerits amounted to a denial of due process.  For reasons stated\r\nbelow, we dismiss her petition.\r\n  I.  BACKGROUND \r\nLuis, a native and citizen of Portugal, entered the\r\nUnited States on May 6, 1988.  She was admitted as a nonimmigrant\r\nvisitor and was only authorized to remain in this country until\r\nNovember 5, 1988.  She remained in the United States beyond that\r\ndate without authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService (\"INS\").  \r\nWithout the requisite authorization from the INS, Luis\r\nwas employed by the Sweetheart Cup Company.  Luis admitted that she\r\npaid someone to provide her with a fraudulent green card, which had\r\nher name and picture, as well as a false social security card.  She\r\nknew that the cards were fraudulent and she had no right to use\r\nthem, but admitted that she used those cards to secure employment. \r\nOn March 22, 1994, the INS issued an Order to Show Cause\r\nwhy Luis should not be deported.  At a hearing before an IJ, Luis\r\nsought either termination of the deportation proceedings or\r\nvoluntary departure in lieu of deportation.  The IJ found Luis\r\nsubject to deportation on the ground that she remained in the\r\nUnited States longer than she was permitted in violation of\r\nSection 241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\r\n(\"INA\"), as amended.  The IJ also denied Luis's application for\r\nvoluntary departure, as a matter of discretion, on the ground that\r\nshe had engaged in unauthorized employment which she obtained by\r\nusing fraudulent documentation.  \r\nLuis appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA.  While the\r\nappeal was pending, Luis's husband became the beneficiary of a\r\nlabor certification petition and was able to adjust his status, and\r\nthat of their two children, to that of lawful permanent residents. \r\nThereupon, Luis filed a motion with the BIA to remand her case to\r\nthe IJ to allow her to apply for adjustment of status.  The BIA\r\ndismissed her appeal and denied her motion to remand.  In\r\ndismissing the appeal, the BIA found that, as a matter of\r\ndiscretion, Luis was not eligible for voluntary departure.  Finding\r\nthat Luis's motion to remand was \"not accompanied by an application\r\nfor adjustment of status or an approved visa petition[,]\" the BIA\r\ndenied her motion.  \r\nOn April 11, 1997, Luis filed a motion with the BIA to\r\nreopen her case so that she could apply for adjustment of status. \r\nIncluded with that motion to reopen was Luis's application for\r\nadjustment of status.  The BIA noted that Luis admitted to\r\nunauthorized employment in the United States and using a fraudulent\r\ngreen card and social security card.  The BIA determined, based on\r\nthose admissions, and in exercise of discretion, that Luis \"[did]\r\nnot merit a reopening of her deportation proceedings to adjust her\r\nstatus.\"  The BIA further noted that Luis lived in the United\r\nStates for nine years with her lawful permanent resident husband\r\nand children.  The BIA balanced those factors and ultimately denied\r\nthe motion to reopen, finding that \"the respondent's equities are\r\noutweighed by [the] adverse factors.\" \r\nOn January 14, 1998, Luis filed a motion to reconsider\r\nthe denial of the motion to reopen.  This is the matter before us. \r\nShe noted that her husband and children were able to adjust their\r\nstatus to that of lawful permanent residents and stressed the\r\nimportance of family unity.  The BIA denied the motion to\r\nreconsider because it was untimely filed.  The BIA did not reach a\r\ndecision on the merits of the motion to reconsider.  This petition\r\nfor review followed.  Luis argues that the BIA abused its\r\ndiscretion when it denied, as untimely, her motion to reconsider. \r\nShe claims that the BIA \"departed from established procedures and\r\nacted inconsistently\" when it did not act sua sponte to review the\r\ncase, and that this amounts to a denial of due process.  \r\nII.       ANALYSIS\r\nLuis's deportation proceedings commenced prior to\r\nApril 1, 1997, and her final order of deportation was issued after\r\nOctober  31, 1996.  As such, jurisdiction over this petition is\r\ngoverned by section 106(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C.  1105a(a), as\r\namended by the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform\r\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. 104-\r\n208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996).  In transitional rules cases, this\r\ncourt has jurisdiction to hear appeals from the BIA under INA\r\n106, 8 U.S.C.  1105a, unless jurisdiction is otherwise\r\nprecluded.  See IIRIRA  309(c)(1).  \r\nGenerally, under the old INA, courts have recognized\r\njurisdiction to review (for abuse of discretion) agency decisions\r\ndenying motions to remand, reopen or reconsider.  See Carter v.\r\nINS, 90 F.3d 14, 15-17 (1st Cir. 1996); Gebremichael v. INS, 10\r\nF.3d 28, 34 n.17 (1st Cir. 1993).  IIRIRA  309(c)(4)(E) precludes\r\njurisdiction if, and only if, review is sought of:  (1) a \"decision\r\nunder\" one of the enumerated sections; and (2) where such a\r\ndecision is based on a matter committed to agency discretion.  Luis\r\nseeks review of the BIA's denial of her untimely motion to\r\nreconsider.  Only this denial is before us.  Luis makes three\r\narguments: (1) that the denial was an abuse of discretion; (2) that\r\nthe BIA should have acted sua sponte; and (3) that the BIA's\r\ndecision denied her due process.  \r\nThe first question is whether the denial of the motion to\r\nreconsider was a \"decision under\" an enumerated section.  It\r\nclearly was not.  Moreover, \"[s]ome components of decisions made\r\nunder the enumerated sections are not committed to agency\r\ndiscretion but are instead determinations of objective facts. \r\nWhere the decision rests on these latter grounds, review is not\r\nprecluded by 309(c)(4)(E).\"  Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, No. 99-1211,\r\nslip op. at 2-3 (1st Cir. Nov. 2, 1999).  \r\nAs the Fourth Circuit recognized in Stewart v. INS, 181\r\nF.3d 587, 594-95 (4th Cir. 1999), some denials of such motions are\r\nbased on other statutory sections, such as INA  242B(e)(2), which\r\nis a gatekeeper section requiring the alien to show exceptional\r\ncircumstances to be eligible for adjustment of status.  Adjustment\r\nof status, INA  245, by contrast, is an enumerated section.  The\r\nStewart court held that  309(c)(4)(E) did not preclude\r\njurisdiction where the BIA's decision was based on a non-enumerated\r\nsection such as  242B(e)(2).  That is, Stewart rejects the idea\r\nthat  309(c)(4)(E) precludes review just because the motion is\r\nrelated to an enumerated section.  See also Arrozal v. INS, 159\r\nF.3d 429 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that the court of appeals had\r\njurisdiction to hear an appeal from the BIA's denial of a motion to\r\nreopen under  241(a)(2) of the INA, which is not one of the\r\nenumerated sections listed in  309(c)(4)(E)).\r\nLuis seeks review of a denial of a motion to reconsider\r\nthe denial of a motion to reopen.  This was a decision under\r\n8 C.F.R.  3.2(a), not one of those sections enumerated in IIRIRA\r\n309(c)(4)(E), and it was not a discretionary decision but an\r\nuncontested factual determination.  Because it is undisputed that\r\nthe motion to reconsider was untimely, that ends the matter.  We\r\nneed not discuss the issue of whether  309(c)(4)(E) would bar\r\nreview by the court of appeals had the motion to reconsider been\r\ntimely filed.\r\nLuis invites this court to review the BIA's decision on\r\nthe ground that the BIA failed to exercise its discretion to sua\r\nsponte reconsider its denial of Luis's motion to reopen her\r\ndeportation proceedings.  We decline the invitation because Luis\r\nfailed to exhaust her administrative remedies with regard to this\r\nissue.  \"Issues not raised before the Board may not be raised for\r\nthe first time upon judicial review of the Board's decisions.\" \r\nRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1992); see also\r\nBernal-Vallejo, slip op. at 14.  Luis could have argued to the BIA\r\nthat even if the motion to reconsider was untimely, the BIA should\r\nhave exercised its sua sponte power pursuant to 8 C.F.R.  3.2(a). \r\nShe did not and, therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to\r\nentertain that issue. \r\nAssuming arguendo that Luis would have exhausted her\r\nadministrative remedies, this court still has no jurisdiction to\r\nreview this claim because the decision of the BIA whether to invoke\r\nits sua sponte authority is committed to its unfettered discretion. \r\nTherefore, the very nature of the claim renders it not subject to\r\njudicial review.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831-33\r\n(1985); Massachusetts Pub. Interest Research Group, Inc. v. United\r\nStates Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 852 F.2d 9 (1st Cir. 1988).  \r\nApart from the situation where Congress has expressed an\r\nintent to preclude review, \r\n  review is not to be had if the statute is\r\ndrawn so that a court would have no meaningful\r\nstandard against which to judge the agency's\r\nexercise of discretion.  In such a case, the\r\nstatute (\"law\") can be taken to have\r\n\"committed\" the decisionmaking to the agency's\r\njudgement absolutely. . . . [I]f no judicially\r\nmanageable standards are available for judging\r\nhow and when an agency should exercise its\r\ndiscretion, then it is impossible to evaluate\r\nagency action for \"abuse of discretion.\"\r\n\nHeckler, 470 U.S. at 830.  There are no guidelines or standards\r\nwhich dictate how and when the BIA should invoke its sua sponte\r\npower under 8 U.S.C.  3.2(a).  As such, it is left to the\r\ndiscretion of the BIA and is not subject to review by this court. \r\nTherefore, this court does not have jurisdiction to review Luis's\r\nclaim that the BIA should have invoked its sua sponte authority to\r\nreconsider her motion to reopen the deportation proceedings.\r\nFinally, Luis asserts that by refusing to consider the\r\nmotion to reconsider on the merits, the BIA denied her of her due\r\nprocess rights.  This court has jurisdiction to review Luis's due\r\nprocess claim.  See Bernal-Vallejo, slip op. at 13, (holding that\r\nthe due process argument \"does not involve a matter that Congress\r\ncommitted to agency discretion.\"); see also Antonio-Cruz v. INS,\r\n147 F.3d 1129, 1130-31 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that  309(c)(4)(E)\r\ndoes not preclude review of a due process claim).\r\nThough the court has jurisdiction to review Luis's due\r\nprocess claim, we find that this claim is frivolous.  Luis argues\r\nthat because the BIA refused to consider the motion to reconsider\r\non the merits, she was denied her due process rights.  After review\r\nof the record, however, we find that this argument is without\r\nmerit.  In fact, Luis has had ample opportunity to present her\r\nclaims to the BIA; first, in her motion to remand; then in her\r\nmotion to reopen the deportation proceedings.  \r\nLuis asserted, inter alia, that she lived in the United\r\nStates for over ten years with her lawful permanent resident\r\nhusband and children.  She was employed, though she admittedly used\r\nfraudulent documentation to secure her employment.  She never\r\nreceived any government assistance or benefit, has never been\r\ncharged with a crime and has paid her taxes.  She asserts that had\r\nthe BIA considered those factors, it would have granted her motion\r\nto reopen so she could apply for adjustment of status.  The record\r\nreveals that the BIA did consider those factors when it denied her\r\nmotion to reopen on the merits.  The BIA explicitly discussed those\r\nfactors and concluded that \"in the exercise of discretion[,]\" Luis\r\ndid not warrant an adjustment of status.  The BIA found that her\r\n\"equities [were] outweighed by [her] adverse factors.\"  It should\r\nalso be noted again that Luis's motion to reconsider was untimely. \r\nAccordingly, we find that there was no due process violation.\r\n\nDismissed.\n",

This case comes before us in a tortured procedural posture. After an adverse ruling at her deportation hearing, Luis appealed the decision and filed a motion to remand the case to the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") so that she could apply for adjustment of status. The appeal was dismissed and the motion to remand was denied. Luis then moved to reopen the proceedings. Failing at that, she moved to reconsider that denial. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denied Luis's motion to reconsider on the undisputed ground that is was untimely. It is this decision from which she now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luis claims that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider and that it failed to follow its own procedures in reviewing such a motion. Luis further claims that the BIA's refusal to consider the motion to reconsider on the merits amounted to a denial of due process. For reasons stated below, we dismiss her petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luis, a native and citizen of Portugal, entered the United States on May 6, 1988. She was admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor and was only authorized to remain in this country until November 5, 1988. She remained in the United States beyond that date without authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without the requisite authorization from the INS, Luis was employed by the Sweetheart Cup Company. Luis admitted that she paid someone to provide her with a fraudulent green card, which had her name and picture, as well as a false social security card. She knew that the cards were fraudulent and she had no right to use them, but admitted that she used those cards to secure employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 1994, the INS issued an Order to Show Cause why Luis should not be deported. At a hearing before an IJ, Luis sought either termination of the deportation proceedings or voluntary departure in lieu of deportation. The IJ found Luis subject to deportation on the ground that she remained in the United States longer than she was permitted in violation of Section 241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), as amended. The IJ also denied Luis's application for voluntary departure, as a matter of discretion, on the ground that she had engaged in unauthorized employment which she obtained by using fraudulent documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luis appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. While the appeal was pending, Luis's husband became the beneficiary of a labor certification petition and was able to adjust his status, and that of their two children, to that of lawful permanent residents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thereupon, Luis filed a motion with the BIA to remand her case to the IJ to allow her to apply for adjustment of status. The BIA dismissed her appeal and denied her motion to remand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In dismissing the appeal, the BIA found that, as a matter of discretion, Luis was not eligible for voluntary departure. Finding that Luis's motion to remand was \"not accompanied by an application for adjustment of status or an approved visa petition[,]\" the BIA denied her motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 11, 1997, Luis filed a motion with the BIA to reopen her case so that she could apply for adjustment of status. Included with that motion to reopen was Luis's application for adjustment of status. The BIA noted that Luis admitted to unauthorized employment in the United States and using a fraudulent green card and social security card. The BIA determined, based on those admissions, and in exercise of discretion, that Luis \"[did] not merit a reopening of her deportation proceedings to adjust her status.\" The BIA further noted that Luis lived in the United States for nine years with her lawful permanent resident husband and children. The BIA balanced those factors and ultimately denied the motion to reopen, finding that \"the respondent's equities are outweighed by [the] adverse factors.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 1998, Luis filed a motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen. This is the matter before us. She noted that her husband and children were able to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent residents and stressed the importance of family unity. The BIA denied the motion to reconsider because it was untimely filed. The BIA did not reach a decision on the merits of the motion to reconsider. This petition for review followed. Luis argues that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied, as untimely, her motion to reconsider. She claims that the BIA \"departed from established procedures and acted inconsistently\" when it did not act sua sponte to review the case, and that this amounts to a denial of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luis's deportation proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997, and her final order of deportation was issued after October 31, 1996. As such, jurisdiction over this petition is governed by section 106(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a), as amended by the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996). In transitional rules cases, this court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from the BIA under INA &#167; 106, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a, unless jurisdiction is otherwise precluded. See IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, under the old INA, courts have recognized jurisdiction to review (for abuse of discretion) agency decisions denying motions to remand, reopen or reconsider. See Carter v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196896\"><a href=\"/opinion/196896/carter-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 15-17 (1st Cir. 1996); Gebremichael v.

IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(E)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> precludes jurisdiction if, and only if, review is sought of: (1) a \"decision under\" one of the enumerated sections; and (2) where such a decision is based on a matter committed to agency discretion. Luis seeks review of the BIA's denial of her untimely motion to reconsider. Only this denial is before us. Luis makes three arguments: (1) that the denial was an abuse of discretion; (2) that the BIA should have acted sua sponte; and (3) that the BIA's decision denied her due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question is whether the denial of the motion to reconsider was a \"decision under\" an enumerated section. It clearly was not. Moreover, \"[s]ome components of decisions made under the enumerated sections are not committed to agency discretion but are instead determinations of objective facts. Where the decision rests on these latter grounds, review is not precluded by &#167;309(c)(4)(E).\" Bernal-Vallejo v.

Adjustment of status, INA &#167; 245, by contrast, is an enumerated section. The Stewart court held that &#167; 309(c)(4)(E) did not preclude jurisdiction where the BIA's decision was based on a non-enumerated section such as &#167; 242B(e)(2). That is, Stewart rejects the idea that &#167; 309(c)(4)(E) precludes review just because the motion is related to an enumerated section. See also Arrozal v.
