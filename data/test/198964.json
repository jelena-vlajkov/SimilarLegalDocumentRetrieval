After a thorough review of the record\n\nand   of   the   parties’   submissions,       we   affirm     appellant’s\n\nconviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm in\n\nviolation 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1).\n\n            The evidence tended to show that appellant Max Dee\n\nJenkins (“Jenkins”) lived at the residence from which the\n\nfirearms were confiscated, because he had purchased and\n\nmoved into the residence with his companion nine months\n\nearlier;    when     released   from    jail    and    restrained     from\n\nvisiting the residence, he had nowhere to live except a\n\nfriend’s    house;    and   approximately      one     month    later,   he\n\nreturned to the residence to retrieve clothing and other\n\npersonal items (including a large cache of ammunition).\n\nConstructive     possession     may    be   established      by   evidence\n\nshowing that the defendant lived at the residence where the\n\nobjects in question were found immediately prior to their\n\ndiscovery by police.        See United States v. Vargas, 945 F.2d\n\n426, 427-28 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            Further, the evidence tended to establish that\n\nJenkins owned the firearms in question.               After the firearms\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fwere confiscated, he began efforts almost immediately to\n\nretrieve them, including devising a deceptive plan whereby\n\nthe guns would be shipped out of state for his retrieval.\n\nFurther, he told both a licensed firearms dealer and the\n\nlocal    police   that   the   weapons    were   his.   Ownership    is\n\n“highly relevant” to the question of possession.                United\n\nStates v. Rogers, 41 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Taking this evidence in a light most favorable to\n\nthe government, United States v. Smith, 101 F.3d 202, 215\n\n(1st Cir. 1996), we think a rational jury could conclude that\n\nappellant constructively possessed the firearms during the\n\ntime    charged   in   the   indictment.     See   United   States   v.\n\nCollins, 60 F.3d 4, 8 (1 st Cir. 1995) (conviction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1) affirmed where firearms were found at\n\ndefendant’s residence and defendant made statements tending\n\nto show he owned the firearms).          The lower court did not err\n\nin     denying    defendant’s     motion     for    acquittal   under\n\nFed.R.Crim.P. 29.\n\n            Affirmed.    1st Cir. Loc.
