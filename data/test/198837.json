Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Michael J. Lepizzera, Jr. on brief for appellant.\r\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C. Lockhart \r\nand Zechariah Chafee, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 25, 2000\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Jesus Martinez appeals from his sentence\r\non two grounds: 1) that the district court erred in finding, on\r\nthe basis of the government's evidence, that the substance\r\ninvolved in his offense was \"crack,\" as that term is defined by\r\nthe sentencing guidelines, and 2) that the district court erred\r\nin denying defendant's request for a downward departure,\r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  4A1.3, from the career-offender\r\nguideline sentencing range.\r\n          I. Proof that Contraband was \"Crack\"\r\n          To meet its burden of proving that the substance\r\ninvolved in Martinez' offense was \"crack,\" as that term is\r\ndefined by the sentencing guidelines, the government introduced\r\na toxicology report identifying the substance as cocaine base\r\nand testimony by a narcotics investigator with the Providence\r\nPolice Department's Special Investigations Bureau, identifying\r\nit as crack.  Martinez' argument on appeal that the\r\ngovernment's evidence was insufficient is foreclosed by this\r\ncourt's recent decisions rejecting similar challenges. See\r\nUnited States v.  Ferreras, 192 F.3d 5, 189 (1st Cir. 1999),\r\ncert. denied,    U.S.   , 120 S. Ct. 969 (2000); United States\r\nv. Martinez, 144 F.3d 189,190 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.\r\nRobinson, 144 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\n          II. Denial of Downward Departure\r\n          The government argues that the district court's\r\ndecision not to depart from the career-offender guideline\r\nsentencing range was a discretionary decision and, as such, is\r\nnot reviewable.  We agree.  See United States v. Rizzo, 121\r\nF.3d 794, 798 (1st Cir. 1997).  The district court expressly\r\nacknowledged its authority to \"invoke  4A1.3 to depart\r\ndownward from the career-offender category if it concludes that\r\nthe category inaccurately reflects the defendant's actual\r\ncriminal history within the meaning of  3553(b).\" United\r\nStates v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1165 (1st Cir. 1996).  Based\r\nupon a thorough review of the entire record, we conclude that\r\nthe denial of Martinez' departure request represented the\r\ndistrict court's discretionary decision that the career-\r\noffender category did not over-represent the seriousness of\r\nMartinez' criminal history.\r\n          Martinez' sentence is affirmed. See Loc. R. 27(c).\r\n",
