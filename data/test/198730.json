LEBRON-GUZMAN,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n                             HHS,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n        [Hon. Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Salvador Medina De La Cruz on brief for appellant.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza Toro,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Robert J. Triba, Chief Counsel, Social\r\nSecurity Administration, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 3, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.    Having reviewed the record with care,\r\nwe find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ's decision\r\nthat claimant did not show that prior to the expiration of his\r\ninsured status he had a medically determinable impairment or\r\ncombination of impairments which precluded the performance of\r\nhis past relevant work.  We apprehend no error in the ALJ's \r\nevaluation of conflicting medical opinions about the claimant's\r\nresidual functional capacity, see 20 C.F.R.  404.1527(e)(2),\r\n(f), nor in the determination that claimant had not produced\r\ncredible proof of the onset of a severe mental impairment prior\r\nto the expiration of his insured status.  See 20 C.F.R.  \r\n404.131(b).     \r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27(c).  \n",
