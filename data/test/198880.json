This procedural motley stems\n\nfrom    the   admittedly      awkward    efforts     of    plaintiff-appellant\n\nInstituto de Educacion Universal Corp. (the Institute) to secure\n\njudicial review of a final determination of the United States\n\nDepartment of Education (DOE) pursuant to the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act (the APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-706.                   In the pages that\n\nfollow, we summarize the strange series of events that led to\n\nthe district court's dismissal of the action and explain why, in\n\nthe interests of justice, we deem it appropriate to vacate the\n\norder of dismissal in part and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n              The Institute is a private, not-for-profit educational\n\ninstitution      based   in   Puerto    Rico.       At    the    times   pertinent\n\nhereto, it offered an array of post-secondary courses.                      Since\n\n1984, its recruitment efforts have depended heavily on the\n\navailability of federal student financial assistance programs\n\nestablished under the aegis of Title IV of the Higher Education\n\nAct of 1965, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1070-1099c-2, and administered by DOE.\n\n              In 1994, DOE's Inspector General undertook an audit\n\nthat resulted in three findings adverse to the Institute.                      The\n\nauditors concluded that the Institute had (1) overstated its\n\n\"clock    hours\"    of   instruction;         (2)   requisitioned        excessive\n\nstudent aid payments (and compounded the problem by using the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fill-gotten funds for unauthorized purposes); and (3) failed to\n\nrefund    grants      received       for    pupils    who     never   completed      the\n\nprograms to which the grants related.                      In due course, DOE took\n\na series of steps, some corrective and some punitive.                            Among\n\nother     things,      it     declared       the     Institute        ineligible      to\n\nparticipate      in     federal       student        aid     programs,    imposed      a\n\nsubstantial fine, and, after the final audit determination and\n\nprogram    review      report        were    issued,        instituted    collection\n\nproceedings to recover $1,284,900 in \"clock hours\" overcharges,\n\n$756,864 in \"excess\" cash receipts, and $655,554 in unpaid\n\nrefunds.\n\n            Asserting that DOE had acted arbitrarily, the Institute\n\npursued its administrative remedies.                       On January 24, 1997, an\n\nadministrative        law    judge     (ALJ)       reversed    the    \"clock    hours\"\n\nfinding but affirmed several other agency determinations (e.g.,\n\nthe   \"excess    cash\"       and     \"unpaid       refunds\"    findings,       and   the\n\ndecision to debar the Institute from participation in federal\n\nstudent aid programs).              Both sides appealed to the Secretary of\n\nEducation.       On October 28, 1997, the Secretary affirmed the\n\nALJ's decision in part but reinstated the \"clock hours\" finding\n\nand vacated the debarment decision.\n\n            At   this       point    in    time,    the     Institute    was   without\n\ncounsel.    Accordingly, Angel Ruiz Rivera (Ruiz), the Institute's\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\ffounder and president, purporting to act both on the Institute's\n\nbehalf and to his own behoof, filed a notice of appeal in this\n\ncourt, asking that we review the Secretary's determination.                       The\n\nnotice of appeal was docketed on March 6, 1998, well within the\n\nsix-year period allowed for seeking judicial review of the\n\nSecretary's final orders.             See 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a); see also\n\nSierra    Club    v.    Slater,    120    F.3d    623,    631    (6th   Cir.    1997)\n\n(holding that six-year limitation period contained in section\n\n2401(a) applies in respect to actions seeking judicial review of\n\nfinal agency determinations); Wind River Mining Corp. v. United\n\nStates,     946        F.2d    710,      713     (9th     Cir.    1991)       (same).\n\nUnfortunately, Ruiz chose the wrong forum; the district courts,\n\nrather than the courts of appeals, have original jurisdiction\n\nover   actions     for    judicial       review    of    the    Secretary's     final\n\ndeterminations.         See 5 U.S.C. § 703.             At any rate, the matter\n\nlay fallow until July 24, 1998, when we issued an order that\n\ninterpreted the notice of appeal as an attempt to \"seek review\n\n. . . of a final decision of the Department of Education,\" and\n\ntransferred it to the district court.                     See 28 U.S.C. § 1631\n\n(authorizing inter-court transfer of misfiled pleadings).\n\n            Because      the     transfer      process    was    plagued   by    lost\n\ndocuments    and       similar    glitches      (attributable      to   the    courts\n\ninvolved, not to the parties), the case was not docketed in the\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdistrict court until October 29, 1998.               Following yet another\n\nprocedural contretemps (the facts of which need not concern us),\n\nthe Institute, still unrepresented, filed a document over Ruiz's\n\nsignature entitled \"Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\"\n\nThe title was misleading; although not a model of clarity, this\n\nsubmission, fairly read, sought not only an injunction but also\n\njudicial review of the final decision of the Secretary.1                  Indeed,\n\nthe request for relief included a prayer that DOE be commanded\n\nto produce \"its entire administrative record [vis-à-vis the\n\nInstitute] in order for this appeal of the final agency decision\n\nto be able to commence.\"         (Emphasis supplied).\n\n            The response to this motion served further to confound\n\nan already muddled situation.        DOE complained that the Institute\n\nhad failed to file a complaint, and then shifted the focus to\n\none of the Institute's requests for injunctive relief.                      This\n\nrequest    stemmed   from   an   assertion    that    DOE   had    refused      to\n\nfurnish another educational institution that wished to lease a\n\nbuilding    from   the   Institute   with    an   assurance       that,    if   it\n\nconsummated the lease, it would not inherit the Institute's\n\n\n    1 By way of illustration, the submission stated in relevant\npart that \"[the Institute] is the appellant in this appeal of\nthe U.S.D.E. Secretary's final decision in the administrative\ncase of that agency against [the Institute].\" It then discussed\nthe \"clock hours\" finding and complained that the DOE was\n\"openly violating\" those provisions of the Administrative\nProcedure Act that afforded the Institute \"a right of review.\"\n\n                                     -6-\n\fTitle IV liabilities.     DOE self-servingly characterized the\n\nlease controversy as the \"real issue\" in the case and contended\n\nthat, because it recently had provided suitable assurances to\n\nthe prospective lessee, the issue was moot.     DOE then pounced\n\nupon an isolated use of the phrase \"in the alternative\" in the\n\nInstitute's papers — to be precise, the Institute had used the\n\nphrase once in a thirty-six page submission — and argued that\n\nthe court could ignore the remainder of the Institute's claims\n\n(including the request for judicial review of the Secretary's\n\nfinal decision) because those claims had been proffered only \"in\n\nthe alternative.\"\n\n         Eschewing oral argument, the district court issued a\n\nterse, three-page order in which it dismissed the action, rather\n\nthan merely denying the request for a temporary restraining\n\norder, on the ground that the relief sought by the Institute\n\nalready had been obtained.   See Instituto de Educacion Universal\n\nv. United States Dep't of Educ., No. 98-2225 (RLA), order at 2\n\n(D.P.R. Feb. 19, 1998).   In a footnote, the court explained that\n\n\"[s]ince the relief sought in the motion for injunctive relief\n\nhas been provided by defendants, the other claims, pled in the\n\nalternative by plaintiffs in their motion, are also rendered\n\nMOOT by the dismissal of this action for lack of controversy.\"\n\nId. at 3 n.4.\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f              Apparently    unaware   that    judgment   had   entered,    the\n\nInstitute filed a \"Motion Urging Jurisdiction\" on February 26,\n\n1999.        The contents of this filing clarified any lingering\n\nuncertainty and made it patent that the Institute's primary goal\n\nwas     to    obtain    judicial   review    of    the   Secretary's   final\n\ndetermination.2         The district court treated this motion as a\n\nmotion for reconsideration and denied it summarily.\n\n              This     appeal   ensued.      For   argument    purposes,    we\n\nconsolidated it with a second appeal (No. 99-1398) involving\n\nessentially the same cast of characters.                  We have elected,\n\nhowever, to decide the two appeals separately.                  This is the\n\nfirst of the two opinions.\n\nII.     ANALYSIS\n\n              As a threshold matter, we confront a jurisdictional\n\nbarrier.      Because the appellants' previous counsel had withdrawn\n\nfrom the case, only Ruiz (a non-lawyer) signed the notice of\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The motion stated, inter alia, that \"[i]t is our humble\nunderstanding that . . . this is the forum where the final\nagency decision . . . ought to be judicially reviewed,\" and\n\"begg[ed]\" the court to hold a conference \"for the coordination\nof this judicial review of the final agency decision.\"      The\nInstitute then inquired rhetorically: \"If this case is not the\nappeal of judicial review of the [Secretary's] final decision,\n. . . then what is it?\" It also asked: \"What do we have to do\nin order to have this honorable court perform its judicial\nreview of the final agency decision?\"\n\n                                      -8-\n\fappeal.      DOE   argues    that    this   circumstance    deprives   us    of\n\nappellate jurisdiction.\n\n             It is a close question as to whether a notice of appeal\n\nsigned by a corporate officer has force with respect to the\n\ncorporation.       On reflection, however, we answer that question\n\naffirmatively.       Corporations, unlike natural persons, can act\n\nonly through agents.         Moreover, appeal periods are notoriously\n\nbrief and, if we were to adopt the Secretary's view, a corporate\n\nlitigant whose counsel dies, becomes disabled, or withdraws at\n\nan inopportune time would be powerless to perfect an appeal.\n\nWhile   it    is   true   that   a   non-lawyer    may     not   represent    a\n\ncorporation in ongoing proceedings, see In re Las Colinas Dev.\n\nCorp., 585 F.2d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1978), we believe that a valid\n\ndistinction can be drawn between ongoing legal representation\n\nand the essentially ministerial action involved in the filing of\n\na notice of appeal.         Thus, we hold that a corporate officer may\n\nsign and file a notice of appeal on behalf of the corporation,\n\nas long as the corporation then promptly retains counsel to take\n\nup the cudgels and prosecute the appeal.                 Accord Bigelow v.\n\nBrady, 179 F.3d 1164, 1165-66 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"We fail to see\n\nany compelling reason to refuse to recognize a corporation's\n\nnotice of appeal, signed and filed by a corporate officer, so\n\nlong as a lawyer promptly thereafter enters a formal appearance\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fon      behalf     of     the      corporation     and   undertakes       the\n\nrepresentation.\"); K.M.A., Inc. v. GMAC, 652 F.2d 398, 399 (5th\n\nCir. 1981) (similar).           That condition is satisfied here.\n\n            Having cleared this jurisdictional hurdle, we review\n\nthe order of dismissal de novo.          See Viqueira v. First Bank, 140\n\nF.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).          The district court was, of course,\n\ncorrect in holding that the lease controversy had become moot.\n\nBut we think that the record adequately (though inartfully)\n\nraised the separate issue of judicial review of the Secretary's\n\nfinal decision.         See 5 U.S.C. § 702 (\"A person suffering legal\n\nwrong    because    of    agency    action,   or   adversely   affected    or\n\naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant\n\nstatute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\")              That issue\n\nis live and unresolved.          Thus, unless the order of dismissal can\n\nbe justified on some other ground, it cannot stand.\n\n            DOE proclaims that the Institute's failure to file a\n\ncomplaint qua complaint sounded the death knell for its suit.\n\nA civil action customarily is instituted by the filing of a\n\ncomplaint, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 3, and DOE asseverates that the\n\nmotion for temporary restraining order is the only document of\n\nrecord here that could have been construed as a complaint.            That\n\nbeing so, its thesis runs, the district court had a perfect\n\nright to treat the motion as the Institute's complaint and to\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fconstrue the phrase \"in the alternative\" as erasing any need to\n\nconsider    other       redress      (including         judicial      review     of\n\nadministrative     action)      once    the    Institute     had    achieved   the\n\nrelief requested in regard to the lease controversy.\n\n           We   are     troubled       by   this   rigid     approach     to   the\n\nconstruction of pleadings.           The rule that every civil action is\n\ninitiated by the filing of a complaint historically has been\n\nrelaxed    in   actions       that   originate     elsewhere       and   are   then\n\ntransferred to a federal district court (e.g., by removal from\n\na state court).     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c) (eliminating the need\n\nfor repleading unless the transferee court so orders).                    In such\n\na situation, the district court need not try to fashion a silk\n\npurse from a sow's ear by treating a paper that obviously was\n\nintended   to   serve     a    different      purpose   as   a    complaint,    but\n\ninstead may direct the filing of a complaint.                    We believe that,\n\ngiven the peculiar circumstances of this case, the district\n\ncourt should have charted such a course before terminating the\n\nentire action (say, by issuing a show-cause order or otherwise\n\nadvising the Institute that its case was at risk).                   Its failure\n\nto do so constituted an abuse of discretion.                 This is especially\n\ntrue because the principal purpose of the proceeding — judicial\n\nreview of the final administrative determination — was clearly\n\nstated both in the Institute's original notice of appeal and in\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\four    transfer      order.       These    statements,     combined     with    the\n\nrepeated references to judicial review that popped up like a\n\nrampant case of impetigo throughout the motion papers, should\n\nhave put the lower court on notice that the Institute's main\n\ngoal was to seek judicial review of the adverse administrative\n\ndecision.3\n\n              We add, moreover, that even assuming, contrary to our\n\nimpression, that the district court's decision to construe the\n\nmotion for temporary restraining order as the complaint was\n\nwithin its discretion, its decision to dismiss the entire action\n\nbased on a non-lawyer's isolated use of the phrase \"in the\n\nalternative\" was not.             The Supreme Court has long held that\n\ncomplaints drafted by non-lawyers are to be construed with some\n\nliberality.         See Hughes v.        Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9 (1980) (per\n\ncuriam);      Haines      v.   Kerner,    404    U.S.   519,   520   (1972)    (per\n\ncuriam); see also Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 54 n.5\n\n(1st       Cir.   1993)    (\"Given   [plaintiff's]       pro   se    status,    the\n\nreference by attachment, though perhaps technically deficient,\n\nwas sufficient to alert the court and the government to the\n\n\n\n       3\n     An additional reason for circumspection is that the\ndistrict court accepted (and ruled on) papers filed by Ruiz, a\nnon-lawyer, on behalf of the Institute. Had the district court\nfollowed standard practice and required the Institute to secure\ncounsel at that point, the interpretative difficulties that\nensued might well have been avoided.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fspecific basis of [plaintiff's] claims.\").                    This tenet rests on\n\nthe sober reality that, \"[p]resumably unskilled in the law, the\n\npro se litigant is far more prone to making errors in pleading\n\nthan       the    person   who    benefits       from   the    representation   of\n\ncounsel.\"         Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000)\n\n(en    banc)      (citation      and    internal   quotation     marks   omitted).\n\nAccordingly, the lower court should not have dismissed this\n\naction, on essentially technical grounds, without affording the\n\nInstitute some opportunity to replead.4                       See 5 Charles Alan\n\nWright & Arthur R. Miller,                Federal Practice and Procedure §\n\n1217, at 176-77 (2d ed. 1990).\n\n                 If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\naforementioned        motion      for    reconsideration       demonstrated   with\n\nunmistakable clarity the Institute's desire to secure judicial\n\nreview of the Secretary's final determination, regardless of\n\nwhether the lease controversy was resolved.                    See supra note 2.\n\nAlthough trial courts have substantial discretion in dealing\n\n\n\n       4\n      We add two caveats.    First, we note that 28 U.S.C. §\n1915(e)(2)(B) does not apply here. Second, we do not mean to\nintimate that pro se parties are excused from compliance with\nprocedural rules (they are not, see Eagle Eye Fishing Corp. v.\nUnited States Dep't of Commerce, 20 F.3d 503, 506 (1st Cir.\n1994)), nor to require district courts invariably to notify pro\nse parties that their cases are open to dismissal. We hold only\nthat when, as now, a pleading drafted by a pro se party appears\nnon-frivolous on its face, the court ought not automatically to\nresolve material ambiguities against the pleader.\n\n                                          -13-\n\fwith   motions    for       reconsideration,      that    discretion      is   not\n\nunbounded.     See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925\n\nF.2d 518, 528 (1st Cir. 1991).               Thus, a refusal to reconsider\n\nmay be overturned if the record makes manifest \"that the court\n\nbelow committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it\n\nreached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\"                   Id. at 528-\n\n29.\n\n          So     it    is    here.     The     district    court,   apparently\n\ninfluenced both by the ambiguity contained in the motion for a\n\ntemporary restraining order and by DOE's self-serving argument,\n\nerroneously      concluded      that     the     abatement     of   the    lease\n\ncontroversy    accorded       the    Institute    all    the   relief   that   it\n\nsought.   The motion for reconsideration, however, made it clear\n\nthat the court had misinterpreted an admittedly prolix, hard-to-\n\nread pro se pleading.         Under those circumstances, the interests\n\nof justice required that the court reconsider and modify its\n\nearlier order.        Cf. id. at 529 (holding that, when fee-seekers'\n\nsubmission on motion for reconsideration corrected deficiencies\n\nin original fee application, \"[t]here was insufficient reason to\n\ndeny reconsideration merely because the movants had erred the\n\nfirst time around\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.      For the reasons stated, we\n\naffirm the district court's order with respect to the denial of\n\nthe motion for a temporary restraining order, but vacate it\n\ninsofar as it purposes to dismiss the entire action.     The matter\n\nis remanded to the district court with instructions that the\n\nInstitute be given an opportunity to file a complaint seeking\n\njudicial   review   of   the   Secretary's   final   administrative\n\ndetermination.\n\n\n\n           Affirmed in part and vacated in part.

In the pages that follow, we summarize the strange series of events that led to the district court's dismissal of the action and explain why, in the interests of justice, we deem it appropriate to vacate the order of dismissal in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Institute is a private, not-for-profit educational institution based in Puerto Rico. At the times pertinent hereto, it offered an array of post-secondary courses. Since 1984, its recruitment efforts have depended heavily on the availability of federal student financial assistance programs established under the aegis of Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C.  1070-1099c-2, and administered by DOE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, DOE's Inspector General undertook an audit that resulted in three findings adverse to the Institute. The auditors concluded that the Institute had (1) overstated its \"clock hours\" of instruction; (2) requisitioned excessive student aid payments (and compounded the problem by using the ill-gotten funds for unauthorized purposes); and (3) failed to refund grants received for pupils who never completed the programs to which the grants related. In due course, DOE took a series of steps, some corrective and some punitive. Among other things, it declared the Institute ineligible to participate in federal student aid programs, imposed a substantial fine, and, after the final audit determination and program review report were issued, instituted collection proceedings to recover $1,284,900 in \"clock hours\" overcharges, $756,864 in \"excess\" cash receipts, and $655,554 in unpaid refunds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asserting that DOE had acted arbitrarily, the Institute pursued its administrative remedies. On January 24, 1997, an administrative law judge (ALJ) reversed the \"clock hours\" finding but affirmed several other agency determinations (e.g., the \"excess cash\" and \"unpaid refunds\" findings, and the decision to debar the Institute from participation in federal student aid programs). Both sides appealed to the Secretary of Education. On October 28, 1997, the Secretary affirmed the ALJ's decision in part but reinstated the \"clock hours\" finding and vacated the debarment decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point in time, the Institute was without counsel. Accordingly, Angel Ruiz Rivera (Ruiz), the Institute's founder and president, purporting to act both on the Institute's behalf and to his own behoof, filed a notice of appeal in this court, asking that we review the Secretary's determination. The notice of appeal was docketed on March 6, 1998, well within the six-year period allowed for seeking judicial review of the Secretary's final orders. See 28 U.S.C.  2401(a); see also Sierra Club v. Slater, 120 F.3d 623, 631 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding that six-year limitation period contained in section 2401(a) applies in respect to actions seeking judicial review of final agency determinations); Wind River Mining Corp. v. United States, 946 F.2d 710, 713 (9th Cir. 1991) (same). Unfortunately, Ruiz chose the wrong forum; the district courts, rather than the courts of appeals, have original jurisdiction over actions for judicial review of the Secretary's final determinations. See 5 U.S.C.  703. At any rate, the matter lay fallow until July 24, 1998, when we issued an order that interpreted the notice of appeal as an attempt to \"seek review . . . of a final decision of the Department of Education,\" and transferred it to the district court. See 28 U.S.C.  1631 (authorizing inter-court transfer of misfiled pleadings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the transfer process was plagued by lost documents and similar glitches (attributable to the courts involved, not to the parties), the case was not docketed in the district court until October 29, 1998. Following yet another procedural contretemps (the facts of which need not concern us), the Institute, still unrepresented, filed a document over Ruiz's signature entitled \"Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\" The title was misleading; although not a model of clarity, this submission, fairly read, sought not only an injunction but also judicial review of the final decision of the Secretary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Indeed, the request for relief included a prayer that DOE be commanded to produce \"its entire administrative record [vis--vis the Institute] in order for this appeal of the final agency decision to be able to commence.\" (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The response to this motion served further to confound an already muddled situation. DOE complained that the Institute had failed to file a complaint, and then shifted the focus to one of the Institute's requests for injunctive relief. This request stemmed from an assertion that DOE had refused to furnish another educational institution that wished to lease a building from the Institute with an assurance that, if it consummated the lease, it would not inherit the Institute's Title IV liabilities. DOE self-servingly characterized the lease controversy as the \"real issue\" in the case and contended that, because it recently had provided suitable assurances to the prospective lessee, the issue was moot. DOE then pounced upon an isolated use of the phrase \"in the alternative\" in the Institute's papers -- to be precise, the Institute had used the phrase once in a thirty-six page submission -- and argued that the court could ignore the remainder of the Institute's claims (including the request for judicial review of the Secretary's final decision) because those claims had been proffered only \"in the alternative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eschewing oral argument, the district court issued a terse, three-page order in which it dismissed the action, rather than merely denying the request for a temporary restraining order, on the ground that the relief sought by the Institute already had been obtained. See Instituto de Educacion Universal v. United States Dep't of Educ., No. 98-2225 (RLA), order at 2 (D.P.R. Feb. 19, 1998). In a footnote, the court explained that \"[s]ince the relief sought in the motion for injunctive relief has been provided by defendants, the other claims, pled in the alternative by plaintiffs in their motion, are also rendered MOOT by the dismissal of this action for lack of controversy.\" Id. at 3 n.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently unaware that judgment had entered, the Institute filed a \"Motion Urging Jurisdiction\" on February 26, 1999. The contents of this filing clarified any lingering uncertainty and made it patent that the Institute's primary goal was to obtain judicial review of the Secretary's final determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court treated this motion as a motion for reconsideration and denied it summarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal ensued. For argument purposes, we consolidated it with a second appeal (No. 99-1398) involving essentially the same cast of characters. We have elected, however, to decide the two appeals separately. This is the first of the two opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, we confront a jurisdictional barrier. Because the appellants' previous counsel had withdrawn from the case, only Ruiz (a non-lawyer) signed the notice of appeal. DOE argues that this circumstance deprives us of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a close question as to whether a notice of appeal signed by a corporate officer has force with respect to the corporation. On reflection, however, we answer that question affirmatively. Corporations, unlike natural persons, can act only through agents. Moreover, appeal periods are notoriously brief and, if we were to adopt the Secretary's view, a corporate litigant whose counsel dies, becomes disabled, or withdraws at an inopportune time would be powerless to perfect an appeal. While it is true that a non-lawyer may not represent a corporation in ongoing proceedings, see In re Las Colinas Dev. Corp., 585 F.2d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1978), we believe that a valid distinction can be drawn between ongoing legal representation and the essentially ministerial action involved in the filing of a notice of appeal. Thus, we hold that a corporate officer may sign and file a notice of appeal on behalf of the corporation, as long as the corporation then promptly retains counsel to take up the cudgels and prosecute the appeal. Accord Bigelow v. Brady, 179 F.3d 1164, 1165-66 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"We fail to see any compelling reason to refuse to recognize a corporation's notice of appeal, signed and filed by a corporate officer, so long as a lawyer promptly thereafter enters a formal appearance on behalf of the corporation and undertakes the representation.\"); K.M.A., Inc. v. GMAC, 652 F.2d 398, 399 (5th Cir. 1981) (similar). That condition is satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having cleared this jurisdictional hurdle, we review the order of dismissal de novo. See Viqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998). The district court was, of course, correct in holding that the lease controversy had become moot. But we think that the record adequately (though inartfully) raised the separate issue of judicial review of the Secretary's final decision. See 5 U.S.C.  702 (\"A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\") That issue is live and unresolved. Thus, unless the order of dismissal can be justified on some other ground, it cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DOE proclaims that the Institute's failure to file a complaint qua complaint sounded the death knell for its suit. A civil action customarily is instituted by the filing of a complaint, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 3, and DOE asseverates that the motion for temporary restraining order is the only document of record here that could have been construed as a complaint. That being so, its thesis runs, the district court had a perfect right to treat the motion as the Institute's complaint and to construe the phrase \"in the alternative\" as erasing any need to consider other redress (including judicial review of administrative action) once the Institute had achieved the relief requested in regard to the lease controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are troubled by this rigid approach to the construction of pleadings. The rule that every civil action is initiated by the filing of a complaint historically has been relaxed in actions that originate elsewhere and are then transferred to a federal district court (e.g., by removal from a state court). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c) (eliminating the need for repleading unless the transferee court so orders). In such a situation, the district court need not try to fashion a silk purse from a sow's ear by treating a paper that obviously was intended to serve a different purpose as a complaint, but instead may direct the filing of a complaint. We believe that, given the peculiar circumstances of this case, the district court should have charted such a course before terminating the entire action (say, by issuing a show-cause order or otherwise advising the Institute that its case was at risk). Its failure to do so constituted an abuse of discretion. This is especially true because the principal purpose of the proceeding -- judicial review of the final administrative determination -- was clearly stated both in the Institute's original notice of appeal and in our transfer order. These statements, combined with the repeated references to judicial review that popped up like a rampant case of impetigo throughout the motion papers, should have put the lower court on notice that the Institute's main goal was to seek judicial review of the adverse administrative decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that even assuming, contrary to our impression, that the district court's decision to construe the motion for temporary restraining order as the complaint was within its discretion, its decision to dismiss the entire action based on a non-lawyer's isolated use of the phrase \"in the alternative\" was not. The Supreme Court has long held that complaints drafted by non-lawyers are to be construed with some liberality. See Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9 (1980) (per curiam); Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972) (per curiam); see also Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 54 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Given [plaintiff's] pro se status, the reference by attachment, though perhaps technically deficient, was sufficient to alert the court and the government to the specific basis of [plaintiff's] claims.\"). This tenet rests on the sober reality that, \"[p]resumably unskilled in the law, the pro se litigant is far more prone to making errors in pleading than the person who benefits from the representation of counsel.\" Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the lower court should not have dismissed this action, on essentially technical grounds, without affording the Institute some opportunity to replead.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See 5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure  1217, at 176-77 (2d ed. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed -- and we doubt that it is -- the aforementioned motion for reconsideration demonstrated with unmistakable clarity the Institute's desire to secure judicial review of the Secretary's final determination, regardless of whether the lease controversy was resolved. See supra note 2. Although trial courts have substantial discretion in dealing with motions for reconsideration, that discretion is not unbounded. See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 528 (1st Cir. 1991). Thus, a refusal to reconsider may be overturned if the record makes manifest \"that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\" Id. at 528-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here. The district court, apparently influenced both by the ambiguity contained in the motion for a temporary restraining order and by DOE's self-serving argument, erroneously concluded that the abatement of the lease controversy accorded the Institute all the relief that it sought. The motion for reconsideration, however, made it clear that the court had misinterpreted an admittedly prolix, hard-to-read pro se pleading. Under those circumstances, the interests of justice required that the court reconsider and modify its earlier order. Cf. id. at 529 (holding that, when fee-seekers' submission on motion for reconsideration corrected deficiencies in original fee application, \"[t]here was insufficient reason to deny reconsideration merely because the movants had erred the first time around\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's order with respect to the denial of the motion for a temporary restraining order, but vacate it insofar as it purposes to dismiss the entire action. The matter is remanded to the district court with instructions that the Institute be given an opportunity to file a complaint seeking judicial review of the Secretary's final administrative determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and vacated in part.

Had the district court followed standard practice and required the Institute to secure counsel at that point, the interpretative difficulties that ensued might well have been avoided.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We add two caveats. First, we note that 28 U.S.C.  1915(e)(2)(B) does not apply here. Second, we do not mean to intimate that pro se parties are excused from compliance with procedural rules (they are not, see Eagle Eye Fishing Corp. v. United States Dep't of Commerce, 20 F.3d 503, 506 (1st Cir. 1994)), nor to require district courts invariably to notify pro se parties that their cases are open to dismissal. We hold only that when, as now, a pleading drafted by a pro se party appears non-frivolous on its face, the court ought not automatically to resolve material ambiguities against the pleader.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Slater, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744516\"><a href=\"/opinion/744516/sierra-club-citizens-for-buckeye-basin-parks-inc-friends-of-mulberry-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span>, 631 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding that six-year limitation period contained in section 2401(a) applies in respect to actions seeking judicial review of final agency determinations); Wind River Mining Corp. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569377\"><a href=\"/opinion/569377/wind-river-mining-corporation-v-united-states-of-america-manuel-lujan-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 713 (9th Cir. 1991) (same). Unfortunately, Ruiz chose the wrong forum; the district courts, rather than the courts of appeals, have original jurisdiction over actions for judicial review of the Secretary's final determinations. See 5 U.S.C.  703. At any rate, the matter lay fallow until July 24, 1998, when we issued an order that interpreted the notice of appeal as an attempt to \"seek review . . . of a final decision of the Department of Education,\" and transferred it to the district court. See 28 U.S.C.  1631 (authorizing inter-court transfer of misfiled pleadings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the transfer process was plagued by lost documents and similar glitches (attributable to the courts involved, not to the parties), the case was not docketed in the district court until October 29, 1998. Following yet another procedural contretemps (the facts of which need not concern us), the Institute, still unrepresented, filed a document over Ruiz's signature entitled \"Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.\" The title was misleading; although not a model of clarity, this submission, fairly read, sought not only an injunction but also judicial review of the final decision of the Secretary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Indeed, the request for relief included a prayer that DOE be commanded to produce \"its entire administrative record [vis--vis the Institute] in order for this appeal of the final agency decision to be able to commence.\" (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The response to this motion served further to confound an already muddled situation. DOE complained that the Institute had failed to file a complaint, and then shifted the focus to one of the Institute's requests for injunctive relief. This request stemmed from an assertion that DOE had refused to furnish another educational institution that wished to lease a building from the Institute with an assurance that, if it consummated the lease, it would not inherit the Institute's Title IV liabilities. DOE self-servingly characterized the lease controversy as the \"real issue\" in the case and contended that, because it recently had provided suitable assurances to the prospective lessee, the issue was moot. DOE then pounced upon an isolated use of the phrase \"in the alternative\" in the Institute's papers -- to be precise, the Institute had used the phrase once in a thirty-six page submission -- and argued that the court could ignore the remainder of the Institute's claims (including the request for judicial review of the Secretary's final decision) because those claims had been proffered only \"in the alternative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eschewing oral argument, the district court issued a terse, three-page order in which it dismissed the action, rather than merely denying the request for a temporary restraining order, on the ground that the relief sought by the Institute already had been obtained. See Instituto de Educacion Universal v. United States Dep't of Educ., No. 98-2225 (RLA), order at 2 (D.P.R. Feb. 19, 1998). In a footnote, the court explained that \"[s]ince the relief sought in the motion for injunctive relief has been provided by defendants, the other claims, pled in the alternative by plaintiffs in their motion, are also rendered MOOT by the dismissal of this action for lack of controversy.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569377\"><a href=\"/opinion/569377/wind-river-mining-corporation-v-united-states-of-america-manuel-lujan-jr/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 3 </a></span>n.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently unaware that judgment had entered, the Institute filed a \"Motion Urging Jurisdiction\" on February 26, 1999. The contents of this filing clarified any lingering uncertainty and made it patent that the Institute's primary goal was to obtain judicial review of the Secretary's final determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court treated this motion as a motion for reconsideration and denied it summarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal ensued. For argument purposes, we consolidated it with a second appeal (No. 99-1398) involving essentially the same cast of characters. We have elected, however, to decide the two appeals separately. This is the first of the two opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, we confront a jurisdictional barrier. Because the appellants' previous counsel had withdrawn from the case, only Ruiz (a non-lawyer) signed the notice of appeal. DOE argues that this circumstance deprives us of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a close question as to whether a notice of appeal signed by a corporate officer has force with respect to the corporation. On reflection, however, we answer that question affirmatively. Corporations, unlike natural persons, can act only through agents. Moreover, appeal periods are notoriously brief and, if we were to adopt the Secretary's view, a corporate litigant whose counsel dies, becomes disabled, or withdraws at an inopportune time would be powerless to perfect an appeal. While it is true that a non-lawyer may not represent a corporation in ongoing proceedings, see In re Las Colinas Dev. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360178\"><a href=\"/opinion/360178/bankr-l-rep-p-67002-in-re-las-colinas-development-corporation-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1978), we believe that a valid distinction can be drawn between ongoing legal representation and the essentially ministerial action involved in the filing of a notice of appeal. Thus, we hold that a corporate officer may sign and file a notice of appeal on behalf of the corporation, as long as the corporation then promptly retains counsel to take up the cudgels and prosecute the appeal. Accord Bigelow v. Brady, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></span>, 1165-66 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"We fail to see any compelling reason to refuse to recognize a corporation's notice of appeal, signed and filed by a corporate officer, so long as a lawyer promptly thereafter enters a formal appearance on behalf of the corporation and undertakes the representation.\"); K.M.A., Inc. v. GMAC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391859\"><a href=\"/opinion/391859/in-re-k-m-a-inc-bankrupt-k-m-a-inc-v-general-motors-acceptance/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 399 (5th Cir. 1981) (similar). That condition is satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having cleared this jurisdictional hurdle, we review the order of dismissal de novo. See Viqueira v. First Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197886\"><a href=\"/opinion/197886/jamie-viqueira-v-first-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1998). The district court was, of course, correct in holding that the lease controversy had become moot. But we think that the record adequately (though inartfully) raised the separate issue of judicial review of the Secretary's final decision. See 5 U.S.C.  702 (\"A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\") That issue is live and unresolved. Thus, unless the order of dismissal can be justified on some other ground, it cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DOE proclaims that the Institute's failure to file a complaint qua complaint sounded the death knell for its suit. A civil action customarily is instituted by the filing of a complaint, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 3, and DOE asseverates that the motion for temporary restraining order is the only document of record here that could have been construed as a complaint. That being so, its thesis runs, the district court had a perfect right to treat the motion as the Institute's complaint and to construe the phrase \"in the alternative\" as erasing any need to consider other redress (including judicial review of administrative action) once the Institute had achieved the relief requested in regard to the lease controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are troubled by this rigid approach to the construction of pleadings. The rule that every civil action is initiated by the filing of a complaint historically has been relaxed in actions that originate elsewhere and are then transferred to a federal district court (e.g., by removal from a state court). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c) (eliminating the need for repleading unless the transferee court so orders). In such a situation, the district court need not try to fashion a silk purse from a sow's ear by treating a paper that obviously was intended to serve a different purpose as a complaint, but instead may direct the filing of a complaint. We believe that, given the peculiar circumstances of this case, the district court should have charted such a course before terminating the entire action (say, by issuing a show-cause order or otherwise advising the Institute that its case was at risk). Its failure to do so constituted an abuse of discretion. This is especially true because the principal purpose of the proceeding -- judicial review of the final administrative determination -- was clearly stated both in the Institute's original notice of appeal and in our transfer order. These statements, combined with the repeated references to judicial review that popped up like a rampant case of impetigo throughout the motion papers, should have put the lower court on notice that the Institute's main goal was to seek judicial review of the adverse administrative decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that even assuming, contrary to our impression, that the district court's decision to construe the motion for temporary restraining order as the complaint was within its discretion, its decision to dismiss the entire action based on a non-lawyer's isolated use of the phrase \"in the alternative\" was not. The Supreme Court has long held that complaints drafted by non-lawyers are to be construed with some liberality. See Hughes v. Rowe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110352\"><a href=\"/opinion/110352/hughes-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 9 (1980) (per curiam); Haines v.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601483\"><a href=\"/opinion/601483/charles-d-lema-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 54 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Given [plaintiff's] pro se status, the reference by attachment, though perhaps technically deficient, was sufficient to alert the court and the government to the specific basis of [plaintiff's] claims.\"). This tenet rests on the sober reality that, \"[p]resumably unskilled in the law, the pro se litigant is far more prone to making errors in pleading than the person who benefits from the representation of counsel.\" Lopez v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767677\"><a href=\"/opinion/767677/max-lopez-jr-v-ga-smith-warden-larry-loo-chief-medical-officer-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span>, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the lower court should not have dismissed this action, on essentially technical grounds, without affording the Institute some opportunity to replead.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See 5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure  1217, at 176-77 (2d ed. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed -- and we doubt that it is -- the aforementioned motion for reconsideration demonstrated with unmistakable clarity the Institute's desire to secure judicial review of the Secretary's final determination, regardless of whether the lease controversy was resolved. See supra note 2. Although trial courts have substantial discretion in dealing with motions for reconsideration, that discretion is not unbounded. See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555766\"><a href=\"/opinion/555766/william-weinberger-v-great-northern-nekoosa-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 528 (1st Cir. 1991). Thus, a refusal to reconsider may be overturned if the record makes manifest \"that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555766\"><a href=\"/opinion/555766/william-weinberger-v-great-northern-nekoosa-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 528-29.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here. The district court, apparently influenced both by the ambiguity contained in the motion for a temporary restraining order and by DOE's self-serving argument, erroneously concluded that the abatement of the lease controversy accorded the Institute all the relief that it sought. The motion for reconsideration, however, made it clear that the court had misinterpreted an admittedly prolix, hard-to-read pro se pleading. Under those circumstances, the interests of justice required that the court reconsider and modify its earlier order. Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555766\"><a href=\"/opinion/555766/william-weinberger-v-great-northern-nekoosa-corp/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 529 </a></span>(holding that, when fee-seekers' submission on motion for reconsideration corrected deficiencies in original fee application, \"[t]here was insufficient reason to deny reconsideration merely because the movants had erred the first time around\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's order with respect to the denial of the motion for a temporary restraining order, but vacate it insofar as it purposes to dismiss the entire action. The matter is remanded to the district court with instructions that the Institute be given an opportunity to file a complaint seeking judicial review of the Secretary's final administrative determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and vacated in part. No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By way of illustration, the submission stated in relevant part that \"[the Institute] is the appellant in this appeal of the U.S.D.E. Secretary's final decision in the administrative case of that agency against [the Institute].\" It then discussed the \"clock hours\" finding and complained that the DOE was \"openly violating\" those provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act that afforded the Institute \"a right of review.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The motion stated, inter alia, that \"[i]t is our humble understanding that . . . this is the forum where the final agency decision . . . ought to be judicially reviewed,\" and \"begg[ed]\" the court to hold a conference \"for the coordination of this judicial review of the final agency decision.\" The Institute then inquired rhetorically: \"If this case is not the appeal of judicial review of the [Secretary's] final decision, . . . then what is it?\" It also asked: \"What do we have to do in order to have this honorable court perform its judicial review of the final agency decision?\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> An additional reason for circumspection is that the district court accepted (and ruled on) papers filed by Ruiz, a non-lawyer, on behalf of the Institute. Had the district court followed standard practice and required the Institute to secure counsel at that point, the interpretative difficulties that ensued might well have been avoided.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We add two caveats. First, we note that 28 U.S.C.  1915(e)(2)(B) does not apply here. Second, we do not mean to intimate that pro se parties are excused from compliance with procedural rules (they are not, see Eagle Eye Fishing Corp. v. United States Dep't of Commerce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666854\"><a href=\"/opinion/666854/eagle-eye-fishing-corporation-v-united-states-department-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 506 (1st Cir. 1994)), nor to require district courts invariably to notify pro se parties that their cases are open to dismissal. We hold only that when, as now, a pleading drafted by a pro se party appears non-frivolous on its face, the court ought not automatically to resolve material ambiguities against the pleader.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
