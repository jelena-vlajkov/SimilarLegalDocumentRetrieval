Appellants Angel Luis Torres and\n\nAgro-Industrias de Comerío sued E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company for\n\nproducing a fungicide that, due to contamination or other defect,\n\nallegedly destroyed appellants' papaya crops in 1988. DuPont moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the basis that the suit was barred both by judicial\n\nestoppel and the applicable statute of limitations. The district court\n\ngranted the judicial estoppel motion only as to Agro-Industrias de\n\nComerío but granted summary judgment as to both appellants on the\n\nstatute of limitations ground. See Torres v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &\n\nCo., No. 94-2632 (D.P.R. June 22, 1998) (\"Torres I\"); Torres v. E.I.\n\nDuPont de Nemours & Co., No. 94-2632 (D.P.R. Nov. 30, 1998) (\"Torres\n\nII\"). The latter ruling was premised on the court's conclusion that\n\nappellants had the requisite legal knowledge of their injury and its\n\ncause in 1988, four years prior to the initiation of this suit. We see\n\nno error in this determination. Accordingly, we affirm the entry of\n\nsummary judgment.1\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\nI.   Factual Background\n\n          In the 1980s, appellants Angel Luis Torres and Agro-\n\nIndustrias de Comerío were engaged in the cultivation, planting, and\n\nsale of papayas in Puerto Rico. They had separate businesses and\n\n1 Our conclusion that this case is barred by the statute of limitations\nis dispositive. Consequently, we decline to address the district\ncourt's ruling regarding judicial estoppel.\n\n                                 -4-\n\ffinances, but they shared practices, employees, customers, and tracts\n\nof land. Appellant Torres was the president of the Board of Directors\n\nof Agro-Industrias; while his brother, Armando Torres, was the\n\ncorporation's general manager and sole shareholder.\n\n          Beginning in 1988, appellants purchased Benlate 50 DF, a\n\nfungicide manufactured and sold by appellee E.I. DuPont de Nemours &\n\nCompany, for application to their papaya crops.          According to\n\nappellants, the Benlate was \"either contaminated with one or more\n\nherbicides, incompatible fungicides or other chemicals toxic to plants,\n\nor was defectively designed, or both.\" Appellants allege that as a\n\nresult of this contamination or defect, the Benlate stunted the tree\n\nand fruit growth of their papaya plants, caused abnormal root growth,\n\nchlorosis, and ultimately, the death of the papaya trees.\n\n          In his deposition, Armando Torres outlined the time frame of\n\nappellants' injury, stating that during the summer of 1988 the papaya\n\ncrops of Agro-Industrias and Torres exhibited symptoms of a disease\n\nonce fumigated with Benlate:\n\n          After the trip [in April of 1988], . . . I was\n          grateful to DuPont who had taken me on a trip to\n          see agriculture. I asked my brother Angel Luis\n          [Torres] what was the product that DuPont\n          distributed in Puerto Rico because I didn't know\n          and he told me that it was Benlate. It was the\n          main one, it was a panacea, the best thing in the\n          world and logically, well, I fumigated the entire\n          plantation with Benlate.\n          The symptoms began during the one (1) week period\n          but this extended more, it was a little bit\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          slower process.       During the period of\n          approximately one (1) month after the moment we\n          already became aware that something more deep\n          rooted was failing was when we began to\n          . . . [c]all agronomists to investigate what was\n          happening and high ranking officials, especially\n          [Eugenio Toro,] the person who gave us\n          orientation at the level of Puerto Rico . . . .\n          All of the agronomists from the area, from the\n          Agricultural Extension Service, all of them\n          visited [appellants'] farm . . . .\n\n          Deposition    testimony   from   several   other   witnesses\n\ncorroborated Armando Torres's account, each indicating that damage to\n\nappellants' crops was apparent following the 1988 application of\n\nBenlate. Ventura Cruz-Sánchez, an employee who worked with Armando\n\nTorres from 1986 to 1989, stated in his deposition that once \"we\n\nsprayed the poison [onto the papaya crops], the following day we had to\n\npull a machete and start cutting them up.\" Similarly, Angel Rivera-\n\nRodríguez, appellants' chemicals supplier, testified that he visited\n\nappellants' papaya farms both before and after the application of\n\nBenlate sometime in 1987 or 1988. Rivera described appellants' crops\n\nprior to the application of Benlate as \"[a] robust seeding area with\n\nlots of fruits and pretty.\"     However, \"[a]fter the Benlate, the\n\nplantation looked unnourished, yellowish, the fruit falling to the\n\nground without reaching ripeness.\" Rivera further testified that\n\nArmando Torres told him that after the papayas had been sprayed with\n\nBenlate \"they had become unwell.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          Similarly, Eugenio Toro, a tropical fruit specialist employed\n\nby the Agricultural Extension Service, testified that by late 1988 or\n\nearly 1989, he considered the possibility that the damage to\n\nappellants' papaya crops was being caused by something physiological,\n\n\"possibl[y] an intoxication with something.\" Further, by that time he\n\nhad rejected disease, lack-of-nutrient problems, or excessive rainfall\n\nas potential causes. He recommended that appellants harvest the fruit\n\nthat was available and abandon the papaya fields.\n\n          The testimony presented to the district court was not,\n\nhowever, entirely unequivocal.         Ramón Luis Martínez-Zayas, an\n\nAgricultural Agent for the Extension Service who visited appellants'\n\nfarm, testified that the cause of the damage to the papaya plants was\n\nnot immediately clear. He stated that sometime after 1987, discovering\n\nthe cause of the damage to the papaya crops \"really sort of became a\n\nhuge jigsaw puzzle because it wasn't only [Angel] Luis [Torres], it was\n\nall of the papaya producers and we started making some conjectures as\n\nto what could be happening but we really didn't have anything clear as\n\nto what was happening as such.\"\n\n          Despite the initial uncertainty, David Berríos, an Area\n\nAgronomist for Puerto Rico, testified that he became aware of\n\ncomplaints from farmers in appellants' region relating to the use of\n\nBenlate in the late 1980s and that at least one farmer in the region\n\nwas taking steps to make a claim against DuPont in 1988 or 1989. More\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fimportant, one of appellants' clients, Miguel A. Colón-Capeles,\n\ntestified at his deposition that Armando Torres requested \"a\n\ncertification\" of the papayas he had purchased from appellants in 1986,\n\n1987, and 1988. According to Colón-Capeles, Armando Torres stated that\n\nhe needed the certification \"because they had a claim against the\n\nDuPont company concerning a chemical which had apparently affected the\n\nsowing and the farms and the lands in which they had their 'papaya'\n\nfarms.\" He reiterated that Armando Torres \"requested that he needed a\n\ncertification what he had sold to me during the year so as to be able\n\nto support his case.\"\n\n          In response to discovery, appellants produced a similar proof\n\nof papaya purchases from a second customer, Fermín Rivera Torres. The\n\nJanuary 10, 1990 document certified the amount of papaya purchased from\n\nAngel Luis Torres from 1984 to 1988.\n\n          Due to the alleged destruction of their crops by Benlate,\n\nappellants were no longer cultivating papaya as of 1989.\n\nII.   Procedural History\n\n          On September 23, 1992, appellants sent a demand letter to\n\nDuPont claiming damages in the amount of $4,000,000. Two years later,\n\non October 21, 1994, Wilson Torres, Armando Torres, and Angel Luis\n\nTorres, doing business as Agro-Industrias de Comerío, sued E.I. DuPont\n\nde Nemours & Company in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico. DuPont removed the case to the United States District\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fCourt for the District of Puerto Rico pursuant to the diversity of\n\ncitizenship statute. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). Following removal,\n\nappellants amended the complaint, dropping Armando and Wilson Torres\n\nand adding Agro-Industrias de Comerío as a named plaintiff. During the\n\npendency of this action, Angel Luis Torres died and his cause of action\n\nwas inherited by his heirs.\n\n            On March 28, 1998, DuPont filed its first motion for summary\n\njudgment.    In that motion, DuPont raised two defenses:      judicial\n\nestoppel and the statute of limitations. DuPont asserted that (1)\n\nappellants had failed to disclose their claims in previous bankruptcy\n\nactions, and (2) the claims of Agro-Industrias, filed in June of 1997,\n\nwere time-barred. The district court granted DuPont's motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the judicial estoppel ground as to Agro-Industrias\n\nbut denied the motion as to appellant Torres. See Torres I , slip op.\n\nat 9-15. The court reasoned that Agro-Industrias was aware of its\n\npotential claim against DuPont prior to filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\n\npetition in 1992, failed to make the required disclosure, and\n\nthereafter obtained relief from the bankruptcy court as a result of\n\nthis misrepresentation. See id. at 11-15. In contrast, the court\n\ndetermined that Torres had failed to comply with the statutory\n\ndisclosure requirements related to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy\n\nproceeding, but, unlike Agro-Industrias, he did not receive relief from\n\nthe bankruptcy court.     See id.    at 9-11.   Accordingly, appellant\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fTorres's claims were not subject to judicial estoppel as a matter of\n\nlaw.   See id.\n\n          On June 19, 1998, DuPont filed a second motion for summary\n\njudgment, this time alleging that the claims raised by Torres were\n\nbarred by the statute of limitations. DuPont argued that Torres did\n\nnot initiate his claim until more than a year after he possessed actual\n\nor deemed knowledge of his injury and its cause. On June 26, 1998,\n\nDuPont raised the identical statute of limitations argument against\n\nAgro-Industrias.\n\n          In their opposition to the June 19th motion, appellants\n\nconceded that they knew that an injury had occurred more than a year\n\nprior to the date they filed their claim. Appellants argued, however,\n\nthat they were unaware of the identity of the entity responsible for\n\ntheir injury and that, therefore, the statute of limitations did not\n\nbar this suit. In support of this argument, appellants submitted two\n\naffidavits that, according to DuPont, contradicted earlier sworn\n\ntestimony. DuPont moved to strike the affidavits and argued that they\n\nfailed to create issues of material fact.\n\n          The district court issued a ruling on November 30, 1998\n\naddressing all of the statute of limitations arguments raised by\n\nDuPont. See Torres II. The court held that the facts, when construed\n\nin the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, demonstrated that the\n\nstatute of limitations was triggered in 1988 as to both plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fSee id. at 9-15. Specifically, the district court found that as of\n\n1988 the plaintiffs: (1) were on notice of sufficient facts that, with\n\nthe exercise of reasonable care regarding a potential claim, should\n\nhave led them to conclude that they had a legal cause of action, and\n\n(2) had actual knowledge that DuPont was responsible for the damages\n\nalleged in the complaint.    See id.   Based on these findings, the\n\ndistrict court held that appellants' claims were time-barred. See id.\n\nIn reaching this result, the district court granted DuPont's motion to\n\nstrike the affidavits filed in opposition to summary judgment on the\n\nbasis that \"[n]o satisfactory explanation [was] provided in either of\n\nthe affidavits as to why the prior testimonies . . . changed.\" Id. at\n\n11.\n\n          In addition, the district court held that \"[t]he fact that\n\nAgro-Industrias, as a corporation, did not form part of the original\n\ncomplaint filed [on] October 21, 1994, is a separate, independent\n\nreason for the dismissal of its claims as time-barred.\" Id. at 12. In\n\nshort, the court concluded that the filing of the 1994 complaint did\n\n\"not have any tolling effect\" on the statute of limitations as to the\n\ncorporation because Wilson Torres and Armando Torres -- the original\n\nplaintiffs -- did not have the capacity to sue in the name of the\n\ncorporation in October 1994.     Id. at 13.\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fI.   Standard of Review\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate if there is \"no genuine issue\n\nas to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).    This Court\n\nreviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, \"viewing 'the entire\n\nrecord in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary\n\njudgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.'\"\n\nEuromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (quoting Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)); see also Morris v. Government Dev. Bank of P.R., 27 F.3d 746,\n\n748 (1st Cir. 1994). We may, however, uphold the district court's\n\norder granting summary judgment regardless of whether we reject or\n\nadopt its rationale, so long as an \"independently sufficient ground\" is\n\nmade manifest by the record. Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d\n\n816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d\n\n46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1990)); see also Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.\n\nTown of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999); Hachikian v. FDIC,\n\n96 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir. 1996). Further, it is well settled that\n\n\"[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence\" is insufficient to\n\ndefeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986). Consequently, \"a party\n\nopposing summary judgment must 'present definite, competent evidence to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\frebut the motion.'\" Maldonado Denis v. Castillo-Rodríguez, 23 F.3d\n\n576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822).\n\nII.   Puerto Rico's One-Year Statute of Limitations\n\n          This is a diversity suit governed by the law of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe parties agree that the relevant statute of limitations is provided\n\nby article 1868 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, which is controlling for\n\ncivil tort actions filed pursuant to article 1802. See 31 L.P.R.A. §\n\n5298. Article 1868 bars any action for recovery of non-contractual\n\ndamages brought more than one year from the time the aggrieved person\n\nhas knowledge of the injury. See id. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\n\nhas held that a plaintiff has knowledge of an injury when he has (1)\n\n\"notice of the injury\" and (2) \"notice of the person who caused it.\"\n\nColón Prieto v. Géigel, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. 313, 330, 115 P.R. Dec.\n\n232, 246 (P.R. 1984).\n\n          We first consider the \"notice of the injury\" requirement.\n\n\"Notice of the injury occurs when there 'exist some outward or physical\n\nsigns through which the aggrieved party may become aware and realize\n\nthat he has suffered an injurious aftereffect, which when known becomes\n\na damage even if at the time its full scope and extent cannot be\n\nweighed.'\" Kaiser v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 872 F.2d 512, 516\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Delgado Rodríguez v. Nazario de Ferrer, 21\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 342, 356, 121 P.R. Dec. 347, 360, (P.R. 1988)).\n\nOnce a plaintiff is on notice of the injury, the plaintiff may \"not\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fwait for his injury to reach its final degree of development and\n\npostpone the running of the period of limitation according to his\n\nsubjective appraisal and judgment.\" Ortiz v. Municipio De Orocovis, 13\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 619, 622, 113 P.R. Dec. 484, 487 (P.R. 1982).\n\n          The second prong of the Colón Prieto test needs little\n\nexplanation: \"'Notice of the person who caused the injury' is required\n\n. . . so that the injured person 'may know who to sue.'\" Kaiser, 872\n\nF.2d at 516 (quoting Colón Prieto, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 330). As\n\nwe have previously indicated, \"[t]he key inquiry under this prong of\n\nthe knowledge requirement is whether plaintiff knew or with the degree\n\nof diligence required by law would have known whom to sue.\"        Id.\n\n(citations and internal quotation omitted); see also Rodríguez-Surís v.\n\nMontesinos, 123 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          The case law indicates that under the Colón Prieto test a\n\nplaintiff is held accountable for both \"true knowledge\" and \"deemed\n\nknowledge.\"   In Rodríguez-Surís, this Court explained:\n\n          First, the concept of \"true knowledge\" applies\n          where a plaintiff is actually aware of all the\n          necessary facts and the existence of a likelihood\n          of a legal cause of action. Second, concepts of\n          \"notice\" and \"deemed knowledge\" apply. Under\n          these concepts a plaintiff's subjective awareness\n          is measured against the level of awareness that\n          the plaintiff, having been put on notice as to\n          certain facts and having exercised reasonable\n          care regarding a potential claim, should have\n          acquired.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f123 F.3d at 14. Consequently, \"actual knowledge is not required where,\n\nby due diligence, such knowledge would likely have been acquired.\"\n\nVillarini-García v. Hospital Del Maestro, Inc., 8 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); see also Rodríguez-Surís, 123 F.3d at 16 (\"Once a plaintiff is\n\nmade aware of facts sufficient to put her on notice that she has a\n\npotential tort claim, she must pursue that claim with reasonable\n\ndiligence, or risk being held to have relinquished her right to pursue\n\nit later, after the limitation period has run.\").\n\n          Finally, \"[i]f a plaintiff brings an action more than a year\n\nafter the injury took place, she bears the burden of proving that she\n\nlacked the requisite 'knowledge' at the relevant times.\" Hidge v.\n\nParke Davis & Co., 833 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing Iluminada\n\nRivera Encarnación v. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R., 13 Offic. Trans.\n\n498, 501, 113 P.R. Dec. 383, 385 (P.R. 1982)); see also Fragoso v.\n\nLópez, 991 F.2d 878, 887 (1st Cir. 1993); Kaiser, 872 F.2d at 516.\n\n          In this case, there is no dispute that the damages alleged\n\nby appellants occurred in 1988, more than a year prior to the filing of\n\nthe complaint. Therefore, the only question is whether appellants have\n\ndemonstrated that they lacked the requisite legal knowledge of who\n\ncaused their injury prior to the running of the statutory period. See,\n\ne.g., Hidge, 833 F.2d at 7. In their opposition to DuPont's motion for\n\nsummary judgment, appellants did not dispute that by 1988 they had\n\nnotice of their injury, the alleged damage to their papaya crops.\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fAppellants argued, however, that they did not know that Benlate was\n\nresponsible for their injury until sometime in 1992, when their\n\nchemical supplier, Angel Rivera, advised them that Benlate was being\n\nrecalled.2 In addition, appellants argued that (1) the first Benlate-\n\nrelated claim initiated in Puerto Rico against DuPont was filed on\n\nApril 23, 1991, and (2) they could not have reasonably foreseen in 1988\n\nthat their damages were caused by Benlate.\n\n          Appellants' contention that they lacked the requisite\n\nknowledge of who caused their injury prior to 1992 is contradicted by\n\nthe deposition testimony of Miguel A. Colón-Capeles, which indicates\n\nthat by December 20, 1989 appellants were preparing a claim against\n\nDuPont. As outlined above, Colón-Capeles testified that Armando Torres\n\nrequested \"a certification\" of the papayas he had purchased from\n\nappellants in 1986, 1987, and 1988 \"because they had a claim against\n\nthe DuPont company concerning a chemical which had apparently affected\n\nthe sowing and the farms and the lands in which they had their 'papaya'\n\nfarms.\" In response to a follow-up question, Colón-Capeles reiterated\n\nthat Armando Torres \"requested that he needed a certification what he\n\nhad sold to me during the year so as to be able to support his case.\"\n\n\n2 Appellants allege that this suit is not time-barred despite being\nfiled in 1994 because the one year statute of limitations was tolled by\n(1) extrajudicial negotiations held between appellants' lawyers and\nDuPont and (2) a Benlate class action suit filed in Puerto Rico in\nMarch of 1992. In light of its determination that appellants had the\nrequisite legal knowledge of their injury in 1988, the district court\ndid not reach these arguments.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          After DuPont moved for summary judgment, appellants attempted\n\nto rebut Colón-Capeles's deposition testimony by filing an affidavit\n\nfrom him dated July 10, 1998. In that affidavit, Colón-Capeles states\n\n\"[a]fter careful reflection, I am unable to recall the reason for which\n\nMr. Torres requested that I provide him with invoices\" in 1989.\n\nAppellants also filed an affidavit from Armando Torres dated July 8,\n\n1998, stating that he had requested the invoices \"in order to submit a\n\nclaim for federal assistance (\"FEMA\") relating to Hurricane Hugo.\"\n\n          The district court struck both affidavits on the basis that\n\nappellants \"failed to justify the suggested changes in testimony and\n\nhave likewise failed to create a genuine issue of credibility.\" Torres\n\nII, slip op. at 11.    The court reasoned:\n\n          The contested affidavits were presented after\n          DuPont moved for summary judgment.             No\n          satisfactory explanation is provided in either of\n          the affidavits as to why the prior testimonies\n          given by Colón Capeles and Armando Torres changed\n          . . . . Without an appropriate explanation as to\n          why the testimony changed, \"there are no facts\n          suggesting why a credibility question exists and\n          the nonmoving party should not be allowed to\n          manufacture a question of fact to delay\n          resolution of the suit.\"\n\nId. (quoting 10A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure § 2726 (3d ed. 1998)). The district court's determination is\n\namply supported by the law and the record.\n\n          It is settled that \"[w]hen an interested witness has given\n\nclear answers to unambiguous questions, he cannot create a conflict and\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fresist    summary   judgment   with   an   affidavit   that   is   clearly\n\ncontradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation of why the\n\ntestimony is changed.\" Colantuoni v. Calcagni & Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1,\n\n4-5 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Slowiak v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., 987 F.2d\n\n1293, 1297 (7th Cir. 1993); Trans-Orient Marine v. Star Trading &\n\nMarine, 925 F.2d 566, 572 (2d Cir. 1991); Davidson & Jones Dev. v.\n\nElmore Dev., 921 F.2d 1343, 1352 (6th Cir. 1991).\n\n           Here, as in Colantuoni, appellants offered the affidavits of\n\nMiguel Colón-Capeles and Armando Torres \"only after defendants had\n\nfiled motions for summary judgment.\" 44 F.3d at 5. Notably, the post-\n\nsummary judgment affidavit of Colón-Capeles does not indicate that\n\nthere was any confusion at the time of his deposition testimony, see,\n\ne.g., Colantuoni, 44 F.3d at 5, nor does it allege that the prior\n\ntestimony was in error. In fact, Colón-Capeles's affidavit makes no\n\nreference to the contrary statements in his deposition at all. As the\n\ndistrict court indicated, there is simply nothing in the record that\n\nprovides any explanation for why Colón-Capeles changed his testimony.\n\nSee Torres II, slip op. at 10.\n\n           Armando Torres's July 8, 1998 affidavit fares no better. It\n\nstates:\n\n           On or about December 20, 1989, I asked Miguel\n           Colón [Capeles] of Cheche Tropical Products to\n           provide me with certifications of the amount of\n           papaya that he purchased from Agro Industrias\n           from 1986 to 1988 in order to submit a claim for\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f          federal assistance (\"FEMA\") relating to Hurricane\n          Hugo. I did not ask Mr. Colón [Capeles] to\n          prepare the certification for a claim against\n          DuPont since I did not become aware, until the\n          summer of 1992, that my use of Benlate 50 DF was\n          responsible for the loss of my papaya\n          plantations.\n\nHowever, at his January 23, 1998 deposition, Armando Torres testified\n\nthat he either never made a claim to the Federal Emergency Management\n\nAgency (\"FEMA\") or, at the very least, he did not recall whether he had\n\nmade a claim to FEMA. In addition, appellants' responses to DuPont's\n\ninterrogatories contain two admissions that flatly contradict Armando\n\nTorres's July 8, 1998 affidavit.        First, appellants stated that\n\nHurricane Hugo damaged plantains. The certifications prepared by\n\nColón-Capeles refer to papaya, not plantains. Second, appellants\n\nstated that as of 1989, the year Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico,\n\nthey were no longer planting papaya. Again, Armando Torres's affidavit\n\nprovides no explanation for these contradictions.\n\n          This Court \"review[s] the district court's decision as to\n\n'the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion for\n\nsummary judgment' only for 'a clear abuse of discretion.'\" Lennon v.\n\nRubin, 166 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting EEOC v. Green, 76 F.3d\n\n19, 24 (1st Cir. 1996)). In this case, we see no abuse of discretion.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to strike the\n\naffidavits of Miguel Colón-Capeles and Armando Torres. See Colantuoni,\n\n44 F.3d at 4-5.\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f          Consequently, as the district court correctly determined,\n\nColón-Capeles's deposition testimony is uncontradicted and clearly\n\nindicates that appellants possessed the requisite legal knowledge of\n\ntheir injury and who caused it prior to the statutory period. While we\n\nbelieve that this evidence is sufficient to dispose of this case, we\n\nnote that there is ample additional evidence in the record to support\n\nthe district court's ruling. This evidence includes: (1) Armando\n\nTorres's testimony that, in April 1988, appellants fumigated their\n\nentire papaya plantations with Benlate; (2) Armando Torres's testimony\n\nthat the injury to the papaya crops was evident \"during the one (1)\n\nweek\" following this spraying and, within a month thereafter, \"we\n\nalready became aware that something more deep rooted\" had occurred to\n\nthe crops; (3) the testimony of Angel Rivera, appellants' chemical\n\nsupplier, stating that after the application of Benlate to appellants'\n\npapaya the plants looked \"unnourished, yellowish, the fruit falling to\n\nthe ground without reaching ripeness\"; (4) Rivera's further testimony\n\nthat Armando Torres told him that appellants' crops \"had become unwell\"\n\nafter they were sprayed with Benlate; (5) the testimony of Eugenio\n\nToro, an expert from the Agricultural Extension Service, stating that\n\nby late 1988 or early 1989 he had determined that \"something was\n\nhappening physiologically in the [papaya] plant[s],\" possibly \"an\n\nintoxication,\" and that he had ruled out disease, lack-of-nutrient\n\nproblems, and excessive rainfall as potential causes of the damage; and\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f(6) the testimony of Ventura Cruz-Sánchez, a farm worker employed by\n\nappellants, stating that after the plants were sprayed with Benlate\n\n\"the following day we had to pull a machete and start cutting them up.\"\n\n          Based on this evidence, in addition to the testimony of\n\nColón-Capeles, the district court held that appellants \"possessed the\n\nnecessary information of whom to sue or that with the degree of\n\ndiligence required by law they should have known who to sue by 1988.\"\n\nSee Torres II, slip op. at 12. We agree. Accordingly, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's ruling that the statute of limitations was triggered\n\nin 1988 and that therefore appellants' claims are time-barred under\n\nArticle 1868.    See 31 L.P.R.A. § 5298.\n\n          In reaching this determination, we are in agreement with the\n\ndistrict court that whether or not appellants received notice that\n\nBenlate was being recalled in 1992 or that the first Benlate claim was\n\nfiled in 1991 is irrelevant. Once appellants were put on notice of a\n\npotential legal cause of action, the statute of limitations began to\n\nrun. Additional information that appellants may or may not have later\n\nacquired is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company  for producing a fungicide that, due to contamination or other  defect, allegedly destroyed appellants' papaya crops in 1988. DuPont moved for summary judgment on the basis that the suit was  barred both by judicial estoppel and the applicable statute of  limitations.  The district court granted the judicial estoppel  motion only as to Agro-Industrias de Comerio but granted summary  judgment as to both appellants on the statute of limitations  ground.  See Torres v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., No. 94-2632  (D.P.R. June 22, 1998) (\"Torres I\"); Torres v. E.I. DuPont de  Nemours &amp; Co., No. 94-2632 (D.P.R. Nov. 30, 1998) (\"Torres II\"). The latter ruling was premised on the court's conclusion that  appellants had the requisite legal knowledge of their injury and  its cause in 1988, four years prior to the initiation of this suit. We see no error in this determination.  Accordingly, we affirm the  entry of summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1980s, appellants Angel Luis Torres and Agro-Industrias de Comerio were engaged in the cultivation, planting,  and sale of papayas in Puerto Rico.  They had separate businesses  and finances, but they shared practices, employees, customers, and  tracts of land.  Appellant Torres was the president of the Board of  Directors of Agro-Industrias; while his brother, Armando Torres,  was the corporation's general manager and sole shareholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1988, appellants purchased Benlate 50 DF, a  fungicide manufactured and sold by appellee E.I. DuPont de Nemours  &amp; Company, for application to their papaya crops.  According to  appellants, the Benlate was \"either contaminated with one or more  herbicides, incompatible fungicides or other chemicals toxic to  plants, or was defectively designed, or both.\"  Appellants allege  that as a result of this contamination or defect, the Benlate  stunted the tree and fruit growth of their papaya plants, caused  abnormal root growth, chlorosis, and ultimately, the death of the  papaya trees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his deposition, Armando Torres outlined the time frame  of appellants' injury, stating that during the summer of 1988 the  papaya crops of Agro-Industrias and Torresexhibited symptoms of a  disease once fumigated with Benlate:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trip [in April of 1988], . . . I was  grateful to DuPont who had taken me on a trip  to see agriculture.  I asked my brother Angel  Luis [Torres] what was the product that DuPont  distributed in Puerto Rico because I didn't  know and he told me that it was Benlate.  It  was the main one, it was a panacea, the best  thing in the world and logically, well, I  fumigated the entire plantation with Benlate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The symptoms began during the one (1) week  period but this extended more, it was a little  bit slower process.  During the period of  approximately one (1) month after the moment  we already became aware that something more  deep rooted was failing was when we began to  . . . [c]all agronomists to investigate what  was happening and high ranking officials,  especially [Eugenio Toro,] the person who gave  us orientation at the level of Puerto Rico  . . . .  All of the agronomists from the area,  from the Agricultural Extension Service, all  of them visited [appellants'] farm . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deposition testimony from several other witnesses  corroborated Armando Torres's account, each indicating that damage  to appellants' crops was apparent following the 1988 application of  Benlate.  Ventura Cruz-Sanchez, an employee who worked with Armando  Torres from 1986 to 1989, stated in his deposition that once \"we  sprayed the poison [onto the papaya crops], the following day we  had to pull a machete and start cutting them up.\"  Similarly, Angel  Rivera-Rodrguez, appellants' chemicals supplier, testified that he  visited appellants' papaya farms both before and after the  application of Benlate sometime in 1987 or 1988.  Rivera described  appellants' crops prior to the application of Benlate as \"[a]  robust seeding area with lots of fruits and pretty.\"  However,  \"[a]fter the Benlate, the plantation looked unnourished, yellowish,  the fruit falling to the ground without reaching ripeness.\"  Rivera  further testified that Armando Torres told him that after the  papayas had been sprayed with Benlate \"they had become unwell.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Eugenio Toro, a tropical fruit specialist  employed by the Agricultural Extension Service, testified that by  late 1988 or early 1989, he considered the possibility that the  damage to appellants' papaya crops was being caused by something  physiological, \"possibl[y] an intoxication with something.\" Further, by that time he had rejected disease, lack-of-nutrient  problems, or excessive rainfall as potential causes.  He  recommended that appellants harvest the fruit that was available  and abandon the papaya fields.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony presented to the district court was not,  however, entirely unequivocal.  Ramon Luis Martnez-Zayas, an  Agricultural Agent for the Extension Service who visited  appellants' farm, testified that the cause of the damage to the  papaya plants was not immediately clear.  He stated that sometime  after 1987, discovering the cause of the damage to the papaya crops  \"really sort of became a huge jigsaw puzzle because it wasn't only  [Angel] Luis [Torres], it was all of the papaya producers and we  started making some conjectures as to what could be happening but  we really didn't have anything clear as to what was happening as  such.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the initial uncertainty, David Berros, an Area  Agronomist for Puerto Rico, testified that he became aware of  complaints from farmers in appellants' region relating to the use  of Benlate in the late 1980s and that at least one farmer in the  region was taking steps to make a claim against DuPont in 1988 or  1989.  More important, one of appellants' clients, Miguel A. Colon-Capeles, testified at his deposition that Armando Torres requested  \"a certification\" of the papayas he had purchased from appellants  in 1986, 1987, and 1988.  According to Colon-Capeles, Armando  Torres stated that he needed the certification \"because they had a  claim against the DuPont company concerning achemical which had  apparently affected the sowing and the farms and the lands in which  they had their 'papaya' farms.\"  He reiterated that Armando Torres  \"requested that he needed a certification what he had sold to me  during the year so as to be able to support his case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to discovery, appellants produced a similar  proof of papaya purchases from a second customer, Fermn Rivera  Torres.  The January 10, 1990 document certified the amount of  papaya purchased from Angel Luis Torres from 1984 to 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to the alleged destruction of their crops by Benlate,  appellants were no longer cultivating papaya as of 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 1992, appellants sent a demand letter to  DuPont claiming damages in the amount of $4,000,000.  Two years  later, on October 21, 1994, Wilson Torres, Armando Torres, and  Angel Luis Torres, doing business as Agro-Industrias de Comerio,  sued E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company in the Superior Court of the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  DuPont removed the case to the United  States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico pursuant to  the diversity of citizenship statute.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). Following removal, appellants amended the complaint, dropping  Armando and Wilson Torres and adding Agro-Industrias de Comerio as  a named plaintiff.  During the pendency of this action, Angel Luis  Torres died and his cause of action was inherited by his heirs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 28, 1998, DuPont filed its first motion for  summary judgment.  In that motion, DuPont raised two defenses: judicial estoppel and the statute of limitations.  DuPont asserted  that (1) appellants had failed to disclose their claims in previous  bankruptcy actions, and (2) the claims of Agro-Industrias, filed in  June of 1997, were time-barred.  The district court granted  DuPont's motion for summary judgment on the judicial estoppel  ground as to Agro-Industrias but denied the motion as to appellant  Torres.  See Torres I, slip op. at 9-15.  The court reasoned that  Agro-Industrias was aware of its potential claim against DuPont  prior to filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1992, failed to  make the required disclosure, and thereafter obtained relief from  the bankruptcy court as a result of this misrepresentation.  Seeid. at 11-15.  In contrast, the court determined that Torres had  failed to comply with the statutory disclosure requirements related  to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding, but, unlike Agro-Industrias, he did not receive relief from the bankruptcy court. See id.  at 9-11.  Accordingly, appellant Torres's claims were not  subject to judicial estoppel as a matter of law.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1998, DuPont filed a second motion for  summary judgment, this time alleging that the claims raised by  Torres were barred by the statute of limitations.  DuPont argued  that Torres did not initiate his claim until more than a year after  he possessed actual or deemed knowledge of his injury and its  cause.  On June 26, 1998, DuPont raised the identical statute of  limitations argument against Agro-Industrias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their opposition to the June 19th motion, appellants  conceded that they knew that an injury had occurred more than a  year prior to the date they filed their claim.  Appellants argued,  however, that they were unaware of the identity of the entity  responsible for their injury and that, therefore, the statute of  limitations did not bar this suit.  In support of this argument,  appellants submitted two affidavits that, according to DuPont,  contradicted earlier sworn testimony.  DuPont moved to strike the  affidavits and argued that they failed to create issues of material  fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued a ruling on November 30, 1998  addressing all of the statute of limitations arguments raised by  DuPont.  See Torres II.  The court held that the facts, when  construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,  demonstratedthat the statute of limitations was triggered in 1988  as to both plaintiffs.  See id. at 9-15.  Specifically, the  district court found that as of 1988 the plaintiffs:  (1) were on  notice of sufficient facts that, with the exercise of reasonable  care regarding a potential claim, should have led them to conclude  that they had a legal cause of action, and (2) had actual knowledge  that DuPont was responsible for the damages alleged in the  complaint.  See id.  Based on these findings, the district court  held that appellants' claims were time-barred.  See id.  In  reaching this result, the district court granted DuPont's motion to  strike the affidavits filed in opposition to summary judgment on  the basis that \"[n]o satisfactory explanation [was] provided in  either of the affidavits as to why the prior testimonies . . .  changed.\"  Id. at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the district court held that \"[t]he fact  that Agro-Industrias, as a corporation, did not form part of the  original complaint filed [on] October 21, 1994, is a separate,  independent reason for the dismissal of its claims as time-barred.\" Id. at 12.  In short, the court concluded that the filing of the  1994 complaint did \"not have any tolling effect\" on the statute of  limitations as to the corporation because Wilson Torres and Armando  Torres -- the original plaintiffs -- did not have the capacity to  sue in the name of the corporation in October 1994.

This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, \"viewing  'the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party  opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in  that party's favor.'\"  Euromotion, Inc. v.

The parties agree that the relevant statute of limitations  is provided by article 1868 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, which is  controlling for civil tort actions filed pursuant to article 1802. See 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298.  Article 1868 bars any action for recovery  of non-contractual damages brought more than one year from the time  the aggrieved person has knowledge of the injury.  See id.  The  Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that a plaintiff has  knowledge of an injury when he has (1) \"notice of the injury\" and  (2) \"notice of the person who caused it.\"  Colon Prieto v.

Second, concepts of \"notice\" and \"deemed  knowledge\" apply.  Under these concepts a  plaintiff's subjective awareness is measured  against the level of awareness that the  plaintiff, having been put on notice as to  certain facts and having exercised reasonable  care regarding a potential claim, should have  acquired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">123 F.3d at 14.  Consequently, \"actual knowledge is not required  where, by due diligence, such knowledge would likely have been  acquired.\"  Villarini-Garca v. Hospital Del Maestro, Inc., 8 F.3d  81, 84 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Rodrguez-Surs, 123 F.3d at 16  (\"Once a plaintiff is made aware of facts sufficient to put her on  notice that she has a potential tort claim, she must pursue that  claim with reasonable diligence, or risk being held to have  relinquished her right to pursue it later, after the limitation  period has run.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, \"[i]f a plaintiff brings an action more than a  year after the injury took place, she bears the burden of proving  that she lacked the requisite 'knowledge' at the relevant times.\" Hidge v.

Therefore, the only question is  whether appellants have demonstrated that they lacked the requisite  legal knowledge of who caused their injury prior to the running of  the statutory period.  See, e.g., Hidge, 833 F.2d at 7.  In their  opposition to DuPont's motion for summary judgment, appellants did  not dispute that by 1988 they had notice of their injury, the  alleged damage to their papaya crops.  Appellants argued, however,  that they did not know that Benlate was responsible for their  injury until sometime in 1992, when their chemical supplier, Angel  Rivera, advised them that Benlate was beingrecalled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In  addition, appellants argued that (1) the first Benlate-related  claim initiated in Puerto Rico against DuPont was filed on  April 23, 1991, and (2) they could not have reasonably foreseen in  1988 that their damages were caused by Benlate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' contention that they lacked the requisite  knowledge of who caused their injury prior to 1992 is contradicted  by the deposition testimony of Miguel A. Colon-Capeles, which  indicates that by December 20, 1989 appellants were preparing a  claim against DuPont.  As outlined above, Colon-Capeles testified  that Armando Torres requested \"a certification\" of the papayas he  had purchased from appellants in 1986, 1987, and 1988 \"because they  had a claim against the DuPont company concerning a chemical which  had apparently affected the sowing and the farms and the lands in  which they had their 'papaya' farms.\"  In response to a follow-up  question, Colon-Capeles reiterated that Armando Torres \"requested  that he needed a certification what he had sold to me during the  year so as to be able to support his case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After DuPont moved for summary judgment, appellants  attempted to rebut Colon-Capeles's deposition testimony by filing an affidavit from him dated July 10, 1998.  In that affidavit,  Colon-Capeles states \"[a]fter careful reflection, I am unable to  recall the reason for which Mr. Torres requested that I provide him  with invoices\" in 1989.  Appellants also filed an affidavit from  Armando Torres dated July 8, 1998, stating that he had requested  the invoices \"in order to submit a claim for federal assistance  (\"FEMA\") relating to Hurricane Hugo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court struck both affidavits on the basis  that appellants \"failed to justify the suggested changes in  testimony and have likewise failed to create a genuine issue of  credibility.\"  Torres II, slip op. at 11.  The court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contested affidavits were presented after  DuPont moved for summary judgment.  No  satisfactory explanation is provided in either  of the affidavits as to why the prior  testimonies given by Colon Capeles and Armando  Torres changed . . . .  Without an appropriate  explanation as to why the testimony changed,  \"there are no facts suggesting why a  credibility question exists and the nonmoving  party should not be allowed to manufacture a  question of fact to delay resolution of the  suit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (quoting 10A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp;  Procedure &#167; 2726 (3d ed. 1998)).  The district court's  determination is amply supported by the law and the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled that \"[w]hen an interested witness has  given clear answers to unambiguous questions, he cannot create a  conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is  clearly contradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation  of why the testimony is changed.\"  Colantuoni v. Calcagni &amp; Sons,  Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Slowiak v. Land  O'Lakes, Inc., 987 F.2d 1293, 1297 (7th Cir. 1993); Trans-Orient  Marine v.

Notably,  the post-summary judgment affidavit of Colon-Capeles does not  indicate that there was any confusion at the time of his deposition  testimony, see, e.g., Colantuoni, 44 F.3d at 5,nor does it allege  that the prior testimony was in error.  In fact, Colon-Capeles's  affidavit makes no reference to the contrary statements in his  deposition at all.  As the district court indicated, there is  simply nothing in the record that provides any explanation for why  Colon-Capeles changed his testimony.  See Torres II, slip op. at  10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armando Torres's July 8, 1998 affidavit fares no better. It states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about December 20, 1989, I asked Miguel  Colon [Capeles] of Cheche Tropical Products to  provide me with certifications of the amount  of papaya that he purchased from Agro  Industrias from 1986 to 1988 in order to  submit a claim for federal assistance (\"FEMA\")  relating to Hurricane Hugo.  I did not ask  Mr. Colon [Capeles] to prepare the  certification for a claim against DuPont since  I did not become aware, until the summer of  1992, that my use of Benlate 50 DF was  responsible for the loss of my papaya  plantations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, at his January 23, 1998 deposition, Armando Torres  testified that he either never made a claim to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") or, at the very least, he did  not recall whether he had made a claim to FEMA.  In addition,  appellants' responses to DuPont's interrogatories contain two  admissions that flatly contradict Armando Torres's July 8, 1998  affidavit.  First, appellants stated that Hurricane Hugo damaged  plantains.  The certifications prepared by Colon-Capeles refer to  papaya, not plantains.  Second, appellants stated that as of 1989,  the year Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico, they were no longer  planting papaya.  Again, Armando Torres's affidavit provides no  explanation for these contradictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court \"review[s] the district court's decision as to  'the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion  for summary judgment' only for 'a clear abuse of discretion.'\" Lennon v. Rubin, 166 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting EEOC v. Green, 76 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 1996)).  In this case, we see no  abuse of discretion.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's  decision to strike the affidavits of Miguel Colon-Capeles and  Armando Torres.  See Colantuoni, 44 F.3d at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, as the district court correctly determined,  Colon-Capeles's deposition testimony is uncontradicted and clearly  indicates that appellants possessed the requisite legal knowledge  of their injury and who caused it prior to the statutory period. While we believe that this evidence is sufficient to dispose of  this case, we note that there is ample additional evidence in the  record to support the district court's ruling.  This evidence  includes: (1) Armando Torres's testimony that, in April 1988,  appellants fumigated their entire papaya plantations with Benlate;  (2) Armando Torres's testimony that the injury to the papaya crops  was evident \"during the one (1) week\" following this spraying and,  within a month thereafter, \"we already became aware that something  more deep rooted\" had occurred to the crops; (3) the testimony of  Angel Rivera, appellants' chemical supplier, stating that after the  application of Benlate to appellants' papaya the plants looked  \"unnourished, yellowish, the fruit falling to the ground without  reaching ripeness\"; (4) Rivera's further testimony that Armando  Torres told him that appellants' crops \"had become unwell\" after  they were sprayed with Benlate; (5) the testimony of Eugenio Toro,  an expert from the Agricultural Extension Service, stating that by  late 1988 or early 1989 he had determined that \"something was  happening physiologically in the [papaya] plant[s],\" possibly \"an  intoxication,\" and that he had ruled out disease, lack-of-nutrient  problems, and excessive rainfall as potential causes of the damage;  and (6) the testimony of Ventura Cruz-Sanchez, a farm worker  employed by appellants, stating that after the plants were sprayed  with Benlate \"the following day we had to pull a machete and start  cutting them up.\" Based on this evidence, in addition to the testimony of  Colon-Capeles, the district court held that appellants \"possessed  the necessary information of whom to sue or that with the degree of  diligence required by law they should have known who to sue by  1988.\"  See Torres II, slip op. at 12.  We agree.  Accordingly, we  affirm the district court's ruling that the statute of limitations  was triggered in 1988 and that therefore appellants' claims are  time-barred under Article 1868.  See 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this determination, we are in agreement with  the district court that whether or not appellants received notice  that Benlate was being recalled in 1992 or that the first Benlate  claim was filed in 1991 is irrelevant.  Once appellants were put on  notice of a potential legal cause of action, the statute of  limitations began to run.  Additional information that appellants  may or may not have later acquired is not sufficient to create a  genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   Our conclusion that this case is barred by the statute of  limitations is dispositive.

In light of its determination that  appellants had the requisite legal knowledge of their injury in  1988, the district court did not reach these arguments.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company  for producing a fungicide that, due to contamination or other  defect, allegedly destroyed appellants' papaya crops in 1988. DuPont moved for summary judgment on the basis that the suit was  barred both by judicial estoppel and the applicable statute of  limitations.  The district court granted the judicial estoppel  motion only as to Agro-Industrias de Comerio but granted summary  judgment as to both appellants on the statute of limitations  ground.  See Torres v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., No. 94-2632  (D.P.R. June 22, 1998) (\"Torres I\"); Torres v. E.I. DuPont de  Nemours &amp; Co., No. 94-2632 (D.P.R. Nov. 30, 1998) (\"Torres II\"). The latter ruling was premised on the court's conclusion that  appellants had the requisite legal knowledge of their injury and  its cause in 1988, four years prior to the initiation of this suit. We see no error in this determination.  Accordingly, we affirm the  entry of summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1980s, appellants Angel Luis Torres and Agro-Industrias de Comerio were engaged in the cultivation, planting,  and sale of papayas in Puerto Rico.  They had separate businesses  and finances, but they shared practices, employees, customers, and  tracts of land.  Appellant Torres was the president of the Board of  Directors of Agro-Industrias; while his brother, Armando Torres,  was the corporation's general manager and sole shareholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1988, appellants purchased Benlate 50 DF, a  fungicide manufactured and sold by appellee E.I. DuPont de Nemours  &amp; Company, for application to their papaya crops.  According to  appellants, the Benlate was \"either contaminated with one or more  herbicides, incompatible fungicides or other chemicals toxic to  plants, or was defectively designed, or both.\"  Appellants allege  that as a result of this contamination or defect, the Benlate  stunted the tree and fruit growth of their papaya plants, caused  abnormal root growth, chlorosis, and ultimately, the death of the  papaya trees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his deposition, Armando Torres outlined the time frame  of appellants' injury, stating that during the summer of 1988 the  papaya crops of Agro-Industrias and Torresexhibited symptoms of a  disease once fumigated with Benlate:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trip [in April of 1988], . . . I was  grateful to DuPont who had taken me on a trip  to see agriculture.  I asked my brother Angel  Luis [Torres] what was the product that DuPont  distributed in Puerto Rico because I didn't  know and he told me that it was Benlate.  It  was the main one, it was a panacea, the best  thing in the world and logically, well, I  fumigated the entire plantation with Benlate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The symptoms began during the one (1) week  period but this extended more, it was a little  bit slower process.  During the period of  approximately one (1) month after the moment  we already became aware that something more  deep rooted was failing was when we began to  . . .

Ventura Cruz-Sanchez, an employee who worked with Armando  Torres from 1986 to 1989, stated in his deposition that once \"we  sprayed the poison [onto the papaya crops], the following day we  had to pull a machete and start cutting them up.\"  Similarly, Angel  Rivera-Rodrguez, appellants' chemicals supplier, testified that he  visited appellants' papaya farms both before and after the  application of Benlate sometime in 1987 or 1988.  Rivera described  appellants' crops prior to the application of Benlate as \"[a]  robust seeding area with lots of fruits and pretty.\"  However,  \"[a]fter the Benlate, the plantation looked unnourished, yellowish,  the fruit falling to the ground without reaching ripeness.\"  Rivera  further testified that Armando Torres told him that after the  papayas had been sprayed with Benlate \"they had become unwell.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Eugenio Toro, a tropical fruit specialist  employed by the Agricultural Extension Service, testified that by  late 1988 or early 1989, he considered the possibility that the  damage to appellants' papaya crops was being caused by something  physiological, \"possibl[y] an intoxication with something.\" Further, by that time he had rejected disease, lack-of-nutrient  problems, or excessive rainfall as potential causes.  He  recommended that appellants harvest the fruit that was available  and abandon the papaya fields.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony presented to the district court was not,  however, entirely unequivocal.  Ramon Luis Martnez-Zayas, an  Agricultural Agent for the Extension Service who visited  appellants' farm, testified that the cause of the damage to the  papaya plants was not immediately clear.  He stated that sometime  after 1987, discovering the cause of the damage to the papaya crops  \"really sort of became a huge jigsaw puzzle because it wasn't only  [Angel] Luis [Torres], it was all of the papaya producers and we  started making some conjectures as to what could be happening but  we really didn't have anything clear as to what was happening as  such.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the initial uncertainty, David Berros, an Area  Agronomist for Puerto Rico, testified that he became aware of  complaints from farmers in appellants' region relating to the use  of Benlate in the late 1980s and that at least one farmer in the  region was taking steps to make a claim against DuPont in 1988 or  1989.  More important, one of appellants' clients, Miguel A. Colon-Capeles, testified at his deposition that Armando Torres requested  \"a certification\" of the papayas he had purchased from appellants  in 1986, 1987, and 1988.  According to Colon-Capeles, Armando  Torres stated that he needed the certification \"because they had a  claim against the DuPont company concerning achemical which had  apparently affected the sowing and the farms and the lands in which  they had their 'papaya' farms.\"  He reiterated that Armando Torres  \"requested that he needed a certification what he had sold to me  during the year so as to be able to support his case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to discovery, appellants produced a similar  proof of papaya purchases from a second customer, Fermn Rivera  Torres.  The January 10, 1990 document certified the amount of  papaya purchased from Angel Luis Torres from 1984 to 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to the alleged destruction of their crops by Benlate,  appellants were no longer cultivating papaya as of 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 1992, appellants sent a demand letter to  DuPont claiming damages in the amount of $4,000,000.  Two years  later, on October 21, 1994, Wilson Torres, Armando Torres, and  Angel Luis Torres, doing business as Agro-Industrias de Comerio,  sued E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company in the Superior Court of the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  DuPont removed the case to the United  States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico pursuant to  the diversity of citizenship statute.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). Following removal, appellants amended the complaint, dropping  Armando and Wilson Torres and adding Agro-Industrias de Comerio as  a named plaintiff.  During the pendency of this action, Angel Luis  Torres died and his cause of action was inherited by his heirs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 28, 1998, DuPont filed its first motion for  summary judgment.  In that motion, DuPont raised two defenses: judicial estoppel and the statute of limitations.  DuPont asserted  that (1) appellants had failed to disclose their claims in previous  bankruptcy actions, and (2) the claims of Agro-Industrias, filed in  June of 1997, were time-barred.  The district court granted  DuPont's motion for summary judgment on the judicial estoppel  ground as to Agro-Industrias but denied the motion as to appellant  Torres.  See Torres I, slip op. at 9-15.  The court reasoned that  Agro-Industrias was aware of its potential claim against DuPont  prior to filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1992, failed to  make the required disclosure, and thereafter obtained relief from  the bankruptcy court as a result of this misrepresentation.  Seeid. at 11-15.  In contrast, the court determined that Torres had  failed to comply with the statutory disclosure requirements related  to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding, but, unlike Agro-Industrias, he did not receive relief from the bankruptcy court. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  at 9-11. </span> Accordingly, appellant Torres's claims were not  subject to judicial estoppel as a matter of law.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1998, DuPont filed a second motion for  summary judgment, this time alleging that the claims raised by  Torres were barred by the statute of limitations.  DuPont argued  that Torres did not initiate his claim until more than a year after  he possessed actual or deemed knowledge of his injury and its  cause.  On June 26, 1998, DuPont raised the identical statute of  limitations argument against Agro-Industrias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their opposition to the June 19th motion, appellants  conceded that they knew that an injury had occurred more than a  year prior to the date they filed their claim.  Appellants argued,  however, that they were unaware of the identity of the entity  responsible for their injury and that, therefore, the statute of  limitations did not bar this suit.  In support of this argument,  appellants submitted two affidavits that, according to DuPont,  contradicted earlier sworn testimony.  DuPont moved to strike the  affidavits and argued that they failed to create issues of material  fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued a ruling on November 30, 1998  addressing all of the statute of limitations arguments raised by  DuPont.  See Torres II.  The court held that the facts, when  construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,  demonstratedthat the statute of limitations was triggered in 1988  as to both plaintiffs.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 9-15. </span> Specifically, the  district court found that as of 1988 the plaintiffs:  (1) were on  notice of sufficient facts that, with the exercise of reasonable  care regarding a potential claim, should have led them to conclude  that they had a legal cause of action, and (2) had actual knowledge  that DuPont was responsible for the damages alleged in the  complaint.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  Based on </span>these findings, the district court  held that appellants' claims were time-barred.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  In  reaching </span>this result, the district court granted DuPont's motion to  strike the affidavits filed in opposition to summary judgment on  the basis that \"[n]o satisfactory explanation [was] provided in  either of the affidavits as to why the prior testimonies . . .  changed.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 11.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the district court held that \"[t]he fact  that Agro-Industrias, as a corporation, did not form part of the  original complaint filed [on] October 21, 1994, is a separate,  independent reason for the dismissal of its claims as time-barred.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 12. </span> In short, the court concluded that the filing of the  1994 complaint did \"not have any tolling effect\" on the statute of  limitations as to the corporation because Wilson Torres and Armando  Torres -- the original plaintiffs -- did not have the capacity to  sue in the name of the corporation in October 1994.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 13.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

Notably,  the post-summary judgment affidavit of Colon-Capeles does not  indicate that there was any confusion at the time of his deposition  testimony, see, e.g., Colantuoni, 44 F.3d at 5,nor does it allege  that the prior testimony was in error.  In fact, Colon-Capeles's  affidavit makes no reference to the contrary statements in his  deposition at all.  As the district court indicated, there is  simply nothing in the record that provides any explanation for why  Colon-Capeles changed his testimony.  See Torres II, slip op. at  10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armando Torres's July 8, 1998 affidavit fares no better. It states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about December 20, 1989, I asked Miguel  Colon [Capeles] of Cheche Tropical Products to  provide me with certifications of the amount  of papaya that he purchased from Agro  Industrias from 1986 to 1988 in order to  submit a claim for federal assistance (\"FEMA\")  relating to Hurricane Hugo.  I did not ask  Mr. Colon [Capeles] to prepare the  certification for a claim against DuPont since  I did not become aware, until the summer of  1992, that my use of Benlate 50 DF was  responsible for the loss of my papaya  plantations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, at his January 23, 1998 deposition, Armando Torres  testified that he either never made a claim to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") or, at the very least, he did  not recall whether he had made a claim to FEMA.  In addition,  appellants' responses to DuPont's interrogatories contain two  admissions that flatly contradict Armando Torres's July 8, 1998  affidavit.  First, appellants stated that Hurricane Hugo damaged  plantains.  The certifications prepared by Colon-Capeles refer to  papaya, not plantains.  Second, appellants stated that as of 1989,  the year Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico, they were no longer  planting papaya.  Again, Armando Torres's affidavit provides no  explanation for these contradictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court \"review[s] the district court's decision as to  'the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion  for summary judgment' only for 'a clear abuse of discretion.'\" Lennon v. Rubin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760938\"><a href=\"/opinion/760938/john-j-lennon-v-robert-rubin-secretary-of-the-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting EEOC v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712246\"><a href=\"/opinion/712246/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-88-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43900-equal/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir. 1996)).  In this case, we see no  abuse of discretion.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's  decision to strike the affidavits of Miguel Colon-Capeles and  Armando Torres.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Colantuoni,</span> <span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4-5</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, as the district court correctly determined,  Colon-Capeles's deposition testimony is uncontradicted and clearly  indicates that appellants possessed the requisite legal knowledge  of their injury and who caused it prior to the statutory period. While we believe that this evidence is sufficient to dispose of  this case, we note that there is ample additional evidence in the  record to support the district court's ruling.  This evidence  includes: (1) Armando Torres's testimony that, in April 1988,  appellants fumigated their entire papaya plantations with Benlate;  (2) Armando Torres's testimony that the injury to the papaya crops  was evident \"during the one (1) week\" following this spraying and,  within a month thereafter, \"we already became aware that something  more deep rooted\" had occurred to the crops; (3) the testimony of  Angel Rivera, appellants' chemical supplier, stating that after the  application of Benlate to appellants' papaya the plants looked  \"unnourished, yellowish, the fruit falling to the ground without  reaching ripeness\"; (4) Rivera's further testimony that Armando  Torres told him that appellants' crops \"had become unwell\" after  they were sprayed with Benlate; (5) the testimony of Eugenio Toro,  an expert from the Agricultural Extension Service, stating that by  late 1988 or early 1989 he had determined that \"something was  happening physiologically in the [papaya] plant[s],\" possibly \"an  intoxication,\" and that he had ruled out disease, lack-of-nutrient  problems, and excessive rainfall as potential causes of the damage;  and (6) the testimony of Ventura Cruz-Sanchez, a farm worker  employed by appellants, stating that after the plants were sprayed  with Benlate \"the following day we had to pull a machete and start  cutting them up.\" Based on this evidence, in addition to the testimony of  Colon-Capeles, the district court held that appellants \"possessed  the necessary information of whom to sue or that with the degree of  diligence required by law they should have known who to sue by  1988.\"  See Torres II, slip op. at 12.  We agree.  Accordingly, we  affirm the district court's ruling that the statute of limitations  was triggered in 1988 and that therefore appellants' claims are  time-barred under Article 1868.  See 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this determination, we are in agreement with  the district court that whether or not appellants received notice  that Benlate was being recalled in 1992 or that the first Benlate  claim was filed in 1991 is irrelevant.  Once appellants were put on  notice of a potential legal cause of action, the statute of  limitations began to run.  Additional information that appellants  may or may not have later acquired is not sufficient to create a  genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   Our conclusion that this case is barred by the statute of  limitations is dispositive.  Consequently, we decline to address  the district court's ruling regarding judicial estoppel.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>   Appellants allege that this suit is not time-barred despite  being filed in 1994 because the one year statute of limitations was  tolled by (1) extrajudicial negotiations held between appellants'  lawyers and DuPont and (2) a Benlate class action suit filed in  Puerto Rico in March of 1992.  In light of its determination that  appellants had the requisite legal knowledge of their injury in  1988, the district court did not reach these arguments.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
