Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Edgar R. Vega-Pabon on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Michelle Morales,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         April 13, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam. Appellant Luis Rivera Newton appeals\n\nfrom an order of pretrial detention.          We have independently\n\nreviewed        the    decision,    “giving    deference      to    the\n\ndetermination    of    the   district   court.”   United   States     v.\n\nO’Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 814 (1st Cir. 1990).           Upon careful\n\nreview of the sparse record before us and of the judge’s\n\nreasons for ordering detention, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that detention is warranted here on the grounds that\n\n“no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\n\nassure the appearance of the person as required and the\n\nsafety of any other person and the community.” 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3142(e).     We therefore affirm.\n\n           The presumption under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) applies\n\nin this case because appellant is charged in a federal\n\nindictment    with    drug   trafficking   offenses   that    carry    a\n\nmaximum penalty in excess of ten years under the Controlled\n\nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.           See United States\n\nv. Dillon, 938 F.2d 1412, 1416 (1st Cir. 1991).              Appellant\n\nhas produced evidence to rebut the presumption, including\n\nevidence of family and business ties to Puerto Rico, of no\n\nprior criminal convictions and of compliance with conditions\n\nof pretrial release imposed by the Puerto Rico courts where\n\fappellant’s trial on murder charges has been pending for\n\nalmost five years.\n\n            Despite    appellant’s         evidence     to     rebut     the\n\npresumption, the district court properly ruled that the\n\nstatutory presumption continues to carry weight. See United\n\nStates v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 389 (1st Cir. 1985).                     The\n\nnature    and   circumstances      of      the    offenses     with    which\n\nappellant is charged indicate that appellant was involved in\n\nthe type of drug operations that were “at the center of\n\nCongressional concern.” Id. at 387.                 The number of co-\n\nconspirators    and    the    scope   of    the    charged     conspiracy,\n\ninvolving the establishment of drug distribution points\n\nthroughout Puerto Rico, suggest a drug trafficking operation\n\nthat     resembles    the    paradigm      underlying    the     statutory\n\npresumption.     The district court’s finding that Rivera has\n\n“ready access to large amounts of cash not derived from a\n\nlegitimate source” also suggests involvement in the kind of\n\nlucrative drug operations with which Congress was concerned.\n\n            I. Risk of Flight\n\n            While the statutory presumption weighs in favor of\n\na finding that Rivera presents a risk of flight, several\n\nfactors weigh against such a finding.               The district court\n\nfound that Rivera has strong family ties to Puerto Rico and\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhe owns a business there.              He has no prior criminal record.\n\nIn    the    context    of    the     offenses      charged    in        this    case,\n\nhowever, these factors do not tip the balance on the risk of\n\nflight issue.          See Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d 15, 18 (1 st\n\nCir.    1987)(affirming         detention      order     where       §    3142(e)’s\n\npresumption applied despite appellants’ strong family ties\n\nand    the    absence    of     any    prior     drug-related         arrests          or\n\nconvictions).\n\n              Rivera’s       record     of    reporting       daily       to     local\n\nofficials      during    the    almost       five    years    that       he     was    on\n\nrelease pending trial in the Puerto Rico courts weighs\n\nagainst a finding of risk of flight.                  However, the district\n\ncourt found that no action has occurred in the Puerto Rico\n\ncase   since     1997    and    that    no    trial    date    has        been      set.\n\nRivera’s reporting history is no guarantee that he won’t\n\nflee when the trial date draws near.                          Rivera disputes\n\nthe district court’s findings that he violated the terms of\n\nhis    release    on    local       charges    by     participating            in     the\n\nconspiracy charged and by working at his liquor store.                                 We\n\nneed not resolve that issue.                   Even without relying upon\n\nthose findings of the district court, the risk of flight\n\ndetermination,         “while    perhaps       not    inevitable,             seems     a\n\nsupportable exercise of [the district court’s] factfinding\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\ffunction.” United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 793 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n           II. Dangerousness\n\n           The § 3142(e) presumption is based, in part, upon\n\nCongress’ findings that drug traffickers are often engaged\n\nin continuing patterns of criminal activity.                See Palmer-\n\nContreras, 835 F.2d at 17.            That generalization seems to\n\napply here, where the charged conspiracy spanned almost ten\n\nyears and continued for four years after Rivera’s arrest on\n\nmurder charges under Puerto Rico law.            Rivera points to the\n\nfact    that   he   has   no   record    of    criminal    convictions.\n\nHowever, the indictment charges that his involvement in the\n\nconspiracy began in 1988, when he was only twenty years old.\n\nTherefore, his absence of a criminal record carries less\n\nweight than it would for an older person.\n\n           The district court expressed specific concern about\n\nthe danger that Rivera’s release would present to witnesses\n\nwho    would   be   testifying    against      him   at    trial.   The\n\nindictment charges that the conspiracy was accomplished by\n\nthe use of violence and specifically charges that Rivera\n\n“planned or participated in the kidnaping, torturing and\n\nexecution” of four people (at the Cayey Massacre).                  The\n\nmagistrate-judge      found    that     most   of    the   government’s\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fevidence   against   Rivera   consists    of   statements   of\n\ncooperating witnesses or co-conspirators.       Rivera argues\n\nthat this shows that the evidence against him is weak.\n\nHowever, it also creates a special risk of danger if he is\n\nreleased: danger of harm to prospective witnesses. Compare\n\nPatriarca, 948 F.2d at 792.         That danger is especially\n\npronounced here because Rivera is charged with participating\n\nin a conspiracy that regularly used violence to threaten and\n\nintimidate.\n\n           For these reasons, along with others specified by\n\nthe district court judge, we agree with the district court\n\nthat Rivera’s detention pending trial is warranted on the\n\ngrounds of risk of flight and dangerousness.\n\n           The order of pretrial detention is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\f",
