  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION   NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\n    For the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 98-1945\r\n\n   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\n           Appellee,\r\n\n               v.\r\n\n       PHILLIP A. LAFOND,\r\n\n     Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n[Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n             Before\r\n\n     Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nCoffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nRoderick B. O'Connor, by appointment of the court, on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C. Lockhart\r\nand Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief\r\nfor the United States.\r\n\nSeptember 21, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  In this criminal appeal, the defendant (who\r\ndid not move to withdraw his plea in the district court) asks us to\r\nset aside his conviction and the guilty plea upon which it was\r\npremised.  He claims that he \"fail[ed] to understand that the\r\nconduct of others could be imputed to him\" in calculating his\r\nguideline sentencing range, and that, therefore, his guilty plea\r\nwas not knowing and intelligently made.  Appellant's Brief at 6.\r\nIn our view, this claim is no more than a claim that the\r\ndefendant received a harsher sentence than he had anticipated.  But\r\nthe record makes manifest that the appellant had ample warning. \r\nHis assertion to the contrary is flatly contradicted both by the\r\nrelevant provisions of the plea agreement and by the painstaking\r\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11 colloquy conducted by the district court.  The\r\nclaim also runs afoul of settled precedent.  See, e.g., United\r\nStates v. De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d 125, 127-28 (1st Cir. 1994).  We\r\nneed go no further.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",
