Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Robert M.

Defendant Robert M. Barry appeals from\r\nthe denial of his motion to correct his sentence, filed under\r\nFed. R. Crim. P. 36.  We have carefully reviewed the record and\r\nthe parties' briefs and conclude that the addition of\r\nrestitution in the written judgment of conviction was\r\nauthorized by Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c).  See United States v.\r\nUccio, 917 F.2d 80 (2d Cir. 1990).  Because the district court\r\nhad the power to make this correction, there is no error in the\r\nwritten judgment and defendant is not entitled to its\r\ncorrection.\r\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  See\r\nLocal Rule 27.1.\n",
