Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\fApril 25, 2000\n\f             STAHL, Circuit Judge. The Defendant, Orlando Escalera,\n\nappeals      the   sentence    he    received      after   pleading     guilty   to\n\nvarious drug-related offenses.                For the following reasons, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n                                     Background\n\n             On October 9, 1997, a grand jury indicted Escalera,\n\nTonya Laythe, Scott Gilley, and Rolando Cartagena on a number of\n\ndrug-trafficking       charges.          Escalera       faced   one     count    of\n\nconspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, see 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846, as well as nine counts of possessing with intent\n\nto distribute and distributing cocaine, see id. § 841(a)(1).\n\n             On March 26, 1998, Escalera pleaded guilty to all\n\ncounts.       Consistent      with    Rule    32   of   the   Federal    Rules   of\n\nCriminal Procedure, a probation officer prepared a presentence\n\nreport (\"PSR\") that described the crimes that Escalera had\n\ncommitted and also discussed his personal background.                      See Fed.\n\nR.   Crim.    P.   32(b)(4).         After    considering     the   PSR,    hearing\n\narguments from counsel, and giving the defendant the opportunity\n\nto speak, the district court sentenced Escalera to seventy\n\nmonths in prison plus five years of supervised release and a\n\n$1000 special assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f               Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"the\n\nGuidelines\"), the district court arrived at this sentence using\n\na base offense level of twenty-six, see U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(7),\n\nwith a two-level increase because Escalera's crimes involved an\n\nunderage       individual,       see   id.    §    2D1.2(a)(1)         (\"the    underage\n\nenhancement\"), and a two-level increase to reflect Escalera's\n\nrole     in      those    offenses,     see       id.   §     3B1.1(c)     (\"the       role\n\nenhancement\").           The court also reduced Escalera's offense level\n\nby three, finding acceptance of responsibility.                               See id. §\n\n3E1.1(b).        On appeal, Escalera challenges both of the sentencing\n\nenhancements by the district court.\n\n                                         II.\n\n               Escalera now contends that the district court should\n\nnot    have      increased     his    base    offense       level    to   reflect       the\n\ninvolvement of an underage individual pursuant to § 2D1.2(a)(1)\n\nof    the     Guidelines,      even    though      he   did    not     challenge       this\n\nenhancement at sentencing.               In fact, when the district court\n\nsought      to    confirm      that    the    enhancement           was   appropriate,\n\nEscalera's        attorney      explicitly      said,       \"[y]es.\"      Under       these\n\ncircumstances,           any   objections     to    the     enhancement        have    been\n\nforfeited.        See United States v. Pilgrim Market Corp., 944 F.2d\n\n14, 21 (1st Cir. 1991).                 We will uphold the trial court's\n\ndecision         to   apply     the    enhancement          unless     that     decision\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fconstitutes a plain error that affects substantial rights and\n\nthat   would   \"seriously     affect[]     the   fairness,    integrity,     or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings\" if left unredressed.\n\nJohnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 467 (1997) (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Given this standard of review, we turn to the merits.\n\nSection 2D1.2(a)(1) of the Guidelines prescribes a two-level\n\nincrease to the base offense level of a defendant who involves\n\nan underage individual in a drug-related offense.                     Although\n\nEscalera argues that this provision applies only to some drug-\n\nrelated crimes and not to others, such as the ones to which he\n\npleaded   guilty,      he   concedes   that      another    section    of   the\n\nGuidelines would have provided an alternative basis for the same\n\nsentencing enhancement.         See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.4 (prescribing a\n\ntwo-level enhancement if the defendant \"used or attempted to use\n\na person less than eighteen years of age\" in the commission of\n\nan offense).        Whether supported by § 2D1.2 or § 3B1.4 of the\n\nGuidelines,    it    is   evident   that   the   district    court    had   the\n\nauthority to increase Escalera's offense level by two if he used\n\nsomeone under eighteen years old to commit the crimes at issue.\n\n           During Escalera's plea colloquy, the government made\n\nan offer of proof that from at least May 5, 1997 through\n\nSeptember 29, 1997, Escalera, Laythe, and Gilley had conspired\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fto traffic cocaine and had sold at least 599.6 grams of cocaine\n\nin nine transactions to an undercover police officer.                     The\n\ngovernment   specifically       represented      that   Laythe     was   under\n\neighteen years old during part of this time and that she had\n\n\"sold   cocaine   with    and   at   the    direction   of   Mr.   Escalera.\"\n\nEscalera's PSR similarly stated that Laythe, who \"was less than\n\n18 years old for each of the cocaine transactions described in\n\nCounts 2 through 8\" of the Indictment, had \"sold cocaine with\n\nand at the direction of defendant Escalera.\"             Although Escalera\n\nprovided the district court with a letter maintaining that\n\nLaythe sometimes had sold drugs on her own, he never disputed\n\nthat she sometimes had sold drugs under his direction while she\n\nwas under eighteen.\n\n           On these facts, the district court properly concluded\n\nthat Escalera had used someone under eighteen years old in the\n\ncommission   of   an     offense,    thereby    warranting     a   two-level\n\nincrease in his base offense level.            There was no plain error.\n\nSee Johnson, 520 U.S. at 467.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Escalera also argues that the district court erred in\n\napplying the role in the offense enhancement to his sentence.\n\nBefore reaching the merits of this claim, we again must consider\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwhether Escalera has preserved the issue for full appellate\n\nreview.\n\n             Before Escalera pleaded guilty, the government made an\n\noffer   of    proof   that      detailed      his    involvement      in   the    drug-\n\ntrafficking      conspiracy.            In     particular,          the    government\n\nrepresented that from at least May 5, 1997 through September 29,\n\n1997:\n\n             Laythe sold cocaine with and at the\n             direction of Mr. Escalera.     Mr. Escalera\n             arranged for the receipt of cocaine from his\n             source, and Laythe would make and receive\n             telephone calls to arrange the sale of that\n             cocaine and then deliver the cocaine to\n             customers. Laythe received payment for the\n             cocaine which she then gave to Escalera, and\n             she acted on his behalf as an interpreter.\n\nWhen asked, Escalera advised the district court that he agreed\n\nwith this proffer and that he had nothing to add to it.\n\n             Escalera's PSR confirmed that Escalera had been the\n\n\"decision-maker       and      leader    of    the     conspiracy.\"          It   also\n\nindicated that Escalera had directed not only Laythe but also\n\nGilley,      Cartagena,     and    an   unnamed       source   of    their   cocaine\n\nsupply.       Because     the     conspiracy        appeared   to     involve      five\n\nparticipants, the PSR urged the district court to apply a four-\n\nlevel   enhancement       to      Escalera's        base   offense    level.        See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a) (prescribing a four-level increase \"[i]f the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdefendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that\n\ninvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\").\n\n          Rather     than    challenging        whether        he    had   played     a\n\nleadership role in the conspiracy, Escalera merely argued that\n\na   two-level    instead     of    a    four-level      role    enhancement         was\n\nappropriate     because     it    was   unclear   exactly           how   many    other\n\nparticipants he had organized or supervised in addition to\n\nLaythe and Gilley.     See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c) (prescribing a two-\n\nlevel increase \"[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader,\n\nmanager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\" and less than\n\nfive participants were involved).               The government agreed with\n\nEscalera's      position,    and       the   district    court        accepted      it,\n\nimposing only a two-level role enhancement.\n\n          By asking the district court to impose a two-level role\n\nenhancement at sentencing, Escalera almost certainly waived his\n\nright to object to that enhancement on appeal.                            See    United\n\nStates v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A party\n\nwaives a right when it makes an intentional relinquishment or\n\nabandonment of it.\" (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).      But even if Escalera's position at sentencing fell\n\nshort of an actual waiver, he unquestionably forfeited his\n\nobjections to the enhancement by failing to raise them until\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fnow.   As a result, we review the propriety of the two-level role\n\nenhancement only for plain error.        See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 467.\n\n          Escalera's    PSR     supported    the   conclusion   that   the\n\ndefendant had been involved in a drug-trafficking conspiracy in\n\nwhich he controlled a source of supply and directed Laythe,\n\nGilley, and possibly others to sell cocaine on his behalf.\n\nAlthough Escalera argued that Laythe and Gilley sometimes had\n\nsold cocaine for their own benefit, he did not dispute that they\n\nsometimes had sold drugs under his direction.             Thus, in the\n\nabsence of any meaningful evidence to the contrary, the district\n\ncourt was free to credit the PSR insofar as it suggested that\n\nEscalera had played a leadership role in the conspiracy.               See\n\nUnited States   v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(\"Facts   contained    in   a   presentence    report   ordinarily     are\n\nconsidered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.\"). Having\n\nmade the requisite factual findings, the district court properly\n\napplied a two-level role enhancement under § 3B1.1(c) of the\n\nGuidelines.   There was no plain error.            See United States v.\n\nGraciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[B]attles over a\n\ndefendant's status and over the scope of the criminal enterprise\n\nwill almost always be won or lost in the district court.\").\n\n                                   IV.\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's sentence.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                           -10-\n\f",

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (1997) (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Given this standard of review, we turn to the merits.\n\nSection 2D1.2(a)(1) of the Guidelines prescribes a two-level\n\nincrease to the base offense level of a defendant who involves\n\nan underage individual in a drug-related offense.                     Although\n\nEscalera argues that this provision applies only to some drug-\n\nrelated crimes and not to others, such as the ones to which he\n\npleaded   guilty,      he   concedes   that      another    section    of   the\n\nGuidelines would have provided an alternative basis for the same\n\nsentencing enhancement.         See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.4 (prescribing a\n\ntwo-level enhancement if the defendant \"used or attempted to use\n\na person less than eighteen years of age\" in the commission of\n\nan offense).        Whether supported by § 2D1.2 or § 3B1.4 of the\n\nGuidelines,    it    is   evident   that   the   district    court    had   the\n\nauthority to increase Escalera's offense level by two if he used\n\nsomeone under eighteen years old to commit the crimes at issue.\n\n           During Escalera's plea colloquy, the government made\n\nan offer of proof that from at least May 5, 1997 through\n\nSeptember 29, 1997, Escalera, Laythe, and Gilley had conspired\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fto traffic cocaine and had sold at least 599.6 grams of cocaine\n\nin nine transactions to an undercover police officer.                     The\n\ngovernment   specifically       represented      that   Laythe     was   under\n\neighteen years old during part of this time and that she had\n\n\"sold   cocaine   with    and   at   the    direction   of   Mr.   Escalera.\"\n\nEscalera's PSR similarly stated that Laythe, who \"was less than\n\n18 years old for each of the cocaine transactions described in\n\nCounts 2 through 8\" of the Indictment, had \"sold cocaine with\n\nand at the direction of defendant Escalera.\"             Although Escalera\n\nprovided the district court with a letter maintaining that\n\nLaythe sometimes had sold drugs on her own, he never disputed\n\nthat she sometimes had sold drugs under his direction while she\n\nwas under eighteen.\n\n           On these facts, the district court properly concluded\n\nthat Escalera had used someone under eighteen years old in the\n\ncommission   of   an     offense,    thereby    warranting     a   two-level\n\nincrease in his base offense level.            There was no plain error.\n\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Johnson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Escalera also argues that the district court erred in\n\napplying the role in the offense enhancement to his sentence.\n\nBefore reaching the merits of this claim, we again must consider\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwhether Escalera has preserved the issue for full appellate\n\nreview.\n\n             Before Escalera pleaded guilty, the government made an\n\noffer   of    proof   that      detailed      his    involvement      in   the    drug-\n\ntrafficking      conspiracy.            In     particular,          the    government\n\nrepresented that from at least May 5, 1997 through September 29,\n\n1997:\n\n             Laythe sold cocaine with and at the\n             direction of Mr. Escalera.     Mr. Escalera\n             arranged for the receipt of cocaine from his\n             source, and Laythe would make and receive\n             telephone calls to arrange the sale of that\n             cocaine and then deliver the cocaine to\n             customers. Laythe received payment for the\n             cocaine which she then gave to Escalera, and\n             she acted on his behalf as an interpreter.\n\nWhen asked, Escalera advised the district court that he agreed\n\nwith this proffer and that he had nothing to add to it.\n\n             Escalera's PSR confirmed that Escalera had been the\n\n\"decision-maker       and      leader    of    the     conspiracy.\"          It   also\n\nindicated that Escalera had directed not only Laythe but also\n\nGilley,      Cartagena,     and    an   unnamed       source   of    their   cocaine\n\nsupply.       Because     the     conspiracy        appeared   to     involve      five\n\nparticipants, the PSR urged the district court to apply a four-\n\nlevel   enhancement       to      Escalera's        base   offense    level.        See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a) (prescribing a four-level increase \"[i]f the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdefendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that\n\ninvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\").\n\n          Rather     than    challenging        whether        he    had   played     a\n\nleadership role in the conspiracy, Escalera merely argued that\n\na   two-level    instead     of    a    four-level      role    enhancement         was\n\nappropriate     because     it    was   unclear   exactly           how   many    other\n\nparticipants he had organized or supervised in addition to\n\nLaythe and Gilley.     See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c) (prescribing a two-\n\nlevel increase \"[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader,\n\nmanager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\" and less than\n\nfive participants were involved).               The government agreed with\n\nEscalera's      position,    and       the   district    court        accepted      it,\n\nimposing only a two-level role enhancement.\n\n          By asking the district court to impose a two-level role\n\nenhancement at sentencing, Escalera almost certainly waived his\n\nright to object to that enhancement on appeal.                            See    United\n\nStates v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196797\"><a href=\"/opinion/196797/united-states-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A party\n\nwaives a right when it makes an intentional relinquishment or\n\nabandonment of it.\" (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).      But even if Escalera's position at sentencing fell\n\nshort of an actual waiver, he unquestionably forfeited his\n\nobjections to the enhancement by failing to raise them until\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fnow.   As a result, we review the propriety of the two-level role\n\nenhancement only for plain error.

Thus, in the\n\nabsence of any meaningful evidence to the contrary, the district\n\ncourt was free to credit the PSR insofar as it suggested that\n\nEscalera had played a leadership role in the conspiracy.
