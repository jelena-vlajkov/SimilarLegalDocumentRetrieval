Romn and Brown &amp;\r\nUbarri were on brief for Ananas Grajales-Romero.\r\n\nOctober 26, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge. American Airlines, Inc. appeals\r\nfrom a judgment of $150,000 in favor of Ananas Grajales-Romero,\r\nwho was injured by a collapsing check-in counter sign at an airport\r\nin St. Kitts.  American claims that the court erred in allowing the\r\ncase to go to the jury on the plaintiff's theory that American was\r\nliable for the negligence of Executive Airlines, d/b/a/ American\r\nEagle, which American argues actually owned, operated, and\r\nmaintained the check-in counter.  American further claims that\r\nthere was insufficient evidence of negligence to sustain the jury\r\nverdict in this case, and that the court erred by not vacating or\r\nremitting the damages award, striking certain defense witnesses,\r\nadmitting some evidence offered by plaintiff, and refusing to give\r\nseveral jury instructions proposed by American.  Grajales cross-\r\nappeals, claiming that the court erred in not awarding attorney's\r\nfees on the basis of the \"obstinacy\" of the defendants.  We affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\nFactual background\r\nWe present the facts as a jury might have found them,\r\nconsistent with the record but in the light most favorable to the\r\nverdict.  See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d\r\n148, 151 (1st Cir. 1990).  On July 29, 1994, Plaintiff Ananas\r\nGrajales-Romero (\"Grajales\") was waiting in line at an American\r\nEagle check-in counter in the St. Kitts airport for a return\r\nflight to San Juan, Puerto Rico.  His acquaintance Terry Connor had\r\naccompanied him to the check-in counter.  Connor attempted to load\r\nGrajales's luggage onto the weigh-in scale adjacent to the check-in\r\ncounter.  In doing so, he grabbed onto an ashtray built into the\r\ncountertop to gain some leverage in lifting the luggage.  The\r\ncountertop was attached by a hinge to the vertical front facing of\r\nthe counter.  When Connor pulled on the ashtray, the countertop\r\ncame loose, and pivoted forward on its hinge.  A metal signpost and\r\nsign were attached to the countertop, and this signpost and sign\r\nalso pivoted forward with the countertop.  As this was happening,\r\nplaintiff Grajales was looking down at his ticket.  The signpost\r\nand/or sign struck Grajales on the top of his head, opening up a\r\ntwo-inch long wound.  Although he did not lose consciousness or\r\nfall to the floor, he was taken to the St. Kitts hospital, where he\r\nreceived four stitches.  After the accident, Grajales experienced\r\nneck pains, headaches, and forgetfulness.  He was diagnosed by a\r\nneurologist as suffering from post-concussion syndrome and a\r\ncervical sprain secondary to the accident. \r\nGrajales filed a complaint against American, AMR Corp.,\r\nand AMR Eagle, Inc. in the federal district court for the District\r\nof Puerto Rico on July 28, 1995. On February 11, 1997, the district\r\ncourt dismissed the claims against co-defendants AMR Corp. and AMR\r\nEagle, Inc. for lack of personal jurisdiction.  During the course\r\nof trial, held from May 20 to May 27, 1998, American claimed that\r\nits witnesses Tomas del Valle and Fred Voltaggio were unavailable\r\nbecause they had been transferred to other positions with American.\r\nIn their place, American offered the testimony of employees who now\r\nheld the posts vacated by del Valle and Voltaggio; however, the\r\ncourt struck the replacement witnesses because they had not been\r\ndisclosed in the course of pre-trial discovery.  While Voltaggio\r\neventually testified, del Valle did not, and the court granted a\r\nmissing witness instruction telling the jurors that they could\r\ninfer that the testimony of del Valle would have been unfavorable\r\nto American.  The court refused to give an instruction on the\r\ndoctrine of res ipsa loquitur requested by Grajales, and refused\r\nseveral instructions offered by American.  The jury found American\r\nliable in the amount of $150,000.  The court issued its judgment\r\naccordingly, and refused Grajales' claim for attorney's fees under\r\nPuerto Rican law.  Both parties appealed.\r\n                            II.\r\nAgency by Apparent Authority\r\nAmerican argues that there was insufficient evidence to\r\nsupport a finding that it was liable under agency principles for\r\nany negligence by Executive Airlines.  It claims that the theories\r\nadvanced by Grajales to establish American's liability for the\r\naccident   namely, agency by estoppel and agency by apparent\r\nauthority   were a subterfuge allowing Grajales to forum-shop into\r\nfederal court, where he was entitled to a jury trial.  See Marshall\r\nv. Perez Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 849 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Puerto Rico,\r\na civil law jurisdiction, never uses juries in civil cases\").  We\r\nwill address only Grajales's \"apparent authority\" claim, which\r\nprovides an adequate basis for American's liability.\r\nUnder Puerto Rico law, an apparent principal may be held\r\nliable for the acts of its apparent agent where the apparent\r\nprincipal's actions \"led the plaintiffs to reasonably believe [in\r\nits] representation\" of authority and control over the apparent\r\nagent, through the apparent principal's conduct, including its\r\n\"silence, evasive language and appearances.\"  Berros v. U.P.R.,\r\n116 D.P.R. 88, 16 P.R. Offic. Trans. 112, 122 (1985).  The Supreme\r\nCourt of Puerto Rico has applied the doctrine where \"persons who\r\nused the services of the [apparent agent] could not possibly know\r\nor had no way of knowing that the entity they were dealing with was\r\nnot\" the apparent principal or an agent thereof.  Id. at 122-23.\r\nThe Court has also applied the doctrine where the plaintiff\r\n\"trusted in good faith\" in defendant's conduct, and where that\r\n\"trust could lead a reasonable person to believe that in fact there\r\nwas a principal-agent relationship.\"  Vega v. Medical Serv. Admin.,\r\n117 D.P.R. 138, 17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 163, 173 (1986).\r\nThe evidence produced at trial was more than sufficient\r\nto allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Grajales trusted in\r\ngood faith in conduct that \"could lead a reasonable person to\r\nbelieve that in fact there was a principal-agent relationship.\"\r\nSpecifically, the jury could have found that Grajales's ticket,\r\nissued by American Airlines, identified the carrier as \"AA,\" an\r\nabbreviation for American Airlines.  The telephone information line\r\nfor American Eagle flights is the American Airlines telephone\r\ninformation line.  The passenger check-in counters in both San Juan\r\nand St. Kitts bore American Airlines logos as well as American\r\nEagle logos.  The in-flight magazines on Grajales's flight were the\r\nAmerican Airlines magazines \"American Ways\" and \"Latitudes.\" The\r\npersonnel staffing the flights wore uniforms and nametags closely\r\nresembling American Airlines uniforms and nametags.  American\r\nAirlines' destination guide (a schedule of flight availability)\r\nlists St. Kitts as a destination.  Grajales testified that he\r\nrelied on such information in choosing to fly with American Eagle,\r\nand that he assumed it was part of American Airlines.  A reasonable\r\njury could conclude from these facts that American's conduct led\r\nGrajales reasonably to believe that there was in fact a principal-\r\nagent relationship between American and Executive Airlines d/b/a/\r\nAmerican Eagle, and thus American would be liable for any\r\nnegligence on the part of Executive.\r\n                            III.\r\nSufficiency of the Evidence of Negligence\r\n(a) Res Ipsa Loquitur\r\nAmerican states that\r\n  [p]laintiff produced no evidence   either through\r\ncustomary airline practices, past practices, or expert\r\ntestimony   to establish a standard of care by which\r\nAmerican should have operated. Further, plaintiff\r\npresented no evidence regarding the inspection,\r\nmaintenance, and operation of the ticket counter, and\r\nmade no attempt to explain in what manner any such\r\nconduct might have constituted negligence.\r\n\nFrom these assertions, and the fact that the court refused to give\r\nthe jurors Grajales's proposed res ipsa loquitur instruction,\r\nAmerican argues that \"[n]o jury could reasonably conclude that\r\nAmerican exercised less than reasonable care from the unexplained\r\nfact that an accident occurred.\"  \r\nWe agree with American that Grajales did not produce\r\neither direct or circumstantial evidence explaining how American\r\nviolated its duty of care.  Grajales offered no evidence, for\r\nexample, suggesting that the ticket counter had been improperly\r\ndesigned, installed, maintained, or operated.  Instead, Grajales\r\nrelied on the fact of an unexpected occurrence, arguing that the\r\ncounter top would not have fallen over and struck him unless\r\nAmerican had violated its duty of care.  The Supreme Court of\r\nPuerto Rico has ruled that the fact of an unexplained occurrence\r\ncannot establish an inference of negligence unless the conditions\r\nof res ipsa loquitur are satisfied: \"(1) the accident must be of a\r\nkind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's\r\nnegligence; (2) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality\r\nwithin the exclusive control of defendant; [and] (3) it must not be\r\ndue to any voluntary action on the part of plaintiff.\" See\r\nCommunity Partnership v. Presbyterian Hosp., 88 P.R.R. 379, 386\r\n(1963).  Given the lack of direct or other circumstantial evidence\r\non American's violation of its duty of care, we must consider\r\nwhether the conditions of res ipsa loquitur were satisfied here.\r\nWe conclude that they were.  Indeed, the first two\r\nelements of res ipsa loquitur were easily established.  A\r\nreasonable jury could have concluded that the accident was of a\r\nkind which \"ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's\r\nnegligence,\" and that the accident was \"caused by an . . .\r\ninstrumentality within the exclusive control of [the] defendant.\" \r\nSee Colmenares-Vivas v. Sun Alliance Ins. Co., 807 F.2d 1102, 1106\r\n(1st Cir. 1986) (\"[R]es ipsa loquitur applies [if] . . .  the\r\ndefendant is responsible for the instrumentality\") (applying Puerto\r\nRico law).\r\nThe res ipsa loquitur requirement that the accident not\r\nbe caused by any \"voluntary action\" on the part of the plaintiff\r\nposed a more difficult challenge for Grajales.  American argues\r\nthat a res ipsa loquitur inference was unreasonable because the\r\nevidence indicates that plaintiff's acquaintance Connor took the\r\n\"voluntary action\" of pulling on the counter-top.  Even if Connor's\r\nactions could be attributed to Grajales, American's argument misses\r\nits mark.  The test is not whether the plaintiff took any voluntary\r\naction, but whether that voluntary action can be blamed for the\r\naccident.  See De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros 931\r\nF.2d 116, 126 (1st Cir. 1991) (plaintiff must be \"free of voluntary\r\nresponsibility for the occurrence\") (applying Puerto Rico law). \r\nThe evidence here was sufficient to support a finding that Grajales\r\nand his colorable agent Connor were blameless, having done nothing\r\nmore than \"attempt to [use the instrumentality] in the ordinary\r\nmanner,\" Colmenares-Vivas, 807 F.2d at 1107.  So long as the jurors\r\ncould have concluded from the evidence that Connor's use of the\r\ncounter for leverage constituted a normal usage of the counter by\r\na customer, the jury could have inferred American's negligence.\r\nWhile there was sufficient evidence on each of the\r\nconditions of res ipsa loquitur, the district court did not provide\r\nthe jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction, as Grajales had\r\nrequested.  We must therefore consider an argument implicit in\r\nAmerican's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of\r\nnegligence  that a jury verdict cannot be justified on the basis\r\nof res ipsa loquitur when the jurors were never instructed on the\r\ndoctrine.\r\nPuerto Rico's statement of the three elements of res ipsa\r\nloquitur is derived from the first edition of a well-known treatise\r\non evidence, 4 Wigmore, Evidence  2509 (1st ed. 1905). See W. Page\r\nKeeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts 244 (Lawyer's 5th ed.\r\n1984).  That origin confirms that a res ipsa loquitur instruction\r\nexplains to the jury a specific form of permissible inference from\r\ncircumstantial evidence of negligence.   Given this purpose, jurors\r\nwho can draw the inference of negligence even without a res ipsa\r\nloquitur instruction should be permitted to do so.  Justice Traynor\r\ncame to the same conclusion:\r\n        The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur concerns a\r\n        type of circumstantial evidence upon which\r\n        plaintiff may rely to discharge his burden of\r\n        proving defendant's negligence. . . .  There\r\n        is no reason why the jury may not draw that\r\n        inference without, as well as with, a specific\r\n        instruction authorizing them to do so. \r\n\nSee Rose v. Melody Lane, 247 P.2d 335, 339 (Cal. 1952).  In this\r\ncase, the jurors were adequately instructed on inference and\r\ncircumstantial evidence, and Grajales made the specific inference\r\ncontemplated by a res ipsa loquitur instruction the linchpin of his\r\ntheory of the case.  Given that there was sufficient evidence on\r\neach of the res ipsa loquitur requirements, the jurors were\r\nentitled to make the res ipsa loquitur inference even in the\r\nabsence of a specific instruction.   \r\n(b) Proximate Cause\r\nAmerican protests that there was insufficient evidence to\r\nallow the jury to find that its negligence was the proximate cause\r\nof Grajales's injuries.  The res ipsa loquitur doctrine only\r\npermits an inference that the defendant engaged in negligent\r\nconduct. See Colmenares-Vivas, 807 F.2d at 1104.  The plaintiff\r\nstill must prove that the negligent conduct was the proximate cause\r\nof the accident.  cf. Donnelly v. National R.R. Passenger Corp.\r\n(Amtrak), 16 F.3d 941, 946 (8th Cir. 1994) (\"res ipsa loquitur has\r\nno application to proximate cause\") (North Dakota law); Daniels v.\r\nTwin Oaks Nursing Home, 692 F.2d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 1982) (same)\r\n(Alabama law).  \r\nIn Puerto Rico, to establish proximate cause, the\r\nplaintiff must prove that an accident was foreseeable and could\r\nhave been avoided if the defendant had not breached its duty of\r\ncare.  See Coyne v. Taber Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 459 (1st Cir.\r\n1995); Marshall v. Perez Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir.\r\n1987).  The defendant can defeat proximate causation by proving the\r\noccurrence of an \"intervening cause\" that was not foreseeable.  See\r\nMalave-Felix v. Volvo Car Corp., 946 F.2d 967, 972 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nA reasonable jury could easily have found that Grajales\r\nsatisfied his proximate causation burden.  See Coyne 53 F.3d at 460\r\n(\"[S]uch questions ordinarily are grist for the factfinder's\r\nmill.\").  There was ample evidence produced at trial that\r\nAmerican's negligence   its failure to secure the countertop\r\nproperly   created a foreseeable risk of an accident of the general\r\ntype involved in this case.  See Malave-Felix 946 F.2d at 972\r\n(\"precise risk\" or \"exact result\" need not be foreseeable). \r\nMoreover, American did not offer sufficient evidence of an\r\nunforeseeable intervening cause to compel us to reverse.  As we\r\nnoted in our discussion of res ipsa loquitur, a reasonable jury\r\ncould have concluded that Connor's actions were blameless.  For the\r\nsame reasons, a jury could have concluded that a customer's use of\r\nthe counter for leverage was not the type of unforeseeable event\r\nthat creates an \"intervening cause\" and clears American of causal\r\nresponsibility.  \r\n                            IV.\r\nAmerican's miscellaneous objections\r\n(a) Exclusion of substitute witnesses\r\nIn response to Grajales's interrogatories (and also in an\r\ninitial scheduling memorandum), American indicated that its trial\r\nwitnesses would include Tomas del Valle, who was president of\r\nExecutive Airlines at the time of the accident, and Fred Voltaggio,\r\nwho was Manager for Support Services for American Airlines at that\r\ntime.  American then attempted, in its proposed pretrial order, to\r\nsubstitute Jos Machado, current Vice President of Flight\r\nOperations for Executive Airlines, for del Valle, who had left\r\nExecutive Airlines to become the Managing Director for American's\r\noperations at Los Angeles International Airport.  American also\r\nattempted to substitute Ernesto Quidgley, Manager for Support\r\nServices for American Airlines, for Voltaggio, who had become\r\nregional manager for American Airlines' Carribean cargo sales by\r\nthe time of trial. \r\nGrajales filed a motion before a magistrate judge \r\nopposing the witness substitutions on the grounds that the new\r\nwitnesses had not been properly disclosed during the course of\r\ndiscovery.  The magistrate judge granted that motion on May 14,\r\n1998.  Four days later, American filed a motion before the trial\r\ncourt seeking reconsideration of the magistrate judge's ruling. \r\nThe trial court agreed to reconsider the matter but, in an oral\r\norder on May 20, 1998, it reaffirmed the magistrate judge's ruling\r\nand excluded the substitute witnesses as a discovery sanction for\r\nAmerican's failure to disclose them in the appropriate pretrial\r\ndisclosures as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). \r\nRule 37(c)(1) provides an exclusionary sanction for\r\nfailures to disclose witnesses as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26:\r\n\"A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose\r\ninformation required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e)(1) shall not, unless\r\nsuch failure is harmless, be permitted to use as evidence at trial\r\n. . . any witness . . . not so disclosed.\"  A district court's Rule\r\n37 sanctions decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See\r\nBarreto v. Citibank, 907 F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam).\r\nHere, it is undisputed that Machado and Quidgley were not disclosed\r\nin response to plaintiff's interrogatories, as required by Rule 26. \r\nAmerican offered no excuse for failing to disclose Machado and\r\nQuidgley while discovery was open, stating only that it was now\r\n\"forced\" to call upon unannounced witnesses since del Valle and\r\nVoltaggio, its originally designated witnesses, no longer occupied\r\nthe same positions they held at the time of the accident.  The\r\ncourt noted, however, that del Valle and Voltaggio, regardless of\r\nany change in position, were currently employees of American,\r\nsubject to its control and available to testify.  On these facts,\r\nwe find no abuse of discretion in the court's refusal to allow\r\nunannounced witnesses to testify. \r\n(b) \"Missing Witness\" Instruction\r\nVoltaggio testified at trial; however, del Valle, while\r\npresent during some of the trial, failed to appear on the day the\r\ncourt expected him to testify.  Upon Grajales' request, the court\r\ngave a missing witness instruction.\r\nA \"missing witness\" instruction is permissible when a\r\nparty fails to call a witness who is either (1) \"favorably\r\ndisposed\" to testify for that party, by virtue of status or\r\nrelationship with the party or (2) \"peculiarly available\" to that\r\nparty, such as being within the party's \"exclusive control.\" \r\nUnited States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 38 (1st Cir. 1998).   We\r\nreview the grant and denial of missing witness instructions for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See id.  \r\nDel Valle had appeared in court during part of the trial\r\nbut then failed to reappear when his testimony was postponed until\r\nthe next business day.  The court found that del Valle, an employee\r\nof American, was under its control, and that American had offered\r\nno acceptable justification for del Valle's absence.  Thus there\r\nwas ample evidence that del Valle's status left him \"favorably\r\ndisposed\" to American and that he was \"peculiarly available\" to the\r\nairline.  Id.  Either one of these grounds is sufficient to justify\r\na missing witness instruction.  Moreover, the court suggested that\r\nAmerican had tactical reasons for not producing del Valle. \r\nSpecifically, del Valle's move from American Eagle to American\r\nAirlines undercut American's efforts to emphasize the minimal\r\nnature of the connection between the airlines.  We find no abuse\r\nof discretion in the court's issuance of a missing witness\r\ninstruction.\r\n(c) Admission of testimony about a non-testifying defense expert's\r\nreport\r\nGrajales submitted to a medical examination performed by\r\nDr. Juan J. Fumero-Prez (\"Fumero\"), an expert witness hired by\r\nAmerican.  American provided Dr. Fumero's report to Grajales, as\r\nrequired under Fed. R. Civ. P. 35(b).  In this report, Dr. Fumero\r\nconcluded that Grajales was suffering from a post-concussion\r\nsyndrome.  Apparently unhappy with this news, American notified\r\nGrajales that it was designating Fumero a non-testifying expert\r\nwitness under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B).  At trial, the court\r\nallowed Grajales to extract a brief mention of Fumero's conclusions\r\nfrom both American's medical expert and two medical experts hired\r\nby Grajales, Dr. Boris Rojas-Rodriguez  and  Dr. Maria T. Margarida\r\nJulia.  The court also allowed Grajales to introduce evidence that\r\nAmerican had initially hired Fumero. American argues that the\r\nreferences to the Fumero report were inadmissible hearsay and\r\nviolated Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B).   American also argues that\r\nevidence of the fact that it hired Fumero was unduly prejudicial\r\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 403.\r\nWe decline to consider American's hearsay challenge to\r\nthis evidence because it was not presented below.  Assuming\r\narguendo that American's other objections were valid, we find that\r\nany error in the admission of this evidence was harmless.  See Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 61.  Grajales invoked only brief references to the\r\nFumero report from the three experts, and Fumero's conclusions were\r\ncumulative of evidence presented convincingly and at great length\r\nby Grajales's experts.  American's \"substantial rights\" were thus\r\nunaffected.  Id.\r\n(d) American's proposed instructions\r\nAmerican objects to the court's refusal to give three\r\nproposed jury instructions. \"The function of the appellate court\r\nwith respect to jury instructions is to satisfy itself that the\r\ninstructions show no tendency to confuse or mislead the jury with\r\nrespect to the applicable principles of law.\"  Harrington v. United\r\nStates, 504 F.2d 1306, 1317 (1st Cir. 1974). \"Beyond that, the\r\ndistrict court's choice of jury instructions is a matter of\r\ndiscretion.\"  Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp., 798 F.2d 559, 564\r\n(1st Cir. 1986); see also Kelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F.3d\r\n335, 355 (1st Cir. 1998) (reviewing refusal of instruction for abuse\r\nof discretion).\r\n(1). Use of trademark as evidence of apparent authority\r\nThe court refused to give American's proposed final\r\ninstruction #25, which stated in relevant part that \"[t]he mere use\r\nof the trademark name, logo and color scheme by a third party is not\r\na legal indication that the owner of the name or logo has actual or\r\napparent control\" over the apparent agent.  The court did give a\r\nbroader instruction on apparent authority, not challenged on appeal,\r\nwhich closely tracked the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's articulation\r\nof the doctrine in Berros. The failure to include a more detailed,\r\nsupplemental instruction, even if accurate, is not error. See\r\nMarbucco Corp. v. Suffolk Constr. Co., 165 F.3d 103, 106 (1st Cir\r\n1999). \r\n(2). Failure to maintain proper medical records \r\nDr. Rojas, a neurologist, examined Grajales and testified\r\non his behalf as an expert witness.  He was not, however, Grajales'\r\ntreating physician and the medical examination was performed solely\r\nto assist Dr. Rojas in the preparation of his testimony.  Dr. Rojas\r\ntestified that he prepared his report on Grajales from handwritten\r\nrough notes and then discarded the notes.  American requested an\r\ninstruction stating that a doctor's failure to \"properly maintain\r\nhis medical records . . . diminishes the effectiveness of the\r\nrecords as a reference tool for evaluation of the treatment,\r\nattention and care the doctor gave the patient\" and \"should be\r\nconsidered when evaluating the credibility of the doctor regarding\r\nthe treatment he gave the patient.\"  The court refused to give this\r\ninstruction, ruling that the stated authority therefor, Sharon Riley\r\nv. Rodrguez de Pacheco, 119 D.P.R. 762, 780 (1987), was\r\ndistinguishable as a case where a physician was evaluating a patient\r\nfor the purposes of treatment and not solely for litigation\r\npurposes. That distinction is obvious from the wording of the\r\ninstruction.  In any event, the jury could have drawn the inference\r\ndescribed without instruction if they found that the facts merited\r\nit.  We find no abuse of discretion in the court's refusal to give\r\nthis instruction.\r\n(3). Definition of inference\r\nAmerican submitted two supplemental instructions on the\r\ndefinition of inference a few hours before the jury was to be\r\ninstructed.  The court refused to consider these new supplemental\r\ninstructions because they had been offered after the court's\r\nannounced deadline for such instructions.  The refusal to consider\r\nthese instructions as untimely was not an abuse of discretion. See\r\nSenra v. Cunningham, 9 F.3d 168, 171 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n                              V.\r\nReasonableness of the Damages Award\r\nAmerican argues that there was insufficient evidence to\r\nsupport the award of $150,000.  Pursuant to the federal rule, \"[a]\r\nverdict should stand unless it is 'grossly excessive,' 'inordinate,'\r\n'shocking to the conscience of the court,' or 'so high that it would\r\nbe a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\" Segal v. Gilbert\r\nColor Sys., Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1984).  Although the\r\ndefendant faces a heavy burden in meeting this standard, excessive\r\ndamage awards are not immune from review.  See,e.g., Koster v. Trans\r\nWorld Airlines, Inc., 181 F.3d 24, 35-36 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding\r\n$716,000 award for emotional distress caused by age discrimination\r\nto be excessive, and limiting recovery to $250,000).  A reasonable\r\njury, crediting the testimony of Grajales' medical experts, could\r\nhave found that Grajales continued to suffer from both chronic neck\r\npain and a loss of cognitive functions, including concentration and\r\nmemory.  An award of $150,000 for such damages was not excessive.\r\nAmerican also argues that the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico reviews awards for consistency with other awards in similar\r\ncases; that the district court should have similarly reviewed the\r\njury's award here, in accordance with the United States Supreme\r\nCourt's pronouncement in Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc.,\r\n518 U.S. 415 (1996), that a substantive state law standard for\r\nreview of jury awards must be applied by federal district courts\r\nhearing cases under diversity jurisdiction; and that the award in\r\nthis case is excessive because it is inconsistent with awards\r\napproved by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in similar cases.  In\r\na recent case we expressly rejected this Gasperini argument, based\r\non our reading of Puerto Rico case law: \"If local law placed a\r\nsubstantive cap on . . . damages, it would control, [citing\r\nGasperini], but Puerto Rico case law suggests no such departure from\r\n[the] ordinary practice\" of reviewing awards under the federal\r\nstandards for judging excessiveness, outlined above.  Mejias Quiros\r\nv. Maxxam Property Corp., 108 F.3d 425, 427 n.1 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nWe therefore find no reason to vacate or modify the jury's award of\r\ndamages.\r\n                            VI.\r\nGrajales' Cross-Appeal: Attorney's Fees\r\nPlaintiff-cross appellant Grajales claims that under\r\nPuerto Rico law, Fernndez v. San Juan Cement Inc., 118 D.P.R. 713, \r\n18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 823, 830 (1987), a party engages in obstinacy\r\nwhen it merely answers a complaint and denies responsibility for a\r\nplaintiff's damages, even if it accepts that responsibility later. \r\nPuerto Rico's Rules of Civil Procedure 44.1(d) and 44.3(b) permit\r\nrespectively the award of attorney's fees and prejudgment interest\r\nwhen a party has been, in the court's judgment, obstinate.  See 32\r\nL.P.R.A. App. III, R. 44.1(d), 44.3(b).  When Puerto Rico law\r\nsupplies the basis for decision in a diversity case, federal courts\r\nmust apply Rule 44.1(d), Quiones Pacheco v. American Airlines,\r\nInc., 979 F.2d 1, 7 n.8 (1st Cir. 1992), and application of Rule\r\n44.3(b) would seem to follow. However, as Grajales concedes, a\r\nprevious panel of this court, in Mejias Quiros v. Maxxam Property\r\nCorp., 108 F.3d 425, 429 (1st Cir. 1997), rejected (years after the\r\nFernndez decision) the very same claim of obstinacy that Grajales\r\nraises here.  We agree with the Mejias panel that this argument\r\n\"cannot [be] seriously intended.\" Id. \r\nAffirmed.\n",

American claims that the court erred in allowing the case to go to the jury on the plaintiff's theory that American was liable for the negligence of Executive Airlines, d/b/a/ American Eagle, which American argues actually owned, operated, and maintained the check-in counter. American further claims that there was insufficient evidence of negligence to sustain the jury verdict in this case, and that the court erred by not vacating or remitting the damages award, striking certain defense witnesses, admitting some evidence offered by plaintiff, and refusing to give several jury instructions proposed by American. Grajales cross-appeals, claiming that the court erred in not awarding attorney's fees on the basis of the \"obstinacy\" of the defendants. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Factual background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the facts as a jury might have found them, consistent with the record but in the light most favorable to the verdict. See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir. 1990). On July 29, 1994, Plaintiff Ananas Grajales-Romero (\"Grajales\") was waiting in line at an American Eagle<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> check-in counter in the St. Kitts airport for a return flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico. His acquaintance Terry Connor had accompanied him to the check-in counter. Connor attempted to load Grajales's luggage onto the weigh-in scale adjacent to the check-in counter. In doing so, he grabbed onto an ashtray built into the countertop to gain some leverage in lifting the luggage. The countertop was attached by a hinge to the vertical front facing of the counter. When Connor pulled on the ashtray, the countertop came loose, and pivoted forward on its hinge. A metal signpost and sign were attached to the countertop, and this signpost and sign also pivoted forward with the countertop. As this was happening, plaintiff Grajales was looking down at his ticket. The signpost and/or sign struck Grajales on the top of his head, opening up a two-inch long wound. Although he did not lose consciousness or fall to the floor, he was taken to the St. Kitts hospital, where he received four stitches. After the accident, Grajales experienced neck pains, headaches, and forgetfulness. He was diagnosed by a neurologist as suffering from post-concussion syndrome and a cervical sprain secondary to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grajales filed a complaint against American, AMR Corp., and AMR Eagle, Inc. in the federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico on July 28, 1995. On February 11, 1997, the district court dismissed the claims against co-defendants AMR Corp. and AMR Eagle, Inc. for lack of personal jurisdiction. During the course of trial, held from May 20 to May 27, 1998, American claimed that its witnesses Tomas del Valle and Fred Voltaggio were unavailable because they had been transferred to other positions with American. In their place, American offered the testimony of employees who now held the posts vacated by del Valle and Voltaggio; however, the court struck the replacement witnesses because they had not been disclosed in the course of pre-trial discovery. While Voltaggio eventually testified, del Valle did not, and the court granted a missing witness instruction telling the jurors that they could infer that the testimony of del Valle would have been unfavorable to American. The court refused to give an instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur requested by Grajales, and refused several instructions offered by American. The jury found American liable in the amount of $150,000. The court issued its judgment accordingly, and refused Grajales' claim for attorney's fees under Puerto Rican law. Both parties appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Agency by Apparent Authority</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that it was liable under agency principles for any negligence by Executive Airlines. It claims that the theories advanced by Grajales to establish American's liability for the accident -- namely, agency by estoppel and agency by apparent authority -- were a subterfuge allowing Grajales to forum-shop into federal court, where he was entitled to a jury trial. See Marshall v. Perez Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 849 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Puerto Rico, a civil law jurisdiction, never uses juries in civil cases\"). We will address only Grajales's \"apparent authority\" claim, which provides an adequate basis for American's liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, an apparent principal may be held liable for the acts of its apparent agent where the apparent principal's actions \"led the plaintiffs to reasonably believe [in its] representation\" of authority and control over the apparent agent, through the apparent principal's conduct, including its \"silence, evasive language and appearances.\" Berros v. U.P.R., 116 D.P.R. 88, 16 P.R. Offic. Trans. 112, 122 (1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has applied the doctrine where \"persons who used the services of the [apparent agent] could not possibly know or had no way of knowing that the entity they were dealing with was not\" the apparent principal or an agent thereof. Id. at 122-23. The Court has also applied the doctrine where the plaintiff \"trusted in good faith\" in defendant's conduct, and where that \"trust could lead a reasonable person to believe that in fact there was a principal-agent relationship.\" Vega v. Medical Serv. Admin., 117 D.P.R. 138, 17 P.R. Offic.

The telephone information line for American Eagle flights is the American Airlines telephone information line. The passenger check-in counters in both San Juan and St. Kitts bore American Airlines logos as well as American Eagle logos. The in-flight magazines on Grajales's flight were the American Airlines magazines \"American Ways\" and \"Latitudes.\" The personnel staffing the flights wore uniforms and nametags closely resembling American Airlines uniforms and nametags. American Airlines' destination guide (a schedule of flight availability) lists St. Kitts as a destination. Grajales testified that he relied on such information in choosing to fly with American Eagle, and that he assumed it was part of American Airlines. A reasonable jury could conclude from these facts that American's conduct led Grajales reasonably to believe that there was in fact a principal-agent relationship between American and Executive Airlines d/b/a/ American Eagle, and thus American would be liable for any negligence on the part of Executive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Sufficiency of the Evidence of Negligence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Res Ipsa Loquitur</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">American states that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[p]laintiff produced no evidence -- either through customary airline practices, past practices, or expert testimony -- to establish a standard of care by which American should have operated. Further, plaintiff presented no evidence regarding the inspection, maintenance, and operation of the ticket counter, and made no attempt to explain in what manner any such conduct might have constituted negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From these assertions, and the fact that the court refused to give the jurors Grajales's proposed res ipsa loquitur instruction, American argues that \"[n]o jury could reasonably conclude that American exercised less than reasonable care from the unexplained fact that an accident occurred.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with American that Grajales did not produce either direct or circumstantial evidence explaining how American violated its duty of care.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Grajales offered no evidence, for example, suggesting that the ticket counter had been improperly designed, installed, maintained, or operated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Instead, Grajales relied on the fact of an unexpected occurrence, arguing that the counter top would not have fallen over and struck him unless American had violated its duty of care. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has ruled that the fact of an unexplained occurrence cannot establish an inference of negligence unless the conditions of res ipsa loquitur are satisfied: \"(1) the accident must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's negligence; (2) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of defendant; [and] (3) it must not be due to any voluntary action on the part of plaintiff.\" See Community Partnership v. Presbyterian Hosp., 88 P.R.R. 379, 386 (1963). Given the lack of direct or other circumstantial evidence on American's violation of its duty of care, we must consider whether the conditions of res ipsa loquitur were satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that they were. Indeed, the first two elements of res ipsa loquitur were easily established. A reasonable jury could have concluded that the accident was of a kind which \"ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's negligence,\" and that the accident was \"caused by an . . . instrumentality within the exclusive control of [the] defendant.\" See Colmenares-Vivas v. Sun Alliance Ins. Co., 807 F.2d 1102, 1106 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"[R]es ipsa loquitur applies [if] . . . the defendant is responsible for the instrumentality\") (applying Puerto Rico law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The res ipsa loquitur requirement that the accident not be caused by any \"voluntary action\" on the part of the plaintiff posed a more difficult challenge for Grajales. American argues that a res ipsa loquitur inference was unreasonable because the evidence indicates that plaintiff's acquaintance Connor took the \"voluntary action\" of pulling on the counter-top. Even if Connor's actions could be attributed to Grajales, American's argument misses its mark. The test is not whether the plaintiff took any voluntary action, but whether that voluntary action can be blamed for the accident. See De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros 931 F.2d 116, 126 (1st Cir. 1991) (plaintiff must be \"free of voluntary responsibility for the occurrence\") (applying Puerto Rico law). The evidence here was sufficient to support a finding that Grajales and his colorable agent Connor were blameless, having done nothing more than \"attempt to [use the instrumentality] in the ordinary manner,\" Colmenares-Vivas, 807 F.2d at 1107. So long as the jurors could have concluded from the evidence that Connor's use of the counter for leverage constituted a normal usage of the counter by a customer, the jury could have inferred American's negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there was sufficient evidence on each of the conditions of res ipsa loquitur, the district court did not provide the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction, as Grajales had requested. We must therefore consider an argument implicit in American's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of negligence-- that a jury verdict cannot be justified on the basis of res ipsa loquitur when the jurors were never instructed on the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's statement of the three elements of res ipsa loquitur is derived from the first edition of a well-known treatise on evidence, 4 Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2509 (1st ed. 1905). See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts 244 (Lawyer's 5th ed. 1984). That origin confirms that a res ipsa loquitur instruction explains to the jury a specific form of permissible inference from circumstantial evidence of negligence.  Given this purpose, jurors who can draw the inference of negligence even without a res ipsa loquitur instruction should be permitted to do so. Justice Traynor came to the same conclusion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur concerns a type of circumstantial evidence upon which plaintiff may rely to discharge his burden of proving defendant's negligence. . . . There is no reason why the jury may not draw that inference without, as well as with, a specific instruction authorizing them to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Rose v.

The res ipsa loquitur doctrine only permits an inference that the defendant engaged in negligent conduct. See Colmenares-Vivas, 807 F.2d at 1104. The plaintiff still must prove that the negligent conduct was the proximate cause of the accident. cf. Donnelly v. National R.R. Passenger Corp. (Amtrak), 16 F.3d 941, 946 (8th Cir. 1994) (\"res ipsa loquitur has no application to proximate cause\") (North Dakota law); Daniels v. Twin Oaks Nursing Home, 692 F.2d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 1982) (same) (Alabama law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Puerto Rico, to establish proximate cause, the plaintiff must prove that an accident was foreseeable and could have been avoided if the defendant had not breached its duty of care. See Coyne v. Taber Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 459 (1st Cir. 1995); Marshall v. Perez Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir. 1987). The defendant can defeat proximate causation by proving the occurrence of an \"intervening cause\" that was not foreseeable. See Malave-Felix v. Volvo Car Corp., 946 F.2d 967, 972 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could easily have found that Grajales satisfied his proximate causation burden. See Coyne 53 F.3d at 460 (\"[S]uch questions ordinarily are grist for the factfinder's mill.\"). There was ample evidence produced at trial that American's negligence -- its failure to secure the countertop properly -- created a foreseeable risk of an accident of the general type involved in this case. See Malave-Felix 946 F.2d at 972 (\"precise risk\" or \"exact result\" need not be foreseeable). Moreover, American did not offer sufficient evidence of an unforeseeable intervening cause to compel us to reverse. As we noted in our discussion of res ipsa loquitur, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Connor's actions were blameless. For the same reasons, a jury could have concluded that a customer's use of the counter for leverage was not the type of unforeseeable event that creates an \"intervening cause\" and clears American of causal responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">American's miscellaneous objections</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Exclusion of substitute witnesses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Grajales's interrogatories (and also in an initial scheduling memorandum), American indicated that its trial witnesses would include Tomas del Valle, who was president of Executive Airlines at the time of the accident, and Fred Voltaggio, who was Manager for Support Services for American Airlines at that time. American then attempted, in its proposed pretrial order, to substitute Jose Machado, current Vice President of Flight Operations for Executive Airlines, for del Valle, who had left Executive Airlines to become the Managing Director for American's operations at Los Angeles International Airport. American also attempted to substitute Ernesto Quidgley, Manager for Support Services for American Airlines, for Voltaggio, who had become regional manager for American Airlines' Carribean cargo sales by the time of trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grajales filed a motion before a magistrate judge opposing the witness substitutions on the grounds that the new witnesses had not been properly disclosed during the course of discovery. The magistrate judge granted that motion on May 14, 1998. Four days later, American filed a motion before the trial court seeking reconsideration of the magistrate judge's ruling. The trial court agreed to reconsider the matter but, in an oral order on May 20, 1998, it reaffirmed the magistrate judge's ruling and excluded the substitute witnesses as a discovery sanction for American's failure to disclose them in the appropriate pretrial disclosures as required by Fed.

See Barreto v. Citibank, 907 F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam). Here, it is undisputed that Machado and Quidgley were not disclosed in response to plaintiff's interrogatories, as required by Rule 26. American offered no excuse for failing to disclose Machado and Quidgley while discovery was open, stating only that it was now \"forced\" to call upon unannounced witnesses since del Valle and Voltaggio, its originally designated witnesses, no longer occupied the same positions they held at the time of the accident. The court noted, however, that del Valle and Voltaggio, regardless of any change in position, were currently employees of American, subject to its control and available to testify. On these facts, we find no abuse of discretion in the court's refusal to allow unannounced witnesses to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) \"Missing Witness\" Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Voltaggio testified at trial; however, del Valle, while present during some of the trial, failed to appear on the day the court expected him to testify.

The court found that del Valle, an employee of American, was under its control, and that American had offered no acceptable justification for del Valle's absence. Thus there was ample evidence that del Valle's status left him \"favorably disposed\" to American and that he was \"peculiarly available\" to the airline. Id. Either one of these grounds is sufficient to justify a missing witness instruction. Moreover, the court suggested that American had tactical reasons for not producing del Valle. Specifically, del Valle's move from American Eagle to American Airlines undercut American's efforts to emphasize the minimal nature of the connection between the airlines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> We find no abuse of discretion in the court's issuance of a missing witness instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Admission of testimony about a non-testifying defense expert's report</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grajales submitted to a medical examination performed by Dr. Juan J. Fumero-Perez (\"Fumero\"), an expert witness hired by American. American provided Dr. Fumero's report to Grajales, as required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 35(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> In this report, Dr. Fumero concluded that Grajales was suffering from a post-concussion syndrome. Apparently unhappy with this news, American notified Grajales that it was designating Fumero a non-testifying expert witness under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B). At trial, the court allowed Grajales to extract a brief mention of Fumero's conclusions from both American's medical expert and two medical experts hired by Grajales, Dr. Boris Rojas-Rodriguez and Dr. Maria T. Margarida Julia. The court also allowed Grajales to introduce evidence that American had initially hired Fumero. American argues that the references to the Fumero report were inadmissible hearsay and violated Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> American also argues that evidence of the fact that it hired Fumero was unduly prejudicial under Fed. R.

United States, 504 F.2d 1306, 1317 (1st Cir. 1974). \"Beyond that, the district court's choice of jury instructions is a matter of discretion.\" Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp., 798 F.2d 559, 564 (1st Cir. 1986); see also Kelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F.3d 335, 355 (1st Cir. 1998) (reviewing refusal of instruction for abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1).

The court did give a broader instruction on apparent authority, not challenged on appeal, which closely tracked the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's articulation of the doctrine in Berros. The failure to include a more detailed, supplemental instruction, even if accurate, is not error. See Marbucco Corp. v. Suffolk Constr. Co., 165 F.3d 103, 106 (1st Cir 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2). Failure to maintain proper medical records</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rojas, a neurologist, examined Grajales and testified on his behalf as an expert witness. He was not, however, Grajales' treating physician and the medical examination was performed solely to assist Dr. Rojas in the preparation of his testimony. Dr. Rojas testified that he prepared his report on Grajales from handwritten rough notes and then discarded the notes. American requested an instruction stating that a doctor's failure to \"properly maintain his medical records . . . diminishes the effectiveness of the records as a reference tool for evaluation of the treatment, attention and care the doctor gave the patient\" and \"should be considered when evaluating the credibility of the doctor regarding the treatment he gave the patient.\" The court refused to give this instruction, ruling that the stated authority therefor, Sharon Riley v. Rodriguez de Pacheco, 119 D.P.R. 762, 780 (1987), was distinguishable as a case where a physician was evaluating a patient for the purposes of treatment and not solely for litigation purposes. That distinction is obvious from the wording of the instruction. In any event, the jury could have drawn the inference described without instruction if they found that the facts merited it. We find no abuse of discretion in the court's refusal to give this instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3).

The court refused to consider these new supplemental instructions because they had been offered after the court's announced deadline for such instructions. The refusal to consider these instructions as untimely was not an abuse of discretion. See Senra v. Cunningham, 9 F.3d 168, 171 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Reasonableness of the Damages Award</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the award of $150,000. Pursuant to the federal rule, \"[a] verdict should stand unless it is 'grossly excessive,' 'inordinate,' 'shocking to the conscience of the court,' or 'so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\" Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1984). Although the defendant faces a heavy burden in meeting this standard, excessive damage awards are not immune from review. See,e.g., Koster v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 181 F.3d 24, 35-36 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding $716,000 award for emotional distress caused by age discrimination to be excessive, and limiting recovery to $250,000). A reasonable jury, crediting the testimony of Grajales' medical experts, could have found that Grajales continued to suffer from both chronic neck pain and a loss of cognitive functions, including concentration and memory. An award of $150,000 for such damages was not excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American also argues that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico reviews awards for consistency with other awards in similar cases; that the district court should have similarly reviewed the jury's award here, in accordance with the United States Supreme Court's pronouncement in Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415 (1996), that a substantive state law standard for review of jury awards must be applied by federal district courts hearing cases under diversity jurisdiction; and that the award in this case is excessive because it is inconsistent with awards approved by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in similar cases. In a recent case we expressly rejected this Gasperini argument, based on our reading of Puerto Rico case law: \"If local law placed a substantive cap on . . . damages, it would control, [citing Gasperini], but Puerto Rico case law suggests no such departure from [the] ordinary practice\" of reviewing awards under the federal standards for judging excessiveness, outlined above. Mejias Quiros v. Maxxam Property Corp., 108 F.3d 425, 427 n.1 (1st Cir. 1997). We therefore find no reason to vacate or modify the jury's award of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Grajales' Cross-Appeal: Attorney's Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-cross appellant Grajales claims that under Puerto Rico law, Fernandez v. San Juan Cement Inc., 118 D.P.R. 713, 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 823, 830 (1987), a party engages in obstinacy when it merely answers a complaint and denies responsibility for a plaintiff's damages, even if it accepts that responsibility later. Puerto Rico's Rules of Civil Procedure 44.1(d) and 44.3(b) permit respectively the award of attorney's fees and prejudgment interest when a party has been, in the court's judgment, obstinate. See 32 L.P.R.A. App. III, R. 44.1(d), 44.3(b). When Puerto Rico law supplies the basis for decision in a diversity case, federal courts must apply Rule 44.1(d), Quinones Pacheco v. American Airlines, Inc., 979 F.2d 1, 7 n.8 (1st Cir. 1992), and application of Rule 44.3(b) would seem to follow. However, as Grajales concedes, a previous panel of this court, in Mejias Quiros v. Maxxam Property Corp., 108 F.3d 425, 429 (1st Cir. 1997), rejected (years after the Fernandez decision<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>) the very same claim of obstinacy that Grajales raises here.

This argument, without more supporting evidence, does not permit an inference that American violated its duty of care, especially since there was no evidence introduced which showed that having the countertop fold backwards was compatible with the other functions of the counter (e.g. housing the reservations computer terminal).</p>\n        <p>At trial, Grajales attempted unsuccessfully to introduce evidence that the counter in question was fitted with retaining hooks to prevent a recurrence of the accident that injured him. This evidence was excluded as evidence of subsequent remedial measures for the purpose of proving negligence. See Fed. R. Evid. 407. At oral argument before us, Grajales argued that photographs of the counter which were introduced as evidence showed these retaining hooks, and that the jury could have inferred from the presence of the hooks in the photograph that they were taken to remedy a design defect. This argument strains credulity.

The res ipsa loquitur doctrine \"has assumed the status of a substantive rule of [state] law,\" Daniels v. Twin Oaks Nursing Home, 692 F.2d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 1983). Thus the res ipsa loquitur instruction should be given if the three conditions of res ipsa loquitur are satisfied and the relevant state tort law allows an inference of negligence under those conditions. Cf. Kelliher v. General Transp. Serv., Inc., 29 F.3d 750, 754 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Although the determination of the substance of a jury instruction in a diversity case is a matter of state law, the grant or denial thereof is a matter of procedure controlled by federal law.\") The instruction assists jurors in the analysis of a particular kind of negligence/circumstantial evidence case. The failure to instruct on res ipsa loquitur in circumstances where the relevant law would support the application of the doctrine may constitute an abuse of discretion and reversible error. See, eg. Stewart v. Ford Motor Co. 553 F.2d 130, 141 (D.C. Cir. 1977); Olsen v. States Line, 378 F.2d 217, 220-21 (9th Cir. 1967).

American further claims that there was insufficient evidence of negligence to sustain the jury verdict in this case, and that the court erred by not vacating or remitting the damages award, striking certain defense witnesses, admitting some evidence offered by plaintiff, and refusing to give several jury instructions proposed by American.

On July 29, 1994, Plaintiff Ananas Grajales-Romero (\"Grajales\") was waiting in line at an American Eagle<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> check-in counter in the St. Kitts airport for a return flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico. His acquaintance Terry Connor had accompanied him to the check-in counter. Connor attempted to load Grajales's luggage onto the weigh-in scale adjacent to the check-in counter. In doing so, he grabbed onto an ashtray built into the countertop to gain some leverage in lifting the luggage. The countertop was attached by a hinge to the vertical front facing of the counter. When Connor pulled on the ashtray, the countertop came loose, and pivoted forward on its hinge. A metal signpost and sign were attached to the countertop, and this signpost and sign also pivoted forward with the countertop. As this was happening, plaintiff Grajales was looking down at his ticket. The signpost and/or sign struck Grajales on the top of his head, opening up a two-inch long wound. Although he did not lose consciousness or fall to the floor, he was taken to the St. Kitts hospital, where he received four stitches. After the accident, Grajales experienced neck pains, headaches, and forgetfulness. He was diagnosed by a neurologist as suffering from post-concussion syndrome and a cervical sprain secondary to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grajales filed a complaint against American, AMR Corp., and AMR Eagle, Inc. in the federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico on July 28, 1995. On February 11, 1997, the district court dismissed the claims against co-defendants AMR Corp. and AMR Eagle, Inc. for lack of personal jurisdiction. During the course of trial, held from May 20 to May 27, 1998, American claimed that its witnesses Tomas del Valle and Fred Voltaggio were unavailable because they had been transferred to other positions with American. In their place, American offered the testimony of employees who now held the posts vacated by del Valle and Voltaggio; however, the court struck the replacement witnesses because they had not been disclosed in the course of pre-trial discovery. While Voltaggio eventually testified, del Valle did not, and the court granted a missing witness instruction telling the jurors that they could infer that the testimony of del Valle would have been unfavorable to American. The court refused to give an instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur requested by Grajales, and refused several instructions offered by American. The jury found American liable in the amount of $150,000. The court issued its judgment accordingly, and refused Grajales' claim for attorney's fees under Puerto Rican law.

The telephone information line for American Eagle flights is the American Airlines telephone information line. The passenger check-in counters in both San Juan and St. Kitts bore American Airlines logos as well as American Eagle logos. The in-flight magazines on Grajales's flight were the American Airlines magazines \"American Ways\" and \"Latitudes.\" The personnel staffing the flights wore uniforms and nametags closely resembling American Airlines uniforms and nametags. American Airlines' destination guide (a schedule of flight availability) lists St. Kitts as a destination. Grajales testified that he relied on such information in choosing to fly with American Eagle, and that he assumed it was part of American Airlines. A reasonable jury could conclude from these facts that American's conduct led Grajales reasonably to believe that there was in fact a principal-agent relationship between American and Executive Airlines d/b/a/ American Eagle, and thus American would be liable for any negligence on the part of Executive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Sufficiency of the Evidence of Negligence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Res Ipsa Loquitur</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">American states that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[p]laintiff produced no evidence -- either through customary airline practices, past practices, or expert testimony -- to establish a standard of care by which American should have operated.

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has ruled that the fact of an unexplained occurrence cannot establish an inference of negligence unless the conditions of res ipsa loquitur are satisfied: \"(1) the accident must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's negligence; (2) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of defendant; [and] (3) it must not be due to any voluntary action on the part of plaintiff.\" See Community Partnership v.

Indeed, the first two elements of res ipsa loquitur were easily established. A reasonable jury could have concluded that the accident was of a kind which \"ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's negligence,\" and that the accident was \"caused by an . . . instrumentality within the exclusive control of [the] defendant.\" See Colmenares-Vivas v. Sun Alliance Ins.

American argues that a res ipsa loquitur inference was unreasonable because the evidence indicates that plaintiff's acquaintance Connor took the \"voluntary action\" of pulling on the counter-top. Even if Connor's actions could be attributed to Grajales, American's argument misses its mark. The test is not whether the plaintiff took any voluntary action, but whether that voluntary action can be blamed for the accident. See De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559868\"><a href=\"/opinion/559868/pablo-de-leon-lopez-v-corporacion-insular-de-seguros/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, 126 (1st Cir. 1991) (plaintiff must be \"free of voluntary responsibility for the occurrence\") (applying Puerto Rico law). The evidence here was sufficient to support a finding that Grajales and his colorable agent Connor were blameless, having done nothing more than \"attempt to [use the instrumentality] in the ordinary manner,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480735\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Colmenares-Vivas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/480735/jose-domingo-colmenares-vivas-v-sun-alliance-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1107</span></a></span>. So long as the jurors could have concluded from the evidence that Connor's use of the counter for leverage constituted a normal usage of the counter by a customer, the jury could have inferred American's negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there was sufficient evidence on each of the conditions of res ipsa loquitur, the district court did not provide the jury with a res ipsa loquitur instruction, as Grajales had requested. We must therefore consider an argument implicit in American's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of negligence-- that a jury verdict cannot be justified on the basis of res ipsa loquitur when the jurors were never instructed on the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's statement of the three elements of res ipsa loquitur is derived from the first edition of a well-known treatise on evidence, 4 Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2509 (1st ed. 1905). See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts 244 (Lawyer's 5th ed. 1984). That origin confirms that a res ipsa loquitur instruction explains to the jury a specific form of permissible inference from circumstantial evidence of negligence.  Given this purpose, jurors who can draw the inference of negligence even without a res ipsa loquitur instruction should be permitted to do so. Justice Traynor came to the same conclusion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur concerns a type of circumstantial evidence upon which plaintiff may rely to discharge his burden of proving defendant's negligence. . . .

American argues that the references to the Fumero report were inadmissible hearsay and violated Fed. R. Civ.

The court did give a broader instruction on apparent authority, not challenged on appeal, which closely tracked the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's articulation of the doctrine in Berros. The failure to include a more detailed, supplemental instruction, even if accurate, is not error. See Marbucco Corp. v. Suffolk Constr.

He was not, however, Grajales' treating physician and the medical examination was performed solely to assist Dr. Rojas in the preparation of his testimony. Dr. Rojas testified that he prepared his report on Grajales from handwritten rough notes and then discarded the notes. American requested an instruction stating that a doctor's failure to \"properly maintain his medical records . . . diminishes the effectiveness of the records as a reference tool for evaluation of the treatment, attention and care the doctor gave the patient\" and \"should be considered when evaluating the credibility of the doctor regarding the treatment he gave the patient.\" The court refused to give this instruction, ruling that the stated authority therefor, Sharon Riley v. Rodriguez de Pacheco, 119 D.P.R. 762, 780 (1987), was distinguishable as a case where a physician was evaluating a patient for the purposes of treatment and not solely for litigation purposes. That distinction is obvious from the wording of the instruction. In any event, the jury could have drawn the inference described without instruction if they found that the facts merited it.

Although the defendant faces a heavy burden in meeting this standard, excessive damage awards are not immune from review. See,e.g., Koster v.

A reasonable jury, crediting the testimony of Grajales' medical experts, could have found that Grajales continued to suffer from both chronic neck pain and a loss of cognitive functions, including concentration and memory. An award of $150,000 for such damages was not excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American also argues that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico reviews awards for consistency with other awards in similar cases; that the district court should have similarly reviewed the jury's award here, in accordance with the United States Supreme Court's pronouncement in Gasperini v.

In a recent case we expressly rejected this Gasperini argument, based on our reading of Puerto Rico case law: \"If local law placed a substantive cap on . . . damages, it would control, [citing Gasperini], but Puerto Rico case law suggests no such departure from [the] ordinary practice\" of reviewing awards under the federal standards for judging excessiveness, outlined above.

Puerto Rico's Rules of Civil Procedure 44.1(d) and 44.3(b) permit respectively the award of attorney's fees and prejudgment interest when a party has been, in the court's judgment, obstinate. See 32 L.P.R.A. App. III, R. 44.1(d), 44.3(b). When Puerto Rico law supplies the basis for decision in a diversity case, federal courts must apply Rule 44.1(d), Quinones Pacheco v.

This evidence was excluded as evidence of subsequent remedial measures for the purpose of proving negligence. See Fed. R. Evid. 407. At oral argument before us, Grajales argued that photographs of the counter which were introduced as evidence showed these retaining hooks, and that the jury could have inferred from the presence of the hooks in the photograph that they were taken to remedy a design defect.
