Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Jorge E. Rivera-Ortiz on brief for appellant.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Camille Velez-Rive, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nSEPTEMBER 29, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Carlos Brignoni-Nieves appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's refusal to reduce his sentence for acceptance\r\nof responsibility under U.S.S.G.  3E1.1.  Although appellant\r\npled guilty and admitted the conduct comprising the offense of\r\nconviction, the sentencing judge found that appellant had\r\ndenied relevant conduct that the court had determined to be\r\ntrue and that appellant was not genuinely repentant.  Because\r\nthose findings are supported by the record and provide a basis\r\nfor denial of an acceptance of responsibility adjustment under\r\n 3E1.1, we affirm appellant's sentence.\r\n          To qualify for a decrease in offense level under \r\n3E1.1, the defendant must \"clearly demonstrate acceptance of\r\nresponsibility for his offense.\"  3E1.1.  \"A defendant may\r\nremain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond the offense\r\nof conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a\r\nreduction under this subsection.  However, a defendant who\r\nfalsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that\r\nthe court determines to be true has acted in a manner\r\ninconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\"  3E1.1,\r\ncomment. (n.1(a)); see United States v. Hernandez-Coplin, 24\r\nF.3d 312, 317 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n          \"A defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement\r\nto decreases in the offense level, including downward\r\nadjustments for acceptance of responsibility.\"  United States\r\nv. Gonzales, 12 F.3d 298, 300 (1st Cir. 1993).  \"A sentencing\r\ncourt has very wide latitude in determining whether to grant\r\nthis adjustment and a finding on this issue is normally set\r\naside only if it was clearly erroneous.\" United States v. De\r\nLeon Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 455 (1st Cir. 1995)(citations omitted);\r\nsee  3E1.1, comment.(n.5) (\"The sentencing judge is in a\r\nunique position to evaluate a defendant's acceptance of\r\nresponsibility.  For this reason, the determination of the\r\nsentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\").\r\n          To qualify for an adjustment under  3E1.1, \"the\r\ndefendant must admit to the conduct comprising the offense and\r\neither admit or remain silent as to other relevant conduct.\"\r\nHernandez Coplin, 24 F.3d at 317.  \"[A]cceptance of\r\nresponsibility necessitates candor and authentic remorse -- not\r\nmerely a pat recital of the vocabulary of contrition . . . .\r\nCredibility and demeanor play a crucial role in determining\r\nwhether a person is genuinely contrite.\" United States v.\r\nRoyer, 895 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990).  The sentencing judge\r\nfound that, with respect to other relevant conduct, appellant\r\nhad \"den[ied] matters that have been established clearly.\"  The\r\ndistrict court also found that appellant's \"demeanor, the way\r\n[he had] been expressing [him]self, [his] justifications\" were\r\ninconsistent with genuine repentance.  \"Because the court had\r\na plausible basis for arriving at the conclusion, no more was\r\nrequired.\" Id.\r\n          Appellant's sentence is affirmed.
