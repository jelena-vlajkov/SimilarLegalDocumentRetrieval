Following a jury trial, Kenneth W.\n\nBrassard was convicted of attempted possession with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, and use of a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c)(1). He was sentenced to consecutive terms of 5 years\n\nimprisonment, as well as four years of supervised release. His appeal\n\nalleges various and numerous errors by the district court at trial and\n\nsentencing, none of which has merit.      Consequently, we affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          The government says that Brassard was caught in a\n\nstraightforward reverse sting operation; Brassard says he was\n\nentrapped. Each side presented its version of events to the jury, an\n\noutline of which follows.\n\n          Brassard owned a janitorial services company that had\n\ncontracts to clean several Burger King franchises in southern New\n\nEngland. Seeking additional contracts, in June 1995, he went to speak\n\nto Ronald Rego, the manager of a Burger King. Unbeknownst to Brassard,\n\nRego was an informant for the Providence Police. Rego testified that\n\nBrassard, in order to get a contract, offered him a kickback, which he\n\nrefused. He then testified that, after he mentioned to Brassard that\n\nhe also worked at a Spanish nightclub, Brassard asked him if he knew\n\nanyone \"in the business,\" meaning the drug business. Rego testified\n\nfurther that Brassard pestered him until Rego put him in contact with\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fa drug dealer. In fact, the person with whom Rego put Brassard in\n\ncontact was a detective with the Providence Police.\n\n           Claiming entrapment, Brassard testified that Rego pressured\n\nhim into finding buyers for his drugs, and Brassard, desperate for work\n\nafter losing two accounts and having his car mysteriously ruined,\n\nfeigned interest so that Rego would give him a cleaning contract.\n\nFinally, Brassard says, he agreed to a plan in which he would buy\n\ncocaine provided that Rego would take the drugs from him and sell them\n\nhimself. Rego, Brassard said, coached him on how to act like a drug\n\ndealer and told him to bring a gun to the drug purchase. Rego was\n\nmotivated, Brassard alleged, by a deal he had with the Providence\n\nPolice to recoup a percentage of moneys forfeited as a result of his\n\ntips.\n\n           In January 1996, Rego's handler, Detective Frank DellaVentura\n\nof the Providence Police, gave Detective Freddy Rocha, an undercover\n\nnarcotics officer, Brassard's phone number. Rocha was to pose as a\n\ndrug dealer named Raul. DellaVentura said that Brassard was expecting\n\n\"Raul\" to call him about a drug deal. After a few conversations in\n\nwhich Rocha and Brassard discussed the quantity and price of the drugs,\n\nas well as, allegedly, Brassard's past history as a drug dealer,\n\nBrassard agreed to purchase a kilogram of cocaine from Rocha for\n\n$18,000.   Brassard was to place a down payment of $5000, with the\n\nremainder secured by Brassard's mobile home as collateral.          The\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fconversations between Rocha and Brassard were recorded. Brassard and\n\nRego arranged to meet at the Marriott Hotel, in Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland, on January 26, 1996. After the exchange of cash for cocaine\n\nwas made in a hotel bathroom, Brassard was arrested as he attempted to\n\nleave.   A loaded handgun was found on him.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Brassard, through his attorney and pro se, raises seven\n\ngrounds for appeal.\n\n1. Discovery\n\n          Brassard says that the district court erred when it\n\nconditioned further discovery of information as to promises,\n\ninducements, or rewards made to the informant Rego on the calling of\n\nthe informant as a witness at trial. General information had been\n\nprovided before trial. Brassard says that, if he had received the\n\nadditional information before trial, he would not have had to call Rego\n\nas a witness, a witness who was clearly more favorable to the\n\ngovernment.    This amounts, he says, to a violation of Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). The government says that it turned over\n\nall relevant information a month before trial, including the total\n\namount paid to Rego from prior closed cases, and that the district\n\ncourt ordered more specific disclosures (the precise amounts paid to\n\nRego in each case) in sufficient time for the defense to make use of\n\nthem at trial.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          We review for abuse of discretion, see United States v.\n\nJosleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1196 (1st Cir. 1996), and there was none.\n\nProduction was ordered in adequate time for the information to be used\n\neffectively by the defense at trial. We reject the argument that the\n\nlate production of more detailed evidence, if late it was, forced the\n\ndefense to call the informant Rego as a witness, or that it caused\n\nprejudice. See Strickler v. Greene, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 1948 (1999);\n\nJosleyn, 99 F.3d at 1196.\n\n2. Government's Opening\n\n          Brassard says that the district court should have granted his\n\nmotion for a mistrial after the government, in its opening argument,\n\nmade one impermissible reference to inadmissible hearsay evidence. We\n\nreview for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993). Brassard objected to the prosecutor's\n\nstatement, \"Now the Defendant asked the informant if he knew where the\n\nDefendant could purchase a large quantity of cocaine. As I already\n\ntold you, unbeknownst to the Defendant, however, the informant had been\n\nemployed by the Government on several prior occasions.\" The objection\n\nwas based on the prosecution's assertion that it did not intend to call\n\nthe informant Rego as a witness. The hearsay statement contradicted\n\nBrassard's version of who introduced the topic of drugs, and the\n\nquestion of who first introduced the topic of drugs was pertinent to\n\nthe entrapment defense.    In response to the objection, the trial\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fprosecutor argued that the information could be introduced without\n\ncalling Rego as a witness. The district court disagreed and sustained\n\nthe objection.   Brassard then turned down the court's offer of a\n\ncurative instruction and, instead, moved for a mistrial. The judge\n\ndenied the motion. The government now acknowledges that the prosecutor\n\nerred in making the statement, but says that the error was harmless.\n\n          The district court judge did not abuse his discretion. The\n\noffending remark was brief, the judge had told the jury that counsel's\n\nstatement was not evidence, the judge offered a curative instruction,\n\nand it is likely that, coming when it did, the remark had no effect.\n\nAs noted in United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 446 (1st Cir. 1994),\n\n\"[t]he level of prejudice, if any, was not sufficiently significant to\n\noverturn the judge's decision to accept the defendant['s] tactical\n\nchoice to forgo more appropriate methods of addressing the potential\n\nprejudice in favor of the unrealistic and unnecessary solution of a\n\ndismissal or a new trial.\"\n\n3. Tape Recordings\n\n          Brassard, pro se, says that the tape recordings and\n\ntranscripts of conversations between him and the undercover agent were\n\nimpermissibly admitted because no foundation was laid, because the\n\nfirst tape was incomplete, and because the tapes were not properly\n\nauthenticated. We review for abuse of discretion. See United States\n\nv. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1986).       In his testimony,\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fDetective Rocha, who made the recordings and transcripts, laid proper\n\nfoundation and made proper authentication of the tapes and the\n\ntranscripts, explaining how the first minute was irreparably damaged\n\nwhile he was making copies of the tapes. See United States v. Doyon,\n\n194 F.3d 207, 212-13 (1st Cir. 1999). While the initial moments of one\n\nof the tapes were destroyed, that did not make that tape inadmissible.\n\nSee id. Further, there was ample cross-examination of Detective Rocha\n\non the substance of the conversation that took place during the missing\n\nportion of the tape to allow the jury to evaluate for itself the\n\ncontent and importance of that part as to both the prosecution's and\n\nthe defense's cases.     See id.\n\n4. Questioning of Informant\n\n          Brassard says that the district court erred when it allowed\n\nthe government, over his objection, to ask the informant certain\n\nquestions, which, he contends, elicited inadmissible hearsay and\n\nviolated the Constitution's Confrontation Clause. See U.S. Const.\n\namend. VI. He challenges, in particular, Rego's testimony that his\n\nBurger King district manager, Gary Poulin, \"blew right up\" when he\n\nheard that Rego was considering Brassard for a cleaning contract, as\n\nwell as Rego's explanation of why Poulin reacted that way (which\n\nincluded the statement \"I guess they [i.e., Burger King] had a problem\n\n. . . about drugs\"). The government's questioning did not elicit\n\nhearsay because the testimony was not offered for its truth but to show\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthat Rego had a reason not to hire Brassard and decided so quickly.\n\nFurther, there are no Confrontation Clause issues because Poulin, the\n\ndeclarant, later testified at trial. See United States v. Palow, 777\n\nF.2d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n5. Cross-examination of Brassard\n\n          Brassard says that the court erred, in violation of Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 608(b), when it allowed the government to cross-\n\nexamine him and question two Burger King employees regarding Brassard's\n\nprior employment history with Burger King, particularly the reasons for\n\nBurger King's termination of its contract with Brassard's company.1\n\nBrassard made no objection to this line of questioning at trial and so\n\nreview is for plain error. See United States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 1999). This questioning was not improper impeachment in\n\nviolation of Rule 608(b) because Brassard's prior employment history\n\nwith Burger King was not a specific instance of conduct for the purpose\n\nof attacking his credibility, nor was the questioning about a\n\ncollateral unrelated matter. The questioning was relevant to rebut\n\nBrassard's entrapment defense: the evidence made it clear that Brassard\n\n\n\n     1    Rule 608(b) states, in pertinent part:\n\n     Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose\n     of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility, other than\n     conviction of a crime as provided in rule 609, may not be proved\n     by extrinsic evidence.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 608(b).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fknew he would not get a Burger King contract, thereby making it more\n\nlikely that Brassard was the one who initiated the drug-dealing\n\nconversation.\n\n6. Sentencing\n\n           Brassard says that the district court erred in the\n\ncomputation of his offense level for sentencing because he \"lack[ed]\n\nthe resources to buy as agreed.\" Thus, pointing to the last sentence\n\nof application note 12 of § 2D1.1 of the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, he claims that he should have been treated like a seller\n\nwho \"was not reasonably capable of providing[] the agreed-upon quantity\n\nof the controlled substance,\" and the court should have \"exclude[d]\n\nfrom the offense level determination the amount of the controlled\n\nsubstance that . . . he . . . was not reasonably capable\" of\n\npurchasing.     U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, application note 12.\n\n           There was no error in sentencing.     Brassard agreed and\n\nintended to purchase one kilogram of cocaine. Application note 12 of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, § 2D1.1, specifies that, \"in a reverse\n\nsting, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance would more\n\naccurately reflect the scale of the offense because the amount actually\n\ndelivered is controlled by the government, not by the defendant.\" The\n\nlast sentence of application note 12, relied on by Brassard and quoted\n\nabove, which deals with a defendant selling drugs, clearly does not\n\napply.   See United States v. Gomez, 103 F.3d 249, 252-53 (2d Cir.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f1997). See generally United States v. Williams, 109 F.3d 502, 511-12\n\n(8th Cir. 1997) (noting that courts applied the last sentence of the\n\npre-1995 version of application note 12 to reverse stings, but not\n\ndeciding whether the same should be done after the 1995 amendments,\n\nwhich, inter alia, added specific language concerning reverse stings).\n\n7. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n          Brassard, pro se, says that his trial counsel was\n\nineffective. This claim is premature and inappropriate to hear on\n\ndirect appeal \"[s]ince the existing record does not enable reliable\n\nappellate review.\" United States v. Ademaj, 170 F.3d 58, 64 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 206 (1999).\n\n                                III.\n\n          For these reasons, we affirm the judgment and sentence of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

The hearsay statement contradicted  Brassard's version of who introduced the topic of drugs, and the  question of who first introduced the topic of drugs was pertinent  to the entrapment defense.  In response to the objection, the trial  prosecutor argued that the information could be introduced without  calling Rego as a witness.  The district court disagreed and  sustained the objection.

Tape Recordings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard, pro se, says that the tape recordings and  transcripts of conversations between him and the undercover agent  were impermissibly admitted because no foundation was laid, because  the first tape was incomplete, and because the tapes were not  properly authenticated.  We review for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1986).  In his  testimony, Detective Rocha, who made the recordings and  transcripts, laid proper foundation and made proper authentication  of the tapes and the transcripts, explaining how the first minute  was irreparably damaged while he was making copies of the tapes. See United States v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207, 212-13 (1st Cir. 1999). While the initial moments of one of the tapes were destroyed, that  did not make that tape inadmissible.  See id.  Further, there was  ample cross-examination of Detective Rocha on the substance of the  conversation that took place during the missing portion of the tape  to allow the jury to evaluate for itself the content and importance  of that part as to both the prosecution's and the defense's cases.

Questioning of Informant</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard says that the district court erred when it  allowed the government, over his objection, to ask the informant  certain questions, which, he contends, elicited inadmissible  hearsay and violated the Constitution's Confrontation Clause.  See U.S. Const. amend. VI.  He challenges, in particular, Rego's  testimony that his Burger King district manager, Gary Poulin, \"blew  right up\" when he heard that Rego was considering Brassard for a  cleaning contract, as well as Rego's explanation of why Poulin  reacted that way (which included the statement \"I guess they [i.e.,  Burger King] had a problem .. about drugs\").  The government's  questioning did not elicit hearsay because the testimony was not  offered for its truth but to show that Rego had a reason not to  hire Brassard and decided so quickly.  Further, there are no  Confrontation Clause issues because Poulin, the declarant, later  testified at trial.  See United States v. Palow, 777 F.2d 52, 57  (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Cross-examination of Brassard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard says that the court erred, in violation of  Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), when it allowed the government to  cross-examine him and question two Burger King employees regarding  Brassard's prior employment history with Burger King, particularly  the reasons for Burger King's termination of its contract with  Brassard's company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Brassard made no objection to this line of  questioning at trial and so review is for plain error.  See United  States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir. 1999).  This questioning  was not improper impeachment in violation of Rule 608(b) because  Brassard's prior employment history with Burger King was not a  specific instance of conduct for the purpose of attacking his  credibility, nor was the questioning about a collateral unrelated  matter.  The questioning was relevant to rebut Brassard's  entrapment defense: the evidence made it clear that Brassard knew  he would not get a Burger King contract, thereby making it more  likely that Brassard was the one who initiated the drug-dealing  conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">6. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard says that the district court erred in the  computation of his offense level for sentencing because he  \"lack[ed] the resources to buy as agreed.\"  Thus, pointing to the  last sentence of application note 12 of &#167; 2D1.1 of the United  States Sentencing Guidelines, he claims that he should have been  treated like a seller who \"was not reasonably capable of  providing[] the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance,\"  and the court should have \"exclude[d] from the offense level  determination the amount of the controlled substance that . . . he  . . . was not reasonably capable\" of purchasing.

Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that Brassard was caught in a  straightforward reverse sting operation; Brassard says he was  entrapped.  Each side presented its version of events to the jury,  an outline of which follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard owned a janitorial services company that had  contracts to clean several Burger King franchises in southern New  England. Seeking additional contracts, in June 1995, he went to  speak to Ronald Rego, the manager of a Burger King.  Unbeknownst to  Brassard, Rego was an informant for the Providence Police.  Rego  testified that Brassard, in order to get a contract, offered him a  kickback, which he refused.  He then testified that, after he  mentioned to Brassard that he also worked at a Spanish nightclub,  Brassard asked him if he knew anyone \"in the business,\" meaning the  drug business.  Rego testified further that Brassard pestered him  until Rego put him in contact with a drug dealer.  In fact, the  person with whom Rego put Brassard in contact was a detective with  the Providence Police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claiming entrapment, Brassard testified that Rego  pressured him into finding buyers for his drugs, and Brassard,  desperate for work after losing two accounts and having his car  mysteriously ruined, feigned interest so that Rego would give him  a cleaning contract. Finally, Brassard says, he agreed to a plan in  which he would buy cocaine provided that Rego would take the drugs  from him and sell them himself.  Rego, Brassard said, coached him  on how to act like a drug dealer and told him to bring a gun to the  drug purchase.  Rego was motivated, Brassard alleged, by a deal he  had with the Providence Police to recoup a percentage of moneys  forfeited as a result of his tips.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1996, Rego's handler, Detective Frank  DellaVentura of the Providence Police, gave Detective Freddy Rocha,  an undercover narcotics officer, Brassard's phone number.  Rocha  was to pose as a drug dealer named Raul.  DellaVentura said that  Brassard was expecting \"Raul\" to call him about a drug deal.  After  a few conversations in which Rocha and Brassard discussed the  quantity and price of the drugs, as well as, allegedly, Brassard's  past history as a drug dealer, Brassard agreed to purchase a  kilogram of cocaine from Rocha for $18,000.  Brassard was to place  a down payment of $5000, with the remainder secured by Brassard's  mobile home as collateral.  The conversations between Rocha and  Brassard were recorded.  Brassard and Rego arranged to meet at the  Marriott Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island, on January 26, 1996. After the exchange of cash for cocaine was made in a hotel  bathroom, Brassard was arrested as he attempted to leave.  A loaded  handgun was found on him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard, through his attorney and pro se, raises seven  grounds for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard says that the district court erred when it  conditioned further discovery of information as to promises,  inducements, or rewards made to the informant Rego on the calling  of the informant as a witness at trial.  General information had  been provided before trial.  Brassard says that, if he had received  the additional information before trial, he would not have had to  call Rego as a witness, a witness who was clearly more favorable to  the government.  This amounts, he says, to a violation of Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span> </a></span>(1963).  The government says that it turned  over all relevant information a month before trial, including the  total amount paid to Rego from prior closed cases, and that the  district court ordered more specific disclosures (the precise  amounts paid to Rego in each case) in sufficient time for the  defense to make use of them at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion, see United States v. Josleyn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197023\"><a href=\"/opinion/197023/united-states-v-josleyn/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span>, 1196 (1st Cir. 1996), and there was none. Production was ordered in adequate time for the information to be  used effectively by the defense at trial.  We reject the argument  that the late production of more detailed evidence, if late it was,  forced the defense to call the informant Rego as a witness, or that  it caused prejudice.  See Strickler v. Greene, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Government's Opening</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brassard says that the district court should have granted  his motion for a mistrial after the government, in its opening  argument, made one impermissible reference to inadmissible hearsay  evidence.  We review for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993).  Brassard objected  to the prosecutor's statement, \"Now the Defendant asked the  informant if he knew where the Defendant could purchase a large  quantity of cocaine.  As I already told you, unbeknownst to the  Defendant, however, the informant had been employed by the  Government on several prior occasions.\"  The objection was based on  the prosecution's assertion that it did not intend to call the  informant Rego as a witness.  The hearsay statement contradicted  Brassard's version of who introduced the topic of drugs, and the  question of who first introduced the topic of drugs was pertinent  to the entrapment defense.  In response to the objection, the trial  prosecutor argued that the information could be introduced without  calling Rego as a witness.  The district court disagreed and  sustained the objection.  Brassard then turned down the court's  offer of a curative instruction and, instead, moved for a mistrial. The judge denied the motion.  The government now acknowledges that  the prosecutor erred in making the statement, but says that the  error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judge did not abuse his discretion. The offending remark was brief, the judge had told the jury that  counsel's statement was not evidence, the judge offered a curative  instruction, and it is likely that, coming when it did, the remark  had no effect.  As noted in United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>,  446 (1st Cir. 1994), \"[t]he level of prejudice, if any, was not  sufficiently significant to overturn the judge's decision to accept  the defendant['s] tactical choice to forgo more appropriate methods  of addressing the potential prejudice in favor of the unrealistic  and unnecessary solution of a dismissal or a new trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.
