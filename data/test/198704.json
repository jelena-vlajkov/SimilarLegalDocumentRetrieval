Leadbetter, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Andrew\r\nKetterer, Attorney General, and Donald W. Macomber, Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                NOVEMBER 4, 1999\r\n                                             CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.  Thomas Platt appeals from a\r\ndistrict court order which dismissed his petition for a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus.  See 28 U.S.C.  2254.  We affirm.\r\n                      I\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\nIn the early morning hours of July 17, 1994, two persons\r\nwearing camouflage net masks entered the office of the Econo-Lodge\r\nin Bangor, Maine, accosted the desk clerk with a knife, and made\r\noff with $1000 in cash.  In due course, Platt and his friends,\r\nRobert King and Dale Braley, were arrested and charged with Class\r\nA robbery under Maine law.  After entering into plea agreements\r\nwith state and federal prosecutors, King and Braley were sentenced\r\nto lengthy prison terms.\r\nAt Platt's state court trial, King invoked the Fifth\r\nAmendment on the ground that he could be placed in jeopardy of\r\nfuture federal prosecution.  The trial judge accordingly declared\r\nKing an unavailable witness and the State introduced the transcript\r\nof a January 1995 police interview in which King described how he\r\nand Platt had robbed the Econo-Lodge while Braley waited in the\r\ncar. \r\nIn order to safeguard Platt's rights under the\r\nConfrontation Clause, see Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123\r\n(1968) (admission of nontestifying codefendant's statements\r\nincriminating the defendant violates Confrontation Clause), the\r\nKing statement was redacted to replace references to \"Platt\" with\r\ntwo asterisks (**).  When the King statement was read to the jury\r\nthe two asterisks were referred to as \"some person.\"  Dale Braley\r\ntestified that Platt and King had entered the motel while Braley\r\nwaited in his car.  \r\nAfter Platt was convicted and sentenced to twelve years\r\nin prison, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court rejected his Bruton-\r\nbased appeal in State v. Platt, 704 A.2d 370 (Me. 1997).  Three\r\ndays before the SJC decision became final, however, the United\r\nStates Supreme Court had issued its decision in Gray v. Maryland,\r\n118 S. Ct. 1151 (1998), which held that the use of incriminating\r\nstatements obtained from nontestifying codefendants violates the\r\ndefendant's right of confrontation even though the prosecution\r\nredacts their statements by replacing the defendant's name with a\r\nneutral symbol.  Id. at 1157.\r\nThereafter, Platt petitioned for habeas corpus relief in\r\nfederal district court, contending that Gray required reversal of\r\nhis state-court conviction.  Although the district court denied the\r\npetition, it issued a certificate of appealability. \r\n                      II\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nA.   The Federal Habeas Corpus Standard\r\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\r\nnarrowed the conditions in which state-court convictions may be\r\nreviewed in federal habeas corpus proceedings, by providing that\r\nthe writ not be granted unless the state court's \"adjudication of\r\nthe claim . . . resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\r\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\r\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\"  28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) (emphasis added).  See O'Brien v.\r\nDubois, 145 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nThe parties agree that the admission of King's redacted\r\nstatement into evidence violated Platt's rights under the\r\nConfrontation Clause if the Gray decision itself then constituted\r\na \"clearly established\" Supreme Court precedent.  But the parties\r\ndisagree as to whether section 2254 requires that the pertinent\r\nSupreme Court precedent need have been decided by the time the\r\nstate court rendered its confrontation-clause ruling, or thereafter\r\nbut before the state-court conviction became \"final.\"\r\nAlthough Platt was tried prior to the Gray decision, the\r\nstate-court judgment did not become final until March 12, 1998,\r\nthree days after Gray was decided.  On an earlier occasion we\r\ndeferred a ruling on this issue of first impression.  See id. at 20\r\nn.3.  We now do so once again, as the admission of the King\r\nstatement into evidence amounted at most to harmless error.\r\nB.   Harmless Error\r\nPlatt argues that admission of the King statement was not\r\nharmless error, since the remaining evidence of his complicity in\r\nthe Econo-Lodge robbery was not trustworthy.  The burden rests with\r\nthe State to establish that the putative Bruton-Gray error had no\r\n\"'substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\r\njury's verdict,'\" or that it \"was [not] of such magnitude that it\r\nactually casts doubt on the integrity of the verdict.\"  Sinnott v.\r\nDuval, 139 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). \r\nNormally, we focus our analysis on three criteria: \"(1) the extent\r\nto which the error permeated the proceeding, (2) the centrality of\r\nthe issue affected by the error to the case as actually tried and\r\n(3) the relative strength of the properly admitted evidence of\r\nguilt.\"  Levasseur v. Pepe, 70 F.3d 187, 193 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n     1.   The Robert King Statement\r\nAt a post-arrest interview in January 1995, Robert King\r\nprovided the following version of the Econo-Lodge robbery:  On the\r\nevening of July 16, 1994, King and his friends, Dale Braley and\r\nTimothy Boudreau, were driving around Bangor in Boudreau's car when\r\nthe police stopped the car and ticketed Boudreau for drag racing.\r\nThereafter, Dale Braley and King left Boudreau and met\r\n\"some person\" (viz., Platt).  Not long after this threesome began\r\ndriving around Bangor in Braley's car, Platt suggested they rob the\r\nEcono-Lodge, claiming that he knew the clerk on duty and they could\r\nget \"big bucks.\"\r\nUpon their arrival at the motel, King and Platt donned\r\ncamouflage net masks or rubber Halloween masks, retrieved from\r\nPlatt's red duffel bag.  Platt was carrying a knife.  Dale Braley,\r\nthe driver, waited in his car.  \r\nWhen Platt and King confronted the motel clerk, she\r\nbecame frantic, which upset King, who had understood from Platt's\r\nearlier assertions about \"knowing\" the clerk that the robbery would\r\nbe an \"inside deal\" and \"real easy.\"  After Platt brandished the\r\nknife and forced the clerk to open the cash register, he and King\r\nreturned to the Braley car.  Later, Platt divided the loot three\r\nways.\r\nAs the State acknowledges, Robert King's statement\r\nreadily met the second of the three Levasseur tests   the\r\ncentrality of the issue implicated by the error   since there can\r\nbe no real question but that the jury would have understood \"some\r\nperson\" as a reference to \"Platt.\"  See Gray, 118 S. Ct. at 1156\r\n(holding that, as a \"class,\" this sort of redacted statement poses\r\ntoo great a risk that the factfinder may presume that the unnamed\r\nactor was the defendant).  Since the Econo-Lodge clerk could\r\nneither identify the two robbers, nor state whether a third\r\nparticipant had remained in the Braley car, the central dispute at\r\ntrial was whether Platt or some other masked person (viz., Dale\r\nBraley) had accompanied Robert King into the motel office.  Thus,\r\nthe King statement was directly on point.\r\n     2.   The Pervasiveness of the Error and the\r\nRelative Strength of Other Evidence\r\n\nThe fact that the Robert King statement implicated Platt\r\nis not necessarily dispositive of the harmless-error inquiry. \r\nRather, the third criterion   \"the relative strengths of the cases\r\nfor the prosecution and the defense absent the offending evidence\"\r\nis \"the major test of harmlessness.\" Sinnott, 139 F.3d at 18. \r\nAs the other evidence of Platt's complicity   altogether\r\naside from the King statement   overshadowed and undermined all\r\ndefense theories, we conclude that the putative Bruton-Gray error\r\ndid not \"permeate[] the [state-court] proceeding.\" Levasseur, 70\r\nF.3d at 193.\r\n               a)   Kim Stark\r\nKim Stark, the clerk on duty at the Econo-Lodge on July\r\n17, 1994, provided the following eyewitness version of the robbery:\r\nAt 2 a.m., two persons entered the office while she was on the\r\nphone.  Each wore a mask made of mesh netting.  One wore a hooded\r\ncamouflage shirt (State's Exhibit 17), had \"dark eyes,\" wore no\r\neyeglasses, spoke in a voice Stark did not recognize, wore gloves,\r\nand threatened her with a knife.  The second robber, who did not\r\nspeak, wore a blue-striped sweatshirt (State's Exhibit 1:  blue-\r\nstriped sweatshirt with the words \"Old Orchard Beach, USA\" on\r\nfront).  The second robber removed approximately $1000 in cash\r\nfrom the register.  Stark was unable to identify either robber. \r\nShe knew Platt as a friend of a friend, and remembered having\r\nspoken with him on June 29, 1994, when he was an overnight guest at\r\nthe Econo-Lodge.    \r\n               b)   Dale Braley\r\nThe State's other eyewitness to the robbery was\r\ncodefendant Dale Braley, who gave the following account: In July\r\n1994, he shared a Bangor apartment with his fiancee, Wendy, his\r\nbrother Donald Braley, Thomas Platt, and Platt's girlfriend, Angela\r\nTurner.  On the evening of July 16, 1994, Braley and his friend\r\nRobert King were riding on Main Street in Bangor with Tim Boudreau\r\nat the wheel.  After Boudreau was ticketed for drag racing, he\r\ndrove to a nearby auto parts store where he parted company with\r\nBraley and King.\r\nThereafter, Braley and King met Platt, and the three\r\ndrove off in Braley's car.  Platt suggested that they rob the\r\nEcono-Lodge because he knew the woman who worked there.  A maroon\r\nduffel bag (with white handles), which Platt had borrowed from\r\nAngela Turner, was visible in the back seat of the Braley car.  The\r\nduffel bag contained \"a couple of camouflage suits, couple of hats,\r\nshirts, [and] some tools.\"  Braley testified that these items had\r\nbeen \"used in previous jobs [viz., robberies].\"\r\nWhile Braley waited in his car, Platt and King went into\r\nthe motel.  King was wearing a \"camouflage net suit\"; Platt an Old\r\nOrchard Beach sweatshirt.  Braley could not recall either Platt or\r\nKing donning any other clothing before leaving the car, nor\r\nremoving the knife from the glove compartment.  Three or four\r\nminutes later, Platt and King ran out of the motel.  Braley then\r\ndrove them to Tim Boudreau's house, where they left the duffel bag.\r\nThe robbery accounts provided by Robert King, Kim Stark\r\nand Dale Braley thus plainly disclosed remarkable similarities.\r\nAlthough improperly admitted evidence will be considered\r\nharmless if merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence, see,\r\ne.g., United States v. Adams, 74 F.3d 1093, 1099 (11th Cir. 1996),\r\nPlatt focuses on what he considers a crucial discrepancy:  Robert\r\nKing stated that he and Platt had donned the masks which were in\r\nthe duffel bag, whereas Dale Braley did not see them do so.  Thus,\r\nPlatt argues, the King statement was more consistent with the\r\ndescriptions of the robbers given by Kim Stark, the Econo-Lodge\r\nclerk; and, without the King statement, the jury would not have\r\nvoted to convict based on Braley's inconsistent testimony.\r\nSince Dale Braley's testimony did not necessarily\r\nconflict with that of Kim Stark, however, we conclude that it had\r\nno \"substantial and injurious effect\" on the verdict.\r\nFirst, Braley acknowledged that Platt's duffel bag  \r\ncontaining \"[a] couple of camouflage suits\"   was in the back seat\r\nof the Braley car.  Accordingly, no inconsistency existed, since\r\nthe term \"camouflage suits\" amply embraces camouflage masks.\r\nFurthermore, Dale Braley neither testified that King and\r\nPlatt had not retrieved the masks from the duffel bag, nor that\r\nthey had not worn masks or carried a knife into the motel.  Rather,\r\nBraley testified that he could not recall seeing Platt and King\r\nretrieve or put on masks.  Nor did King state that he and Platt\r\neither donned the masks while in or near the Braley car, or that\r\nBraley had an opportunity to observe them retrieving or donning\r\nmasks.  Thus, the Dale Braley testimony did not contradict Kim\r\nStark's statement that the robbers wore masks while inside the\r\nmotel.\r\nPlatt next contends that the jury must have rejected the\r\nBraley testimony (i) as unreliable, since he admittedly gave the\r\npolice different versions of the crime, and (ii) as self-serving,\r\nsince he received a reduced sentence for cooperating with the\r\nState.  Neither contention withstands scrutiny.\r\nBraley conceded that he lied to the police at the outset\r\nin order to conceal his own involvement in the robbery, but decided\r\nto confess in November 1994 after hearing rumors that other\r\nwitnesses had implicated him.  Moreover, in no subsequent interview\r\ndid Braley fail to implicate Platt as the third participant in the\r\nmotel robbery.\r\nFurthermore, although the defense impeached Braley with\r\nhis prior criminal record, and thoroughly explored the terms of the\r\nplea agreement, the jury heard testimony that Braley had important\r\nreasons not to lie about Platt's involvement:  Braley, who was\r\nserving a twelve-year prison sentence, with all but six years\r\nsuspended, acknowledged that perjury would have exposed him to six\r\nyears' further imprisonment.  Braley also testified that he and\r\nPlatt, a \"close friend,\" shared an apartment in July 1994.\r\nFinally, under the harmless-error analysis the critical\r\ninquiry is not whether the Braley testimony   standing alone   was\r\nreliable, but whether the jury returned a guilty verdict against\r\nPlatt solely because the Robert King statement was in evidence. \r\nImportantly, the defense impeached the King statement along\r\nsubstantially the same lines as it had done with Braley,\r\nintroducing evidence of King's plea agreement and prior criminal\r\nrecord (e.g., a 1992 robbery conviction).  And the defense adduced\r\nevidence that in January 1996 Robert King had given a different\r\naccount of the robbery, claiming that Platt was not involved. \r\nThus, had the jury found grounds to consider Braley's testimony\r\nsuspect, it would have had like grounds to reject, as unreliable,\r\nthe Robert King statement.\r\n               c)   The Corroborative Evidence         \r\nThe State bolstered the Braley testimony with independent\r\ncorroborative testimony connecting Platt to the motel robbery.  In\r\norder to substantiate the Braley testimony that Platt knew Kim\r\nStark, the State called both Stark and Dale Braley's brother,\r\nDonald, to confirm that Platt had stayed overnight at the Econo-\r\nLodge two weeks prior to the robbery. Stark testified that she had\r\nspoken to Platt on that occasion, and that she had met him\r\npreviously through a friend. \r\nTen days after the Econo-Lodge robbery, an electric\r\ncompany worker found a red corduroy duffel bag with white handles\r\n(State's Exhibit 2) behind a tree near Church Road in Bangor. \r\nInside the bag there was a tag bearing the name and address of\r\nPlatt's girlfriend, Angela Turner, as well as a camouflage net\r\njacket with hood, two camouflage baseball caps fitted with netting\r\nmasks, some brown gloves, and a Halloween mask.  Turner testified\r\nthat she had loaned the bag to Platt for a trip to Chicago on July\r\n9-11, 1994, that she had not seen it after Platt returned from the\r\ntrip, and, further, that a friend had supplied Platt with\r\ncamouflage clothing.  Braley testified that Platt had the duffel\r\nbag in his possession when Braley and Boudreau picked him up at the\r\nairport, and that the same bag was in the back seat of Braley's car\r\non the morning of the robbery.\r\nFour days after the duffel bag was found near Church\r\nRoad, an off-duty detective discovered a plastic shopping bag\r\ninside the foundation of a washed-out bridge at the Ohio Street\r\nextension in Bangor.  Among other items, the bag contained the Old\r\nOrchard Beach sweatshirt and a Department of Labor Childcare\r\nCertification card bearing the name \"Angela Turner.\"  Stark\r\ntestified that one of the robbers had worn the Old Orchard Beach\r\nsweatshirt (State's Exhibit 1); Braley testified that Platt owned\r\nthe sweatshirt, and had worn it on the day of the robbery.\r\nTellingly, Dale Braley's brother, Donald, testified that\r\nPlatt had bought the sweatshirt on a recent trip to Old Orchard\r\nBeach.  Donald also testified that some time after the robbery he\r\nhad driven to Ohio Street   with Platt, Platt's friend, Dennis\r\nSullivan, and Sullivan's girlfriend, Susan Boober   where he saw\r\nthem hide the plastic shopping bag in the bridge foundation.\r\nFinally, Timothy Boudreau testified that Platt, King, and\r\nDale Braley had shown up together at Boudreau's apartment on the\r\nmorning of the robbery, that all three were acting \"hyper,\" and\r\nthat Platt looked \"wide-eyed and attentive.\"\r\nThus, the corroborating evidence tended strongly to\r\nsubstantiate the Dale Braley testimony that Platt had been the\r\nthird participant in the Econo-Lodge robbery.\r\n               d)   The Platt Admissions\r\nThe State also presented four witnesses   Angela Turner,\r\nDonald Braley, Timothy Boudreau and Susan Boober   who testified\r\nthat Platt had admitted in the presence of each that he had taken\r\npart in the Econo-Lodge robbery.  These witnesses testified that\r\nPlatt had volunteered different details relating to the robbery: \r\nPlatt told Angela Turner that he had used a four-inch knife in the\r\nrobbery; he told Boudreau that he had used a knife and a camouflage\r\nmask, and that he knew the motel clerk.  Susan Boober overheard\r\nPlatt admit to her boyfriend, Dennis Sullivan, that he had used a\r\n\"butter or jack knife\" or a \"[small] pocket knife.\"\r\nPlatt discounts their testimony as unreliable because\r\nthey were not eyewitnesses to the robbery. Cf. Sinnott, 139 F.3d at\r\n18-19 (no harmless error where improperly admitted evidence was\r\ncumulative of testimony of four nonparty eyewitnesses).\r\nAlthough we found nonparty eyewitness testimony to be\r\ncompelling in Sinnott, it does not follow that non-eyewitness\r\nevidence cannot support a finding of harmless error.  Each case is\r\nto be judged on its facts.  In some circumstances, eyewitness\r\ntestimony may be untrustworthy; whereas third-party reports of a\r\ndefendant's self-incriminating statements may prove compelling, as\r\nwas the case here.\r\nPlatt did not simply admit criminal complicity to these\r\nfour individuals on the same occasion; he did so in some detail, on\r\nfour separate occasions, to nonparty witnesses.  Nor does Platt\r\nsuggest any reason to suppose that any of these nonparty witnesses\r\nhad a motive to testify falsely against him.  Rather, Angela\r\nTurner, one of two defense witnesses, had been a reluctant\r\ngovernment witness, see supra note 5, who testified not only that\r\nPlatt was the father of her infant daughter, but that she remained\r\n\"close\" to him and visited him often.\r\nSimilarly, Boudreau testified that Platt was his friend\r\nand that in the fall of 1994 he had not told the police that Platt\r\nhad admitted his involvement in the Econo-Lodge robbery.  Susan\r\nBoober, whose relationship with Platt was more attenuated and whose\r\ntestimony was read back to the jury during its deliberations, had\r\neven less apparent motive to testify falsely against him.  Thus,\r\nthe trial record reveals no plausible basis for supposing that\r\nthese four witnesses, independently or in concert, sought falsely\r\nto implicate Platt.\r\n     3.   Relative Strength of the Defense  \r\nPlatt offered two defense theories.  First, the defense\r\nsuggested that Dale Braley's brother, Donald, who had a prior\r\nrobbery conviction, committed the Econo-Lodge robbery along with\r\nRobert King and Dale Braley, and that Dale falsely implicated Platt\r\nto protect Donald.  Second, the defense intimated that two persons\r\nRobert King and Dale Braley   robbed the Econo-Lodge, not three. \r\nWe conclude that the Robert King statement to the police in January\r\n1995 could not have caused the jury to reject either defense\r\ntheory.\r\nThe defense suggested that State's Exhibit 1, the Old\r\nOrchard Beach sweatshirt worn by one of the robbers, belonged to\r\nDale Braley's brother, Donald, rather than Platt.  Be that as it\r\nmay, the King statement does not so much as mention the Old Orchard\r\nBeach sweatshirt. See supra Section II.B.1.  Further, the defense\r\nnoted that Kim Stark had not seen either robber wearing eyeglasses,\r\nwhereas Platt always wore his glasses.  Once again, however, the\r\nKing statement never indicated whether or not King's companion had\r\nworn eyeglasses.\r\nFinally, the defense relied on evidence that Donald\r\nBraley had spent one night with Platt at the Econo-Lodge in late\r\nJune 1994, thus suggesting that Donald may have been the person who\r\ntold Dale Braley and Robert King on July 17 that he knew the motel\r\nclerk.  Once again, however, the Robert King statement could not\r\nhave hobbled this defense theory, since King did not purport to\r\ncomprehend how his companion had become acquainted with Kim Stark. \r\nNor did King ever suggest that Donald Braley did not know Stark. \r\nFinally, Donald Braley acknowledged that he and Platt had stayed at\r\nthe Econo-Lodge on a previous occasion.\r\nFar from hindering the defense, the King statement\r\nallowed it to exploit an otherwise unavailable theory   that only\r\ntwo people (viz., Dale Braley and King) committed the Econo-Lodge\r\nrobbery, and that no third person remained outside in the getaway\r\nvehicle.  Thus, in attempting to impeach the King statement, the\r\ndefense was allowed to introduce evidence that King had recently\r\nrecanted his January 1995 statement, and now claimed that Platt was\r\nnever involved in the robbery.\r\n                     III\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nFor these reasons, we cannot conclude that admission of\r\nthe redacted King statement into evidence constituted error of such\r\nmagnitude as to have had a substantial effect on the jury verdict. \r\nSee Sinnott, 139 F.3d at 15.  Accordingly, the district court order\r\nis affirmed.\n",

After entering into plea agreements\r\nwith state and federal prosecutors, King and Braley were sentenced\r\nto lengthy prison terms.\r\nAt Platt's state court trial, King invoked the Fifth\r\nAmendment on the ground that he could be placed in jeopardy of\r\nfuture federal prosecution.  The trial judge accordingly declared\r\nKing an unavailable witness and the State introduced the transcript\r\nof a January 1995 police interview in which King described how he\r\nand Platt had robbed the Econo-Lodge while Braley waited in the\r\ncar. \r\nIn order to safeguard Platt's rights under the\r\nConfrontation Clause, see Bruton v.

Harmless Error\r\nPlatt argues that admission of the King statement was not\r\nharmless error, since the remaining evidence of his complicity in\r\nthe Econo-Lodge robbery was not trustworthy.  The burden rests with\r\nthe State to establish that the putative Bruton-Gray error had no\r\n\"'substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\r\njury's verdict,'\" or that it \"was [not] of such magnitude that it\r\nactually casts doubt on the integrity of the verdict.\"  Sinnott v.\r\nDuval, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197851\"><a href=\"/opinion/197851/sinnott-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). \r\nNormally, we focus our analysis on three criteria: \"(1) the extent\r\nto which the error permeated the proceeding, (2) the centrality of\r\nthe issue affected by the error to the case as actually tried and\r\n(3) the relative strength of the properly admitted evidence of\r\nguilt.\"  Levasseur v.

The Robert King Statement\r\nAt a post-arrest interview in January 1995, Robert King\r\nprovided the following version of the Econo-Lodge robbery:  On the\r\nevening of July 16, 1994, King and his friends, Dale Braley and\r\nTimothy Boudreau, were driving around Bangor in Boudreau's car when\r\nthe police stopped the car and ticketed Boudreau for drag racing.\r\nThereafter, Dale Braley and King left Boudreau and met\r\n\"some person\" (viz., Platt).  Not long after this threesome began\r\ndriving around Bangor in Braley's car, Platt suggested they rob the\r\nEcono-Lodge, claiming that he knew the clerk on duty and they could\r\nget \"big bucks.\"\r\nUpon their arrival at the motel, King and Platt donned\r\ncamouflage net masks or rubber Halloween masks, retrieved from\r\nPlatt's red duffel bag.  Platt was carrying a knife.  Dale Braley,\r\nthe driver, waited in his car.  \r\nWhen Platt and King confronted the motel clerk, she\r\nbecame frantic, which upset King, who had understood from Platt's\r\nearlier assertions about \"knowing\" the clerk that the robbery would\r\nbe an \"inside deal\" and \"real easy.\"  After Platt brandished the\r\nknife and forced the clerk to open the cash register, he and King\r\nreturned to the Braley car.  Later, Platt divided the loot three\r\nways.\r\nAs the State acknowledges, Robert King's statement\r\nreadily met the second of the three Levasseur tests   the\r\ncentrality of the issue implicated by the error   since there can\r\nbe no real question but that the jury would have understood \"some\r\nperson\" as a reference to \"Platt.\"  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118184\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gray,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118184/gray-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Since the Econo-Lodge clerk could\r\nneither identify the two robbers, nor state whether a third\r\nparticipant had remained in the Braley car, the central dispute at\r\ntrial was whether Platt or some other masked person (viz., Dale\r\nBraley) had accompanied Robert King into the motel office.  Thus,\r\nthe King statement was directly on point.\r\n     2.   The Pervasiveness of the Error and the\r\nRelative Strength of Other Evidence\r\n\nThe fact that the Robert King statement implicated Platt\r\nis not necessarily dispositive of the harmless-error inquiry. \r\nRather, the third criterion   \"the relative strengths of the cases\r\nfor the prosecution and the defense absent the offending evidence\"\r\nis \"the major test of harmlessness.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197851\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sinnott,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197851/sinnott-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \r\nAs the other evidence of Platt's complicity   altogether\r\naside from the King statement   overshadowed and undermined all\r\ndefense theories, we conclude that the putative Bruton-Gray error\r\ndid not \"permeate[] the [state-court] proceeding.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196422\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Levasseur,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196422/levasseur-v-pepe/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r\n               a)   Kim Stark\r\nKim Stark, the clerk on duty at the Econo-Lodge on July\r\n17, 1994, provided the following eyewitness version of the robbery:\r\nAt 2 a.m., two persons entered the office while she was on the\r\nphone.  Each wore a mask made of mesh netting.  One wore a hooded\r\ncamouflage shirt (State's Exhibit 17), had \"dark eyes,\" wore no\r\neyeglasses, spoke in a voice Stark did not recognize, wore gloves,\r\nand threatened her with a knife.  The second robber, who did not\r\nspeak, wore a blue-striped sweatshirt (State's Exhibit 1:  blue-\r\nstriped sweatshirt with the words \"Old Orchard Beach, USA\" on\r\nfront).  The second robber removed approximately $1000 in cash\r\nfrom the register.  Stark was unable to identify either robber. \r\nShe knew Platt as a friend of a friend, and remembered having\r\nspoken with him on June 29, 1994, when he was an overnight guest at\r\nthe Econo-Lodge.    \r\n               b)   Dale Braley\r\nThe State's other eyewitness to the robbery was\r\ncodefendant Dale Braley, who gave the following account: In July\r\n1994, he shared a Bangor apartment with his fiancee, Wendy, his\r\nbrother Donald Braley, Thomas Platt, and Platt's girlfriend, Angela\r\nTurner.  On the evening of July 16, 1994, Braley and his friend\r\nRobert King were riding on Main Street in Bangor with Tim Boudreau\r\nat the wheel.  After Boudreau was ticketed for drag racing, he\r\ndrove to a nearby auto parts store where he parted company with\r\nBraley and King.\r\nThereafter, Braley and King met Platt, and the three\r\ndrove off in Braley's car.  Platt suggested that they rob the\r\nEcono-Lodge because he knew the woman who worked there.  A maroon\r\nduffel bag (with white handles), which Platt had borrowed from\r\nAngela Turner, was visible in the back seat of the Braley car.  The\r\nduffel bag contained \"a couple of camouflage suits, couple of hats,\r\nshirts, [and] some tools.\"  Braley testified that these items had\r\nbeen \"used in previous jobs [viz., robberies].\"\r\nWhile Braley waited in his car, Platt and King went into\r\nthe motel.  King was wearing a \"camouflage net suit\"; Platt an Old\r\nOrchard Beach sweatshirt.  Braley could not recall either Platt or\r\nKing donning any other clothing before leaving the car, nor\r\nremoving the knife from the glove compartment.  Three or four\r\nminutes later, Platt and King ran out of the motel.  Braley then\r\ndrove them to Tim Boudreau's house, where they left the duffel bag.\r\nThe robbery accounts provided by Robert King, Kim Stark\r\nand Dale Braley thus plainly disclosed remarkable similarities.\r\nAlthough improperly admitted evidence will be considered\r\nharmless if merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence, see,\r\ne.g., United States v. Adams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711207\"><a href=\"/opinion/711207/united-states-v-goldean-adams-bruce-raybon-jones-warren-e-adams-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1099 (11th Cir. 1996),\r\nPlatt focuses on what he considers a crucial discrepancy:  Robert\r\nKing stated that he and Platt had donned the masks which were in\r\nthe duffel bag, whereas Dale Braley did not see them do so.  Thus,\r\nPlatt argues, the King statement was more consistent with the\r\ndescriptions of the robbers given by Kim Stark, the Econo-Lodge\r\nclerk; and, without the King statement, the jury would not have\r\nvoted to convict based on Braley's inconsistent testimony.\r\nSince Dale Braley's testimony did not necessarily\r\nconflict with that of Kim Stark, however, we conclude that it had\r\nno \"substantial and injurious effect\" on the verdict.\r\nFirst, Braley acknowledged that Platt's duffel bag  \r\ncontaining \"[a] couple of camouflage suits\"   was in the back seat\r\nof the Braley car.  Accordingly, no inconsistency existed, since\r\nthe term \"camouflage suits\" amply embraces camouflage masks.\r\nFurthermore, Dale Braley neither testified that King and\r\nPlatt had not retrieved the masks from the duffel bag, nor that\r\nthey had not worn masks or carried a knife into the motel.  Rather,\r\nBraley testified that he could not recall seeing Platt and King\r\nretrieve or put on masks.  Nor did King state that he and Platt\r\neither donned the masks while in or near the Braley car, or that\r\nBraley had an opportunity to observe them retrieving or donning\r\nmasks.  Thus, the Dale Braley testimony did not contradict Kim\r\nStark's statement that the robbers wore masks while inside the\r\nmotel.\r\nPlatt next contends that the jury must have rejected the\r\nBraley testimony (i) as unreliable, since he admittedly gave the\r\npolice different versions of the crime, and (ii) as self-serving,\r\nsince he received a reduced sentence for cooperating with the\r\nState.  Neither contention withstands scrutiny.\r\nBraley conceded that he lied to the police at the outset\r\nin order to conceal his own involvement in the robbery, but decided\r\nto confess in November 1994 after hearing rumors that other\r\nwitnesses had implicated him.  Moreover, in no subsequent interview\r\ndid Braley fail to implicate Platt as the third participant in the\r\nmotel robbery.\r\nFurthermore, although the defense impeached Braley with\r\nhis prior criminal record, and thoroughly explored the terms of the\r\nplea agreement, the jury heard testimony that Braley had important\r\nreasons not to lie about Platt's involvement:  Braley, who was\r\nserving a twelve-year prison sentence, with all but six years\r\nsuspended, acknowledged that perjury would have exposed him to six\r\nyears' further imprisonment.  Braley also testified that he and\r\nPlatt, a \"close friend,\" shared an apartment in July 1994.\r\nFinally, under the harmless-error analysis the critical\r\ninquiry is not whether the Braley testimony   standing alone   was\r\nreliable, but whether the jury returned a guilty verdict against\r\nPlatt solely because the Robert King statement was in evidence. \r\nImportantly, the defense impeached the King statement along\r\nsubstantially the same lines as it had done with Braley,\r\nintroducing evidence of King's plea agreement and prior criminal\r\nrecord (e.g., a 1992 robbery conviction).  And the defense adduced\r\nevidence that in January 1996 Robert King had given a different\r\naccount of the robbery, claiming that Platt was not involved. \r\nThus, had the jury found grounds to consider Braley's testimony\r\nsuspect, it would have had like grounds to reject, as unreliable,\r\nthe Robert King statement.\r\n               c)   The Corroborative Evidence         \r\nThe State bolstered the Braley testimony with independent\r\ncorroborative testimony connecting Platt to the motel robbery.  In\r\norder to substantiate the Braley testimony that Platt knew Kim\r\nStark, the State called both Stark and Dale Braley's brother,\r\nDonald, to confirm that Platt had stayed overnight at the Econo-\r\nLodge two weeks prior to the robbery. Stark testified that she had\r\nspoken to Platt on that occasion, and that she had met him\r\npreviously through a friend. \r\nTen days after the Econo-Lodge robbery, an electric\r\ncompany worker found a red corduroy duffel bag with white handles\r\n(State's Exhibit 2) behind a tree near Church Road in Bangor. \r\nInside the bag there was a tag bearing the name and address of\r\nPlatt's girlfriend, Angela Turner, as well as a camouflage net\r\njacket with hood, two camouflage baseball caps fitted with netting\r\nmasks, some brown gloves, and a Halloween mask.  Turner testified\r\nthat she had loaned the bag to Platt for a trip to Chicago on July\r\n9-11, 1994, that she had not seen it after Platt returned from the\r\ntrip, and, further, that a friend had supplied Platt with\r\ncamouflage clothing.  Braley testified that Platt had the duffel\r\nbag in his possession when Braley and Boudreau picked him up at the\r\nairport, and that the same bag was in the back seat of Braley's car\r\non the morning of the robbery.\r\nFour days after the duffel bag was found near Church\r\nRoad, an off-duty detective discovered a plastic shopping bag\r\ninside the foundation of a washed-out bridge at the Ohio Street\r\nextension in Bangor.  Among other items, the bag contained the Old\r\nOrchard Beach sweatshirt and a Department of Labor Childcare\r\nCertification card bearing the name \"Angela Turner.\"  Stark\r\ntestified that one of the robbers had worn the Old Orchard Beach\r\nsweatshirt (State's Exhibit 1); Braley testified that Platt owned\r\nthe sweatshirt, and had worn it on the day of the robbery.\r\nTellingly, Dale Braley's brother, Donald, testified that\r\nPlatt had bought the sweatshirt on a recent trip to Old Orchard\r\nBeach.  Donald also testified that some time after the robbery he\r\nhad driven to Ohio Street   with Platt, Platt's friend, Dennis\r\nSullivan, and Sullivan's girlfriend, Susan Boober   where he saw\r\nthem hide the plastic shopping bag in the bridge foundation.\r\nFinally, Timothy Boudreau testified that Platt, King, and\r\nDale Braley had shown up together at Boudreau's apartment on the\r\nmorning of the robbery, that all three were acting \"hyper,\" and\r\nthat Platt looked \"wide-eyed and attentive.\"\r\nThus, the corroborating evidence tended strongly to\r\nsubstantiate the Dale Braley testimony that Platt had been the\r\nthird participant in the Econo-Lodge robbery.\r\n               d)   The Platt Admissions\r\nThe State also presented four witnesses   Angela Turner,\r\nDonald Braley, Timothy Boudreau and Susan Boober   who testified\r\nthat Platt had admitted in the presence of each that he had taken\r\npart in the Econo-Lodge robbery.  These witnesses testified that\r\nPlatt had volunteered different details relating to the robbery: \r\nPlatt told Angela Turner that he had used a four-inch knife in the\r\nrobbery; he told Boudreau that he had used a knife and a camouflage\r\nmask, and that he knew the motel clerk.  Susan Boober overheard\r\nPlatt admit to her boyfriend, Dennis Sullivan, that he had used a\r\n\"butter or jack knife\" or a \"[small] pocket knife.\"\r\nPlatt discounts their testimony as unreliable because\r\nthey were not eyewitnesses to the robbery. Cf. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197851\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sinnott,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197851/sinnott-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at\r\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">-19 (no harmless error where improperly admitted evidence was\r\ncumulative of testimony of four nonparty eyewitnesses).\r\nAlthough we found nonparty eyewitness testimony to be\r\ncompelling in Sinnott, it does not follow that non-eyewitness\r\nevidence cannot support a finding of harmless error.  Each case is\r\nto be judged on its facts.  In some circumstances, eyewitness\r\ntestimony may be untrustworthy; whereas third-party reports of a\r\ndefendant's self-incriminating statements may prove compelling, as\r\nwas the case here.\r\nPlatt did not simply admit criminal complicity to these\r\nfour individuals on the same occasion; he did so in some detail, on\r\nfour separate occasions, to nonparty witnesses.  Nor does Platt\r\nsuggest any reason to suppose that any of these nonparty witnesses\r\nhad a motive to testify falsely against him.  Rather, Angela\r\nTurner, one of two defense witnesses, had been a reluctant\r\ngovernment witness, see supra note 5, who testified not only that\r\nPlatt was the father of her infant daughter, but that she remained\r\n\"close\" to him and visited him often.\r\nSimilarly, Boudreau testified that Platt was his friend\r\nand that in the fall of 1994 he had not told the police that Platt\r\nhad admitted his involvement in the Econo-Lodge robbery.  Susan\r\nBoober, whose relationship with Platt was more attenuated and whose\r\ntestimony was read back to the jury during its deliberations, had\r\neven less apparent motive to testify falsely against him.  Thus,\r\nthe trial record reveals no plausible basis for supposing that\r\nthese four witnesses, independently or in concert, sought falsely\r\nto implicate Platt.\r\n     3.   Relative Strength of the Defense  \r\nPlatt offered two defense theories.  First, the defense\r\nsuggested that Dale Braley's brother, Donald, who had a prior\r\nrobbery conviction, committed the Econo-Lodge robbery along with\r\nRobert King and Dale Braley, and that Dale falsely implicated Platt\r\nto protect Donald.  Second, the defense intimated that two persons\r\nRobert King and Dale Braley   robbed the Econo-Lodge, not three. \r\nWe conclude that the Robert King statement to the police in January\r\n1995 could not have caused the jury to reject either defense\r\ntheory.\r\nThe defense suggested that State's Exhibit 1, the Old\r\nOrchard Beach sweatshirt worn by one of the robbers, belonged to\r\nDale Braley's brother, Donald, rather than Platt.  Be that as it\r\nmay, the King statement does not so much as mention the Old Orchard\r\nBeach sweatshirt. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra </span><pre class=\"inline\">Section II.B.1.  Further, the defense\r\nnoted that Kim Stark had not seen either robber wearing eyeglasses,\r\nwhereas Platt always wore his glasses.  Once again, however, the\r\nKing statement never indicated whether or not King's companion had\r\nworn eyeglasses.\r\nFinally, the defense relied on evidence that Donald\r\nBraley had spent one night with Platt at the Econo-Lodge in late\r\nJune 1994, thus suggesting that Donald may have been the person who\r\ntold Dale Braley and Robert King on July 17 that he knew the motel\r\nclerk.  Once again, however, the Robert King statement could not\r\nhave hobbled this defense theory, since King did not purport to\r\ncomprehend how his companion had become acquainted with Kim Stark. \r\nNor did King ever suggest that Donald Braley did not know Stark. \r\nFinally, Donald Braley acknowledged that he and Platt had stayed at\r\nthe Econo-Lodge on a previous occasion.\r\nFar from hindering the defense, the King statement\r\nallowed it to exploit an otherwise unavailable theory   that only\r\ntwo people (viz., Dale Braley and King) committed the Econo-Lodge\r\nrobbery, and that no third person remained outside in the getaway\r\nvehicle.  Thus, in attempting to impeach the King statement, the\r\ndefense was allowed to introduce evidence that King had recently\r\nrecanted his January 1995 statement, and now claimed that Platt was\r\nnever involved in the robbery.\r\n                     III\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nFor these reasons, we cannot conclude that admission of\r\nthe redacted King statement into evidence constituted error of such\r\nmagnitude as to have had a substantial effect on the jury verdict. \r\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197851\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sinnott,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197851/sinnott-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.
