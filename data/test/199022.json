Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                Torruella, Chief Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, Mary\nE. Rogers, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Margaret\nE. Curran, United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellant.\n\n     Steven A. Lagana, with whom     Lagana & Associates was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\fJuly 27, 2000\n\f            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.      This appeal by the\n\ngovernment challenges a sentence imposed by the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island (Torres, J.).\n\nDefendant-Appellee Julio Cesar Luna-Díaz (hereafter \"Luna\") was\n\nconvicted of the offense of reentry after deportation.          At\n\nsentencing, the district court refused to apply a 16-level\n\nenhancement for reentry by an alien who had previously been\n\ndeported following conviction of an aggravated felony.     Finding\n\nthe district court's decision contrary to the language of the\n\nguidelines, we reverse and remand for new sentencing.\n\n            I. Offense Facts\n\n            Although the law in this case is complex, the facts are\n\nsimple and undisputed.     The events that occasioned this appeal\n\nbegan in October of 1992, when Luna first entered the United\n\nStates illegally.     In December of 1993, Luna pled guilty in\n\nMassachusetts    state court to four felony drug offenses related\n\nto the manufacture and distribution of cocaine (hereafter \"the\n\n1993 conviction\").    The state court imposed a two-year suspended\n\nsentence.     In May of 1995, Luna was deported.        Luna again\n\nentered the country illegally in September of 1997, but was\n\nalmost immediately apprehended and deported.       In December of\n\n1997, Luna again entered the country without permission from the\n\nAttorney General.    On March 26, 1998, he was arrested.   Shortly\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fafter his arrest, Luna was indicted, and he pled guilty on\n\nSeptember 11, 1998 to a violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) (1994),\n\nwhich bars deported aliens from returning without the express\n\npermission   of   the   Attorney   General.   The    district   court\n\nsentenced him to eighteen months imprisonment.\n\n         II. Procedural Facts and Relevant Statutes\n\n         This case is governed by a somewhat complex web of\n\nfederal and state statutes.    Section 1326(a), the statute under\n\nwhich Luna was indicted, states in pertinent part:\n\n         Subject to subsection (b) of this section,\n         any alien who —\n           (1) has been denied admission, excluded,\n           deported, or removed . . . and thereafter\n           (2) enters . . . the United States, unless\n           . . . the Attorney General has expressly\n           consented . . .\n         shall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned\n         not more than 2 years, or both.\n\nSection 1326(b) provides that:\n\n         Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this\n         section, in the case of any alien described\n         in such subsection — . . .\n           (2) whose removal was subsequent to a\n           conviction for commission of an aggravated\n           felony, such alien shall be fined under\n           [Title 18], imprisoned not more than 20\n           years, or both . . . .\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) § 2L1.2 is\n\nthe relevant guideline provision for violations of § 1326.\n\nSection 2L1.2 sets a base offense level of 8.       Subsection (b) of\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f§ 2L1.2 provides for enhancements based on specific offense\n\ncharacteristics.   It states:\n\n         (b) Specific Offense Characteristic\n                (1) If the defendant previously was\n         deported after a criminal conviction . . .\n         increase as follows . . . .:\n                     (A) If the conviction was for an\n         aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b).\n\n         After pleading guilty, Luna obtained a continuance of\n\nhis sentencing hearing in order to challenge his earlier 1993\n\nconviction in a Massachusetts state court.   Luna then moved in\n\nstate court to vacate his previous conviction.    As support for\n\nthis motion, Luna cited Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278 § 29D (1998).\n\nThis law, which applies in all criminal cases in Massachusetts,\n\nmandates a warning to defendants pleading guilty, that a guilty\n\nplea may have adverse immigration consequences.   Chapter 278, §\n\n29D states:\n\n         The court shall not accept a plea of guilty\n         . . . from any defendant in any criminal\n         proceeding unless the court advises such\n         defendant of the following: \"If you are not\n         a citizen of the United States, you are\n         hereby advised that conviction of the\n         offense for which you have been charged may\n         have   the    consequences  of   deportation,\n         exclusion from admission to the United\n         States,    or    denial  of   naturalization,\n         pursuant to the laws of the United States.\"\n         The defendant shall not be required at the\n         time of the plea to disclose to the court\n         his legal status in the United States . . .\n         .\n\n                                -5-\n\f            If the court fails so to advise the\n          defendant, and he later at any time shows\n          that his plea and conviction may have one of\n          the enumerated consequences, the court, on\n          the defendant's motion, shall vacate the\n          judgment, and permit the defendant to\n          withdraw the plea of guilty . . . . Absent\n          a record that the court provided the\n          advisement required by this section, the\n          defendant shall be presumed not to have\n          received the required advisement.\n\nIn a proceeding before the state court, the judge who had\n\naccepted the original plea examined the docket and record from\n\nthe 1993 conviction.       The court noted that the box marked\n\n\"Advised of Alien Rights\" had not been checked.1       In keeping with\n\n§ 29D's presumption, the court vacated the plea.\n\n          After vacating the 1983 conviction, Luna moved in\n\nfederal   district     court   to   advance   his   sentencing.      At\n\nsentencing, Luna claimed that § 2L1.2(b) no longer applied to\n\nhim, because he had vacated his conviction.            The government\n\ndisagreed,   arguing     instead     that   the   relevant   time   for\n\ndetermination of felon status is the time of deportation, not\n\nthe time of sentencing on the reentry offense.           The district\n\ncourt accepted the defendant's view and declined to apply the\n\n\n    1  We note that there are, on the docket sheet, five boxes to\ncheck for colloquy warning.     They are: \"Advised of right to\ncounsel;\" \"Advised of right to drug exam;\" \"Advised of right to\nbail review;\" \"Advised of right to F.I. Jury Trial;\" and\n\"Advised of alien rights.\"      The New Bedford District Court\nchecked only one of these boxes: the one for the right to a jury\ntrial.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f16-level enhancement.        The government objected to the resulting\n\nsentence of eighteen months, and this appeal ensued.\n\n           III. Standard of Review\n\n           We review the legal determination of the guideline's\n\nmeaning and scope de novo.           See United States v. Talladino, 38\n\nF.3d 1255, 1263 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[Q]uestions of law — including\n\ninterpretive questions concerning the meaning and scope of the\n\nsentencing guidelines — engender de novo review.\").\n\n           IV. Guideline Interpretation\n\n           We begin, as with other questions of statutory and\n\nregulatory   interpretation,          with    the   plain    language   of   the\n\ndisputed guideline.         See United States v. McMinn, 103 F.3d 216,\n\n221 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"Our construction is guided by conventional\n\ninterpretive principles.\"); see also United States v. Butler,\n\n207 F.3d 839, 847 (6th Cir. 2000) (\"It was proper for the\n\ndistrict   court   to   take     a    plain    language      approach   in   its\n\ninterpretation     of   §    3B1.4,    because      courts    must   treat   the\n\nsentencing guidelines as if they were a statute, and follow the\n\nclear, unambiguous language if there is no manifestation of a\n\ncontrary intent.\") (opinion of Clay, J.) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); United States v. Lewis, 93 F.3d 1075, 1080 (2d\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fCir. 1996) (\"Interpretation of the Guidelines is similar to\n\nstatutory construction.\").2\n\n           The guideline at issue in this case states:           \"If the\n\ndefendant previously was deported after a . . . conviction . .\n\n.   for   an   aggravated   felony       increase   16   levels.\"     The\n\nguideline's     plain   language     militates      in   favor   of   the\n\ngovernment's position.      The language suggests that the relevant\n\ntime is the time of deportation: \"deported after a . . .\n\nconviction,\" and not the time of sentencing.              The guideline\n\nspeaks of time, not possession or status.           In other words, the\n\nguideline (and statute) might have dealt with aliens who have a\n\nprevious aggravated felony conviction or are convicted felons,\n\nand then are convicted of reentry.         The guideline, however, is\n\nin the past tense, which suggests that the present status of the\n\n\n\n     2 There is one crucial difference between interpreting\ncriminal statutes and all other statutes.     In interpreting a\ncriminal statute, including the guidelines, the rule of lenity\napplies.    See United States v. Werlinger, 894 F.2d 1015, 1017-\n18 (8th Cir. 1990) (invoking rule of lenity to find that\nGuidelines shall not be readily construed to multiply punishment\nfor conduct already punished through the application of another\nguideline). The rule of lenity requires that ambiguities in the\nscope of a criminal statute must be resolved in favor of the\ncriminal defendant. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259,\n266 (1997); see also United States v. Bowen, 127 F.3d 9, 13 (1st\nCir. 1997) (invoking the rule of lenity to resolve Sentencing\nGuidelines' ambiguity in favor of criminal defendant). The rule\ncomes into operation, though, only when the language of the\nstatute is ambiguous. See United States v. Campbell, 167 F.3d\n94, 98 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n                                   -8-\n\faggravated felony conviction is irrelevant.           It is impossible to\n\nalter the historical fact that the defendant was convicted, and\n\nthen deported.\n\n            The same is true of the statute itself, which speaks\n\nof an alien \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for\n\ncommission of an aggravated felony.\"           8 U.S.C. § 1326(b).       By\n\nall indications, the relevant time under the statute is the\n\nmoment of removal, not of sentencing.\n\n            This conclusion is in accord with that of the Tenth\n\nCircuit in the only reported decision to address this problem.3\n\nIn   United States v. Cisneros-Cabrera, 110 F.3d 746 (10th Cir.\n\n1997), the court ruled that subsequent vacatur of the previous\n\naggravated    felony   was   irrelevant   to    the   application   of    §\n\n2L1.2(b).    The court did so exclusively by resort to the plain\n\nlanguage of § 2L1.2(b) and § 1326(b).          It stated:\n\n\n\n     3 In our decision in United States v. Smith, 36 F.3d 128\n(1st Cir. 1994), we considered a facially similar claim. The\ndefendant in that case alleged that his indictment under § 1326,\nwhich referred specifically to § 1326(b)(2), should have been\ndismissed because he succeeded in vacating his prior state\nconviction. We rejected that contention, based on our view that\n§ 1326(b) does not establish a separate offense, but instead\nprovides a sentencing enhancement.    That view has since been\naffirmed by the Supreme Court. See Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U.S. 224 (1998). Despite the factual similarity,\nSmith bears no resemblance to the instant case as a legal\nmatter; it dealt with dismissal of the indictment based on a\nground since rejected by the Supreme Court, and not with\nsentencing on an issue not yet considered by the Supreme Court.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            Given the clarity of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2)\n            and U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(2), the district\n            court's    consideration  of   [defendant's]\n            vacated state conviction to enhance his\n            sentence was appropriate. [Defendant] does\n            not deny he was deported after a conviction\n            for an aggravated felony, and under §\n            2L1.2(b)(2), no more is required.      Thus,\n            while true most other sentence enhancement\n            provisions consider only those convictions\n            valid at the time of sentencing, in this\n            case,    the   relevant   time   frame   for\n            determining whether the sentence enhancement\n            should apply is specifically provided by\n            statute.\n\nCisneros-Cabrera, 110 F.3d at 748.\n\n            Review        of   other   statutes    that   depend   on     prior\n\nconvictions supports our conclusion with respect to the language\n\nof the statute.           The guidelines concerning calculation of a\n\ndefendant's criminal history score contain an explicit exception\n\nfor convictions subsequently vacated.               Application Note 6 to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 states: \"Sentences resulting from convictions\n\nthat (A) have been reversed or vacated because of errors of law\n\nor because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the\n\ndefendant, or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid . .\n\n.   are   not   to   be    counted.\"     Other    guidelines   that     provide\n\nsentence enhancements based on prior convictions explicitly\n\nincorporate by reference the above limitations.                For example,\n\nApplication Note 5 to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, dictates that, when\n\nconsidering enhancement under the guideline for possession of a\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\ffirearm, \"'prior felony conviction(s),' are defined in § 4B1.2.\"\n\n\n\n           More importantly, the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924 (1994) (ACCA), bars the use of \"[a]ny conviction\n\nwhich has been expunged, or set aside . . . .,\" see § 921(a)(20)\n\n(providing definitions for § 924), as does the guideline that\n\npertains to the Act.       See U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2, Application Note 3\n\n(cross-referencing     definition        of   convictions   set   out   in    §\n\n4A1.2).\n\n           The   absence    of    an    explicit    exception   for   vacated\n\nconvictions in § 2L1.2(b) and the statute compels a result here\n\nthat is different from the result that would obtain under the\n\nACCA or § 4A1.2.       Congress (in the ACCA) and the Sentencing\n\nCommission (in § 4A1.2) have both manifested an ability to state\n\nunambiguously when vacated convictions are to be disregarded for\n\npurposes of punishment.          Because the guidelines elsewhere make\n\nsuch an exception explicit, we are unable to read one implicitly\n\ninto § 2L1.2(b).\n\n           Our interpretation of the statute is in accord with the\n\ninterpretive method used by the Supreme Court in the analogous\n\nCustis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485(1994).              In that case the\n\nSupreme Court considered whether the ACCA \"should be read to\n\npermit    defendants   to    challenge        the    constitutionality       of\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconvictions used for sentencing purposes.\"                    Id. at 490.        The\n\nCourt    answered     this   question    in    the       negative,    noting    that\n\nrelated statutes explicitly permitted such challenges, but the\n\nACCA did not.         The Court found this omission deliberate and\n\ndispositive, stating:          \"The language of [the Drug Act] shows\n\nthat when Congress intended to authorize collateral attacks on\n\nprior convictions . . . it knew how to do so.                           Congress'\n\nomission of similar language in [the ACCA] indicates that it did\n\nnot    intend   to    give   defendants       the   right    to     challenge    the\n\nvalidity of prior convictions under this statute.\"                    Id. at 492.\n\nCf. Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991)\n\n(\"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section\n\nof a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\n\nis    generally    presumed    that    Congress      acts    intentionally       and\n\npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\") (quoted in\n\nCustis, 511 U.S. at 492).\n\n            The      First   Circuit    faced       an    similar    interpretive\n\nquestion in United States v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1198-99 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).       In that case, the defendant argued that a guideline\n\nenhancement for \"abuse of a position of trust\" should not apply\n\nto commercial bribery cases.            As support for his position, he\n\nnoted that because the guidelines mandated that the enhancement\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fcould not apply to public bribery cases, they should not apply\n\nto private bribery.           We rejected this position, stating:\n\n               The  absence   of   an    explicit   provision\n               restricting the application of the abuse-of-\n               trust enhancement in commercial bribery\n               cases severely undercuts the analogy urged\n               by [the defendant].     See United States v.\n               Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 673-74 (1st Cir. 1992)\n               (applying expressio unius est exclusio\n               alterius   principle   in    this   sentencing\n               context).     Furthermore, the Sentencing\n               Commission   took    pains    throughout   the\n               Guidelines to specify the circumstances in\n               which courts should not impose enhancements\n               for abuse of trust.\n\nJosleyn, 99 F.3d at 1198-99.             For similar reasons, we refuse to\n\nadopt Luna's view of the instant guideline.\n\n               In addition, the commentary to § 2L1.2(b) implies that\n\nLuna's     now-vacated        conviction    should       still    be     considered.\n\nApplication Note 4 states:             \"An adjustment under subsection (b)\n\nfor   a   prior    felony      conviction      applies     in    addition    to   any\n\ncriminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter\n\nFour, Part A . . . .\"          Application Note 4 makes clear that under\n\n§ 2L1.2(b), prior convictions are distinct from convictions\n\nconsidered       under    §   4A1.2.     Convictions       that    the    court   may\n\nconsider pursuant to § 4A1.2 are limited to those that have not\n\nbeen vacated; those that the court may consider under § 2L1.2(b)\n\ncarry     no    such     limitation,     and    are   to    be    considered      \"in\n\naddition.\"\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f              Diaz argues that the instant case is controlled by our\n\ndecision in           United States v.      Cuevas, 75 F.3d 778 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).       In Cuevas we considered the question of whether a plea\n\nof nolo contendere constituted a conviction for purposes of §\n\n2L1.2.       According to a state statute, such pleas could not be\n\nintroduced in any later proceeding, provided that the defendant\n\nhad successfully completed probation on the nolo plea.                  See id.\n\nat 780 & n.5.           We held that \"conviction\" under § 2L1.2 was a\n\nmatter of federal law, and that the state law did not control.\n\nSee id. at 781.\n\n              Contrary to Luna's assertions on appeal, we did not\n\nhold       that   §    4A1.1-2   provides    the    definition   for   the   term\n\n\"conviction\" in the reentry guideline.                We did not go that far.\n\nSee Cuevas, 75 F.3d at 780-81.                     We described the criminal\n\nhistory guideline as \"provid[ing] . . . guidance,\" id. at 782,\n\nand \"instructive, if not dispositive,\" id. at 782 n.10.                 Even if\n\nwe were to agree, which we do not, that Cuevas turned on\n\napplication of § 4A1.1-2 to § 2L1.2, that still would not bind\n\nus in the instant case.           Cuevas defined \"conviction\" but did not\n\ndeal with the exclusions from the definition that are at issue\n\nin the instant case.4\n\n\n       4\n       We are aware of the decision of the Second Circuit in\nUnited States v. Campbell, 167 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 1999). In that\ncase, the Second Circuit held that convictions that had been\n\n                                       -14-\n\f         V. Conclusion\n\n         For the reasons stated, we find that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in refusing to impose the enhancement.\n\nAccordingly, we   vacate the sentence imposed by the district\n\ncourt and remand for resentencing.5\n\n\n\n\nvacated could still form the basis for the § 2L1.2 enhancement\nwhere the reason for the vacatur (or reversal) was \"for reasons\nunrelated to innocence or errors of law.\" Id. at 98. In doing\nso, the court, like the Cuevas court, relied on § 4A1.2 as\ninstructive, although not controlling, for purposes of § 2L1.2.\nWere we to adopt the view of the Second Circuit, our result\nmight be the same; the vacatur in Diaz's case is arguably\ntechnical. We do not reach the issue, however, because of our\nholding above that the plain language of the guideline requires\nuse of Luna's prior conviction.\n    5  One caveat is appropriate.    The instant case does not\nrequire us to decide whether allowing § 2L1.2(b)'s enhancement\nto rest on a prior conviction vacated as a result of a\nconstitutional   infirmity,   egregious   error   of  law,   or\ndetermination of innocence, might in some limited circumstances\nraise constitutional due process concerns.\n\n                             -15-\n\f",

Defendant-Appellee Julio Cesar Luna-Daz (hereafter \"Luna\") was convicted of the offense of re-entry after deportation. At sentencing, the district court refused to apply a 16-level enhancement for re-entry by an alien who had previously been deported following conviction of an aggravated felony. Finding the district court's decision contrary to the language of the guidelines, we reverse and remand for new sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Offense Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the law in this case is complex, the facts are simple and undisputed. The events that occasioned this appeal began in October of 1992, when Luna first entered the United States illegally. In December of 1993, Luna pled guilty in Massachusetts state court to four felony drug offenses related to the manufacture and distribution of cocaine (hereafter \"the 1993 conviction\"). The state court imposed a two-year suspended sentence. In May of 1995, Luna was deported. Luna again entered the country illegally in September of 1997, but was almost immediately apprehended and deported. In December of 1997, Luna again entered the country without permission from the Attorney General. On March 26, 1998, he was arrested. Shortly after his arrest, Luna was indicted, and he pled guilty on September 11, 1998 to a violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) (1994), which bars deported aliens from returning without the express permission of the Attorney General. The district court sentenced him to eighteen months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Procedural Facts and Relevant Statutes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is governed by a somewhat complex web of federal and state statutes. Section 1326(a), the statute under which Luna was indicted, states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien who -</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed... and thereafter</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) enters... the United States, unless... the Attorney General has expressly consented...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 1326(b) provides that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of any alien described in such subsection -...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under [Title 18], imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) &#167; 2L1.2 is the relevant guideline provision for violations of &#167; 1326. Section 2L1.2 sets a base offense level of 8. Subsection (b) of &#167; 2L1.2 provides for enhancements based on specific offense characteristics. It states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Specific Offense Characteristic</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) If the defendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction... increase as follows....:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) If the conviction was for an aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pleading guilty, Luna obtained a continuance of his sentencing hearing in order to challenge his earlier 1993 conviction in a Massachusetts state court. Luna then moved in state court to vacate his previous conviction. As support for this motion, Luna cited Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278 &#167; 29D (1998). This law, which applies in all criminal cases in Massachusetts, mandates a warning to defendants pleading guilty, that a guilty plea may have adverse immigration consequences. Chapter 278, &#167; 29D states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court shall not accept a plea of guilty... from any defendant in any criminal proceeding unless the court advises such defendant of the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"If you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\" The defendant shall not be required at the time of the plea to disclose to the court his legal status in the United States</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court fails so to advise the defendant, and he later at any time shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences, the court, on the defendant's motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty.... Absent a record that the court provided the advisement required by this section, the defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required advisement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a proceeding before the state court, the judge who had accepted the original plea examined the docket and record from the 1993 conviction. The court noted that the box marked \"Advised of Alien Rights\" had not been checked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In keeping with &#167; 29D's presumption, the court vacated the plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After vacating the 1993 conviction, Luna moved in federal district court to advance his sentencing. At sentencing, Luna claimed that &#167; 2L1.2(b) no longer applied to him, because he had vacated his conviction. The government disagreed, arguing instead that the relevant time for determination of felon status is the time of deportation, not the time of sentencing on the re-entry offense. The district court accepted the defendant's view and declined to apply the 16-level enhancement. The government objected to the resulting sentence of eighteen months, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the legal determination of the guideline's meaning and scope de novo. See United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255, 1263 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[Q]uestions of law - including interpretive questions concerning the meaning and scope of the sentencing guidelines - engender de novo review.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Guideline Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin, as with other questions of statutory and regulatory interpretation, with the plain language of the disputed guideline. See United States v. McMinn, 103 F.3d 216, 221 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"Our construction is guided by conventional interpretive principles.\"); see also United States v. Butler, 207 F.3d 839, 847 (6th Cir. 2000) (\"It was proper for the district court to take a plain language approach in its interpretation of &#167; 3B1.4, because courts must treat the sentencing guidelines as if they were a statute, and follow the clear, unambiguous language if there is no manifestation of a contrary intent.\") (opinion of Clay, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Lewis, 93 F.3d 1075, 1080 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"Interpretation of the Guidelines is similar to statutory construction.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guideline at issue in this case states: \"If the defendant previously was deported after a... conviction... for an aggravated felony increase 16 levels.\" The guideline's plain language militates in favor of the government's position. The language suggests that the relevant time is the time of deportation: \"deported after a... conviction,\" and not the time of sentencing. The guideline speaks of time, not possession or status. In other words, the guideline (and statute) might have dealt with aliens who have a previous aggravated felony conviction or are convicted felons, and then are convicted of re-entry. The guideline, however, is in the past tense, which suggests that the present status of the aggravated felony conviction is irrelevant. It is impossible to alter the historical fact that the defendant was convicted, and then deported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true of the statute itself, which speaks of an alien \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b). By all indications, the relevant time under the statute is the moment of removal, not of sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is in accord with that of the Tenth Circuit in the only reported decision to address this problem.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In United States v. Cisneros-Cabrera, 110 F.3d 746 (10th Cir. 1997), the court ruled that subsequent vacatur of the previous aggravated felony was irrelevant to the application of &#167; 2L1.2(b). The court did so exclusively by resort to the plain language of &#167; 2L1.2(b) and &#167; 1326(b). It stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the clarity of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2), the district court's consideration of [defendant's] vacated state conviction to enhance his sentence was appropriate. [Defendant] does not deny he was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony, and under &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2), no more is required. Thus, while true most other sentence enhancement provisions consider only those convictions valid at the time of sentencing, in this case, the relevant time frame for determining whether the sentence enhancement should apply is specifically provided by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cisneros-Cabrera, 110 F.3d at 748.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of other statutes that depend on prior convictions supports our conclusion with respect to the language of the statute. The guidelines concerning calculation of a defendant's criminal history score contain an explicit exception for convictions subsequently vacated. Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2 states: \"Sentences resulting from convictions that (A) have been reversed or vacated because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the defendant, or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid... are not to be counted.\" Other guidelines that provide sentence enhancements based on prior convictions explicitly incorporate by reference the above limitations. For example, Application Note 5 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1, dictates that, when considering enhancement under the guideline for possession of a firearm, \"'prior felony conviction(s),' are defined in &#167; 4B1.2.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924 (1994) (ACCA), bars the use of \"[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside....,\" see &#167; 921(a)(20) (providing definitions for &#167; 924), as does the guideline that pertains to the Act. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, Application Note 3 (cross-referencing definition of convictions set out in &#167; 4A1.2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of an explicit exception for vacated convictions in &#167; 2L1.2(b) and the statute compels a result here that is different from the result that would obtain under the ACCA or &#167; 4A1.2. Congress (in the ACCA) and the Sentencing Commission (in &#167; 4A1.2) have both manifested an ability to state unambiguously when vacated convictions are to be disregarded for purposes of punishment. Because the guidelines elsewhere make such an exception explicit, we are unable to read one implicitly into &#167; 2L1.2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation of the statute is in accord with the interpretive method used by the Supreme Court in the analogous Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485(1994). In that case the Supreme Court considered whether the ACCA \"should be read to permit defendants to challenge the constitutionality of convictions used for sentencing purposes.\" Id. at 490. The Court answered this question in the negative, noting that related statutes explicitly permitted such challenges, but the ACCA did not. The Court found this omission deliberate and dispositive, stating: \"The language of [the Drug Act] shows that when Congress intended to authorize collateral attacks on prior convictions... it knew how to do so. Congress' omission of similar language in [the ACCA] indicates that it did not intend to give defendants the right to challenge the validity of prior convictions under this statute.\" Id. at 492. Cf. Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991) (\"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\") (quoted in Custis, 511 U.S. at 492).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Circuit faced an similar interpretive question in United States v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1198-99 (1st Cir. 1996). In that case, the defendant argued that a guideline enhancement for \"abuse of a position of trust\" should not apply to commercial bribery cases. As support for his position, he noted that because the guidelines mandated that the enhancement could not apply to public bribery cases, they should not apply to private bribery. We rejected this position, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of an explicit provision restricting the application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement in commercial bribery cases severely undercuts the analogy urged by [the defendant]. See United States v. Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 673-74 (1st Cir. 1992) (applying expressio unius est exclusio alterius principle in this sentencing context). Furthermore, the Sentencing Commission took pains throughout the Guidelines to specify the circumstances in which courts should not impose enhancements for abuse of trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Josleyn, 99 F.3d at 1198-99. For similar reasons, we refuse to adopt Luna's view of the instant guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the commentary to &#167; 2L1.2(b) implies that Luna's now-vacated conviction should still be considered. Application Note 4 states: \"An adjustment under subsection (b) for a prior felony conviction applies in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter Four, Part A....\" Application Note 4 makes clear that under &#167; 2L1.2(b), prior convictions are distinct from convictions considered under &#167; 4A1.2. Convictions that the court may consider pursuant to &#167; 4A1.2 are limited to those that have not been vacated; those that the court may consider under &#167; 2L1.2(b) carry no such limitation, and are to be considered \"in addition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz argues that the instant case is controlled by our decision in United States v. Cuevas, 75 F.3d 778 (1st Cir. 1996). In Cuevas we considered the question of whether a plea of nolo contendere constituted a conviction for purposes of &#167; 2L1.2. According to a state statute, such pleas could not be introduced in any later proceeding, provided that the defendant had successfully completed probation on the nolo plea. See id. at 780 &amp; n.5. We held that \"conviction\" under &#167; 2L1.2 was a matter of federal law, and that the state law did not control. See id. at 781.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Luna's assertions on appeal, we did not hold that &#167; 4A1.1-2 provides the definition for the term \"conviction\" in the re-entry guideline. We did not go that far. See Cuevas, 75 F.3d at 780-81. We described the criminal history guideline as \"provid[ing]... guidance,\" id. at 782, and \"instructive, if not dispositive,\" id. at 782 n.10. Even if we were to agree, which we do not, that Cuevas turned on application of &#167; 4A1.1-2 to &#167; 2L1.2, that still would not bind us in the instant case.

Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to impose the enhancement.

They are: \"Advised of right to counsel;\" \"Advised of right to drug exam;\" \"Advised of right to bail review;\" \"Advised of right to F.I. Jury Trial;\" and \"Advised of alien rights.\" The New Bedford District Court checked only one of these boxes: the one for the right to a jury trial.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  There is one crucial difference between interpreting criminal statutes and all other statutes. In interpreting a criminal statute, including the guidelines, the rule of lenity applies. See United States v. Werlinger, 894 F.2d 1015, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 1990) (invoking rule of lenity to find that Guidelines shall not be readily construed to multiply punishment for conduct already punished through the application of another guideline). The rule of lenity requires that ambiguities in the scope of a criminal statute must be resolved in favor of the criminal defendant. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997); see also United States v. Bowen, 127 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1997) (invoking the rule of lenity to resolve Sentencing Guidelines' ambiguity in favor of criminal defendant). The rule comes into operation, though, only when the language of the statute is ambiguous. See United States v. Campbell, 167 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  In our decision in United States v. Smith, 36 F.3d 128 (1st Cir. 1994), we considered a facially similar claim. The defendant in that case alleged that his indictment under &#167; 1326, which referred specifically to &#167; 1326(b)(2), should have been dismissed because he succeeded in vacating his prior state conviction. We rejected that contention, based on our view that &#167; 1326(b) does not establish a separate offense, but instead provides a sentencing enhancement. That view has since been affirmed by the Supreme Court. See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998). Despite the factual similarity, Smith bears no resemblance to the instant case as a legal matter; it dealt with dismissal of the indictment based on a ground since rejected by the Supreme Court, and not with sentencing on an issue not yet considered by the Supreme Court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  We are aware of the decision of the Second Circuit in United States v. Campbell, 167 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 1999). In that case, the Second Circuit held that convictions that had been vacated could still form the basis for the &#167; 2L1.2 enhancement where the reason for the vacatur (or reversal) was \"for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law.\" Id. at 98. In doing so, the court, like the Cuevas court, relied on &#167; 4A1.2 as instructive, although not controlling, for purposes of &#167; 2L1.2. Were we to adopt the view of the Second Circuit, our result might be the same; the vacatur in Diaz's case is arguably technical. We do not reach the issue, however, because of our holding above that the plain language of the guideline requires use of Luna's prior conviction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  One caveat is appropriate. The instant case does not require us to decide whether allowing &#167; 2L1.2(b)'s enhancement to rest on a prior conviction vacated as a result of a constitutional infirmity, egregious error of law, or determination of innocence, might in some limited circumstances raise constitutional due process concerns.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Defendant-Appellee Julio Cesar Luna-Daz (hereafter \"Luna\") was convicted of the offense of re-entry after deportation. At sentencing, the district court refused to apply a 16-level enhancement for re-entry by an alien who had previously been deported following conviction of an aggravated felony. Finding the district court's decision contrary to the language of the guidelines, we reverse and remand for new sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Offense Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the law in this case is complex, the facts are simple and undisputed. The events that occasioned this appeal began in October of 1992, when Luna first entered the United States illegally. In December of 1993, Luna pled guilty in Massachusetts state court to four felony drug offenses related to the manufacture and distribution of cocaine (hereafter \"the 1993 conviction\"). The state court imposed a two-year suspended sentence. In May of 1995, Luna was deported. Luna again entered the country illegally in September of 1997, but was almost immediately apprehended and deported. In December of 1997, Luna again entered the country without permission from the Attorney General. On March 26, 1998, he was arrested. Shortly after his arrest, Luna was indicted, and he pled guilty on September 11, 1998 to a violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) (1994), which bars deported aliens from returning without the express permission of the Attorney General. The district court sentenced him to eighteen months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Procedural Facts and Relevant Statutes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is governed by a somewhat complex web of federal and state statutes. Section 1326(a), the statute under which Luna was indicted, states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien who -</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed... and thereafter</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) enters... the United States, unless... the Attorney General has expressly consented...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 1326(b) provides that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of any alien described in such subsection -...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under [Title 18], imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) &#167; 2L1.2 is the relevant guideline provision for violations of &#167; 1326. Section 2L1.2 sets a base offense level of 8. Subsection (b) of &#167; 2L1.2 provides for enhancements based on specific offense characteristics. It states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Specific Offense Characteristic</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) If the defendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction... increase as follows....:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) If the conviction was for an aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pleading guilty, Luna obtained a continuance of his sentencing hearing in order to challenge his earlier 1993 conviction in a Massachusetts state court. Luna then moved in state court to vacate his previous conviction. As support for this motion, Luna cited Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278 &#167; 29D (1998). This law, which applies in all criminal cases in Massachusetts, mandates a warning to defendants pleading guilty, that a guilty plea may have adverse immigration consequences. Chapter 278, &#167; 29D states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court shall not accept a plea of guilty... from any defendant in any criminal proceeding unless the court advises such defendant of the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"If you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\" The defendant shall not be required at the time of the plea to disclose to the court his legal status in the United States</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court fails so to advise the defendant, and he later at any time shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences, the court, on the defendant's motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty.... Absent a record that the court provided the advisement required by this section, the defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required advisement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a proceeding before the state court, the judge who had accepted the original plea examined the docket and record from the 1993 conviction. The court noted that the box marked \"Advised of Alien Rights\" had not been checked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In keeping with &#167; 29D's presumption, the court vacated the plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After vacating the 1993 conviction, Luna moved in federal district court to advance his sentencing. At sentencing, Luna claimed that &#167; 2L1.2(b) no longer applied to him, because he had vacated his conviction. The government disagreed, arguing instead that the relevant time for determination of felon status is the time of deportation, not the time of sentencing on the re-entry offense. The district court accepted the defendant's view and declined to apply the 16-level enhancement. The government objected to the resulting sentence of eighteen months, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the legal determination of the guideline's meaning and scope de novo.

Guideline Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin, as with other questions of statutory and regulatory interpretation, with the plain language of the disputed guideline.

(internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725002\"><a href=\"/opinion/725002/united-states-v-ephraim-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span>, 1080 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"Interpretation of the Guidelines is similar to statutory construction.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guideline at issue in this case states: \"If the defendant previously was deported after a... conviction... for an aggravated felony increase 16 levels.\" The guideline's plain language militates in favor of the government's position. The language suggests that the relevant time is the time of deportation: \"deported after a... conviction,\" and not the time of sentencing. The guideline speaks of time, not possession or status. In other words, the guideline (and statute) might have dealt with aliens who have a previous aggravated felony conviction or are convicted felons, and then are convicted of re-entry. The guideline, however, is in the past tense, which suggests that the present status of the aggravated felony conviction is irrelevant. It is impossible to alter the historical fact that the defendant was convicted, and then deported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true of the statute itself, which speaks of an alien \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b). By all indications, the relevant time under the statute is the moment of removal, not of sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is in accord with that of the Tenth Circuit in the only reported decision to address this problem.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In United States v. Cisneros-Cabrera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739143\"><a href=\"/opinion/739143/united-states-v-alejandro-cisneros-cabrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span> </a></span>(10th Cir. 1997), the court ruled that subsequent vacatur of the previous aggravated felony was irrelevant to the application of &#167; 2L1.2(b). The court did so exclusively by resort to the plain language of &#167; 2L1.2(b) and &#167; 1326(b). It stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the clarity of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2), the district court's consideration of [defendant's] vacated state conviction to enhance his sentence was appropriate. [Defendant] does not deny he was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony, and under &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2), no more is required. Thus, while true most other sentence enhancement provisions consider only those convictions valid at the time of sentencing, in this case, the relevant time frame for determining whether the sentence enhancement should apply is specifically provided by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739143\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cisneros-Cabrera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/739143/united-states-v-alejandro-cisneros-cabrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of other statutes that depend on prior convictions supports our conclusion with respect to the language of the statute. The guidelines concerning calculation of a defendant's criminal history score contain an explicit exception for convictions subsequently vacated. Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2 states: \"Sentences resulting from convictions that (A) have been reversed or vacated because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the defendant, or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid... are not to be counted.\" Other guidelines that provide sentence enhancements based on prior convictions explicitly incorporate by reference the above limitations. For example, Application Note 5 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1, dictates that, when considering enhancement under the guideline for possession of a firearm, \"'prior felony conviction(s),' are defined in &#167; 4B1.2.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924 (1994) (ACCA), bars the use of \"[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside....,\" see &#167; 921(a)(20) (providing definitions for &#167; 924), as does the guideline that pertains to the Act. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, Application Note 3 (cross-referencing definition of convictions set out in &#167; 4A1.2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of an explicit exception for vacated convictions in &#167; 2L1.2(b) and the statute compels a result here that is different from the result that would obtain under the ACCA or &#167; 4A1.2. Congress (in the ACCA) and the Sentencing Commission (in &#167; 4A1.2) have both manifested an ability to state unambiguously when vacated convictions are to be disregarded for purposes of punishment. Because the guidelines elsewhere make such an exception explicit, we are unable to read one implicitly into &#167; 2L1.2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation of the statute is in accord with the interpretive method used by the Supreme Court in the analogous Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485(1994). In that case the Supreme Court considered whether the ACCA \"should be read to permit defendants to challenge the constitutionality of convictions used for sentencing purposes.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 490. </span>The Court answered this question in the negative, noting that related statutes explicitly permitted such challenges, but the ACCA did not. The Court found this omission deliberate and dispositive, stating: \"The language of [the Drug Act] shows that when Congress intended to authorize collateral attacks on prior convictions... it knew how to do so. Congress' omission of similar language in [the ACCA] indicates that it did not intend to give defendants the right to challenge the validity of prior convictions under this statute.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 492. </span>Cf.

In that case, the defendant argued that a guideline enhancement for \"abuse of a position of trust\" should not apply to commercial bribery cases. As support for his position, he noted that because the guidelines mandated that the enhancement could not apply to public bribery cases, they should not apply to private bribery. We rejected this position, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of an explicit provision restricting the application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement in commercial bribery cases severely undercuts the analogy urged by [the defendant].

Application Note 4 states: \"An adjustment under subsection (b) for a prior felony conviction applies in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter Four, Part A....\" Application Note 4 makes clear that under &#167; 2L1.2(b), prior convictions are distinct from convictions considered under &#167; 4A1.2. Convictions that the court may consider pursuant to &#167; 4A1.2 are limited to those that have not been vacated; those that the court may consider under &#167; 2L1.2(b) carry no such limitation, and are to be considered \"in addition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz argues that the instant case is controlled by our decision in United States v. Cuevas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196562\"><a href=\"/opinion/196562/united-states-v-cuevas/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1996). In Cuevas we considered the question of whether a plea of nolo contendere constituted a conviction for purposes of &#167; 2L1.2. According to a state statute, such pleas could not be introduced in any later proceeding, provided that the defendant had successfully completed probation on the nolo plea. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 780 </span>&amp; n.5. We held that \"conviction\" under &#167; 2L1.2 was a matter of federal law, and that the state law did not control. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 781.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Luna's assertions on appeal, we did not hold that &#167; 4A1.1-2 provides the definition for the term \"conviction\" in the re-entry guideline. We did not go that far. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196562\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cuevas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196562/united-states-v-cuevas/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">780-81</span></a></span>. We described the criminal history guideline as \"provid[ing]... guidance,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196562\"><a href=\"/opinion/196562/united-states-v-cuevas/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 782, </a></span>and \"instructive, if not dispositive,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196562\"><a href=\"/opinion/196562/united-states-v-cuevas/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 782 </a></span>n.10. Even if we were to agree, which we do not, that Cuevas turned on application of &#167; 4A1.1-2 to &#167; 2L1.2, that still would not bind us in the instant case. Cuevas defined \"conviction\" but did not deal with the exclusions from the definition that are at issue in the instant case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to impose the enhancement. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  We note that there are, on the docket sheet, five boxes to check for colloquy warning. They are: \"Advised of right to counsel;\" \"Advised of right to drug exam;\" \"Advised of right to bail review;\" \"Advised of right to F.I. Jury Trial;\" and \"Advised of alien rights.\" The New Bedford District Court checked only one of these boxes: the one for the right to a jury trial.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  There is one crucial difference between interpreting criminal statutes and all other statutes. In interpreting a criminal statute, including the guidelines, the rule of lenity applies. See United States v. Werlinger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535671\"><a href=\"/opinion/535671/united-states-v-dennis-allen-werlinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span>, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 1990) (invoking rule of lenity to find that Guidelines shall not be readily construed to multiply punishment for conduct already punished through the application of another guideline). The rule of lenity requires that ambiguities in the scope of a criminal statute must be resolved in favor of the criminal defendant. See United States v. Lanier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 266 (1997); see also United States v. Bowen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746978\"><a href=\"/opinion/746978/united-states-v-bradley-oliver-bowen-united-states-v-rinaldo/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1997) (invoking the rule of lenity to resolve Sentencing Guidelines' ambiguity in favor of criminal defendant). The rule comes into operation, though, only when the language of the statute is ambiguous. See United States v. Campbell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761519\"><a href=\"/opinion/761519/united-states-v-vincent-lloyd-campbell-aka-elijah-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 98 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  In our decision in United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678805\"><a href=\"/opinion/678805/united-states-v-devon-wayne-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1994), we considered a facially similar claim. The defendant in that case alleged that his indictment under &#167; 1326, which referred specifically to &#167; 1326(b)(2), should have been dismissed because he succeeded in vacating his prior state conviction. We rejected that contention, based on our view that &#167; 1326(b) does not establish a separate offense, but instead provides a sentencing enhancement. That view has since been affirmed by the Supreme Court. See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span> </a></span>(1998). Despite the factual similarity, Smith bears no resemblance to the instant case as a legal matter; it dealt with dismissal of the indictment based on a ground since rejected by the Supreme Court, and not with sentencing on an issue not yet considered by the Supreme Court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  We are aware of the decision of the Second Circuit in United States v. Campbell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761519\"><a href=\"/opinion/761519/united-states-v-vincent-lloyd-campbell-aka-elijah-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span> </a></span>(2d Cir. 1999). In that case, the Second Circuit held that convictions that had been vacated could still form the basis for the &#167; 2L1.2 enhancement where the reason for the vacatur (or reversal) was \"for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 98. </span>In doing so, the court, like the Cuevas court, relied on &#167; 4A1.2 as instructive, although not controlling, for purposes of &#167; 2L1.2. Were we to adopt the view of the Second Circuit, our result might be the same; the vacatur in Diaz's case is arguably technical. We do not reach the issue, however, because of our holding above that the plain language of the guideline requires use of Luna's prior conviction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  One caveat is appropriate. The instant case does not require us to decide whether allowing &#167; 2L1.2(b)'s enhancement to rest on a prior conviction vacated as a result of a constitutional infirmity, egregious error of law, or determination of innocence, might in some limited circumstances raise constitutional due process concerns.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
