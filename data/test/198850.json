Plaintiff-appellant Arnold W.\n\nVinick    appeals     the   district    court's    determination     that   he\n\npersonally       is   liable   for   withholding    taxes   that   Jefferson\n\nBronze, Inc. (“Jefferson Bronze”) failed to pay.                   Previously\n\nthis     court    vacated      a   determination     that   Vinick    was     a\n\n“responsible person” within the meaning of section 6672(a) of\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code and remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with our opinion.           See Vinick v. United States, 110\n\nF.3d 168 (1st Cir. 1997) (appeal from summary judgment in the\n\ngovernment's favor) (hereinafter Vinick I).             Following a bench\n\ntrial, the district court again ruled in the government's favor\n\nby finding Vinick to be a responsible person.               We reverse.\n\n                                       I.\n\n                                       A.\n\n            To ease the logistical burden on employees and to aid\n\nin the collection of taxes, the Internal Revenue Code requires\n\nemployers to withhold from employees' wages social security and\n\nfederal income taxes.          See 26 U.S.C. §§ 3102, 3402 (1994).          The\n\nmoney withheld is held by the employer in trust for the United\n\nStates.     See id. § 7501.          This system protects from later\n\nrecourse the employees who are deemed to have paid their taxes,\n\neven if the employer fails to pay the Internal Revenue Service\n\n(“IRS”) the money it withheld.              See Caterino v. United States,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f794 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1986) (noting that the IRS “has no\n\nrecourse   against   employees     who    have   had   income   and   social\n\nsecurity taxes withheld from their wages”).              The Code renders\n\nliable for the taxes due those it deems to be responsible\n\npersons who willfully have neglected to pay the withheld money.\n\nSee 26 U.S.C. § 6672.     In pertinent part, § 6672 states:\n\n           Any person required to collect, truthfully\n           account for, and pay over any tax imposed by\n           this title who willfully fails to collect\n           such tax, or truthfully account for and pay\n           over such tax, or willfully attempts in any\n           manner to evade or defeat any such tax or\n           the payment thereof, shall, in addition to\n           other penalties provided by law, be liable\n           to a penalty equal to the total amount of\n           the tax evaded, or not collected, or not\n           accounted for and paid over.\n\n           Liability under § 6672 falls upon those persons who\n\nsatisfy both prongs of a two-part inquiry.              First, the person\n\nmust be “responsible” for collecting, accounting for, and paying\n\nover the taxes; second, if, and only if, the person is deemed\n\nresponsible, he is liable if he acted “willfully” within the\n\nmeaning of this section.        See, e.g., Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 170;\n\nCaterino, 794 F.2d at 3; Harrington v. United States, 504 F.2d\n\n1306,   1312-13   (1st   Cir.    1974).      Because    we   already    have\n\ndetermined as a matter of law that Vinick acted willfully, see\n\nVinick I, 110 F.3d at 174, the only issue before us is whether\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthe record supports the district court's conclusion that Vinick\n\nwas in fact a responsible person.      We hold that it does not.\n\n                                  B.\n\n          We review the record in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment.    See United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741,\n\n744-45 (1st Cir. 1985) (noting that “we present the facts and\n\nthe   reasonable   inferences    therefrom    in    the    manner     most\n\nhospitable to the appellee, to the extent consistent with record\n\nsupport”).\n\n          Vinick, a certified public accountant, has been in\n\nprivate practice since 1962.      Prior to that time, he worked for\n\nthe IRS for eight years.        While in private practice, Vinick\n\nbecame acquainted with Richard M. Letterman, then a practicing\n\nattorney.1    In 1981, Letterman, Peter Mayer, and Vinick formed\n\nJefferson Bronze for the purpose of operating a foundry.            Norman\n\nLeach, who owned a foundry in Salem, Massachusetts, sold them\n\nthe necessary assets.    Letterman was Leach's attorney, Vinick\n\nwas his accountant, and Mayer was Letterman's brother-in-law.\n\n          Jefferson   Bronze    received   from    the   Small   Business\n\nAdministration (“SBA”) a loan to acquire the assets from Leach.\n\n\n\n      1\n     In 1992, Letterman pled guilty to four counts of larceny\nand one count of embezzlement by a fiduciary. He subsequently\nwas disbarred and received a two-year prison sentence.     The\ncharges were unrelated to his involvement in Jefferson Bronze.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fLetterman,     Mayer,   and    Vinick,   who      each   owned   one-third    of\n\nJefferson Bronze's stock, personally guaranteed the SBA loan and\n\npledged   their   homes       as   collateral.       Letterman    became     the\n\npresident and clerk.           Vinick was the treasurer.            Mayer was\n\nneither an officer nor a director, but he was the day-to-day\n\nmanager of the foundry.\n\n          Throughout      the      history   of   his    involvement   in    the\n\ncorporation, Vinick never gave up his accounting practice and\n\nnever had an office at Jefferson Bronze.             Although Letterman and\n\nhe both were signatories on the company's checking accounts,\n\nVinick never signed checks prior to the company's filing of its\n\nChapter   11    petition.          Vinick,   however,      did   prepare     the\n\ncorporation's quarterly employment tax returns.\n\n          Soon after its formation, Jefferson Bronze began what\n\nwould become a long period of financial difficulties.               Early on,\n\nin 1983, Letterman fired Mayer, and he and Vinick then acquired\n\nMayer's share of the corporation, obtained his release from\n\nliability on the SBA loan, and each became a half owner of\n\nJefferson Bronze.       Subsequently, Vinick asked Ronald Ouellette,\n\nwho had worked in the foundry under Leach, to take over as the\n\nnew manager.\n\n          Ouellette ran the office and the foundry, and his wife\n\nDiane Ouellette worked part time as the bookkeeper in the office\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fand signed the company checks and payroll returns.                          Vinick\n\noccasionally        would    visit     the    Ouellette    home      to     collect\n\ninformation needed to complete the quarterly returns.                         After\n\ntheir preparation, Vinick would return the completed, unsigned\n\nforms to the Ouellette home.            Usually once a month, Vinick would\n\ndiscuss      with   Ron    Ouellette    the   financial    condition        of   the\n\ncorporation and would stress to him the need to pay the taxes.\n\n             During       Ouellette's    tenure    as     manager,        Jefferson\n\nBronze's financial troubles continued.              Often, the corporation\n\nfailed timely to pay the withholding taxes due.               Regardless, the\n\ncorporation always filed its tax returns on time.                          At some\n\npoint, Letterman and Vinick obtained from Leach a $35,000 loan,\n\nwhich they secured with personal guarantees.                 In 1985, Vinick\n\nnegotiated with an IRS revenue officer a payment plan for the\n\ntaxes Jefferson Bronze owed.             Vinick relayed to Ouellette the\n\nterms   of    the   plan,    and   Ouellette    complied     with    the     plan's\n\nrequirements.       After Jefferson Bronze completed payment of these\n\ntaxes, it experienced no further tax delinquency until Letterman\n\ntook over as manager.\n\n             In January 1988, Letterman decided on his own to take\n\nover as the day-to-day financial manager of the corporation.\n\nLetterman moved his law practice to Jefferson Bronze's office\n\nand relieved Ouellette of his financial responsibilities, but\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fretained him as the foundry manager.              Letterman's wife, Ellen\n\nLetterman, took over as office manager and bookkeeper.                    Vinick\n\ncontinued to collect the financial information, to prepare the\n\ntax returns, and to leave them for Letterman to sign.                    While he\n\nalso continued to advise Letterman to pay the corporation's\n\ntaxes, the record is undisputed that Vinick became less involved\n\nin the financial affairs of the corporation as Letterman's role\n\nincreased.\n\n            In May 1988, Jefferson Bronze refinanced its SBA loan\n\nwith a $300,000 loan from National Grand Bank.                 Letterman and\n\nVinick met with the bank's vice president, Eliot Rothwell, who\n\nnegotiated    the    loan.       The    bank's    practice     required         all\n\nprincipals    of    any    closely     held   corporation    to     be   account\n\nsignatories, and it made no exception for Jefferson Bronze.\n\nLetterman and Vinick each signed the note evidencing the loan\n\ntwice, once in an individual capacity and once in a corporate\n\ncapacity.     Each    further     personally     guaranteed       the    loan    by\n\npledging    his    house   as   collateral.      Around     March    1989,      the\n\ncorporation became delinquent on its loan from National Grand\n\nBank, and Letterman and Vinick met with Rothwell to discuss the\n\nfinancial future of Jefferson Bronze.\n\n            By July of 1990, the company's continuing financial\n\ndifficulties forced it to file for bankruptcy protection under\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fChapter 11.       After doing so, it opened two new bank accounts at\n\nHeritage Cooperative Bank (“Heritage”): a debtor in possession\n\naccount    and    a   tax    account.          Both   accounts      required    two\n\nsignatures,      Letterman's      and    Vinick's,     on   every    check,    even\n\nthough Letterman retained possession of the checkbooks.                   For the\n\nfirst time in Jefferson Bronze's existence, Vinick's signature\n\nappeared on Jefferson Bronze checks.\n\n           In 1990, during the bankruptcy period, Vinick signed\n\nevery check on the Heritage accounts, but it is unclear when he\n\nsigned    them.       On    several     occasions,    Juli   Young,     the    bank\n\nemployee who filed all paid checks, called Vinick down to the\n\nbank.     Upon arrival, she presented to him for his signature\n\nchecks    that     the     bank   already       had   negotiated      with     only\n\nLetterman's signature.2           On July 26, 1991, National Grand Bank\n\nforeclosed on its loan.               Later that year, Jefferson Bronze\n\nfinally closed its doors.\n\n\n\n\n    2These checks were the subject of much dispute during the\ntrial because testimony about whether Vinick signed the checks\nbefore or after the bank negotiated them was conflicting.\nVinick testified that he signed all checks after the bank had\nnegotiated them, but bank employees recalled that the bank had\nnegotiated some of the checks with Vinick's signature already\naffixed. The district court did not resolve this dispute; the\njudge merely stated that Vinick had signed some before and some\nafter negotiation, and further found the fact of Vinick's\nsigning, regardless of when, to be indicative of his authority\nand responsibility within the meaning of § 6672.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f            Meantime,     from    April     1989   to    June   1990,   during\n\nLetterman's tenure as manager and prior to Vinick's ever having\n\nsigned a company check, Jefferson Bronze again fell behind in\n\nits withholding tax obligations.            On December 17, 1990, the IRS\n\nassessed against Vinick a penalty pursuant to § 6672 for the\n\ntotal amount owed, $49,129.               The assessment alleged failed\n\nwithholding payments for the last three quarters of 1989 and the\n\nfirst two quarters of 1990.          On December 24, 1990, the IRS made\n\na like assessment against Letterman.\n\n            Vinick paid $3,731 and filed a claim for a refund.              The\n\nIRS denied that claim, and Vinick commenced this suit.                      The\n\ngovernment counterclaimed for the balance due and moved for\n\nsummary judgment against both men.           The district court concluded\n\nthat   as   a   matter    of   law   Letterman     and    Vinick    both   were\n\nresponsible persons who acted willfully under § 6672.                The court\n\nthus   granted   the     government's     motion   for    summary   judgment.\n\nVinick alone appealed.         In Vinick I, we found a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether Vinick was a responsible person and\n\nremanded for a bench trial on the issue that is the subject of\n\nthis appeal.\n\n            During a two-day bench trial to determine whether\n\nVinick was a responsible person, the court heard testimony from\n\nseveral witnesses about the company's organizational structure\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fand about the financial operations at Jefferson Bronze.                        That\n\ntestimony covered the formation of the corporation, the various\n\nmanagement changes, the operation of the company under each\n\nmanager, its financial difficulties, and its bankruptcy.                        The\n\ncourt received into evidence over Vinick's objection over 200\n\ncanceled checks from the two Heritage accounts, which Jefferson\n\nBronze had opened after the relevant quarters.\n\n            After the second day of testimony, the court issued a\n\nbench opinion, finding by a preponderance of the evidence3 that\n\nVinick was a responsible person within the meaning of § 6672.\n\nThe   court    found     that   he   was   the    treasurer,       prepared     the\n\nquarterly tax returns, negotiated with the IRS on behalf of the\n\ncorporation,        pledged     personal     assets,     had       authority       to\n\nparticipate in employment decisions, and possessed throughout\n\nthe corporation's existence check-signing authority.                      The court\n\nalso found that he actually exercised this authority only while\n\nthe corporation was in bankruptcy.               The court weighed each of\n\nthese     factors   to   varying     degrees     in   favor   of    his    being    a\n\n\n\n      3\n     The district court noted upon rendering its findings and\njudgment that because the standard of proof is by a\npreponderance of the evidence, it is immaterial which side has\nthe burden of proof.   We have held that “[a]lthough the rule\nappears harsh, as in other tax litigation a person who\nchallenges a section 6672 assessment bears the burden of\npersuasion to prove lack of control.” Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fresponsible person.     The court did find him to be uninvolved in\n\nthe day-to-day management of the corporation and weighed this\n\nfactor against his being a responsible person, noting, however,\n\nthat its weight was minimal.          Vinick now appeals.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          In reviewing factual findings, this court applies the\n\nclear-error standard of review.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\nUnder this standard, we accept the district court's findings of\n\nfact unless we are “'left with the definite and firm conviction\n\nthat a mistake has been committed.'”              Anderson v. City of\n\nBessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985) (quoting United States\n\nv. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)); see also\n\nBrown Daltas & Assoc., Inc. v. General Accident Ins. Co., 48\n\nF.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 1995).          Moreover, we usually defer to a\n\ntrial court's resolution of mixed questions of law and fact.\n\nSee,   e.g.,   United   States   v.    Howard   (In   re   Extradition   of\n\nHoward), 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993) (“The standard of\n\nreview applicable to mixed questions usually depends upon where\n\nthey fall along the degree-of-deference continuum: the more\n\nfact-dominated the question, the more likely it is that the\n\ntrier's resolution of it will be accepted unless shown to be\n\nclearly erroneous.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f              But, the case for deference vanishes when a court's\n\nultimate conclusion is infected by legal error.                     See Inwood\n\nLabs. v. Ives Labs., 456 U.S. 844, 855 n.15 (1982) (“Of course,\n\nif the trial court bases its findings upon a mistaken impression\n\nof applicable legal principles, the reviewing court is not bound\n\nby the clearly erroneous standard.”); Brown Daltas, 48 F.3d at\n\n36 (same); Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d\n\n148, 153 (1st Cir. 1990) (“It is settled that one way around the\n\nrigors of the 'clearly erroneous' rule is to show that the trial\n\ncourt mistook the applicable law.”).               As a result, when a trial\n\ncourt “premise[s] its ultimate finding . . . on an erroneous\n\ninterpretation of the standard to be applied,” we do not use\n\nclear-error review.          United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362\n\nU.S.   29,    44   (1960).     Instead,      we    treat   the   trial   court's\n\nconclusion as a question of law.             See United States v. Singer\n\nMfg.   Co.,    374   U.S.    174,   194   n.9     (1963)   (“Insofar     as   that\n\nconclusion derived from the court's application of an improper\n\nstandard to the facts, it may be corrected as a matter of\n\nlaw.”); Parke, Davis, 362 U.S. at 44 (noting that in these\n\ncircumstances, the appeals court is “reviewing a question of\n\nlaw, namely, whether the District Court applied the proper\n\nstandard      to   essentially      undisputed      facts”);     Bergersen      v.\n\nCommissioner, 109 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that with\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fmixed    questions       of   law   and        fact   “once     the   raw   facts    are\n\ndetermined (and such determinations are normally reviewed only\n\nfor clear error), deciding which legal label to apply to those\n\nfacts    is   a    normative      decision--strictly            speaking,     a   legal\n\nissue”).\n\n              Because the trial court made its findings of fact based\n\non a misunderstanding of the legal standard for what constitutes\n\na responsible person under § 6672 in that it considered Vinick's\n\nconduct over the entire period he was involved with Jefferson\n\nBronze    rather     than     his    activities        during     the    quarters     in\n\nquestion,      see   infra     Part       III.B,      we   do   not   defer    to    its\n\nconclusion        that   Vinick     was    a    responsible      party      within   the\n\nmeaning of the statute.4\n\n                                          III.\n\n                                           A.\n\n              A responsible person5 under § 6672 is anyone within a\n\ncompany who has a duty to collect, account for, or pay the\n\n\n    4 The dissent argues that we have altered the standard of\nreview applicable to § 6672 cases as set forth in Caterino. We\nhave not. We agree that this court ordinarily should review the\ntrial court's responsible person determination for clear error;\nhowever, when the fact-finder misunderstands the applicable\nlegal standards, the case for deference disappears.\n    5This term does not appear in the statute itself, but courts\nlong have referred to the persons subject to liability under\n§ 6672 as “responsible persons.” See, e.g., Slodov v. United\nStates, 436 U.S. 238, 245 n.7 (1978).\n\n                                          -14-\n\fwithheld taxes.6   See Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172.   In determining\n\nwho falls within the category of responsible person, the courts\n\nhave identified seven typically used, but nonexclusive, indicia.\n\nThe inquiry focuses on whether the individual\n\n         (1) is an officer or member of the board of\n         directors, (2) owns shares or possesses an\n         entrepreneurial stake in the company, (3) is\n         active in the management of day-to-day\n         affairs of the company, (4) has the ability\n         to hire and fire employees, (5) makes\n         decisions regarding which, when and in what\n         order outstanding debts or taxes will be\n         paid, (6) exercises control over daily bank\n         accounts and disbursement records, and (7)\n         has check-signing authority.\n\nFiataruolo v. United States, 8 F.3d 930, 939 (2d Cir. 1993);\n\naccord Barnett v. IRS, 988 F.2d 1449, 1455 (5th Cir. 1993);\n\nDenbo v. United States, 988 F.2d 1029, 1032 (10th Cir. 1993);\n\nBrounstein v.   United States, 979 F.2d 952, 954-55 (3d Cir.\n\n1992); Thomsen v.    United States, 887 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1989); Gephart v. United States, 818 F.2d 469, 473 (6th Cir.\n\n1987).   No single factor is determinative of responsibility.\n\nSee Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1455.   The deciding court must look at\n\n\n    6While the Code defines a responsible person as one who is\n“required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any\ntax,” 26 U.S.C. § 6672(a) (1994), the Supreme Court has\ninterpreted the statute to apply to any person who has a duty to\ndo any one of those things, see Slodov, 436 U.S. at 250\n(concluding that Congress meant this phrase “to limit § 6672 to\npersons responsible for collection of third-party taxes and not\nto limit it to those persons in a position to perform all three\nof the enumerated duties”).\n\n                               -15-\n\fthe   “totality   of   the    circumstances”   when   making   the\n\ndetermination of responsibility.       Fiataruolo, 8 F.3d at 939\n\n(“The question of control over the employer's finances must be\n\nanswered in light of the totality of the circumstances; no one\n\nfactor is determinative.”).\n\n         Because the goal of the statute is to hold liable for\n\nthe nonpayment of withholding taxes the party responsible for\n\nsuch payment, the “crucial inquiry is whether the person had the\n\n'effective power' to pay the taxes--that is, whether he had the\n\nactual authority or ability, in view of his status within the\n\ncorporation, to pay the taxes owed.”    Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1454;\n\nsee also Raba v. United States, 977 F.2d 941, 943 (5th Cir.\n\n1992) (“The crucial examination is whether a person had the\n\neffective power to pay taxes.” (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted)).    While these factors largely are self-\n\nexplanatory, it is important to elaborate upon them to resolve\n\nwhether Vinick was a responsible person in light of the facts as\n\nfound.   The factors easily divide into the following three\n\ngroups: (1) those that identify the taxpayer's status within the\n\ncorporation, (2) those that identify his involvement in the\n\ndaily affairs of the corporation, and (3) those that identify\n\nhis involvement in the financial affairs of the corporation.    We\n\nturn now to each of these groups.\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f                                      1.\n\n            The first two factors contemplate the taxpayer's status\n\nwithin the corporate structure.            As an initial matter, we note\n\nthat titular authority is insufficient to create liability.                 See\n\nCaterino, 794 F.2d at 5 (noting that courts “have fashioned an\n\nelastic definition predicated upon the function of an individual\n\nin the employer's business, not the level of the office held”);\n\nsee also Fiataruolo, 8 F.3d at 939 (“[T]he significant control\n\ntest is not meant to ensnare those who have merely technical\n\nauthority or titular designation.”). Moreover, “[t]he requisite\n\nexercised authority or duty is particularly lacking in a case\n\n. . . where the taxpayer assumes a title merely for the purpose\n\nof protecting his investment.”             O'Connor v. United States, 956\n\nF.2d 48, 51-52 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\n            Like corporate title, share ownership is a factor, but\n\nnot all shareholders are responsible persons.                    See id. (“To\n\nignore [the separation of ownership and authority] would be to\n\nenvelop within 'responsible person' all significant investors\n\nwith titles in corporations which fail to pay their withholding\n\ntaxes.”).     Furthermore, share ownership is not a predicate to\n\nfinding responsibility.         See Donelan Phelps & Co. v. United\n\nStates, 876 F.2d 1373, 1376 (8th Cir. 1989) (noting that a\n\nresponsible    person   “need   not    be    an   officer   or   director    or\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fshareholder or employee or disbursing officer or payroll clerk\n\nof   the   trustee    of     the   funds     deducted   from   the   employees'\n\nwages”).\n\n                                        2.\n\n            The     next     two    factors     focus   on     the   taxpayer's\n\ninvolvement in the operation of the corporation.                     The first\n\nfactor is whether the taxpayer is active in the day-to-day\n\naffairs of the company.            Day-to-day management in a corporation\n\ninvolves more than simply having some tangential involvement in\n\nthe corporation's business.            See Godfrey v. United States, 748\n\nF.2d 1568, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1984).              The Godfrey court described\n\nwhat day-to-day management means:\n\n            [The taxpayer] actively conducted the day-\n            to-day operations of the business: he came\n            to the office daily, hired and laid off\n            employees, ordered materials and supplies,\n            conducted business correspondence, set the\n            price of jobs, negotiated all contracts with\n            customers,   prepared  invoices,   disbursed\n            corporate checks signed by him and the\n            secretary-treasurer in payment of supplier's\n            [sic] bills and other business expenses, and\n            deposited the business receipts in the\n            corporation's bank account. His address was\n            used for receiving most business mail; his\n            signature was required on all corporate\n            checks.\n\nId. (describing activities of the taxpayer in White v. United\n\nStates, 372 F.2d 513 (Ct. Cl. 1967)).                    Given the depth of\n\ninvolvement       required    for    day-to-day     management,      occasional\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\finvolvement   in   business    affairs      is   insufficient      to   create\n\nliability.    See id. at 1575-76.\n\n          The next factor is whether the taxpayer has the ability\n\nto hire and fire the employees.         In essence, this factor assists\n\nin determining the taxpayer's level of involvement in the daily\n\noperations of the company.          Cf. Thibodeau v. United States, 828\n\nF.2d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir. 1987) (“The government claims that,\n\nas president, the taxpayer was responsible for running the\n\ncorporation on a daily basis, including the hiring and firing of\n\nall employees.”); White, 372 F.2d at 515 (listing with his other\n\ndaily   operational   duties    the     taxpayer's     responsibility      for\n\nhiring and firing all employees).           The theory is that a person\n\nwith authority to hire and fire the employees likely is involved\n\nsubstantially in the day-to-day management of the company.\n\n                                      3.\n\n          The final three factors assess involvement in the\n\nfinancial operations of the corporation.              This inquiry is the\n\nheart of the matter because it identifies most readily the\n\nperson who could have paid the taxes, but chose not to do so.\n\nSee Morgan v. United States, 937 F.2d 281, 284 (5th Cir. 1991)\n\n(“The   central    question    is    whether     an   individual    had    the\n\neffective power to pay taxes.”); Hochstein v. United States, 900\n\nF.2d 543, 547 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The central question, however, is\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fwhether    the     individual      has    significant      control      over   the\n\nenterprise's finances.”).            Of the three factors within this\n\ncentral question, the first, whether the taxpayer has decision-\n\nmaking authority, is the most important because the goal of\n\n§ 6672 is to fix liability on those persons who could have and\n\nshould have remitted taxes to the IRS.                 See Caterino, 794 F.2d\n\nat 5 (noting that the inquiry for responsibility is “whether the\n\nperson had the power to determine whether the taxes should be\n\nremitted or paid or had the final word as to what bills should\n\nor should not be paid and when” (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted)); see also Greenberg v. United States, 46 F.3d\n\n239, 243 (3d Cir. 1994) (finding responsible a taxpayer who\n\n“wrote    checks       to   pay   other    creditors     while   knowing       that\n\nwithholding      tax    liabilities       to    the   United   States   remained\n\nunpaid”); Denbo, 988 F.2d at 1032 (“[A] corporate officer or\n\nemployee is responsible if he or she has significant, though not\n\nnecessarily exclusive, authority in the general management and\n\nfiscal decisionmaking of the corporation.” (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted)); Gephart, 818 F.2d at 473 (noting\n\nthat the test focuses “upon the degree of influence and control\n\nwhich the person exercised over the financial affairs of the\n\ncorporation and, specifically, disbursements of funds and the\n\npriority of payments to creditors”); Commonwealth Nat'l Bank v.\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fUnited States, 665 F.2d 743, 757 (5th Cir. 1982) (“A responsible\n\nperson is one who has a final or significant--even if not\n\nexclusive--word          as    to       which   bills     or    creditors       should    be\n\npaid.”); White, 372 F.2d at 517 (noting that a responsible\n\nperson usually is one “with ultimate authority over expenditures\n\nof   funds       since   such       a    person     can    fairly    be    said    to     be\n\nresponsible        for   the    corporation's           failure     to    pay    over    its\n\ntaxes”;      one    with      “authority        to      direct     [the]    payment       of\n\ncreditors”).\n\n             The second of these factors, whether the taxpayer\n\nexercised control over the daily bank accounts, is significant\n\nbecause     it     distinguishes          between    the       officers    with   general\n\ncontrol and those with financial control.                          See Hochstein, 900\n\nF.2d   at    547    (“[T]he      district         court    incorrectly      focused       on\n\n[taxpayer's] control over [the company's] operations generally,\n\nrather than his control over the finances of the corporation.”).\n\nFinancial involvement indicates that the taxpayer not only was\n\ninvolved in the daily management of the company, but also knew\n\nthe financial circumstances and could have paid the government.\n\n\n\n             The final factor is whether the taxpayer had check-\n\nsigning authority.            Again, this factor is significant because it\n\nhelps determine whether the taxpayer actually could have paid\n\n\n                                            -21-\n\fthe IRS the due taxes.             Importantly, “[c]ase law discloses that\n\nauthority to sign checks, without more, is a weak pillar on\n\nwhich   to    rest       a    liability    determination    that    a   person    is\n\nproperly subject to a 100 percent penalty under section 6672.”\n\nBarrett v. United States, 580 F.2d 449, 453 (Ct. Cl. 1978).                      The\n\ncheck-signing inquiry goes beyond the simple question whether\n\nthe taxpayer was a signatory; rather, the court must look at the\n\ncheck-signing authority in the context of financial control.\n\nSee United States v. Carrigan, 31 F.3d 130, 134 (3d Cir. 1994)\n\n(noting      that    a       president's    having   and   even    exercising     on\n\noccasion signatory authority, without more involvement in the\n\ncompany's financial affairs, does not as a matter of law make\n\nhim a responsible person).             Possession of the authority without\n\nits exercise is not enough.                See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51 (“The\n\nsubstance of the circumstances must be such that the officer\n\nexercises and uses his authority over financial affairs or\n\ngeneral management, or is under a duty to do so, before that\n\nofficer can be deemed to be a responsible person.”); Morgan, 937\n\nF.2d at 284-85 (“Mere access to corporate funds, however, does\n\nnot make one a responsible person.”); Pototzky v. United States,\n\n8 Cl. Ct. 308, 316 (1985) (holding that a corporate officer who\n\nno longer exercised his authority as a signatory even though he\n\n\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\f“technically had the authority to sign” was not a responsible\n\nperson).\n\n           Having established the background and having explained\n\nthe operation of the indicia of responsibility, we turn to\n\ndiscuss this particular case.\n\n                                      B.\n\n           As previously mentioned, our task is not to determine\n\nwhether the district court's factual findings were correct given\n\nthe weight of the evidence on each factual dispute involved.\n\nRather,    the   issue     is   whether    Vinick's      level    of   corporate\n\ninvolvement suffices to render him a responsible person under\n\n§ 6672.    Therefore, our task is to decide whether the district\n\ncourt understood the legal standard for what is required to be\n\na responsible person and correctly applied this legal standard\n\nto its findings when making its ultimate conclusion.                   We hold it\n\ndid not and that it should have entered judgment for Vinick.\n\nSee Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 647\n\n(2d Cir. 1998) (remanding with instructions to enter judgment\n\nfor the appellee when there was insufficient evidence to support\n\nthe district court's judgment and no further proceedings were\n\nrequired).\n\n           As     we   have     discussed,       the    central   question      in\n\ndetermining      whether   a    taxpayer    is    a    responsible     person   is\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fwhether he had the power to pay the taxes during the quarters in\n\nquestion.       See Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1454.                  In Vinick I, we\n\nlimited     the     inquiry    of    responsibility        to     “the   relevant\n\nquarters.”7       Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172 (focusing attention on the\n\nrelevant quarters and noting that while Vinick participated in\n\nsome business activities, “neither of those incidents occurred\n\nduring    the     quarters    in   question”).        At   oral   argument,     the\n\ngovernment contended that evidence of activities outside the\n\nquarters in question bears on whether Vinick had authority\n\nduring the quarters in question.             We disagree.         Responsibility\n\nduring one period does not equate to responsibility in all\n\nperiods.        See   Caterino,     794   F.2d   at    4   (finding      that   the\n\ntaxpayer's “involvement with [the company] was insufficient to\n\nmake him 'responsible' for 1973 under section 6672, but was\n\nsufficient to make him 'responsible' for the first two quarters\n\n\n\n    7A review of the district court's Findings and Conclusions\nis troubling because of its reliance on Vinick's activities\noutside the quarters in question. Indeed, it leaves us with the\nimpression that the court relied almost entirely on Vinick's\nactivities before and after the relevant quarters.     Twice in\nVinick I we emphasized that an inquiry into liability under\n§ 6672 should focus on the taxpayer's activities during the\nquarters in question, see Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172 (dismissing\nfindings that Vinick engaged in managerial activities because\nthey did not occur during the quarters in question), and we\nreiterate that principle here.     When determining whether a\ntaxpayer is a responsible person under § 6672, the court should\nfocus its inquiry on the quarters during which the taxes were\nunpaid.\n\n                                      -24-\n\fof 1974\").          As we review the record, we can identify several\n\ndistinct eras of corporate governance.                     The first followed\n\nLetterman's, Mayer's, and Vinick's initial purchase of Jefferson\n\nBronze, during which time, 1981 to 1983, Mayer was the day-to-\n\nday manager.     The second came with Ouellette's tenure as day-to-\n\nday manager, which was from 1983 to 1987.                    The third, which\n\nincludes the quarters in question, began with Letterman's taking\n\nover the daily operations in 1987 and ended when the company\n\nfiled for bankruptcy in July 1990.               The final period began with\n\nthe filing of bankruptcy, during which time the company had\n\nopened the Heritage accounts, and ended with the company's\n\nfailure    in   1991.   The   latter       two    phases    were   particularly\n\nsignificant.      Letterman's management of the business was more\n\nconcentrated in his hands than it had been in those of his\n\npredecessors.       Moreover,       when    Jefferson       Bronze   filed   for\n\nbankruptcy, not only was Letterman's control a factor, but also\n\nthe bankruptcy court's oversight into the company's affairs\n\nwould bear upon the degree of control that either Letterman or\n\nVinick could have had.          Because of the differences in the\n\ngovernance of Jefferson Bronze, it is erroneous to conflate\n\nresponsibility     during     one    era    with     responsibility     during\n\nanother.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\f           All        the    factors   involved       in   making     the    legal\n\ndetermination of responsibility are designed to focus attention\n\non the central question of power.                     At no time did Vinick\n\nexercise any decision-making authority over which creditors\n\nJefferson Bronze paid.              Moreover, the government's evidence\n\nindicates that during the quarters in question, Letterman was in\n\ncharge of the day-to-day operations.             While it is true that more\n\nthan one person can be responsible, see Harrington, 504 F.2d at\n\n1312 (noting that we hold responsible “all with responsibility\n\nand authority to avoid the default which constitutes a violation\n\nof   the   statute”),         the   government    introduced        no   evidence\n\nindicating that during the relevant quarters, Vinick had any\n\ninvolvement      in    the    day-to-day    operations.        Unless       titular\n\nauthority, being a shareholder, and having unexercised check-\n\nsigning authority suffice to render a taxpayer responsible, no\n\nevidence supports holding Vinick as such.\n\n           It is with these observations that we discuss the\n\ndistrict      court's          legal    conclusions           about      Vinick's\n\nresponsibility.\n\n           Initially,         the   court     found    that   Vinick     was    the\n\ncorporation's treasurer.            In commenting that the fact of title\n\nis determinative, the court concluded that position alone favors\n\nfinding Vinick to be a responsible person.                 Here, the district\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fcourt contravened the message of Vinick I, in which we said that\n\nwe “predicate our definition of who is a responsible person on\n\nthe function of the employee in the business, and not the level\n\nof the office held.”        Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172; see also\n\nCaterino, 794 F.2d at 5 (noting that courts consider a person's\n\nactual office function rather than his title); White, 372 F.2d\n\nat 516 (“[T]he courts tend to disregard the mechanical functions\n\nof the various corporate officers and instead emphasize where\n\nthe ultimate authority for the decision not to pay the tax\n\nlies.”).   The court then compounded its error by determining\n\nthat being treasurer “gives him authority to do many things that\n\nhe does not necessarily have the responsibility to do.”          Instead\n\nof   focusing   on   his   unexercised   authority   and   his   titular\n\ndesignation, the court should have looked at the substance of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fVinick's      work   as   treasurer8       to   determine    what   bearing     on\n\nresponsibility this titular authority should have.\n\n              The government contended at oral argument that simply\n\nbeing    an    inside     director    is    sufficient      to   make   a   person\n\nresponsible because directors owe the company a fiduciary duty\n\nto see to it that the taxes are paid.              This position is contrary\n\nto the caselaw.         See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51-52; Godfrey, 748\n\nF.2d at 1576.        In O'Connor, the taxpayer was a fifty-percent\n\nshareholder, the vice-president, and a director of a closely\n\nheld corporation, but did not exercise any authority.                          See\n\nO'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51.            The court held that, even though he\n\n\n     8Vinick's acting “as treasurer” is important because he was\nand is a Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”).       The district\ncourt determined that his activities over the years of the\ncompany's existence in preparing the taxes, meeting with the IRS\nto negotiate the settlement in the early years, preparing the\nquarterly employment tax returns, and recommending that the\nwithholding taxes be paid were activities within his capacity as\ntreasurer. These activities are also those that a professional\nCPA would undertake to service his client.         Indeed, Ellen\nLetterman, in her testimony, discussed her relationship with\nVinick: “Well, he was the CPA and I would give him all the money\ninformation he needed.”\n     The government has suggested that Vinick's telling Letterman\nand the other managers to pay the taxes demonstrates his\nresponsibility. Giving this advice is, after all, typically a\npart of the CPA's or attorney's function.        But this advice\ncoupled with an investment interest and a corporate title is\ninsufficient to render that professional a responsible person\nbecause it does not demonstrate an ability to decide which\ncreditors are paid. If anything, the rendering of advice would\nsupport a determination of willfulness, but that inquiry begins\nonly after the determination of responsibility is made.       See\nVinick I, 110 F.3d at 170.\n\n                                       -28-\n\fwas a director, “O'Connor was a 'silent' investor who did not\n\nexercise authority and was under no duty to do so.”                           Id.\n\nSimilarly, in Godfrey, the taxpayer was the chairman of the\n\nboard, had taken the lead in attempting to avoid insolvency, had\n\nnegotiated for loans, had sold corporate assets, and otherwise\n\nhad participated in the daily operations of the business.                     See\n\nGodfrey,   748     F.2d   at   1576.     In   deeming      these    activities\n\ninsufficient to render him a responsible person, the Federal\n\nCircuit noted that “[t]o hold Godfrey a 'responsible person' on\n\nthe present record would be to hold as a 'responsible person'\n\nevery board chairman who took an active interest in the solvency\n\nof the corporation he serves.”          Id.\n\n           The district court also determined that Vinick's having\n\ncheck-signing authority weighed heavily in favor of finding\n\nresponsibility.      The court's affording such weight to the check-\n\nsigning factor without regard to whether check-signing authority\n\nwas   indicative    of    financial    control   is   contrary      to   §   6672\n\nprecedent.   Cf. Denbo, 988 F.2d at 1032 (finding a taxpayer with\n\ncheck-signing      authority    responsible      because    of     his   regular\n\ninvolvement in the financial management of the corporation).                   In\n\nother words, whether the taxpayer had check-signing authority is\n\nrelevant, but only insofar as it demonstrates financial control.\n\nThe central inquiry is whether Vinick could have paid the taxes.\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fSee Morgan, 937 F.2d at 284; White, 372 F.2d at 517.                      While it\n\nis true that he had check-signing authority during the quarters\n\nin question, he at no time had access to the checkbook during\n\nthat period, see Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172, and thus he was not\n\nin a position to exercise his authority, which is determinative.\n\nSee Carrigan, 31 F.3d at 134 (noting that the taxpayer's check-\n\nsigning   authority      did   not   render      him    a    responsible      person\n\nbecause “the corporate books, records and checkbooks were locked\n\nin an office, and [the taxpayer] did not have his own key”);\n\nDudley v. United States, 428 F.2d 1196, 1202 (9th Cir. 1970)\n\n(noting that the taxpayer “did not have control over the payment\n\nof    checks,”   which    indicated        his   lack   of    control    over    the\n\nfinances of the corporation).\n\n            The court ignored Vinick I's instructions to focus on\n\nthe   quarters    in    question     and    admitted        much   evidence    about\n\nVinick's signing of checks post Chapter 11, weighing that fact\n\nheavily in favor of finding responsibility.                   This evidence does\n\nnot bear on the inquiry into responsibility during the relevant\n\nquarters.     See Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172-73.                    Even if it were\n\nappropriate      to    consider    evidence      from   later       quarters,    the\n\nintervention of the Chapter 11 proceeding significantly changed\n\nthis equation.         Vinick's role, limited before the bankruptcy,\n\nwas only slightly more active after it.                        The fact of the\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fbankruptcy      renders   meaningless      any    comparison       of   these   two\n\nperiods.      To    the   extent    the   district    court    considered       the\n\nevidence   of      Vinick's   signing     checks    after    the    quarters     in\n\nquestion, it erred.\n\n           Assuming arguendo that Vinick's signing the Heritage\n\nchecks had some relevance, being a countersignatory does not\n\nsuffice to make him a responsible person.                   See Lee v. United\n\nStates, 89-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9393, at 89,018 (D. Haw. Apr.\n\n26,   1989)   (noting     that     even   though    the   taxpayer      “had    the\n\nauthority to countersign checks . . ., she did not have any\n\nauthority to decide which creditors were to be paid” and thus\n\nwas not a responsible person); Montana v. United States, 76-1\n\nU.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9145, at 83,159 (D. Neb. Nov. 18, 1975)\n\n(noting    that      in   cases    finding       countersignatories        to    be\n\nresponsible persons, “the taxpayer's power to sign checks was\n\nmerely a manifestation of his control over the management and\n\ndisbursement of corporate funds”); Last v. United States, 65-1\n\nU.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9244, at 94,926 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 1965)\n\n(finding the taxpayers not to be responsible persons even though\n\nthey “continue[d] to countersign checks” during the period in\n\nquestion).\n\n           The court found that Vinick's previous negotiation with\n\nthe IRS and interaction with financial institutions weighed in\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\ffavor of responsibility.            Again, the district court should not\n\nhave relied on this evidence because Vinick did not engage in\n\nthese activities during the quarters in question.                See Vinick I,\n\n110 F.3d at 172.         And even in the case of the IRS settlement, it\n\nwas the manager, not Vinick, who saw to the fulfillment of its\n\nterms.       As the government noted in its brief, “[a]fter these\n\ntaxes       were   paid,    there   was     no   further   delinquency   during\n\nOuellette's tenure.”             It is at this point that Letterman took\n\nover       management,     and   Vinick's    role,   already   slight,   became\n\nminimal.9\n\n              The district court weighed in favor of responsibility\n\nVinick's investment in the corporation.10              This finding does not\n\nfit within the typical litany of § 6672 factors, see Thomsen,\n\n887 F.2d at 16, and is not relevant.                 While making a personal\n\n       9\n      A person's decision to become involved in loans and\nrefinancing but not in the payment of taxes can demonstrate\nwillfulness, which is the second prong of the § 6672 inquiry,\nbut does not demonstrate responsibility. See Caterino, 794 F.2d\nat 6 (“Any responsible person who knows the taxes are not paid\nand allows the business to pay other creditors acts willfully.”\n(emphasis added)). For example, in Godfrey, the taxpayer took\nan active interest in the company's solvency, but not in the\npayment of taxes. The court correctly noted that his “knowledge\nof nonpayment may be relevant to the issue of willfulness, but\nit is irrelevant in considering the question of whether he was\na 'responsible person.'” Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576 (citation\nomitted).\n       10\n      The court stated that the form of the personal\ncontribution, that is, whether he pledged personal assets or\nmade a personal guarantee to secure financing for Jefferson\nBronze, was irrelevant. It was the mere fact of contribution\nthat the court weighed in the responsibility calculus.\n\n                                          -32-\n\finvestment shows a level of involvement in the corporation, it\n\ndoes not indicate financial control, and determining whether\n\nVinick has financial control is the aim of the § 6672 inquiry.\n\nBecause individual investors in corporations by definition use\n\ntheir personal assets to make their investment, the court's\n\nconclusion     would       render    any    investor    in    a    closely     held\n\ncorporation a responsible person.               Because this finding does not\n\nserve to limit the scope of who could be a responsible person,\n\nit has no bearing on the § 6672 inquiry.\n\n            The district court found that Vinick had authority to\n\nparticipate in the hiring and firing decisions at Jefferson\n\nBronze.     The court weighed this factor in favor of his being a\n\nresponsible       person    and   deemed    it    irrelevant      that   he   never\n\nactually exercised that authority.                  As discussed above, the\n\nproper inquiry focuses on whether Vinick was involved in the\n\ndaily management of the corporation, which routine hiring and\n\nfiring of employees would indicate.               The court did not find that\n\nVinick routinely made personnel decisions.                The only finding is\n\nthat   he   had    “authority       to   participate”    in    these     decisions\n\nregarding only the general manager.                Again, such authority is\n\ninsufficient to render him a responsible person, see Godfrey,\n\n748 F.2d at 1576 (noting that the taxpayer who “participated in\n\nthe hiring and firing of top corporate management” was not a\n\nresponsible       person),    because      it    does   not    demonstrate      any\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fsignificant control over the daily operations, especially the\n\nfinancial operations, of the corporation.\n\n           The final finding of the district court is that Vinick\n\nhad   little   involvement   in    the   daily   management   of    the\n\ncorporation.    The court then gave this determination minimal\n\nweight because it was “so far below the combined weight of the\n\n[other] factors.”   The court gave this finding short shrift in\n\ncontravention of accepted authority.      See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at\n\n51.    At the heart of the question whether a taxpayer is a\n\nresponsible person lies an analysis of his influence and control\n\nin the corporation and in its financial affairs.       See id.     That\n\nVinick did not have any involvement in the daily operation of\n\nthe corporation is much more significant than his title, for\n\nexample, because it demonstrates his inability to exercise any\n\ndegree of significant control over which creditors the company\n\nwould pay.\n\n           Taking all of these factors together, the findings of\n\nthe district court do not support the ultimate conclusion that\n\nVinick is a responsible person.11\n\n      11\n      The government notes that the Tenth Circuit's Denbo\ndecision has similar facts to those in this case. While it is\ntrue the Tenth Circuit found there was sufficient evidence to\nfind Denbo a responsible person, see Denbo, 988 F.2d at 1033,\nthe case is distinguishable.      Denbo was a fifty percent\nshareholder, was the secretary-treasurer, was a director, did\nnot manage the restaurant's daily operations, pledged personal\nassets for the corporation, arranged financing for the\ncorporation, and had check-signing authority, which he never\n\n                                  -34-\n\f         While Vinick may have been more than a mere passive\n\ninvestor in the corporation, this fact alone is insufficient to\n\nrender him a responsible person.     See Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576\n\n(“Godfrey's activities were not those of a passive 'above the\n\nfray' chairman, but they do not, without more, impose or create\n\nthe 'duty' expressly described in the statute.”).        Absent a\n\nfinding that Vinick possessed actual, exercised authority over\n\nthe company's financial matters, including the duty and power to\n\ndetermine which creditors to pay, as a matter of law he cannot\n\nbe a responsible person.\n\n                              IV.\n\n         For the reasons stated, we find that Vinick as a matter\n\nof law was not a responsible person within the meaning of 26\n\nU.S.C. § 6672(a).   We therefore reverse and remand the case to\n\n\n\n\nexercised.   See id. at 1032.    He also “held regular meetings\nwith [his co-owner] and the accountants.”     Id.  As the Tenth\nCircuit   noted,  “[Denbo's]   financial   involvement   in  the\ncorporation, along with his check-signing authority, gave him\nthe effective power to see to it that the taxes were paid.” Id.\nat 1033.\n     In contrast, Vinick's role in the financial activities of\nthe corporation was largely as its accountant, unlike Denbo who\nactively engaged in actual financial management of the\ncorporation. When Letterman became Jefferson Bronze's manager,\nVinick's role in the corporation substantially lessened.\nMoreover, to the extent Vinick, as Jefferson Bronze's\naccountant, was involved in the corporation's financial affairs,\nsuch involvement demonstrates only his willfulness because it\nshows he knew that on occasion the taxes had not been paid, but\ndoes not demonstrate his power to pay them, which a\ndetermination of responsibility requires.\n\n                              -35-\n\fthe district court with instructions to enter judgement in favor\n\nof Vinick.   Reversed and remanded.\n\n                                               Dissent follows.\n\n\n\n\n                              -36-\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting.       I dissent in this case,\n\ndespite great respect for my brethren, because I believe the\n\nmajority opinion is based upon significant errors of law.\n\nA. Inconsistency With Prior Decision\n\n             In Vinick v. Commissioner, 110 F.3d 168 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(\"Vinick I\"), this court twice stated that the facts presented\n\nin this case would permit a reasonable inference that Arnold W.\n\nVinick was a \"responsible person\" for purposes of 26 U.S.C.\n\n§   6672(a).      We   said   that   the    record    contained   sufficient\n\nevidence \"from which one could infer Vinick’s responsibility as\n\na matter of fact.\"        Id. at 173.       We also noted, with regard to\n\nevidence limited to the periods during which the taxes were not\n\npaid, \"[f]rom these indicia alone, one might infer that Vinick\n\nwas a responsible person.\"           Id. at 172.        Yet now, after the\n\ntrial judge has actually heard the same evidence, including\n\ntestimony from Vinick that was contradicted in material respects\n\nby every other witness, the majority concludes that the trial\n\njudge erred in determining that Vinick was a responsible person.\n\nThat alone is both passingly odd and at odds with the law of the\n\ncase doctrine.\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n             The majority empowers itself to reverse the district\n\ncourt   by     treating    the   question     of     whether   Vinick   is   a\n\n\"responsible person\" as a question of law.              But the standard of\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\freview utilized by this court in § 6672 cases is review for\n\nclear error.      The majority says it is entitled to decide the\n\nquestion de novo because the district court committed an error\n\nof law.    That error of law, according to the majority, is that\n\nthe district court \"considered Vinick's conduct over the entire\n\nperiod he was involved with Jefferson Bronze rather than his\n\nactivities during the quarters in question.\"                 There was no error\n\nof law, as it was well within the district court's discretion to\n\nadmit this evidence and determine what weight to give it.                 There\n\nis no reason to think the district court gave undue weight to\n\nthis evidence.      Also, Vinick may not be heard to complain on\n\nthese grounds as he introduced much of the evidence in question\n\nand did not object to the evidence the government introduced,\n\nand so has waived this argument.              Finally, there was no error,\n\nmuch     less   clear   error,   in     the       district    court's   factual\n\ndeterminations.\n\n            It is settled law in this circuit that a trier of\n\nfact's    determination    of    whether      a    taxpayer    had   sufficient\n\ncontrol over a corporation to be deemed a responsible person is\n\nsubject to clear error review.           In Caterino v. United States,\n\n794 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1986), we said,\n\n            This court cannot reverse merely because it\n            is convinced that it would have decided the\n            question differently; we must ascertain\n            whether the finding of fact is clearly\n            erroneous. We must affirm if the finding is\n            reasonably supported by the record as a\n\n                                      -38-\n\f           whole. We must reverse when a review of the\n           entire evidence leaves this court with the\n           definite and firm conviction that a mistake\n           has been committed.\n\nId.   at 5 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted);\n\naccord Harrington v. United States, 504 F.2d 1306, 1313 (1st\n\nCir. 1974) (affirming jury finding of responsibility \"[s]ince\n\nthe jury could properly have found that [the taxpayer] was the\n\nperson with responsibility for the taxes\").             We have viewed this\n\nas a fact dominated determination and so give deference to the\n\ntrial judge.    See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 6 (\"We conclude that the\n\ndistrict court's finding that Caterino had sufficient power . .\n\n. to control what creditors [the corporation] would pay is not\n\nclearly erroneous.      Therefore, its conclusion that Caterino is\n\n'responsible'    within     the    meaning    of   section   6672      is   not\n\nincorrect.\").\n\n           The majority of circuits review the responsible person\n\ndetermination for clear error as well.             See Ghandour v. United\n\nStates, No. 97-5062, 1997 WL 716143, at *1 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 17,\n\n1997) (unpublished); United States v. Jones, 33 F.3d 1137, 1139\n\n(9th Cir. 1994); United States v. Running, 7 F.3d 1293, 1297\n\n(7th Cir. 1993); Raba v. United States, 977 F.2d 941, 943 (5th\n\nCir. 1992); Donelan Phelps & Co. v. United States, 876 F.2d\n\n1373,   1374   n.2   (8th   Cir.   1989);    Williams    Indus.   v.   United\n\nStates, No. 87-2630, 1988 WL 92869, at *1 (4th Cir. Sept. 6,\n\n1988) (unpublished); Sinder v. United States, 655 F.2d 729, 731\n\n                                    -39-\n\f(6th Cir. 1981).   Two circuits approach the issue differently.\n\nSee Bradshaw v. United States, 83 F.3d 1175, 1178 (10th Cir.\n\n1995) (stating that determination of responsible person status\n\npresents mixed question of law and fact, subject to de novo\n\nreview); United States v. McCombs, 30 F.3d 310, 319 (2d Cir.\n\n1994) (reviewing findings regarding the taxpayer's role in the\n\ncompany for clear error, but giving plenary review to conclusion\n\nthat taxpayer's role made her responsible under § 6672).     In\n\naddition, the other circuits have correctly viewed this court's\n\nstandard of review as being the clearly erroneous standard.\n\nSee, e.g., Bradshaw, 83 F.3d at 1178 n.4; Running, 7 F.3d at\n\n1297; Hochstein v. United States, 900 F.2d 543, 546 (2d Cir\n\n1990).\n\n         To support its departure from clear error review, the\n\nmajority cites to a number of Supreme Court and First Circuit\n\ncases for the unremarkable proposition that a reviewing court is\n\nnot bound by the clearly erroneous standard where the trial\n\ncourt has committed an error of law.   In the two Supreme Court\n\ncases and the First Circuit case cited by the majority in which\n\nthere was departure from the clear error standard of review, the\n\ntrial courts had committed obvious and important errors of law.\n\nIn United States v. Parke, Davis, & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 43-44\n\n(1960), the trial court had erroneously found that the lack of\n\n\n\n                              -40-\n\fan   express   or   implied   agreement    to    suppress   competition\n\nprecluded finding a violation of the Sherman Act.            In United\n\nStates v. Singer Manufacturing Co., 374 U.S. 174, 193-95 (1963),\n\nthe trial court similarly misunderstood the nature of what would\n\nsuffice to constitute a violation of the Sherman Act.          In Brown\n\nDaltas & Associates, Inc. v. General Accident Insurance Company\n\nof America, 48 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 1995), the trial court had\n\nan erroneous view of which party bore the burden of proving a\n\nmaterial element in the case.1\n\n          The majority opinion is simply wrong when it says that\n\nthere was legal error on the part of the district court in this\n\ncase.    The   record   demonstrates      that   the   district   court\n\nunderstood both the nature of the inquiry into responsibility\n\nunder § 6672 and the factors that were relevant to this inquiry.2\n\n\n     1\n     Furthermore, Brown Daltas does not state that a reviewing\ncourt should apply de novo review when a trial court's factual\nfinding has been affected by legal error. The language is more\nmodest, noting that in this situation a \"reviewing court is not\nbound by the clearly erroneous standard\" and that the trial\ncourt's findings should be \"accorded diminished respect on\nappeal.\" Brown Daltas, 48 F.3d at 36 (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n     2The majority's departure from the clear error standard will\ncause problems in a related area: the taxpayer's right to a jury\ntrial.    Is the majority contending that a jury must be\ninstructed it cannot consider any evidence from outside the\nperiod in question?\n     While the First Circuit has not specifically ruled on the\nquestion of whether the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\nobtains in proceedings in which the government seeks to recover\nunpaid taxes, cases have routinely come to us after jury\n\n                                 -41-\n\fC. Standards Guiding the Determination\n\n          The majority opinion is based upon errors of law both\n\nas to the rules it states and as to the application of otherwise\n\ncorrect rules.    The majority thrice errs.     First, the majority\n\nopinion creates a new and erroneous legal rule: that evidence\n\nfrom tax quarters outside of the quarters at issue may not be\n\nconsidered.   There is no support given for this new rule, and it\n\nis contrary to the law.     Second, the majority opinion pays lip\n\nservice to the rule that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer\n\nand then ignores that principle.       Third, the majority departs\n\nfrom circuit precedent by moving from a flexible, multi-factored\n\napproach to a single focus of decisive weight.            Instead of\n\nregarding the individual factors as elements contributing to an\n\noverall picture of Vinick's status, the majority opinion notes\n\nfor each factor that weighs in favor of responsibility that such\n\nan   individual   factor,   alone,    is   insufficient   to   create\n\n\n\n\ndeterminations of whether a party is a responsible person. Both\nThomsen v. United States, 887 F.2d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1989)\n(involving a § 6672 action), and Harrington involved appeals\nfrom jury trials.   We have applied clear error review to the\nresponsible person determination in both bench and jury trials.\n     Other circuits have addressed the question and have found\nthat the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial does exist in\nthis situation. See United States v. McMahan, 569 F.2d 889, 892\n(5th Cir. 1978) (holding right to jury trial exists in § 6672\nrecovery suit brought by government); cf. Damsky v. Zavatt, 289\nF.2d 46, 51 (2d Cir. 1961) (holding, in part, that right to jury\ntrial exists in action by government to recover federal income\ntaxes).\n\n                               -42-\n\fresponsibility.       But    factors       do   not   stand   alone,     and   the\n\ndistrict court correctly considered them in aggregate.\n\n1. Consideration of Evidence from Outside the Tax Quarters at\n\nIssue\n\n            The district court properly considered evidence from\n\noutside of the quarters at issue so that it could determine\n\nVinick's status, authority, and control during the pertinent\n\nquarters.     No court, to my knowledge, has ever before held that\n\nit is error for a trier of fact to admit evidence from quarters\n\nother than the quarters during which the taxes were not paid and\n\nthen to consider what weight to give to this evidence.\n\n            The district court acted in accord with the Federal\n\nRules of Evidence in admitting evidence that has a tendency to\n\nprove or disprove a material fact (and thus is relevant).                      See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 401-402.       Courts regularly admit evidence of prior\n\nor later transactions, occurrences, and statements to prove\n\nmaterial elements of cases.              In corporate veil-piercing cases,\n\nwhich   are   analogous      to    the    present     case,   courts     consider\n\nevidence    from   outside    of    the    period     at   issue   to   determine\n\nwhether the principal should be held personally liable to the\n\ncorporation's creditors.           In Crane v. Green & Freedman Baking\n\nCo., 134 F.3d 17 (1st Cir. 1998), a union benefits plan sought\n\nto pierce the veil of a corporation to recover unpaid sums from\n\nthe corporation's principals.             In reversing summary judgment for\n\n\n                                         -43-\n\fthe defendants, this court found \"[p]articularly flagrant . . .\n\nthe   evidence   of   a   personal    vacation      that   the    [principals]\n\nfinanced with corporate funds.\"         Id. at 24.         The court weighed\n\nthe evidence of this vacation, which took place in January 1991,\n\nagainst the principals, even though the corporation failed to\n\nmake payments to the benefits plan more than a year later, in\n\nApril 1992.      See id. at 20, 24.            The court also considered\n\nevidence of checks from the corporate account that were made to\n\nthe defendants beginning in January 1991.                   See id. at 24.\n\nSimilarly, in Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. v. Checkers,\n\nInc., 754 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1985) -- another veil piercing\n\ncase -- this court held that summaries of corporate checks made\n\nto the defendants were admissible as proof of the lack of\n\nseparate corporate and individual identities even though the\n\nchecks were made after the debt sued upon had been incurred.\n\n           Courts     consider   this       type   of   temporally      removed\n\nevidence    in   other     situations        as    well.         In   fraud   or\n\nmisrepresentation cases, \"proof that the defendant perpetrated\n\nsimilar    deceptions     frequently    is    received     in    evidence.\"    1\n\nMcCormick on Evidence § 197, at 695 (John W. Strong ed., 5th ed.\n\n1999); see, e.g., Whittaker Corp. v. Execuair Corp., 736 F.2d\n\n1341, 1347 (9th Cir. 1984).           Also, \"when the authority of an\n\nagent is in question, other similar transactions that the agent\n\nhas carried out on behalf of the principal are freely admitted.\"\n\n\n                                     -44-\n\f1 McCormick on Evidence § 198, at 698; see also 2 Wigmore on\n\nEvidence § 377, at 392-93 (James H. Chadbourn rev. 1979).\n\n              In    the    context   of    prosecutions     for   conspiracy   to\n\ndeceive       immigration       authorities        through     phony    marriage\n\nceremonies, the Supreme Court has held that evidence from the\n\nperiod after the conspiracy has ended is admissible to prove the\n\nspuriousness of the marriage and the intent of the parties.                    See\n\nLutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 617 (1953).                     This court\n\nhas allowed admission of post-conspiracy evidence in a criminal\n\nconspiracy case to prove the existence of the conspiracy and the\n\ndefendant's participation.                See United States v. Fields, 871\n\nF.2d 188, 197 (1st Cir. 1989).3\n\n              Finally, in torts cases, evidence from before or after\n\nan accident has occurred is admissible for a number of purposes.\n\nSee, e.g., Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., 43 F.3d 1, 5-10\n\n(1st       Cir.    1994)   (holding       that   district    court   abused    its\n\n\n\n       3\n     Similarly, Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) specifically\nenumerates a list of purposes for which evidence of other\n\"crimes, wrongs, or acts\" is admissible.      See, e.g., United\nStates v. Tse, 135 F.3d 200, 208 & n.6 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding\nthat evidence of a subsequent crime was admissible to show that\ndefendant was \"constantly trying to maintain his dominance\" as\nleader of a gang); United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1501-\n02 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that statements by defendant made\nprior to conduct for which he was charged was admissible to\nprove motive and intent); United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d\n620, 628-29 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that evidence of prior\npossession of cocaine was admissible to prove knowledge and\nintent); see generally 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 404.20\n(Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 1999).\n\n                                          -45-\n\fdiscretion in refusing to admit evidence of modification of saw\n\nto prove feasibility in design defect case and holding that\n\nevidence of lack of prior accidents was properly admitted to\n\nprove absence of defect and lack of causation); Clausen v. Sea-\n\n3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1189-92 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that it\n\nwas not plain error for district court to admit evidence of\n\nremedial measure taken three years after accident to prove\n\ndefendant's control over area in which accident occurred).\n\n          In this case, Vinick's exercise of authority outside\n\nof the quarters in question sheds light upon the authority he\n\nhad during the quarters in question.       That he helped negotiate\n\nrefinancing before the quarters in question suggests that he\n\nwould have done so during the quarters in question.          That he\n\npreviously took steps to remedy the company's non-payment of\n\ntaxes is also relevant to his authority and control during the\n\npertinent quarters, as is the fact that he helped take the\n\ncompany into and through bankruptcy proceedings.        Such evidence\n\nis   relevant   and,   therefore,   admissible.   The    trial   court\n\ncorrectly concluded that it could admit, in this bench trial,\n\nevidence from outside the quarters in question, appropriately\n\nadjusting the weight such evidence would be given.       There was no\n\nerror.\n\n          Evidence from outside of the quarters in question\n\nserves an especially important role where, as here, taxes were\n\n\n                                -46-\n\fnot paid for a relatively short period.     It could easily be the\n\ncase that a person with significant authority and control in a\n\ncompany has no occasion to exercise that authority and control\n\nduring a short period -- for example, when no major decisions\n\nneed to be made and no significant events occur.      Although this\n\nmay be purely a matter of luck, the majority opinion renders it\n\npotentially impossible in this type of situation to find that a\n\nperson who actually has the authority to pay the taxes is a\n\nresponsible person.\n\n            Further, Vinick has waived the issue of the district\n\ncourt's consideration of evidence from outside the quarters in\n\nquestion.    Where an appropriate, contemporaneous objection has\n\nbeen made, this court reviews admissions of evidence for abuse\n\nof discretion.       See Varano v. Jabar, 197 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1999). While Vinick made a motion in limine requesting that the\n\ngovernment's evidence be limited \"to the periods at Issue in the\n\ncase at Bar,\" it was Vinick who introduced much of the evidence\n\nfrom outside of the quarters in question and thus waived the\n\nobjection.     See Gill v. Thomas, 83 F.3d 537, 541 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   Moreover, Vinick never objected to the government's\n\nintroduction    of   such   evidence.   Therefore,   review   of   the\n\ndistrict courts evidence determinations is for plain error. See\n\nVarano, 197 F.3d at 4; Clausen, 21 F.3d at 1190.\n\n                                 -47-\n\f          Vinick testified on direct examination regarding his\n\ninvolvement in hiring Ron Ouellette, signing Heritage Bank\n\nchecks,   the        initial   $165,000    financing,    the     $300,000\n\nrefinancing, and Jefferson Bronze's bankruptcy.             Vinick also\n\nintroduced evidence of Jefferson Bronze checks from before the\n\nquarters in question -- checks that lacked his signature -- to\n\nprove that he never exercised his check signing authority before\n\nthe bankruptcy.        On cross-examination, Vinick was questioned\n\nwithout objection regarding his negotiating a payment plan with\n\nthe IRS during Ouellette's tenure.         Vinick called two employees\n\nfrom Heritage Bank as witnesses and questioned them about the\n\nchecks he had signed after the quarters in question.              Vinick\n\nmade no objection to the government's questioning of Elliot\n\nRothwell, a National Grand Bank employee, regarding Vinick's\n\ninvolvement     in    the   $300,000   refinancing.     Vinick   made   no\n\nobjection to the government's questioning of Ouellette regarding\n\nthe frequency and amount of information Vinick received about\n\nJefferson Bronze during Ouellette's tenure.             Vinick made no\n\nobjection to the government's questioning of Richard Letterman\n\nas to Vinick's role in the original $165,000 financing and in\n\nthe $300,000 refinancing.          Vinick made no objection to the\n\ngovernment's questioning of Letterman regarding Vinick's role in\n\n                                   -48-\n\fnegotiating with the IRS during Ouellette's tenure, Vinick's\n\ninvolvement     in   hiring      and   firing     decisions,    and   Vinick's\n\ninvolvement in the company's bankruptcy.                Nor did Vinick object\n\nto the questioning of Letterman's wife regarding the frequency\n\nand amount of information Vinick received during her husband's\n\ntenure and the number of Heritage Bank checks Vinick signed.\n\n          It was not an abuse of discretion, much less plain\n\nerror, for the district court to admit this evidence, which\n\nclearly had a tendency to prove Vinick's authority and control.\n\n2. The Burden of Proof\n\n          As to the burden of proof, these cases usually involve\n\na company that has withheld taxes from employees' wages and has\n\nthen   failed   to   pay   the    taxes    to     the   government.    In   the\n\nmeantime, the company has typically used the withheld funds to\n\npay other creditors.       Because the employees are held harmless\n\nand credited with the amounts withheld, the U.S. taxpayer often\n\nmakes up the difference.          In order to deter this behavior and\n\nlessen   the    costs   imposed    on     other    taxpayers,   Congress    has\n\nimposed a duty on persons whom the law deems responsible to\n\ncollect, account for, and pay the taxes.                Thus, the question is\n\nnot who in the company ordinarily pays the taxes, but upon whom\n\nthe law imposes a duty to see that the taxes are paid.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -49-\n\f               In keeping with the social policy objectives of § 6672,\n\nthe burden of proof is on a taxpayer whom the IRS believes is a\n\nresponsible person to prove that he is not a responsible person.\n\nSee Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5.                 We have said that this may be a\n\nharsh      rule,   see     id.,    but    it     is    designed     to   protect    the\n\ngovernment and our nation's taxpayers from tax scofflaws, see\n\nHarrington, 504 F.2d at 1311.                     The district court, not the\n\nmajority, has it right.                Under the relevant tests, Vinick did\n\nnot    carry    his    burden     of     proof    to   show   that    he    was   not   a\n\nresponsible person.4\n\n3. The Responsible Person Factors Should be Viewed in Aggregate\n\n               In keeping with the social policy objectives, \"[c]ourts\n\nhave       explicitly      given       the     word     'responsible'        a    broad\n\ninterpretation.\"           Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5.                  Since the term\n\n\"responsible\"         is   far    from    self-defining,       we    have    generally\n\nlooked to indicia of responsibility such as \"the holding of\n\ncorporate office, control over financial affairs, the authority\n\nto disburse corporate funds, stock ownership, and the ability to\n\nhire and fire employees.\"                Thomsen v. United States, 887 F.2d\n\n12, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).                 This was the standard the district\n\ncourt applied, and correctly so.\n\n\n       4\n     The majority opinion even suggests that it viewed the\nburden of proof as the government's, stating that \"the\ngovernment introduced no evidence indicating that during the\nrelevant quarters, Vinick had any involvement in the day-to-day\noperations.\"\n\n                                           -50-\n\f              Until now, this court has never suggested that the\n\nfactors fell into an exclusive trinity or that the factor of\n\nday-to-day decision-making authority over company operations was\n\nthe dispositive factor.         The majority's suggestion that control\n\nover    the    company's     day-to-day       affairs   is    central     to   the\n\nresponsible         person   determination       conflicts       with     circuit\n\nprecedent.      In Harrington, this court held there was \"no error\n\nin the court's charge [to the jury] that an individual need not\n\nbe in day to day control of the administrative and financial\n\naspects of the business in order to be [a] responsible person\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 6672.\"               Harrington, 504 F.2d at\n\n1315.\n\n              The   majority    opinion   also     skews     normal     appellate\n\nreview, dismissing each factor pertaining to responsible person\n\nstatus   by    saying    that   that    factor    alone      cannot   support    a\n\nresponsible person determination.               For example, the majority\n\nopinion states: \"titular authority is insufficient,\" \"not all\n\nshareholders are responsible persons,\" \"occasional involvement\n\nin business affairs is insufficient,\" \"[p]ossession of [check\n\nsigning] authority . . . is not enough.\"                       But factors in\n\ncombination can describe sufficient authority or control to\n\nrender someone a responsible person.\n\nD. Record Support for the Determination\n\n\n\n\n                                       -51-\n\f            This case comes to us after trial, and we are required\n\nto draw all inferences from the evidence in favor of upholding\n\nthe verdict.      See United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741,\n\n744-45     (1st   Cir.   1985).    Although    the     majority       opinion\n\nrecognizes this principle, it does not follow it; it could not\n\ndo so and reach the result it does.\n\n            This picture emerges from the evidence:           Vinick owned\n\nhalf the company and was one of its incorporators.                    He was,\n\nthroughout, its treasurer and one of only two directors.               During\n\nthe periods in question, there were only two corporate officers,\n\nVinick and Letterman.        When Letterman, Vinick, and Peter Mayer\n\nbought the company in 1981, Vinick agreed, both personally and\n\nin his capacity as treasurer, to reimburse the former owner for\n\nany taxes owed.      Vinick signed the note and pledged his house as\n\nsecurity for the original financing of $165,000 with the Small\n\nBusiness      Administration   (\"SBA\").     This     gave   him   a    strong\n\nincentive to stay involved in what the company was doing, and\n\nVinick did keep abreast of the company's financial situation.\n\nHe prepared all of the tax returns, including returns when the\n\ncompany lacked funds to pay the taxes.        In order to prepare the\n\ntaxes,   he    was   given   regular   information    about    income     and\n\nexpenses.      Indeed, throughout his relationship with the company\n\nhe received more information than that.        He was regularly given\n\ncopies of the check registers and reviewed information on a\n\n\n                                   -52-\n\fweekly basis from those actually operating the company.                 His\n\nactivities went beyond those of a mere accountant.5\n\n            Although the district court did not decide the issue,\n\nVinick appears to have played a significant role in hiring and\n\nfiring.     In 1983, after the SBA complained to Vinick about\n\nMayer,    the    first   operations    manager,   Vinick   and    Letterman\n\ndecided to remove Mayer.       Vinick then asked Ouellette to run the\n\ncompany.    In 1988, when Ouellette had problems, Letterman moved\n\ninto the position, doing so with Vinick’s tacit approval.\n\n            In 1985, when the company could not pay its withholding\n\ntaxes, Vinick and Letterman (but not Ouellette, the company's\n\nday-to-day manager) went to see the IRS, and Vinick worked out\n\na   settlement     agreement   and    payment   schedule   that   Ouellette\n\nfollowed.       This effort belies the majority opinion's suggestion\n\nthat Vinick was merely a passive investor.          The fact that Vinick\n\ndid not keep the checkbook or write the checks did not stop him\n\nfrom exercising his authority to correct this problem with the\n\nIRS, and there is nothing to indicate that, having exercised\n\nthis authority in 1985, he did not have such authority in 1989\n\nand 1990.\n\n            Throughout, Vinick had check-signing authority.              He\n\nchose not to exercise any such authority until the company went\n\n\n\n      5\n     Vinick denied he acted as the company’s accountant; this\nwas contradicted by other witnesses.\n\n                                     -53-\n\finto bankruptcy in mid-1990.          If he had regularly signed checks,\n\nthe IRS would have had a stronger case.             But that he chose not\n\nto sign checks until later does not negate his authority to do\n\nso    during   the   quarters    in   question.     Indeed,     when   he   did\n\nexercise check-signing authority during the bankruptcy period,\n\nhe even went to the bank to complain that it was letting checks\n\ngo through without his signature on them.\n\n           The quarters when the taxes were not paid were the last\n\nthree quarters of 1989 and the first two quarters of 1990.                  The\n\nmajority opinion asserts that there was a sea change in the\n\noperations of the company during those quarters.                That is not\n\nso.     It is true that Letterman took control of day-to-day\n\noperations of the company in 1988, and his wife acted as the\n\nbookkeeper.      It is also true that Vinick then reduced his\n\ninvolvement in the day-to-day operations.              But it is not true\n\nthat he reduced his involvement in the financial affairs of the\n\ncompany.\n\n           The majority opinion is simply incorrect when it states\n\nthat \"the record is undisputed that Vinick became less involved\n\nin the financial affairs of the corporation as Letterman's role\n\nincreased.\"      When    Ouellette     ran   the   day-to-day    operations,\n\nVinick discussed the company's financial condition with him \"on\n\na monthly basis.\"       In contrast, when Letterman ran the day-to-\n\nday    operations,      Vinick    reviewed    the    company's     financial\n\n\n                                      -54-\n\fcondition at least weekly, and often more frequently.                    Letterman\n\ntestified that he and Vinick had weekly conversations about how\n\nthe company was doing, that Vinick saw the weekly receipts from\n\ncustomers,      and    that    Mrs.    Letterman     \"brought    him   everything\n\n[they] did.\"      Mrs. Letterman testified that she brought Vinick\n\nthe company’s income and expense information at least weekly,\n\nand more frequently at the end of the month.                      The judge was\n\nentitled   to    accept       the    Lettermans'     testimony    over   Vinick’s\n\ncontradictory testimony that he got such information at most\n\nonce a month.         In fact, Richard Letterman testified that Vinick\n\nwas privy to all information about what was happening at all\n\ntimes.     Nor did Vinick's other financial activities lessen.\n\nJust as before, Vinick prepared the tax returns and the profit\n\nand loss statements.            Just as before, he refused to sign the\n\nreturns and told others to do so.\n\n           When there were major decisions to be made, Vinick made\n\nthem together with Letterman.               The two of them decided in mid-\n\nJuly of 1990 that the company had to be put into bankruptcy.\n\nVinick went to the bankruptcy court, and he started signing\n\ncompany checks that he had always had the authority to sign.                    At\n\ntrial, Vinick attempted to minimize his role in the running of\n\nthe company at this stage, but his testimony was contradicted by\n\nothers.    For example, Vinick claimed he signed the vast majority\n\nof   checks     only    after       they   had    been   negotiated    with   only\n\n\n                                           -55-\n\fLetterman's signature.          Two bank officials and Letterman's wife\n\nall said he signed most checks before negotiation.\n\n               But it is what happened during and around the quarters\n\nin question that reinforces that the district court’s conclusion\n\nwas not error.        The district court quite properly weighed in\n\nVinick’s favor the fact that he did not run the company day-to-\n\nday.     But it is also true that when the company ran into\n\nfinancial problems, Vinick played a considerable role.                        In May\n\nof 1988, the company secured a $300,000 loan from National Grand\n\nBank,    refinancing     its    earlier   $165,000        loan   and    obtaining\n\nadditional operating capital.             Vinick and Letterman met with\n\nEliot Rothwell, a bank official, two or three times to secure\n\nthe    loan.      Rothwell     found   Vinick   to   be    familiar      with    the\n\ncompany’s       financial    condition.         Vinick      signed      the     loan\n\napplication and then signed the note both in his individual and\n\ncorporate capacities.           Vinick and Letterman each personally\n\nguaranteed the loan, and there is evidence that each pledged his\n\nhome.    The bank encouraged them to open an account there for the\n\ncompany; Vinick and Letterman were the signatories.                    Vinick said\n\nthere was a separate $300,000 loan from Bank of New England that\n\nwas made personally to him and to Letterman, that the money was\n\nput into the company, and that he gave a mortgage on his home\n\nfor this loan.        In any event, if the obligations to National\n\nGrand Bank were not met, Vinick was personally in jeopardy.                       In\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\ffact, Vinick's interest in being involved in the company's\n\nfinancial    affairs     had   now   become   even   greater   than      it   was\n\noriginally, as the amount for which he was personally liable had\n\nalmost doubled.        This helps explain his weekly review of the\n\ncompany's finances during Letterman's tenure.\n\n            In early 1989, just before it stopped paying its taxes,\n\nthe company became delinquent on the National Grand Bank loan.\n\nVinick and Letterman then met several times with Rothwell to try\n\nto   work   out    the   problem.       Again,    Rothwell     found     Vinick\n\nknowledgeable about the company’s financial affairs.               Vinick was\n\nwell aware during this period that the company was not paying\n\nthe taxes withheld from employees.             Vinick did not do what he\n\nhad done in 1985, which was to try to work out matters with the\n\nIRS and negotiate a plan to pay the taxes owed.              In essence, it\n\nis fair to infer that he and Letterman together decided to treat\n\nthe IRS as a second-best creditor and put their efforts and the\n\ncompany's payments toward the bank, to which they had immediate\n\npersonal liability.       But that is not what the law permits.               See\n\nDonelan Phelps, 876 F.2d at 1377.             The record amply supports a\n\nfinding that Vinick was a responsible person.\n\n            This is not a case, as the majority would have it, of\n\na passive investor unfairly being saddled with § 6672 liability.\n\nSuch   investors    do   need    protection,     a   fact   that   was    amply\n\ndemonstrated by the government’s aggressive and overreaching\n\n\n                                     -57-\n\fposture at oral argument.       The evidence in this case, however,\n\nshowed that Vinick was not merely a passive investor.              On the\n\nevidence presented, Vinick could have been, and was, deemed a\n\nresponsible person.        As such he had a duty to ensure that the\n\ntaxes were paid.         Given the degree of his involvement and\n\ncontrol over financial and other matters in the company,           Vinick\n\ncould not avoid that duty by refusing to write checks to the IRS\n\nthat he had the authority to write, by refusing to sign tax\n\nreturns that he had the authority to sign, and by failing to\n\nmeet with the IRS when he had the authority to do so.\n\nE. Disposition on Appeal\n\n             Even if the majority opinion were correct in asserting\n\nthat the district court had a mistaken impression of applicable\n\nlegal principles, then the proper disposition would be to remand\n\nthe   case    to   the   district   court,   not   to   decide   the   case\n\nourselves.     Where the evidence \"does not compel a ruling for\n\neither side,\" the proper course is to remand the case to the\n\ntrial court.       TEC Eng. Corp. v. Budget Molders Supply, Inc., 82\n\nF.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir. 1996).             It cannot be said that the\n\nrecord compels a finding that Vinick was not a responsible\n\nperson.\n\n             But for his dissembling at trial, there is a temptation\n\nto feel sorry for Vinick.       His investment in this small company\n\nhas led to a nightmare for him.        Yet, it was not his investment\n\n\n                                    -58-\n\falone that led to his being a responsible person, nor was it\n\nmerely his title as treasurer.      Crediting the entire record,\n\nthere was no error in the trial judge’s decision, and I dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                             -59-\n\f",

Vinick appeals the district court's determination that he personally is liable for withholding taxes that Jefferson Bronze, Inc. (\"Jefferson Bronze\") failed to pay. Previously this court vacated a determination that Vinick was a \"responsible person\" within the meaning of section 6672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. See Vinick v. United States, 110 F.3d 168 (1st Cir. 1997) (appeal from summary judgment in the government's favor) (hereinafter Vinick I). Following a bench trial, the district court again ruled in the government's favor by finding Vinick to be a responsible person. We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To ease the logistical burden on employees and to aid in the collection of taxes, the Internal Revenue Code requires employers to withhold from employees' wages social security and federal income taxes. See 26 U.S.C.  3102, 3402 (1994). The money withheld is held by the employer in trust for the United States. See id.  7501. This system protects from later recourse the employees who are deemed to have paid their taxes, even if the employer fails to pay the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") the money it withheld. See Caterino v. United States, 794 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1986) (noting that the IRS \"has no recourse against employees who have had income and social security taxes withheld from their wages\"). The Code renders liable for the taxes due those it deems to be responsible persons who willfully have neglected to pay the withheld money. See 26 U.S.C.  6672. In pertinent part,  6672 states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liability under  6672 falls upon those persons who satisfy both prongs of a two-part inquiry. First, the person must be \"responsible\" for collecting, accounting for, and paying over the taxes; second, if, and only if, the person is deemed responsible, he is liable if he acted \"willfully\" within the meaning of this section. See, e.g., Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 170; Caterino, 794 F.2d at 3; Harrington v. United States, 504 F.2d 1306, 1312-13 (1st Cir. 1974). Because we already have determined as a matter of law that Vinick acted willfully, see Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 174, the only issue before us is whether the record supports the district court's conclusion that Vinick was in fact a responsible person. We hold that it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the record in the light most favorable to the government. See United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 744-45 (1st Cir. 1985) (noting that \"we present the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the manner most hospitable to the appellee, to the extent consistent with record support\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick, a certified public accountant, has been in private practice since 1962. Prior to that time, he worked for the IRS for eight years. While in private practice, Vinick became acquainted with Richard M. Letterman, then a practicing attorney.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In 1981, Letterman, Peter Mayer, and Vinick formed Jefferson Bronze for the purpose of operating a foundry. Norman Leach, who owned a foundry in Salem, Massachusetts, sold them the necessary assets. Letterman was Leach's attorney, Vinick was his accountant, and Mayer was Letterman's brother-in-law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jefferson Bronze received from the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") a loan to acquire the assets from Leach. Letterman, Mayer, and Vinick, who each owned one-third of Jefferson Bronze's stock, personally guaranteed the SBA loan and pledged their homes as collateral. Letterman became the president and clerk. Vinick was the treasurer. Mayer was neither an officer nor a director, but he was the day-to-day manager of the foundry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the history of his involvement in the corporation, Vinick never gave up his accounting practice and never had an office at Jefferson Bronze. Although Letterman and he both were signatories on the company's checking accounts, Vinick never signed checks prior to the company's filing of its Chapter 11 petition. Vinick, however, did prepare the corporation's quarterly employment tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after its formation, Jefferson Bronze began what would become a long period of financial difficulties. Early on, in 1983, Letterman fired Mayer, and he and Vinick then acquired Mayer's share of the corporation, obtained his release from liability on the SBA loan, and each became a half owner of Jefferson Bronze. Subsequently, Vinick asked Ronald Ouellette, who had worked in the foundry under Leach, to take over as the new manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ouellette ran the office and the foundry, and his wife Diane Ouellette worked part time as the bookkeeper in the office and signed the company checks and payroll returns. Vinick occasionally would visit the Ouellette home to collect information needed to complete the quarterly returns. After their preparation, Vinick would return the completed, unsigned forms to the Ouellette home. Usually once a month, Vinick would discuss with Ron Ouellette the financial condition of the corporation and would stress to him the need to pay the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Ouellette's tenure as manager, Jefferson Bronze's financial troubles continued. Often, the corporation failed timely to pay the withholding taxes due. Regardless, the corporation always filed its tax returns on time. At some point, Letterman and Vinick obtained from Leach a $35,000 loan, which they secured with personal guarantees. In 1985, Vinick negotiated with an IRS revenue officer a payment plan for the taxes Jefferson Bronze owed. Vinick relayed to Ouellette the terms of the plan, and Ouellette complied with the plan's requirements. After Jefferson Bronze completed payment of these taxes, it experienced no further tax delinquency until Letterman took over as manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1988, Letterman decided on his own to take over as the day-to-day financial manager of the corporation. Letterman moved his law practice to Jefferson Bronze's office and relieved Ouellette of his financial responsibilities, but retained him as the foundry manager. Letterman's wife, Ellen Letterman, took over as office manager and bookkeeper. Vinick continued to collect the financial information, to prepare the tax returns, and to leave them for Letterman to sign. While he also continued to advise Letterman to pay the corporation's taxes, the record is undisputed that Vinick became less involved in the financial affairs of the corporation as Letterman's role increased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1988, Jefferson Bronze refinanced its SBA loan with a $300,000 loan from National Grand Bank. Letterman and Vinick met with the bank's vice president, Eliot Rothwell, who negotiated the loan. The bank's practice required all principals of any closely held corporation to be account signatories, and it made no exception for Jefferson Bronze. Letterman and Vinick each signed the note evidencing the loan twice, once in an individual capacity and once in a corporate capacity. Each further personally guaranteed the loan by pledging his house as collateral. Around March 1989, the corporation became delinquent on its loan from National Grand Bank, and Letterman and Vinick met with Rothwell to discuss the financial future of Jefferson Bronze.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By July of 1990, the company's continuing financial difficulties forced it to file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. After doing so, it opened two new bank accounts at Heritage Cooperative Bank (\"Heritage\"): a debtor in possession account and a tax account. Both accounts required two signatures, Letterman's and Vinick's, on every check, even though Letterman retained possession of the checkbooks. For the first time in Jefferson Bronze's existence, Vinick's signature appeared on Jefferson Bronze checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, during the bankruptcy period, Vinick signed every check on the Heritage accounts, but it is unclear when he signed them. On several occasions, Juli Young, the bank employee who filed all paid checks, called Vinick down to the bank. Upon arrival, she presented to him for his signature checks that the bank already had negotiated with only Letterman's signature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On July 26, 1991, National Grand Bank foreclosed on its loan. Later that year, Jefferson Bronze finally closed its doors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meantime, from April 1989 to June 1990, during Letterman's tenure as manager and prior to Vinick's ever having signed a company check, Jefferson Bronze again fell behind in its withholding tax obligations. On December 17, 1990, the IRS assessed against Vinick a penalty pursuant to  6672 for the total amount owed, $49,129. The assessment alleged failed withholding payments for the last three quarters of 1989 and the first two quarters of 1990. On December 24, 1990, the IRS made a like assessment against Letterman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick paid $3,731 and filed a claim for a refund. The IRS denied that claim, and Vinick commenced this suit. The government counterclaimed for the balance due and moved for summary judgment against both men. The district court concluded that as a matter of law Letterman and Vinick both were responsible persons who acted willfully under  6672. The court thus granted the government's motion for summary judgment. Vinick alone appealed. In Vinick I, we found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Vinick was a responsible person and remanded for a bench trial on the issue that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a two-day bench trial to determine whether Vinick was a responsible person, the court heard testimony from several witnesses about the company's organizational structure and about the financial operations at Jefferson Bronze. That testimony covered the formation of the corporation, the various management changes, the operation of the company under each manager, its financial difficulties, and its bankruptcy. The court received into evidence over Vinick's objection over 200 canceled checks from the two Heritage accounts, which Jefferson Bronze had opened after the relevant quarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the second day of testimony, the court issued a bench opinion, finding by a preponderance of the evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that Vinick was a responsible person within the meaning of  6672. The court found that he was the treasurer, prepared the quarterly tax returns, negotiated with the IRS on behalf of the corporation, pledged personal assets, had authority to participate in employment decisions, and possessed throughout the corporation's existence check-signing authority. The court also found that he actually exercised this authority only while the corporation was in bankruptcy. The court weighed each of these factors to varying degrees in favor of his being a responsible person. The court did find him to be uninvolved in the day-to-day management of the corporation and weighed this factor against his being a responsible person, noting, however, that its weight was minimal. Vinick now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing factual findings, this court applies the clear-error standard of review. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Under this standard, we accept the district court's findings of fact unless we are \"'left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\" Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985) (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)); see also Brown Daltas &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. General Accident Ins. Co., 48 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 1995). Moreover, we usually defer to a trial court's resolution of mixed questions of law and fact. See, e.g., United States v. Howard (In re Extradition of Howard), 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The standard of review applicable to mixed questions usually depends upon where they fall along the degree-of-deference continuum: the more fact-dominated the question, the more likely it is that the trier's resolution of it will be accepted unless shown to be clearly erroneous.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, the case for deference vanishes when a court's ultimate conclusion is infected by legal error. See Inwood Labs. v. Ives Labs., 456 U.S. 844, 855 n.15 (1982) (\"Of course, if the trial court bases its findings upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles, the reviewing court is not bound by the clearly erroneous standard.\"); Brown Daltas, 48 F.3d at 36 (same); Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 153 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is settled that one way around the rigors of the 'clearly erroneous' rule is to show that the trial court mistook the applicable law.\"). As a result, when a trial court \"premise[s] its ultimate finding . . . on an erroneous interpretation of the standard to be applied,\" we do not use clear-error review. United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., 362 U.S. 29, 44 (1960). Instead, we treat the trial court's conclusion as a question of law. See United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 194 n.9 (1963) (\"Insofar as that conclusion derived from the court's application of an improper standard to the facts, it may be corrected as a matter of law.\"); Parke, Davis, 362 U.S. at 44 (noting that in these circumstances, the appeals court is \"reviewing a question of law, namely, whether the District Court applied the proper standard to essentially undisputed facts\"); Bergersen v. Commissioner, 109 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that with mixed questions of law and fact \"once the raw facts are determined (and such determinations are normally reviewed only for clear error), deciding which legal label to apply to those facts is a normative decision--strictly speaking, a legal issue\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the trial court made its findings of fact based on a misunderstanding of the legal standard for what constitutes a responsible person under  6672 in that it considered Vinick's conduct over the entire period he was involved with Jefferson Bronze rather than his activities during the quarters in question, see infra Part III.B, we do not defer to its conclusion that Vinick was a responsible party within the meaning of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A responsible person<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> under  6672 is anyone within a company who has a duty to collect, account for, or pay the withheld taxes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172. In determining who falls within the category of responsible person, the courts have identified seven typically used, but nonexclusive, indicia.

United States, 8 F.3d 930, 939 (2d Cir. 1993); accord Barnett v. IRS, 988 F.2d 1449, 1455 (5th Cir. 1993); Denbo v. United States, 988 F.2d 1029, 1032 (10th Cir. 1993); Brounstein v. United States, 979 F.2d 952, 954-55 (3d Cir. 1992); Thomsen v. United States, 887 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1989); Gephart v. United States, 818 F.2d 469, 473 (6th Cir. 1987). No single factor is determinative of responsibility. See Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1455. The deciding court must look at the \"totality of the circumstances\" when making the determination of responsibility. Fiataruolo, 8 F.3d at 939 (\"The question of control over the employer's finances must be answered in light of the totality of the circumstances; no one factor is determinative.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the goal of the statute is to hold liable for the nonpayment of withholding taxes the party responsible for such payment, the \"crucial inquiry is whether the person had the 'effective power' to pay the taxes--that is, whether he had the actual authority or ability, in view of his status within the corporation, to pay the taxes owed.\" Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1454; see also Raba v. United States, 977 F.2d 941, 943 (5th Cir. 1992) (\"The crucial examination is whether a person had the effective power to pay taxes.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). While these factors largely are self-explanatory, it is important to elaborate upon them to resolve whether Vinick was a responsible person in light of the facts as found. The factors easily divide into the following three groups: (1) those that identify the taxpayer's status within the corporation, (2) those that identify his involvement in the daily affairs of the corporation, and (3) those that identify his involvement in the financial affairs of the corporation. We turn now to each of these groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two factors contemplate the taxpayer's status within the corporate structure. As an initial matter, we note that titular authority is insufficient to create liability. See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5 (noting that courts \"have fashioned an elastic definition predicated upon the function of an individual in the employer's business, not the level of the office held\"); see also Fiataruolo, 8 F.3d at 939 (\"[T]he significant control test is not meant to ensnare those who have merely technical authority or titular designation.\"). Moreover, \"[t]he requisite exercised authority or duty is particularly lacking in a case . . . where the taxpayer assumes a title merely for the purpose of protecting his investment.\" O'Connor v. United States, 956 F.2d 48, 51-52 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like corporate title, share ownership is a factor, but not all shareholders are responsible persons. See id. (\"To ignore [the separation of ownership and authority] would be to envelop within 'responsible person' all significant investors with titles in corporations which fail to pay their withholding taxes.\"). Furthermore, share ownership is not a predicate to finding responsibility. See Donelan Phelps &amp; Co. v. United States, 876 F.2d 1373, 1376 (8th Cir. 1989) (noting that a responsible person \"need not be an officer or director or shareholder or employee or disbursing officer or payroll clerk of the trustee of the funds deducted from the employees' wages\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next two factors focus on the taxpayer's involvement in the operation of the corporation. The first factor is whether the taxpayer is active in the day-to-day affairs of the company. Day-to-day management in a corporation involves more than simply having some tangential involvement in the corporation's business. See Godfrey v. United States, 748 F.2d 1568, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Godfrey court described what day-to-day management means:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The taxpayer] actively conducted the day-to-day operations of the business: he came to the office daily, hired and laid off employees, ordered materials and supplies, conducted business correspondence, set the price of jobs, negotiated all contracts with customers, prepared invoices, disbursed corporate checks signed by him and the secretary-treasurer in payment of supplier's [sic] bills and other business expenses, and deposited the business receipts in the corporation's bank account. His address was used for receiving most business mail; his signature was required on all corporate checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (describing activities of the taxpayer in White v. United States, 372 F.2d 513 (Ct. Cl. 1967)). Given the depth of involvement required for day-to-day management, occasional involvement in business affairs is insufficient to create liability. See id. at 1575-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next factor is whether the taxpayer has the ability to hire and fire the employees. In essence, this factor assists in determining the taxpayer's level of involvement in the daily operations of the company. Cf. Thibodeau v. United States, 828 F.2d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir. 1987) (\"The government claims that, as president, the taxpayer was responsible for running the corporation on a daily basis, including the hiring and firing of all employees.\"); White, 372 F.2d at 515 (listing with his other daily operational duties the taxpayer's responsibility for hiring and firing all employees). The theory is that a person with authority to hire and fire the employees likely is involved substantially in the day-to-day management of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final three factors assess involvement in the financial operations of the corporation. This inquiry is the heart of the matter because it identifies most readily the person who could have paid the taxes, but chose not to do so. See Morgan v. United States, 937 F.2d 281, 284 (5th Cir. 1991) (\"The central question is whether an individual had the effective power to pay taxes.\"); Hochstein v. United States, 900 F.2d 543, 547 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"The central question, however, is whether the individual has significant control over the enterprise's finances.\"). Of the three factors within this central question, the first, whether the taxpayer has decision-making authority, is the most important because the goal of  6672 is to fix liability on those persons who could have and should have remitted taxes to the IRS. See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5 (noting that the inquiry for responsibility is \"whether the person had the power to determine whether the taxes should be remitted or paid or had the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid and when\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see also Greenberg v. United States, 46 F.3d 239, 243 (3d Cir. 1994) (finding responsible a taxpayer who \"wrote checks to pay other creditors while knowing that withholding tax liabilities to the United States remained unpaid\"); Denbo, 988 F.2d at 1032 (\"[A] corporate officer or employee is responsible if he or she has significant, though not necessarily exclusive, authority in the general management and fiscal decisionmaking of the corporation.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Gephart, 818 F.2d at 473 (noting that the test focuses \"upon the degree of influence and control which the person exercised over the financial affairs of the corporation and, specifically, disbursements of funds and the priority of payments to creditors\"); Commonwealth Nat'l Bank v. United States, 665 F.2d 743, 757 (5th Cir. 1982) (\"A responsible person is one who has a final or significant--even if not exclusive--word as to which bills or creditors should be paid.\"); White, 372 F.2d at 517 (noting that a responsible person usually is one \"with ultimate authority over expenditures of funds since such a person can fairly be said to be responsible for the corporation's failure to pay over its taxes\"; one with \"authority to direct [the] payment of creditors\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second of these factors, whether the taxpayer exercised control over the daily bank accounts, is significant because it distinguishes between the officers with general control and those with financial control. See Hochstein, 900 F.2d at 547 (\"[T]he district court incorrectly focused on [taxpayer's] control over [the company's] operations generally, rather than his control over the finances of the corporation.\"). Financial involvement indicates that the taxpayer not only was involved in the daily management of the company, but also knew the financial circumstances and could have paid the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final factor is whether the taxpayer had check-signing authority. Again, this factor is significant because it helps determine whether the taxpayer actually could have paid the IRS the due taxes. Importantly, \"[c]ase law discloses that authority to sign checks, without more, is a weak pillar on which to rest a liability determination that a person is properly subject to a 100 percent penalty under section 6672.\" Barrett v. United States, 580 F.2d 449, 453 (Ct. Cl. 1978). The check-signing inquiry goes beyond the simple question whether the taxpayer was a signatory; rather, the court must look at the check-signing authority in the context of financial control. See United States v. Carrigan, 31 F.3d 130, 134 (3d Cir. 1994) (noting that a president's having and even exercising on occasion signatory authority, without more involvement in the company's financial affairs, does not as a matter of law make him a responsible person). Possession of the authority without its exercise is not enough. See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51 (\"The substance of the circumstances must be such that the officer exercises and uses his authority over financial affairs or general management, or is under a duty to do so, before that officer can be deemed to be a responsible person.\"); Morgan, 937 F.2d at 284-85 (\"Mere access to corporate funds, however, does not make one a responsible person.\"); Pototzky v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 308, 316 (1985) (holding that a corporate officer who no longer exercised his authority as a signatory even though he \"technically had the authority to sign\" was not a responsible person).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established the background and having explained the operation of the indicia of responsibility, we turn to discuss this particular case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously mentioned, our task is not to determine whether the district court's factual findings were correct given the weight of the evidence on each factual dispute involved. Rather, the issue is whether Vinick's level of corporate involvement suffices to render him a responsible person under  6672. Therefore, our task is to decide whether the district court understood the legal standard for what is required to be a responsible person and correctly applied this legal standard to its findings when making its ultimate conclusion. We hold it did not and that it should have entered judgment for Vinick. See Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 647 (2d Cir. 1998) (remanding with instructions to enter judgment for the appellee when there was insufficient evidence to support the district court's judgment and no further proceedings were required).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have discussed, the central question in determining whether a taxpayer is a responsible person is whether he had the power to pay the taxes during the quarters in question. See Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1454. In Vinick I, we limited the inquiry of responsibility to \"the relevant quarters.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172 (focusing attention on the relevant quarters and noting that while Vinick participated in some business activities, \"neither of those incidents occurred during the quarters in question\"). At oral argument, the government contended that evidence of activities outside the quarters in question bears on whether Vinick had authority during the quarters in question. We disagree. Responsibility during one period does not equate to responsibility in all periods. See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 4 (finding that the taxpayer's \"involvement with [the company] was insufficient to make him 'responsible' for 1973 under section 6672, but was sufficient to make him 'responsible' for the first two quarters of 1974\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we review the record, we can identify several distinct eras of corporate governance. The first followed Letterman's, Mayer's, and Vinick's initial purchase of Jefferson Bronze, during which time, 1981 to 1983, Mayer was the day-to-day manager. The second came with Ouellette's tenure as day-to-day manager, which was from 1983 to 1987. The third, which includes the quarters in question, began with Letterman's taking over the daily operations in 1987 and ended when the company filed for bankruptcy in July 1990. The final period began with the filing of bankruptcy, during which time the company had opened the Heritage accounts, and ended with the company's failure in 1991. The latter two phases were particularly significant. Letterman's management of the business was more concentrated in his hands than it had been in those of his predecessors. Moreover, when Jefferson Bronze filed for bankruptcy, not only was Letterman's control a factor, but also the bankruptcy court's oversight into the company's affairs would bear upon the degree of control that either Letterman or Vinick could have had. Because of the differences in the governance of Jefferson Bronze, it is erroneous to conflate responsibility during one era with responsibility during another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the factors involved in making the legal determination of responsibility are designed to focus attention on the central question of power. At no time did Vinick exercise any decision-making authority over which creditors Jefferson Bronze paid. Moreover, the government's evidence indicates that during the quarters in question, Letterman was in charge of the day-to-day operations. While it is true that more than one person can be responsible, see Harrington, 504 F.2d at 1312 (noting that we hold responsible \"all with responsibility and authority to avoid the default which constitutes a violation of the statute\"), the government introduced no evidence indicating that during the relevant quarters, Vinick had any involvement in the day-to-day operations. Unless titular authority, being a shareholder, and having unexercised check-signing authority suffice to render a taxpayer responsible, no evidence supports holding Vinick as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is with these observations that we discuss the district court's legal conclusions about Vinick's responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the court found that Vinick was the corporation's treasurer. In commenting that the fact of title is determinative, the court concluded that position alone favors finding Vinick to be a responsible person. Here, the district court contravened the message of Vinick I, in which we said that we \"predicate our definition of who is a responsible person on the function of the employee in the business, and not the level of the office held.\" Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172; see also Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5 (noting that courts consider a person's actual office function rather than his title); White, 372 F.2d at 516 (\"[T]he courts tend to disregard the mechanical functions of the various corporate officers and instead emphasize where the ultimate authority for the decision not to pay the tax lies.\"). The court then compounded its error by determining that being treasurer \"gives him authority to do many things that he does not necessarily have the responsibility to do.\" Instead of focusing on his unexercised authority and his titular designation, the court should have looked at the substance of Vinick's work as treasurer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> to determine what bearing on responsibility this titular authority should have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contended at oral argument that simply being an inside director is sufficient to make a person responsible because directors owe the company a fiduciary duty to see to it that the taxes are paid. This position is contrary to the caselaw. See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51-52; Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576. In O'Connor, the taxpayer was a fifty-percent shareholder, the vice-president, and a director of a closely held corporation, but did not exercise any authority. See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51. The court held that, even though he was a director, \"O'Connor was a 'silent' investor who did not exercise authority and was under no duty to do so.\" Id. Similarly, in Godfrey, the taxpayer was the chairman of the board, had taken the lead in attempting to avoid insolvency, had negotiated for loans, had sold corporate assets, and otherwise had participated in the daily operations of the business. See Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576. In deeming these activities insufficient to render him a responsible person, the Federal Circuit noted that \"[t]o hold Godfrey a 'responsible person' on the present record would be to hold as a 'responsible person' every board chairman who took an active interest in the solvency of the corporation he serves.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also determined that Vinick's having check-signing authority weighed heavily in favor of finding responsibility. The court's affording such weight to the check-signing factor without regard to whether check-signing authority was indicative of financial control is contrary to  6672 precedent. Cf. Denbo, 988 F.2d at 1032 (finding a taxpayer with check-signing authority responsible because of his regular involvement in the financial management of the corporation). In other words, whether the taxpayer had check-signing authority is relevant, but only insofar as it demonstrates financial control. The central inquiry is whether Vinick could have paid the taxes. See Morgan, 937 F.2d at 284; White, 372 F.2d at 517. While it is true that he had check-signing authority during the quarters in question, he at no time had access to the checkbook during that period, see Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172, and thus he was not in a position to exercise his authority, which is determinative. See Carrigan, 31 F.3d at 134 (noting that the taxpayer's check-signing authority did not render him a responsible person because \"the corporate books, records and checkbooks were locked in an office, and [the taxpayer] did not have his own key\"); Dudley v. United States, 428 F.2d 1196, 1202 (9th Cir. 1970) (noting that the taxpayer \"did not have control over the payment of checks,\" which indicated his lack of control over the finances of the corporation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ignored Vinick I's instructions to focus on the quarters in question and admitted much evidence about Vinick's signing of checks post Chapter 11, weighing that fact heavily in favor of finding responsibility. This evidence does not bear on the inquiry into responsibility during the relevant quarters. See Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172-73. Even if it were appropriate to consider evidence from later quarters, the intervention of the Chapter 11 proceeding significantly changed this equation. Vinick's role, limited before the bankruptcy, was only slightly more active after it. The fact of the bankruptcy renders meaningless any comparison of these two periods. To the extent the district court considered the evidence of Vinick's signing checks after the quarters in question, it erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that Vinick's signing the Heritage checks had some relevance, being a countersignatory does not suffice to make him a responsible person. See Lee v. United States, 89-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH)  9393, at 89,018 (D. Haw. Apr. 26, 1989) (noting that even though the taxpayer \"had the authority to countersign checks . . ., she did not have any authority to decide which creditors were to be paid\" and thus was not a responsible person); Montana v. United States, 76-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH)  9145, at 83,159 (D. Neb. Nov. 18, 1975) (noting that in cases finding countersignatories to be responsible persons, \"the taxpayer's power to sign checks was merely a manifestation of his control over the management and disbursement of corporate funds\"); Last v. United States, 65-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH)  9244, at 94,926 (E.D.N.Y.

Again, the district court should not have relied on this evidence because Vinick did not engage in these activities during the quarters in question. See Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172. And even in the case of the IRS settlement, it was the manager, not Vinick, who saw to the fulfillment of its terms. As the government noted in its brief, \"[a]fter these taxes were paid, there was no further delinquency during Ouellette's tenure.\" It is at this point that Letterman took over management, and Vinick's role, already slight, became minimal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court weighed in favor of responsibility Vinick's investment in the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> This finding does not fit within the typical litany of  6672 factors, see Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 16, and is not relevant. While making a personal investment shows a level of involvement in the corporation, it does not indicate financial control, and determining whether Vinick has financial control is the aim of the  6672 inquiry. Because individual investors in corporations by definition use their personal assets to make their investment, the court's conclusion would render any investor in a closely held corporation a responsible person. Because this finding does not serve to limit the scope of who could be a responsible person, it has no bearing on the  6672 inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Vinick had authority to participate in the hiring and firing decisions at Jefferson Bronze. The court weighed this factor in favor of his being a responsible person and deemed it irrelevant that he never actually exercised that authority. As discussed above, the proper inquiry focuses on whether Vinick was involved in the daily management of the corporation, which routine hiring and firing of employees would indicate. The court did not find that Vinick routinely made personnel decisions. The only finding is that he had \"authority to participate\" in these decisions regarding only the general manager. Again, such authority is insufficient to render him a responsible person, see Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576 (noting that the taxpayer who \"participated in the hiring and firing of top corporate management\" was not a responsible person), because it does not demonstrate any significant control over the daily operations, especially the financial operations, of the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final finding of the district court is that Vinick had little involvement in the daily management of the corporation. The court then gave this determination minimal weight because it was \"so far below the combined weight of the [other] factors.\" The court gave this finding short shrift in contravention of accepted authority. See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51. At the heart of the question whether a taxpayer is a responsible person lies an analysis of his influence and control in the corporation and in its financial affairs. See id. That Vinick did not have any involvement in the daily operation of the corporation is much more significant than his title, for example, because it demonstrates his inability to exercise any degree of significant control over which creditors the company would pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking all of these factors together, the findings of the district court do not support the ultimate conclusion that Vinick is a responsible person.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Vinick may have been more than a mere passive investor in the corporation, this fact alone is insufficient to render him a responsible person. See Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576 (\"Godfrey's activities were not those of a passive 'above the fray' chairman, but they do not, without more, impose or create the 'duty' expressly described in the statute.\"). Absent a finding that Vinick possessed actual, exercised authority over the company's financial matters, including the duty and power to determine which creditors to pay, as a matter of law he cannot be a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we find that Vinick as a matter of law was not a responsible person within the meaning of 26 U.S.C.  6672(a).

The district court did not resolve this dispute; the judge merely stated that Vinick had signed some before and some after negotiation, and further found the fact of Vinick's signing, regardless of when, to be indicative of his authority and responsibility within the meaning of  6672.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court noted upon rendering its findings and judgment that because the standard of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence, it is immaterial which side has the burden of proof.

Indeed, it leaves us with the impression that the court relied almost entirely on Vinick's activities before and after the relevant quarters. Twice in Vinick I we emphasized that an inquiry into liability under  6672 should focus on the taxpayer's activities during the quarters in question, see Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 172 (dismissing findings that Vinick engaged in managerial activities because they did not occur during the quarters in question), and we reiterate that principle here. When determining whether a taxpayer is a responsible person under  6672, the court should focus its inquiry on the quarters during which the taxes were unpaid.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Vinick's acting \"as treasurer\" is important because he was and is a Certified Public Accountant (\"CPA\"). The district court determined that his activities over the years of the company's existence in preparing the taxes, meeting with the IRS to negotiate the settlement in the early years, preparing the quarterly employment tax returns, and recommending that the withholding taxes be paid were activities within his capacity as treasurer. These activities are also those that a professional CPA would undertake to service his client. Indeed, Ellen Letterman, in her testimony, discussed her relationship with Vinick: \"Well, he was the CPA and I would give him all the money information he needed.\"</p>\n        <p>The government has suggested that Vinick's telling Letterman and the other managers to pay the taxes demonstrates his responsibility. Giving this advice is, after all, typically a part of the CPA's or attorney's function. But this advice coupled with an investment interest and a corporate title is insufficient to render that professional a responsible person because it does not demonstrate an ability to decide which creditors are paid. If anything, the rendering of advice would support a determination of willfulness, but that inquiry begins only after the determination of responsibility is made. See Vinick I, 110 F.3d at 170.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> A person's decision to become involved in loans and refinancing but not in the payment of taxes can demonstrate willfulness, which is the second prong of the  6672 inquiry, but does not demonstrate responsibility. See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 6 (\"Any responsible person who knows the taxes are not paid and allows the business to pay other creditors acts willfully.\" (emphasis added)). For example, in Godfrey, the taxpayer took an active interest in the company's solvency, but not in the payment of taxes. The court correctly noted that his \"knowledge of nonpayment may be relevant to the issue of willfulness, but it is irrelevant in considering the question of whether he was a 'responsible person.'\" Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576 (citation omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The court stated that the form of the personal contribution, that is, whether he pledged personal assets or made a personal guarantee to secure financing for Jefferson Bronze, was irrelevant. It was the mere fact of contribution that the court weighed in the responsibility calculus.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The government notes that the Tenth Circuit's Denbo decision has similar facts to those in this case. While it is true the Tenth Circuit found there was sufficient evidence to find Denbo a responsible person, see Denbo, 988 F.2d at 1033, the case is distinguishable. Denbo was a fifty percent shareholder, was the secretary-treasurer, was a director, did not manage the restaurant's daily operations, pledged personal assets for the corporation, arranged financing for the corporation, and had check-signing authority, which he never exercised. See id. at 1032. He also \"held regular meetings with [his co-owner] and the accountants.\" Id. As the Tenth Circuit noted, \"[Denbo's] financial involvement in the corporation, along with his check-signing authority, gave him the effective power to see to it that the taxes were paid.\" Id. at 1033.</p>\n        <p>In contrast, Vinick's role in the financial activities of the corporation was largely as its accountant, unlike Denbo who actively engaged in actual financial management of the corporation. When Letterman became Jefferson Bronze's manager, Vinick's role in the corporation substantially lessened. Moreover, to the extent Vinick, as Jefferson Bronze's accountant, was involved in the corporation's financial affairs, such involvement demonstrates only his willfulness because it shows he knew that on occasion the taxes had not been paid, but does not demonstrate his power to pay them, which a determination of responsibility requires.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent in this case, despite great respect for my brethren, because I believe the majority opinion is based upon significant errors of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Commissioner, 110 F.3d 168 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"Vinick I\"), this court twice stated that the facts presented in this case would permit a reasonable inference that Arnold W. Vinick was a \"responsible person\" for purposes of 26 U.S.C.  6672(a). We said that the record contained sufficient evidence \"from which one could infer Vinick's responsibility as a matter of fact.\" Id. at 173. We also noted, with regard to evidence limited to the periods during which the taxes were not paid, \"[f]rom these indicia alone, one might infer that Vinick was a responsible person.\" Id. at 172. Yet now, after the trial judge has actually heard the same evidence, including testimony from Vinick that was contradicted in material respects by every other witness, the majority concludes that the trial judge erred in determining that Vinick was a responsible person. That alone is both passingly odd and at odds with the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority empowers itself to reverse the district court by treating the question of whether Vinick is a \"responsible person\" as a question of law. But the standard of review utilized by this court in  6672 cases is review for clear error. The majority says it is entitled to decide the question de novo because the district court committed an error of law. That error of law, according to the majority, is that the district court \"considered Vinick's conduct over the entire period he was involved with Jefferson Bronze rather than his activities during the quarters in question.\" There was no error of law, as it was well within the district court's discretion to admit this evidence and determine what weight to give it. There is no reason to think the district court gave undue weight to this evidence. Also, Vinick may not be heard to complain on these grounds as he introduced much of the evidence in question and did not object to the evidence the government introduced, and so has waived this argument. Finally, there was no error, much less clear error, in the district court's factual determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law in this circuit that a trier of fact's determination of whether a taxpayer had sufficient control over a corporation to be deemed a responsible person is subject to clear error review. In Caterino v.

We must affirm if the finding is reasonably supported by the record as a whole.

We have viewed this as a fact dominated determination and so give deference to the trial judge. See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 6 (\"We conclude that the district court's finding that Caterino had sufficient power . . . to control what creditors [the corporation] would pay is not clearly erroneous. Therefore, its conclusion that Caterino is 'responsible' within the meaning of section 6672 is not incorrect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority of circuits review the responsible person determination for clear error as well.

United States, 655 F.2d 729, 731 (6th Cir. 1981). Two circuits approach the issue differently. See Bradshaw v. United States, 83 F.3d 1175, 1178 (10th Cir. 1995) (stating that determination of responsible person status presents mixed question of law and fact, subject to de novo review); United States v. McCombs, 30 F.3d 310, 319 (2d Cir. 1994) (reviewing findings regarding the taxpayer's role in the company for clear error, but giving plenary review to conclusion that taxpayer's role made her responsible under  6672). In addition, the other circuits have correctly viewed this court's standard of review as being the clearly erroneous standard. See, e.g., Bradshaw, 83 F.3d at 1178 n.4; Running, 7 F.3d at 1297; Hochstein v. United States, 900 F.2d 543, 546 (2d Cir 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its departure from clear error review, the majority cites to a number of Supreme Court and First Circuit cases for the unremarkable proposition that a reviewing court is not bound by the clearly erroneous standard where the trial court has committed an error of law. In the two Supreme Court cases and the First Circuit case cited by the majority in which there was departure from the clear error standard of review, the trial courts had committed obvious and important errors of law. In United States v. Parke, Davis, &amp; Co., 362 U.S. 29, 43-44 (1960), the trial court had erroneously found that the lack of an express or implied agreement to suppress competition precluded finding a violation of the Sherman Act. In United States v. Singer Manufacturing Co., 374 U.S. 174, 193-95 (1963), the trial court similarly misunderstood the nature of what would suffice to constitute a violation of the Sherman Act. In Brown Daltas &amp; Associates, Inc. v. General Accident Insurance Company of America, 48 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 1995), the trial court had an erroneous view of which party bore the burden of proving a material element in the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion is simply wrong when it says that there was legal error on the part of the district court in this case.

Standards Guiding the Determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion is based upon errors of law both as to the rules it states and as to the application of otherwise correct rules. The majority thrice errs. First, the majority opinion creates a new and erroneous legal rule: that evidence from tax quarters outside of the quarters at issue may not be considered. There is no support given for this new rule, and it is contrary to the law. Second, the majority opinion pays lip service to the rule that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer and then ignores that principle. Third, the majority departs from circuit precedent by moving from a flexible, multi-factored approach to a single focus of decisive weight. Instead of regarding the individual factors as elements contributing to an overall picture of Vinick's status, the majority opinion notes for each factor that weighs in favor of responsibility that such an individual factor, alone, is insufficient to create responsibility. But factors do not stand alone, and the district court correctly considered them in aggregate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

No court, to my knowledge, has ever before held that it is error for a trier of fact to admit evidence from quarters other than the quarters during which the taxes were not paid and then to consider what weight to give to this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court acted in accord with the Federal Rules of Evidence in admitting evidence that has a tendency to prove or disprove a material fact (and thus is relevant). See Fed. R. Evid. 401-402. Courts regularly admit evidence of prior or later transactions, occurrences, and statements to prove material elements of cases. In corporate veil-piercing cases, which are analogous to the present case, courts consider evidence from outside of the period at issue to determine whether the principal should be held personally liable to the corporation's creditors. In Crane v. Green &amp; Freedman Baking Co., 134 F.3d 17 (1st Cir. 1998), a union benefits plan sought to pierce the veil of a corporation to recover unpaid sums from the corporation's principals. In reversing summary judgment for the defendants, this court found \"[p]articularly flagrant . . . the evidence of a personal vacation that the [principals] financed with corporate funds.\" Id. at 24. The court weighed the evidence of this vacation, which took place in January 1991, against the principals, even though the corporation failed to make payments to the benefits plan more than a year later, in April 1992. See id. at 20, 24. The court also considered evidence of checks from the corporate account that were made to the defendants beginning in January 1991. See id. at 24. Similarly, in Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. v. Checkers, Inc., 754 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1985) -- another veil piercing case -- this court held that summaries of corporate checks made to the defendants were admissible as proof of the lack of separate corporate and individual identities even though the checks were made after the debt sued upon had been incurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts consider this type of temporally removed evidence in other situations as well.

Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999); see, e.g., Whittaker Corp. v. Execuair Corp., 736 F.2d 1341, 1347 (9th Cir. 1984).

This court has allowed admission of post-conspiracy evidence in a criminal conspiracy case to prove the existence of the conspiracy and the defendant's participation. See United States v. Fields, 871 F.2d 188, 197 (1st Cir. 1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in torts cases, evidence from before or after an accident has occurred is admissible for a number of purposes. See, e.g., Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., 43 F.3d 1, 5-10 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that district court abused its discretion in refusing to admit evidence of modification of saw to prove feasibility in design defect case and holding that evidence of lack of prior accidents was properly admitted to prove absence of defect and lack of causation); Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1189-92 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that it was not plain error for district court to admit evidence of remedial measure taken three years after accident to prove defendant's control over area in which accident occurred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Vinick's exercise of authority outside of the quarters in question sheds light upon the authority he had during the quarters in question. That he helped negotiate refinancing before the quarters in question suggests that he would have done so during the quarters in question. That he previously took steps to remedy the company's non-payment of taxes is also relevant to his authority and control during the pertinent quarters, as is the fact that he helped take the company into and through bankruptcy proceedings. Such evidence is relevant and, therefore, admissible. The trial court correctly concluded that it could admit, in this bench trial, evidence from outside the quarters in question, appropriately adjusting the weight such evidence would be given. There was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence from outside of the quarters in question serves an especially important role where, as here, taxes were not paid for a relatively short period. It could easily be the case that a person with significant authority and control in a company has no occasion to exercise that authority and control during a short period -- for example, when no major decisions need to be made and no significant events occur. Although this may be purely a matter of luck, the majority opinion renders it potentially impossible in this type of situation to find that a person who actually has the authority to pay the taxes is a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Vinick has waived the issue of the district court's consideration of evidence from outside the quarters in question. Where an appropriate, contemporaneous objection has been made, this court reviews admissions of evidence for abuse of discretion. See Varano v. Jabar, 197 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1999). While Vinick made a motion in limine requesting that the government's evidence be limited \"to the periods at Issue in the case at Bar,\" it was Vinick who introduced much of the evidence from outside of the quarters in question and thus waived the objection. See Gill v. Thomas, 83 F.3d 537, 541 (1st Cir. 1996). Moreover, Vinick never objected to the government's introduction of such evidence. Therefore, review of the district courts evidence determinations is for plain error. See Varano, 197 F.3d at 4; Clausen, 21 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick testified on direct examination regarding his involvement in hiring Ron Ouellette, signing Heritage Bank checks, the initial $165,000 financing, the $300,000 refinancing, and Jefferson Bronze's bankruptcy. Vinick also introduced evidence of Jefferson Bronze checks from before the quarters in question -- checks that lacked his signature -- to prove that he never exercised his check signing authority before the bankruptcy. On cross-examination, Vinick was questioned without objection regarding his negotiating a payment plan with the IRS during Ouellette's tenure. Vinick called two employees from Heritage Bank as witnesses and questioned them about the checks he had signed after the quarters in question. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Elliot Rothwell, a National Grand Bank employee, regarding Vinick's involvement in the $300,000 refinancing. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Ouellette regarding the frequency and amount of information Vinick received about Jefferson Bronze during Ouellette's tenure. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Richard Letterman as to Vinick's role in the original $165,000 financing and in the $300,000 refinancing. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Letterman regarding Vinick's role in negotiating with the IRS during Ouellette's tenure, Vinick's involvement in hiring and firing decisions, and Vinick's involvement in the company's bankruptcy. Nor did Vinick object to the questioning of Letterman's wife regarding the frequency and amount of information Vinick received during her husband's tenure and the number of Heritage Bank checks Vinick signed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not an abuse of discretion, much less plain error, for the district court to admit this evidence, which clearly had a tendency to prove Vinick's authority and control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Burden of Proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the burden of proof, these cases usually involve a company that has withheld taxes from employees' wages and has then failed to pay the taxes to the government. In the meantime, the company has typically used the withheld funds to pay other creditors. Because the employees are held harmless and credited with the amounts withheld, the U.S. taxpayer often makes up the difference. In order to deter this behavior and lessen the costs imposed on other taxpayers, Congress has imposed a duty on persons whom the law deems responsible to collect, account for, and pay the taxes. Thus, the question is not who in the company ordinarily pays the taxes, but upon whom the law imposes a duty to see that the taxes are paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In keeping with the social policy objectives of  6672, the burden of proof is on a taxpayer whom the IRS believes is a responsible person to prove that he is not a responsible person. See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5. We have said that this may be a harsh rule, see id., but it is designed to protect the government and our nation's taxpayers from tax scofflaws, see Harrington, 504 F.2d at 1311. The district court, not the majority, has it right. Under the relevant tests, Vinick did not carry his burden of proof to show that he was not a responsible person.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Responsible Person Factors Should be Viewed in Aggregate</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In keeping with the social policy objectives, \"[c]ourts have explicitly given the word 'responsible' a broad interpretation.\" Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5. Since the term \"responsible\" is far from self-defining, we have generally looked to indicia of responsibility such as \"the holding of corporate office, control over financial affairs, the authority to disburse corporate funds, stock ownership, and the ability to hire and fire employees.\" Thomsen v. United States, 887 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1989). This was the standard the district court applied, and correctly so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until now, this court has never suggested that the factors fell into an exclusive trinity or that the factor of day-to-day decision-making authority over company operations was the dispositive factor. The majority's suggestion that control over the company's day-to-day affairs is central to the responsible person determination conflicts with circuit precedent. In Harrington, this court held there was \"no error in the court's charge [to the jury] that an individual need not be in day to day control of the administrative and financial aspects of the business in order to be [a] responsible person within the meaning of Section 6672.\" Harrington, 504 F.2d at 1315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion also skews normal appellate review, dismissing each factor pertaining to responsible person status by saying that that factor alone cannot support a responsible person determination. For example, the majority opinion states: \"titular authority is insufficient,\" \"not all shareholders are responsible persons,\" \"occasional involvement in business affairs is insufficient,\" \"[p]ossession of [check signing] authority . . . is not enough.\" But factors in combination can describe sufficient authority or control to render someone a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Record Support for the Determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us after trial, and we are required to draw all inferences from the evidence in favor of upholding the verdict. See United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 744-45 (1st Cir. 1985). Although the majority opinion recognizes this principle, it does not follow it; it could not do so and reach the result it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This picture emerges from the evidence: Vinick owned half the company and was one of its incorporators. He was, throughout, its treasurer and one of only two directors. During the periods in question, there were only two corporate officers, Vinick and Letterman. When Letterman, Vinick, and Peter Mayer bought the company in 1981, Vinick agreed, both personally and in his capacity as treasurer, to reimburse the former owner for any taxes owed. Vinick signed the note and pledged his house as security for the original financing of $165,000 with the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\"). This gave him a strong incentive to stay involved in what the company was doing, and Vinick did keep abreast of the company's financial situation. He prepared all of the tax returns, including returns when the company lacked funds to pay the taxes. In order to prepare the taxes, he was given regular information about income and expenses. Indeed, throughout his relationship with the company he received more information than that. He was regularly given copies of the check registers and reviewed information on a weekly basis from those actually operating the company. His activities went beyond those of a mere accountant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not decide the issue, Vinick appears to have played a significant role in hiring and firing. In 1983, after the SBA complained to Vinick about Mayer, the first operations manager, Vinick and Letterman decided to remove Mayer. Vinick then asked Ouellette to run the company. In 1988, when Ouellette had problems, Letterman moved into the position, doing so with Vinick's tacit approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, when the company could not pay its withholding taxes, Vinick and Letterman (but not Ouellette, the company's day-to-day manager) went to see the IRS, and Vinick worked out a settlement agreement and payment schedule that Ouellette followed. This effort belies the majority opinion's suggestion that Vinick was merely a passive investor. The fact that Vinick did not keep the checkbook or write the checks did not stop him from exercising his authority to correct this problem with the IRS, and there is nothing to indicate that, having exercised this authority in 1985, he did not have such authority in 1989 and 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout, Vinick had check-signing authority. He chose not to exercise any such authority until the company went into bankruptcy in mid-1990. If he had regularly signed checks, the IRS would have had a stronger case. But that he chose not to sign checks until later does not negate his authority to do so during the quarters in question. Indeed, when he did exercise check-signing authority during the bankruptcy period, he even went to the bank to complain that it was letting checks go through without his signature on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quarters when the taxes were not paid were the last three quarters of 1989 and the first two quarters of 1990. The majority opinion asserts that there was a sea change in the operations of the company during those quarters. That is not so. It is true that Letterman took control of day-to-day operations of the company in 1988, and his wife acted as the bookkeeper. It is also true that Vinick then reduced his involvement in the day-to-day operations. But it is not true that he reduced his involvement in the financial affairs of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion is simply incorrect when it states that \"the record is undisputed that Vinick became less involved in the financial affairs of the corporation as Letterman's role increased.\" When Ouellette ran the day-to-day operations, Vinick discussed the company's financial condition with him \"on a monthly basis.\" In contrast, when Letterman ran the day-to-day operations, Vinick reviewed the company's financial condition at least weekly, and often more frequently. Letterman testified that he and Vinick had weekly conversations about how the company was doing, that Vinick saw the weekly receipts from customers, and that Mrs. Letterman \"brought him everything [they] did.\" Mrs. Letterman testified that she brought Vinick the company's income and expense information at least weekly, and more frequently at the end of the month. The judge was entitled to accept the Lettermans' testimony over Vinick's contradictory testimony that he got such information at most once a month. In fact, Richard Letterman testified that Vinick was privy to all information about what was happening at all times. Nor did Vinick's other financial activities lessen. Just as before, Vinick prepared the tax returns and the profit and loss statements. Just as before, he refused to sign the returns and told others to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When there were major decisions to be made, Vinick made them together with Letterman. The two of them decided in mid-July of 1990 that the company had to be put into bankruptcy. Vinick went to the bankruptcy court, and he started signing company checks that he had always had the authority to sign. At trial, Vinick attempted to minimize his role in the running of the company at this stage, but his testimony was contradicted by others. For example, Vinick claimed he signed the vast majority of checks only after they had been negotiated with only Letterman's signature. Two bank officials and Letterman's wife all said he signed most checks before negotiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it is what happened during and around the quarters in question that reinforces that the district court's conclusion was not error. The district court quite properly weighed in Vinick's favor the fact that he did not run the company day-to-day. But it is also true that when the company ran into financial problems, Vinick played a considerable role. In May of 1988, the company secured a $300,000 loan from National Grand Bank, refinancing its earlier $165,000 loan and obtaining additional operating capital. Vinick and Letterman met with Eliot Rothwell, a bank official, two or three times to secure the loan. Rothwell found Vinick to be familiar with the company's financial condition. Vinick signed the loan application and then signed the note both in his individual and corporate capacities. Vinick and Letterman each personally guaranteed the loan, and there is evidence that each pledged his home. The bank encouraged them to open an account there for the company; Vinick and Letterman were the signatories. Vinick said there was a separate $300,000 loan from Bank of New England that was made personally to him and to Letterman, that the money was put into the company, and that he gave a mortgage on his home for this loan. In any event, if the obligations to National Grand Bank were not met, Vinick was personally in jeopardy. In fact, Vinick's interest in being involved in the company's financial affairs had now become even greater than it was originally, as the amount for which he was personally liable had almost doubled. This helps explain his weekly review of the company's finances during Letterman's tenure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1989, just before it stopped paying its taxes, the company became delinquent on the National Grand Bank loan. Vinick and Letterman then met several times with Rothwell to try to work out the problem. Again, Rothwell found Vinick knowledgeable about the company's financial affairs. Vinick was well aware during this period that the company was not paying the taxes withheld from employees. Vinick did not do what he had done in 1985, which was to try to work out matters with the IRS and negotiate a plan to pay the taxes owed. In essence, it is fair to infer that he and Letterman together decided to treat the IRS as a second-best creditor and put their efforts and the company's payments toward the bank, to which they had immediate personal liability. But that is not what the law permits. See Donelan Phelps, 876 F.2d at 1377. The record amply supports a finding that Vinick was a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case, as the majority would have it, of a passive investor unfairly being saddled with  6672 liability. Such investors do need protection, a fact that was amply demonstrated by the government's aggressive and overreaching posture at oral argument. The evidence in this case, however, showed that Vinick was not merely a passive investor. On the evidence presented, Vinick could have been, and was, deemed a responsible person. As such he had a duty to ensure that the taxes were paid. Given the degree of his involvement and control over financial and other matters in the company, Vinick could not avoid that duty by refusing to write checks to the IRS that he had the authority to write, by refusing to sign tax returns that he had the authority to sign, and by failing to meet with the IRS when he had the authority to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Disposition on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the majority opinion were correct in asserting that the district court had a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles, then the proper disposition would be to remand the case to the district court, not to decide the case ourselves. Where the evidence \"does not compel a ruling for either side,\" the proper course is to remand the case to the trial court. TEC Eng. Corp. v. Budget Molders Supply, Inc., 82 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir. 1996). It cannot be said that the record compels a finding that Vinick was not a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But for his dissembling at trial, there is a temptation to feel sorry for Vinick. His investment in this small company has led to a nightmare for him. Yet, it was not his investment alone that led to his being a responsible person, nor was it merely his title as treasurer. Crediting the entire record, there was no error in the trial judge's decision, and I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, Brown Daltas does not state that a reviewing court should apply de novo review when a trial court's factual finding has been affected by legal error. The language is more modest, noting that in this situation a \"reviewing court is not bound by the clearly erroneous standard\" and that the trial court's findings should be \"accorded diminished respect on appeal.\" Brown Daltas, 48 F.3d at 36 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The majority's departure from the clear error standard will cause problems in a related area: the taxpayer's right to a jury trial. Is the majority contending that a jury must be instructed it cannot consider any evidence from outside the period in question?</p>\n        <p>While the First Circuit has not specifically ruled on the question of whether the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial obtains in proceedings in which the government seeks to recover unpaid taxes, cases have routinely come to us after jury determinations of whether a party is a responsible person. Both Thomsen v. United States, 887 F.2d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1989) (involving a  6672 action), and Harrington involved appeals from jury trials. We have applied clear error review to the responsible person determination in both bench and jury trials.</p>\n        <p>Other circuits have addressed the question and have found that the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial does exist in this situation. See United States v. McMahan, 569 F.2d 889, 892 (5th Cir. 1978) (holding right to jury trial exists in  6672 recovery suit brought by government); cf. Damsky v.

See, e.g., United States v. Tse, 135 F.3d 200, 208 &amp; n.6 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding that evidence of a subsequent crime was admissible to show that defendant was \"constantly trying to maintain his dominance\" as leader of a gang); United States v.

The Code renders liable for the taxes due those it deems to be responsible persons who willfully have neglected to pay the withheld money. See 26 U.S.C.  6672. In pertinent part,  6672 states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liability under  6672 falls upon those persons who satisfy both prongs of a two-part inquiry.

Prior to that time, he worked for the IRS for eight years. While in private practice, Vinick became acquainted with Richard M. Letterman, then a practicing attorney.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In 1981, Letterman, Peter Mayer, and Vinick formed Jefferson Bronze for the purpose of operating a foundry. Norman Leach, who owned a foundry in Salem, Massachusetts, sold them the necessary assets. Letterman was Leach's attorney, Vinick was his accountant, and Mayer was Letterman's brother-in-law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jefferson Bronze received from the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") a loan to acquire the assets from Leach. Letterman, Mayer, and Vinick, who each owned one-third of Jefferson Bronze's stock, personally guaranteed the SBA loan and pledged their homes as collateral. Letterman became the president and clerk. Vinick was the treasurer. Mayer was neither an officer nor a director, but he was the day-to-day manager of the foundry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the history of his involvement in the corporation, Vinick never gave up his accounting practice and never had an office at Jefferson Bronze. Although Letterman and he both were signatories on the company's checking accounts, Vinick never signed checks prior to the company's filing of its Chapter 11 petition. Vinick, however, did prepare the corporation's quarterly employment tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after its formation, Jefferson Bronze began what would become a long period of financial difficulties. Early on, in 1983, Letterman fired Mayer, and he and Vinick then acquired Mayer's share of the corporation, obtained his release from liability on the SBA loan, and each became a half owner of Jefferson Bronze. Subsequently, Vinick asked Ronald Ouellette, who had worked in the foundry under Leach, to take over as the new manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ouellette ran the office and the foundry, and his wife Diane Ouellette worked part time as the bookkeeper in the office and signed the company checks and payroll returns. Vinick occasionally would visit the Ouellette home to collect information needed to complete the quarterly returns. After their preparation, Vinick would return the completed, unsigned forms to the Ouellette home. Usually once a month, Vinick would discuss with Ron Ouellette the financial condition of the corporation and would stress to him the need to pay the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Ouellette's tenure as manager, Jefferson Bronze's financial troubles continued. Often, the corporation failed timely to pay the withholding taxes due. Regardless, the corporation always filed its tax returns on time. At some point, Letterman and Vinick obtained from Leach a $35,000 loan, which they secured with personal guarantees. In 1985, Vinick negotiated with an IRS revenue officer a payment plan for the taxes Jefferson Bronze owed. Vinick relayed to Ouellette the terms of the plan, and Ouellette complied with the plan's requirements. After Jefferson Bronze completed payment of these taxes, it experienced no further tax delinquency until Letterman took over as manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1988, Letterman decided on his own to take over as the day-to-day financial manager of the corporation. Letterman moved his law practice to Jefferson Bronze's office and relieved Ouellette of his financial responsibilities, but retained him as the foundry manager. Letterman's wife, Ellen Letterman, took over as office manager and bookkeeper. Vinick continued to collect the financial information, to prepare the tax returns, and to leave them for Letterman to sign. While he also continued to advise Letterman to pay the corporation's taxes, the record is undisputed that Vinick became less involved in the financial affairs of the corporation as Letterman's role increased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1988, Jefferson Bronze refinanced its SBA loan with a $300,000 loan from National Grand Bank. Letterman and Vinick met with the bank's vice president, Eliot Rothwell, who negotiated the loan. The bank's practice required all principals of any closely held corporation to be account signatories, and it made no exception for Jefferson Bronze. Letterman and Vinick each signed the note evidencing the loan twice, once in an individual capacity and once in a corporate capacity. Each further personally guaranteed the loan by pledging his house as collateral. Around March 1989, the corporation became delinquent on its loan from National Grand Bank, and Letterman and Vinick met with Rothwell to discuss the financial future of Jefferson Bronze.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By July of 1990, the company's continuing financial difficulties forced it to file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. After doing so, it opened two new bank accounts at Heritage Cooperative Bank (\"Heritage\"): a debtor in possession account and a tax account. Both accounts required two signatures, Letterman's and Vinick's, on every check, even though Letterman retained possession of the checkbooks. For the first time in Jefferson Bronze's existence, Vinick's signature appeared on Jefferson Bronze checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, during the bankruptcy period, Vinick signed every check on the Heritage accounts, but it is unclear when he signed them. On several occasions, Juli Young, the bank employee who filed all paid checks, called Vinick down to the bank. Upon arrival, she presented to him for his signature checks that the bank already had negotiated with only Letterman's signature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On July 26, 1991, National Grand Bank foreclosed on its loan. Later that year, Jefferson Bronze finally closed its doors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meantime, from April 1989 to June 1990, during Letterman's tenure as manager and prior to Vinick's ever having signed a company check, Jefferson Bronze again fell behind in its withholding tax obligations. On December 17, 1990, the IRS assessed against Vinick a penalty pursuant to  6672 for the total amount owed, $49,129. The assessment alleged failed withholding payments for the last three quarters of 1989 and the first two quarters of 1990. On December 24, 1990, the IRS made a like assessment against Letterman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick paid $3,731 and filed a claim for a refund. The IRS denied that claim, and Vinick commenced this suit. The government counterclaimed for the balance due and moved for summary judgment against both men. The district court concluded that as a matter of law Letterman and Vinick both were responsible persons who acted willfully under  6672. The court thus granted the government's motion for summary judgment. Vinick alone appealed. In Vinick I, we found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Vinick was a responsible person and remanded for a bench trial on the issue that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a two-day bench trial to determine whether Vinick was a responsible person, the court heard testimony from several witnesses about the company's organizational structure and about the financial operations at Jefferson Bronze. That testimony covered the formation of the corporation, the various management changes, the operation of the company under each manager, its financial difficulties, and its bankruptcy. The court received into evidence over Vinick's objection over 200 canceled checks from the two Heritage accounts, which Jefferson Bronze had opened after the relevant quarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the second day of testimony, the court issued a bench opinion, finding by a preponderance of the evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that Vinick was a responsible person within the meaning of  6672. The court found that he was the treasurer, prepared the quarterly tax returns, negotiated with the IRS on behalf of the corporation, pledged personal assets, had authority to participate in employment decisions, and possessed throughout the corporation's existence check-signing authority. The court also found that he actually exercised this authority only while the corporation was in bankruptcy. The court weighed each of these factors to varying degrees in favor of his being a responsible person. The court did find him to be uninvolved in the day-to-day management of the corporation and weighed this factor against his being a responsible person, noting, however, that its weight was minimal. Vinick now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing factual findings, this court applies the clear-error standard of review.

The first factor is whether the taxpayer is active in the day-to-day affairs of the company. Day-to-day management in a corporation involves more than simply having some tangential involvement in the corporation's business. See Godfrey v.

In essence, this factor assists in determining the taxpayer's level of involvement in the daily operations of the company. Cf. Thibodeau v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494220\"><a href=\"/opinion/494220/john-a-thibodeau-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1499</span></a></span>, 1504 (11th Cir. 1987) (\"The government claims that, as president, the taxpayer was responsible for running the corporation on a daily basis, including the hiring and firing of all employees.\"); <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"274700\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">White,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/274700/robert-white-v-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">515</span> </a></span>(listing with his other daily operational duties the taxpayer's responsibility for hiring and firing all employees).

This inquiry is the heart of the matter because it identifies most readily the person who could have paid the taxes, but chose not to do so. See Morgan v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563835\"><a href=\"/opinion/563835/tommy-d-morgan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 284 (5th Cir. 1991) (\"The central question is whether an individual had the effective power to pay taxes.\"); Hochstein v.

Of the three factors within this central question, the first, whether the taxpayer has decision-making authority, is the most important because the goal of  6672 is to fix liability on those persons who could have and should have remitted taxes to the IRS. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472151\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Caterino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/472151/cosmo-j-caterino-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">5</span> </a></span>(noting that the inquiry for responsibility is \"whether the person had the power to determine whether the taxes should be remitted or paid or had the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid and when\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see also Greenberg v.

Again, this factor is significant because it helps determine whether the taxpayer actually could have paid the IRS the due taxes. Importantly, \"[c]ase law discloses that authority to sign checks, without more, is a weak pillar on which to rest a liability determination that a person is properly subject to a 100 percent penalty under section 6672.\" Barrett v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></span>, 453 (Ct. Cl. 1978). The check-signing inquiry goes beyond the simple question whether the taxpayer was a signatory; rather, the court must look at the check-signing authority in the context of financial control. See United States v. Carrigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675707\"><a href=\"/opinion/675707/united-states-v-robert-p-carrigan-david-l-fendrick-and-edward-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 134 (3d Cir. 1994) (noting that a president's having and even exercising on occasion signatory authority, without more involvement in the company's financial affairs, does not as a matter of law make him a responsible person).

Rather, the issue is whether Vinick's level of corporate involvement suffices to render him a responsible person under  6672. Therefore, our task is to decide whether the district court understood the legal standard for what is required to be a responsible person and correctly applied this legal standard to its findings when making its ultimate conclusion. We hold it did not and that it should have entered judgment for Vinick. See Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dep't, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758664\"><a href=\"/opinion/758664/robert-n-colwell-charles-r-ellinger-and-richard-h-abrams-jr-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 647 (2d Cir. 1998) (remanding with instructions to enter judgment for the appellee when there was insufficient evidence to support the district court's judgment and no further proceedings were required).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have discussed, the central question in determining whether a taxpayer is a responsible person is whether he had the power to pay the taxes during the quarters in question.

At oral argument, the government contended that evidence of activities outside the quarters in question bears on whether Vinick had authority during the quarters in question. We disagree. Responsibility during one period does not equate to responsibility in all periods. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472151\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Caterino,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/472151/cosmo-j-caterino-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span> </a></span>(finding that the taxpayer's \"involvement with [the company] was insufficient to make him 'responsible' for 1973 under section 6672, but was sufficient to make him 'responsible' for the first two quarters of 1974\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we review the record, we can identify several distinct eras of corporate governance. The first followed Letterman's, Mayer's, and Vinick's initial purchase of Jefferson Bronze, during which time, 1981 to 1983, Mayer was the day-to-day manager. The second came with Ouellette's tenure as day-to-day manager, which was from 1983 to 1987. The third, which includes the quarters in question, began with Letterman's taking over the daily operations in 1987 and ended when the company filed for bankruptcy in July 1990. The final period began with the filing of bankruptcy, during which time the company had opened the Heritage accounts, and ended with the company's failure in 1991. The latter two phases were particularly significant. Letterman's management of the business was more concentrated in his hands than it had been in those of his predecessors. Moreover, when Jefferson Bronze filed for bankruptcy, not only was Letterman's control a factor, but also the bankruptcy court's oversight into the company's affairs would bear upon the degree of control that either Letterman or Vinick could have had. Because of the differences in the governance of Jefferson Bronze, it is erroneous to conflate responsibility during one era with responsibility during another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the factors involved in making the legal determination of responsibility are designed to focus attention on the central question of power. At no time did Vinick exercise any decision-making authority over which creditors Jefferson Bronze paid. Moreover, the government's evidence indicates that during the quarters in question, Letterman was in charge of the day-to-day operations. While it is true that more than one person can be responsible, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322472\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Harrington,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/322472/harold-e-harrington-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1312</span> </a></span>(noting that we hold responsible \"all with responsibility and authority to avoid the default which constitutes a violation of the statute\"), the government introduced no evidence indicating that during the relevant quarters, Vinick had any involvement in the day-to-day operations. Unless titular authority, being a shareholder, and having unexercised check-signing authority suffice to render a taxpayer responsible, no evidence supports holding Vinick as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is with these observations that we discuss the district court's legal conclusions about Vinick's responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the court found that Vinick was the corporation's treasurer.

The court's affording such weight to the check-signing factor without regard to whether check-signing authority was indicative of financial control is contrary to  6672 precedent.

In other words, whether the taxpayer had check-signing authority is relevant, but only insofar as it demonstrates financial control. The central inquiry is whether Vinick could have paid the taxes.

Even if it were appropriate to consider evidence from later quarters, the intervention of the Chapter 11 proceeding significantly changed this equation. Vinick's role, limited before the bankruptcy, was only slightly more active after it. The fact of the bankruptcy renders meaningless any comparison of these two periods.

And even in the case of the IRS settlement, it was the manager, not Vinick, who saw to the fulfillment of its terms. As the government noted in its brief, \"[a]fter these taxes were paid, there was no further delinquency during Ouellette's tenure.\" It is at this point that Letterman took over management, and Vinick's role, already slight, became minimal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court weighed in favor of responsibility Vinick's investment in the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> This finding does not fit within the typical litany of  6672 factors, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530302\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Thomsen,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/530302/edgar-b-thomsen-jr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, and is not relevant. While making a personal investment shows a level of involvement in the corporation, it does not indicate financial control, and determining whether Vinick has financial control is the aim of the  6672 inquiry. Because individual investors in corporations by definition use their personal assets to make their investment, the court's conclusion would render any investor in a closely held corporation a responsible person. Because this finding does not serve to limit the scope of who could be a responsible person, it has no bearing on the  6672 inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Vinick had authority to participate in the hiring and firing decisions at Jefferson Bronze. The court weighed this factor in favor of his being a responsible person and deemed it irrelevant that he never actually exercised that authority. As discussed above, the proper inquiry focuses on whether Vinick was involved in the daily management of the corporation, which routine hiring and firing of employees would indicate. The court did not find that Vinick routinely made personnel decisions. The only finding is that he had \"authority to participate\" in these decisions regarding only the general manager. Again, such authority is insufficient to render him a responsible person, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Godfrey,</span> <span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1576</span> </span>(noting that the taxpayer who \"participated in the hiring and firing of top corporate management\" was not a responsible person), because it does not demonstrate any significant control over the daily operations, especially the financial operations, of the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final finding of the district court is that Vinick had little involvement in the daily management of the corporation.

Indeed, it leaves us with the impression that the court relied almost entirely on Vinick's activities before and after the relevant quarters. Twice in Vinick I we emphasized that an inquiry into liability under  6672 should focus on the taxpayer's activities during the quarters in question, see Vinick <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197295\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197295/vinick-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">172</span> </a></span>(dismissing findings that Vinick engaged in managerial activities because they did not occur during the quarters in question), and we reiterate that principle here. When determining whether a taxpayer is a responsible person under  6672, the court should focus its inquiry on the quarters during which the taxes were unpaid.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Vinick's acting \"as treasurer\" is important because he was and is a Certified Public Accountant (\"CPA\"). The district court determined that his activities over the years of the company's existence in preparing the taxes, meeting with the IRS to negotiate the settlement in the early years, preparing the quarterly employment tax returns, and recommending that the withholding taxes be paid were activities within his capacity as treasurer. These activities are also those that a professional CPA would undertake to service his client. Indeed, Ellen Letterman, in her testimony, discussed her relationship with Vinick: \"Well, he was the CPA and I would give him all the money information he needed.\"</p>\n        <p>The government has suggested that Vinick's telling Letterman and the other managers to pay the taxes demonstrates his responsibility. Giving this advice is, after all, typically a part of the CPA's or attorney's function. But this advice coupled with an investment interest and a corporate title is insufficient to render that professional a responsible person because it does not demonstrate an ability to decide which creditors are paid. If anything, the rendering of advice would support a determination of willfulness, but that inquiry begins only after the determination of responsibility is made.

Denbo was a fifty percent shareholder, was the secretary-treasurer, was a director, did not manage the restaurant's daily operations, pledged personal assets for the corporation, arranged financing for the corporation, and had check-signing authority, which he never exercised.

When Letterman became Jefferson Bronze's manager, Vinick's role in the corporation substantially lessened. Moreover, to the extent Vinick, as Jefferson Bronze's accountant, was involved in the corporation's financial affairs, such involvement demonstrates only his willfulness because it shows he knew that on occasion the taxes had not been paid, but does not demonstrate his power to pay them, which a determination of responsibility requires.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent in this case, despite great respect for my brethren, because I believe the majority opinion is based upon significant errors of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

There is no reason to think the district court gave undue weight to this evidence. Also, Vinick may not be heard to complain on these grounds as he introduced much of the evidence in question and did not object to the evidence the government introduced, and so has waived this argument.

In the two Supreme Court cases and the First Circuit case cited by the majority in which there was departure from the clear error standard of review, the trial courts had committed obvious and important errors of law.

The record demonstrates that the district court understood both the nature of the inquiry into responsibility under  6672 and the factors that were relevant to this inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

The majority thrice errs. First, the majority opinion creates a new and erroneous legal rule: that evidence from tax quarters outside of the quarters at issue may not be considered. There is no support given for this new rule, and it is contrary to the law. Second, the majority opinion pays lip service to the rule that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer and then ignores that principle. Third, the majority departs from circuit precedent by moving from a flexible, multi-factored approach to a single focus of decisive weight. Instead of regarding the individual factors as elements contributing to an overall picture of Vinick's status, the majority opinion notes for each factor that weighs in favor of responsibility that such an individual factor, alone, is insufficient to create responsibility. But factors do not stand alone, and the district court correctly considered them in aggregate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

No court, to my knowledge, has ever before held that it is error for a trier of fact to admit evidence from quarters other than the quarters during which the taxes were not paid and then to consider what weight to give to this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court acted in accord with the Federal Rules of Evidence in admitting evidence that has a tendency to prove or disprove a material fact (and thus is relevant). See Fed. R. Evid. 401-402. Courts regularly admit evidence of prior or later transactions, occurrences, and statements to prove material elements of cases. In corporate veil-piercing cases, which are analogous to the present case, courts consider evidence from outside of the period at issue to determine whether the principal should be held personally liable to the corporation's creditors. In Crane v. Green &amp; Freedman Baking Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197738\"><a href=\"/opinion/197738/crane-v-green-freedman/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1998), a union benefits plan sought to pierce the veil of a corporation to recover unpaid sums from the corporation's principals. In reversing summary judgment for the defendants, this court found \"[p]articularly flagrant . . . the evidence of a personal vacation that the [principals] financed with corporate funds.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197738\"><a href=\"/opinion/197738/crane-v-green-freedman/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 24. </a></span>The court weighed the evidence of this vacation, which took place in January 1991, against the principals, even though the corporation failed to make payments to the benefits plan more than a year later, in April 1992.

This court has allowed admission of post-conspiracy evidence in a criminal conspiracy case to prove the existence of the conspiracy and the defendant's participation. See United States v. Fields, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520578\"><a href=\"/opinion/520578/united-states-v-michael-j-fields-united-states-of-america-v-james-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 197 (1st Cir. 1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in torts cases, evidence from before or after an accident has occurred is admissible for a number of purposes. See, e.g., Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685127\"><a href=\"/opinion/685127/41-fed-r-evid-serv-94-prodliabrep-cch-p-14121-william-and-rita/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-10 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that district court abused its discretion in refusing to admit evidence of modification of saw to prove feasibility in design defect case and holding that evidence of lack of prior accidents was properly admitted to prove absence of defect and lack of causation); Clausen v.

That he helped negotiate refinancing before the quarters in question suggests that he would have done so during the quarters in question. That he previously took steps to remedy the company's non-payment of taxes is also relevant to his authority and control during the pertinent quarters, as is the fact that he helped take the company into and through bankruptcy proceedings. Such evidence is relevant and, therefore, admissible. The trial court correctly concluded that it could admit, in this bench trial, evidence from outside the quarters in question, appropriately adjusting the weight such evidence would be given. There was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence from outside of the quarters in question serves an especially important role where, as here, taxes were not paid for a relatively short period. It could easily be the case that a person with significant authority and control in a company has no occasion to exercise that authority and control during a short period -- for example, when no major decisions need to be made and no significant events occur. Although this may be purely a matter of luck, the majority opinion renders it potentially impossible in this type of situation to find that a person who actually has the authority to pay the taxes is a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Vinick has waived the issue of the district court's consideration of evidence from outside the quarters in question. Where an appropriate, contemporaneous objection has been made, this court reviews admissions of evidence for abuse of discretion. See Varano v. Jabar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198721\"><a href=\"/opinion/198721/varano-v-jabor/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1999). While Vinick made a motion in limine requesting that the government's evidence be limited \"to the periods at Issue in the case at Bar,\" it was Vinick who introduced much of the evidence from outside of the quarters in question and thus waived the objection. See Gill v. Thomas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196766\"><a href=\"/opinion/196766/gill-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 541 (1st Cir. 1996). Moreover, Vinick never objected to the government's introduction of such evidence. Therefore, review of the district courts evidence determinations is for plain error. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198721\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Varano,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198721/varano-v-jabor/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668217\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Clausen,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/668217/eric-clausen-v-sea-3-inc-storage-tank-development-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick testified on direct examination regarding his involvement in hiring Ron Ouellette, signing Heritage Bank checks, the initial $165,000 financing, the $300,000 refinancing, and Jefferson Bronze's bankruptcy. Vinick also introduced evidence of Jefferson Bronze checks from before the quarters in question -- checks that lacked his signature -- to prove that he never exercised his check signing authority before the bankruptcy. On cross-examination, Vinick was questioned without objection regarding his negotiating a payment plan with the IRS during Ouellette's tenure. Vinick called two employees from Heritage Bank as witnesses and questioned them about the checks he had signed after the quarters in question. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Elliot Rothwell, a National Grand Bank employee, regarding Vinick's involvement in the $300,000 refinancing. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Ouellette regarding the frequency and amount of information Vinick received about Jefferson Bronze during Ouellette's tenure. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Richard Letterman as to Vinick's role in the original $165,000 financing and in the $300,000 refinancing. Vinick made no objection to the government's questioning of Letterman regarding Vinick's role in negotiating with the IRS during Ouellette's tenure, Vinick's involvement in hiring and firing decisions, and Vinick's involvement in the company's bankruptcy. Nor did Vinick object to the questioning of Letterman's wife regarding the frequency and amount of information Vinick received during her husband's tenure and the number of Heritage Bank checks Vinick signed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not an abuse of discretion, much less plain error, for the district court to admit this evidence, which clearly had a tendency to prove Vinick's authority and control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Burden of Proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the burden of proof, these cases usually involve a company that has withheld taxes from employees' wages and has then failed to pay the taxes to the government. In the meantime, the company has typically used the withheld funds to pay other creditors. Because the employees are held harmless and credited with the amounts withheld, the U.S. taxpayer often makes up the difference. In order to deter this behavior and lessen the costs imposed on other taxpayers, Congress has imposed a duty on persons whom the law deems responsible to collect, account for, and pay the taxes. Thus, the question is not who in the company ordinarily pays the taxes, but upon whom the law imposes a duty to see that the taxes are paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In keeping with the social policy objectives of  6672, the burden of proof is on a taxpayer whom the IRS believes is a responsible person to prove that he is not a responsible person.

The district court, not the majority, has it right.

Since the term \"responsible\" is far from self-defining, we have generally looked to indicia of responsibility such as \"the holding of corporate office, control over financial affairs, the authority to disburse corporate funds, stock ownership, and the ability to hire and fire employees.\" Thomsen v.

The majority's suggestion that control over the company's day-to-day affairs is central to the responsible person determination conflicts with circuit precedent. In Harrington, this court held there was \"no error in the court's charge [to the jury] that an individual need not be in day to day control of the administrative and financial aspects of the business in order to be [a] responsible person within the meaning of Section 6672.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322472\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Harrington,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/322472/harold-e-harrington-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1315</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion also skews normal appellate review, dismissing each factor pertaining to responsible person status by saying that that factor alone cannot support a responsible person determination. For example, the majority opinion states: \"titular authority is insufficient,\" \"not all shareholders are responsible persons,\" \"occasional involvement in business affairs is insufficient,\" \"[p]ossession of [check signing] authority . . . is not enough.\" But factors in combination can describe sufficient authority or control to render someone a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Record Support for the Determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us after trial, and we are required to draw all inferences from the evidence in favor of upholding the verdict. See United States v.

He was, throughout, its treasurer and one of only two directors. During the periods in question, there were only two corporate officers, Vinick and Letterman. When Letterman, Vinick, and Peter Mayer bought the company in 1981, Vinick agreed, both personally and in his capacity as treasurer, to reimburse the former owner for any taxes owed. Vinick signed the note and pledged his house as security for the original financing of $165,000 with the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\"). This gave him a strong incentive to stay involved in what the company was doing, and Vinick did keep abreast of the company's financial situation. He prepared all of the tax returns, including returns when the company lacked funds to pay the taxes. In order to prepare the taxes, he was given regular information about income and expenses. Indeed, throughout his relationship with the company he received more information than that. He was regularly given copies of the check registers and reviewed information on a weekly basis from those actually operating the company. His activities went beyond those of a mere accountant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not decide the issue, Vinick appears to have played a significant role in hiring and firing. In 1983, after the SBA complained to Vinick about Mayer, the first operations manager, Vinick and Letterman decided to remove Mayer. Vinick then asked Ouellette to run the company. In 1988, when Ouellette had problems, Letterman moved into the position, doing so with Vinick's tacit approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, when the company could not pay its withholding taxes, Vinick and Letterman (but not Ouellette, the company's day-to-day manager) went to see the IRS, and Vinick worked out a settlement agreement and payment schedule that Ouellette followed. This effort belies the majority opinion's suggestion that Vinick was merely a passive investor. The fact that Vinick did not keep the checkbook or write the checks did not stop him from exercising his authority to correct this problem with the IRS, and there is nothing to indicate that, having exercised this authority in 1985, he did not have such authority in 1989 and 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout, Vinick had check-signing authority. He chose not to exercise any such authority until the company went into bankruptcy in mid-1990. If he had regularly signed checks, the IRS would have had a stronger case. But that he chose not to sign checks until later does not negate his authority to do so during the quarters in question. Indeed, when he did exercise check-signing authority during the bankruptcy period, he even went to the bank to complain that it was letting checks go through without his signature on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quarters when the taxes were not paid were the last three quarters of 1989 and the first two quarters of 1990. The majority opinion asserts that there was a sea change in the operations of the company during those quarters. That is not so. It is true that Letterman took control of day-to-day operations of the company in 1988, and his wife acted as the bookkeeper. It is also true that Vinick then reduced his involvement in the day-to-day operations. But it is not true that he reduced his involvement in the financial affairs of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion is simply incorrect when it states that \"the record is undisputed that Vinick became less involved in the financial affairs of the corporation as Letterman's role increased.\" When Ouellette ran the day-to-day operations, Vinick discussed the company's financial condition with him \"on a monthly basis.\" In contrast, when Letterman ran the day-to-day operations, Vinick reviewed the company's financial condition at least weekly, and often more frequently. Letterman testified that he and Vinick had weekly conversations about how the company was doing, that Vinick saw the weekly receipts from customers, and that Mrs. Letterman \"brought him everything [they] did.\" Mrs. Letterman testified that she brought Vinick the company's income and expense information at least weekly, and more frequently at the end of the month. The judge was entitled to accept the Lettermans' testimony over Vinick's contradictory testimony that he got such information at most once a month. In fact, Richard Letterman testified that Vinick was privy to all information about what was happening at all times. Nor did Vinick's other financial activities lessen. Just as before, Vinick prepared the tax returns and the profit and loss statements. Just as before, he refused to sign the returns and told others to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When there were major decisions to be made, Vinick made them together with Letterman. The two of them decided in mid-July of 1990 that the company had to be put into bankruptcy. Vinick went to the bankruptcy court, and he started signing company checks that he had always had the authority to sign. At trial, Vinick attempted to minimize his role in the running of the company at this stage, but his testimony was contradicted by others. For example, Vinick claimed he signed the vast majority of checks only after they had been negotiated with only Letterman's signature. Two bank officials and Letterman's wife all said he signed most checks before negotiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it is what happened during and around the quarters in question that reinforces that the district court's conclusion was not error. The district court quite properly weighed in Vinick's favor the fact that he did not run the company day-to-day. But it is also true that when the company ran into financial problems, Vinick played a considerable role. In May of 1988, the company secured a $300,000 loan from National Grand Bank, refinancing its earlier $165,000 loan and obtaining additional operating capital. Vinick and Letterman met with Eliot Rothwell, a bank official, two or three times to secure the loan. Rothwell found Vinick to be familiar with the company's financial condition. Vinick signed the loan application and then signed the note both in his individual and corporate capacities. Vinick and Letterman each personally guaranteed the loan, and there is evidence that each pledged his home. The bank encouraged them to open an account there for the company; Vinick and Letterman were the signatories. Vinick said there was a separate $300,000 loan from Bank of New England that was made personally to him and to Letterman, that the money was put into the company, and that he gave a mortgage on his home for this loan. In any event, if the obligations to National Grand Bank were not met, Vinick was personally in jeopardy. In fact, Vinick's interest in being involved in the company's financial affairs had now become even greater than it was originally, as the amount for which he was personally liable had almost doubled. This helps explain his weekly review of the company's finances during Letterman's tenure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1989, just before it stopped paying its taxes, the company became delinquent on the National Grand Bank loan. Vinick and Letterman then met several times with Rothwell to try to work out the problem. Again, Rothwell found Vinick knowledgeable about the company's financial affairs. Vinick was well aware during this period that the company was not paying the taxes withheld from employees. Vinick did not do what he had done in 1985, which was to try to work out matters with the IRS and negotiate a plan to pay the taxes owed. In essence, it is fair to infer that he and Letterman together decided to treat the IRS as a second-best creditor and put their efforts and the company's payments toward the bank, to which they had immediate personal liability. But that is not what the law permits. See Donelan <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524670\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Phelps,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/524670/donelan-phelps-company-inc-donelan-phelps-company-a-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1377</span></a></span>. The record amply supports a finding that Vinick was a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case, as the majority would have it, of a passive investor unfairly being saddled with  6672 liability. Such investors do need protection, a fact that was amply demonstrated by the government's aggressive and overreaching posture at oral argument. The evidence in this case, however, showed that Vinick was not merely a passive investor. On the evidence presented, Vinick could have been, and was, deemed a responsible person. As such he had a duty to ensure that the taxes were paid. Given the degree of his involvement and control over financial and other matters in the company, Vinick could not avoid that duty by refusing to write checks to the IRS that he had the authority to write, by refusing to sign tax returns that he had the authority to sign, and by failing to meet with the IRS when he had the authority to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Disposition on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the majority opinion were correct in asserting that the district court had a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles, then the proper disposition would be to remand the case to the district court, not to decide the case ourselves. Where the evidence \"does not compel a ruling for either side,\" the proper course is to remand the case to the trial court. TEC Eng. Corp. v. Budget Molders Supply, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196742\"><a href=\"/opinion/196742/tec-engineering-v-budget-molders/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir. 1996). It cannot be said that the record compels a finding that Vinick was not a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But for his dissembling at trial, there is a temptation to feel sorry for Vinick. His investment in this small company has led to a nightmare for him. Yet, it was not his investment alone that led to his being a responsible person, nor was it merely his title as treasurer. Crediting the entire record, there was no error in the trial judge's decision, and I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, Brown Daltas does not state that a reviewing court should apply de novo review when a trial court's factual finding has been affected by legal error. The language is more modest, noting that in this situation a \"reviewing court is not bound by the clearly erroneous standard\" and that the trial court's findings should be \"accorded diminished respect on appeal.\" Brown <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195919\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Daltas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195919/brown-daltas-v-northbrook-excess/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">36</span> </a></span>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The majority's departure from the clear error standard will cause problems in a related area: the taxpayer's right to a jury trial.

We have applied clear error review to the responsible person determination in both bench and jury trials.</p>\n        <p>Other circuits have addressed the question and have found that the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial does exist in this situation.
