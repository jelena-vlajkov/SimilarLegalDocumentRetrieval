This appeal grows out of a\n\nsecond superseding indictment returned in New Hampshire on May\n\n1, 1997, charging six defendants with a variety of federal\n\noffenses related to a string of bank and armored car robberies\n\nthat took place between 1990 and 1996.                   The trial began on\n\nSeptember 16, 1997, one defendant pled guilty during trial, and\n\nthe remaining five defendants completed the three-month trial,\n\nwere   convicted      and    are   appellants     in   this    court:   they   are\n\nAnthony Shea, Stephen Burke, Matthew McDonald, Patrick McGonagle\n\nand Michael O'Halloran.\n\n           The evidence presented at trial included a wealth of\n\nexhibits   as    well   as    testimony      by   over   150   witnesses.       In\n\nsubstance, the evidence showed that Shea, McDonald and one Dick\n\nDonovan had carried out a series of bank robberies beginning in\n\n1990; that by 1992 Stephen Burke and O'Halloran had joined the\n\nscheme, together with Burke's brother John (who pled guilty at\n\ntrial).    From 1992 onward, the group concentrated on armored car\n\nrobberies (with an occasional bank robbery) in the Northeast and\n\nFlorida.        The   most    notorious      incident    was    a   Hudson,    New\n\nHampshire, armored car robbery in August 1994, in which both\n\narmored car drivers were kidnaped and executed.\n\n           The government's case was substantially aided by the\n\ntestimony of Steven Connolly, who was a longtime friend of two\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fof the defendants and an acquaintance to the others.                                He had\n\nbeen    recruited       into   the    scheme     in    March    1994      and   provided\n\ntestimony, including descriptions of defendants' conduct in\n\nvarious of the offenses, their techniques, and admissions made\n\nby   individual         defendants.         A    number    of       other    government\n\nwitnesses,       some     unwilling,        also       described      admissions          by\n\nindividual defendants to various of the robberies.\n\n            The government charged two armored car robberies--those\n\nthat had occurred in New Hampshire--as substantive offenses, and\n\nit offered proof of a number of other bank or armored car\n\nrobberies as predicate acts or evidence to support the charges\n\nthat    some     or     all    of    the   defendants       were         engaged     in    a\n\nracketeering          enterprise      under      the    RICO    statute,        a     RICO\n\nconspiracy, conspiracy to rob banks, carjacking, and several\n\ndifferent       kinds    of    firearms     offenses.          18    U.S.C.     §§    371,\n\n922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), 924(c), 1951, 1962(c)-(d), 2113(d), 2119\n\n(1994).     The two New Hampshire robberies, including the August\n\n1994 Hudson robbery and another that occurred in Seabrook in May\n\n1993, were the subject of extensive evidence.\n\n            About two months into the trial, the district court\n\n(with     the    government's         agreement)        granted      a    judgment        of\n\nacquittal on several counts and one racketeering act as to\n\ncertain of the defendants and one racketeering act as to all of\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fthe   defendants.        The   remaining    counts,     minus   particular\n\nracketeering acts and overt acts as to which no evidence was\n\npresented,     were    eventually   submitted    to    the   jury   under   a\n\nredacted indictment now containing 14 counts and on December 22,\n\n1997, the jury convicted all five defendants on all submitted\n\ncharges, save that it acquitted McGonagle of carjacking in\n\nrelation to the Hudson robbery.\n\n          All five of the defendants were convicted of conspiracy\n\nto commit armed robberies and of committing and conspiring to\n\ncommit   the   Hudson    robbery.     All   of   the   defendants    except\n\nMcGonagle were convicted of operating a racketeering enterprise,\n\nengaging in a racketeering conspiracy, carjacking in connection\n\nwith the Hudson robbery, and of various firearms offenses.\n\nShea, Burke and O'Halloran were also convicted of committing and\n\nconspiring to commit the Seabrook armored car robbery.\n\n          On May 8, 1998, the court imposed sentences on each of\n\nthe defendants.       Each was sentenced to life imprisonment, except\n\nfor McGonagle, who was sentenced to 360 months.              The defendants\n\nhave now appealed, presenting a series of claims concerning\n\nsufficiency of evidence as to certain counts, pretrial and trial\n\nrulings, the composition of the jury and the instructions given\n\nto it, and sentencing and other post-trial matters.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f         Sufficiency.    On several claims, individual defendants\n\nsay that the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to\n\nconvict, and that their motions for a judgment of acquittal\n\nshould have been granted.      Review of such claims is de novo,\n\nUnited States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1495 (1st Cir. 1997), and\n\nthe evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution.    United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).     By this standard, the evidence in each case was\n\nadequate on the contested counts (and on many others it was\n\noverwhelming).\n\n         McGonagle    does   not   contest   that   the   evidence   was\n\nsufficient to convict him of bank robbery and conspiracy to\n\ncommit the Hudson robbery, but he says that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to tie him to a broader conspiracy to commit a\n\nseries of armed robberies--a crime of which all defendants were\n\nconvicted.    However, Connolly testified that Shea had identified\n\nMcGonagle as one of the conspirators in the broader conspiracy\n\nand, in addition to the ample evidence of McGonagle's role in\n\nthe Hudson robbery, there is evidence that linked him to a\n\nseparate armored car robbery by the conspirators almost eight\n\nmonths before the Hudson robbery.        At least two witnesses, in\n\naddition to Connolly, testified to McGonagle's role.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            McDonald, joined by O'Halloran and Burke, says that the\n\ngovernment        failed   to   prove   the   existence   of   a     single\n\nracketeering enterprise, racketeering conspiracy, or a broad\n\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery; at best, he contends, the\n\njury could only have found smaller enterprises or conspiracies\n\nwith a changing cast of conspirators.           No magic formula exists\n\nfor determining when a set of jointly committed crimes adds up\n\nto an overarching conspiracy or enterprise; the courts tend to\n\nlook for common goal, overlap among participants, and a measure\n\nof interdependence, United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 695\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 273 (1999); and a general\n\nscheme may exist \"notwithstanding variations in personnel and\n\ntheir roles\" over time.         United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d\n\n664, 668 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            Here, the evidence supported, and the jury necessarily\n\nfound, that while the cast of characters changed over time,\n\nthere was nevertheless one overarching conspiracy.                 Shea was\n\ninvolved from the beginning, and he and Burke were involved in\n\nthe largest number of crimes.            There was also evidence that\n\nMcDonald was involved in the conspiracy from its inception and\n\nthat   he   and    O'Halloran    were   substantially   involved    in   the\n\noverarching racketeering conspiracy and enterprise and a broad\n\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery.           Despite an interruption in\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fMcDonald's role caused by his temporary imprisonment on a parole\n\nviolation, and O'Halloran's somewhat late arrival in the scheme,\n\nenough evidence existed of a common and continuing aim, similar\n\nmethods      of     operation,       continuity      in      personnel,     and\n\ninterdependence to permit the court to send the separate counts\n\nto the jury and the jury to find a RICO enterprise, a RICO\n\nconspiracy, and a broad conspiracy to rob banks and armored\n\ncars.\n\n             McDonald was convicted of three different gun charges\n\n(felon-in-possession,         drug   user-in-possession,        and   use   and\n\npossession     during    a   violent    crime)    relating    to   the    Hudson\n\narmored car robbery.         He says that the evidence was insufficient\n\non   these     counts.        However,        constructive    possession     is\n\nsufficient.       United States v. Wight, 968 F.2d 1393, 1397-98 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).       Here the evidence showed that the defendants as a\n\ngroup were regularly armed.            In addition, a government witness\n\ntestified that two days before the Hudson robbery, McDonald said\n\nthat he was going to take part in it and displayed a handgun at\n\nthe same time; and at least six weapons were used in the Hudson\n\nrobbery.\n\n             O'Halloran, who was convicted of firearms charges in\n\nconnection with both the Hudson and Seabrook robberies, makes a\n\nsimilar claim that the evidence was insufficient.                  Again, the\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconstructive possession theory was available to the government\n\nand was supported by the evidence.                   In addition, there was\n\ntestimony by government witnesses to support the view that\n\nO'Halloran      had   himself      possessed       weapons   in   both    of    the\n\nrobberies.       The lower court did not err in sending the firearm\n\ncounts to the jury.\n\n           Specific evidence.             We turn next to objections to\n\nparticular pieces of evidence, starting with Shea's objection to\n\nthe use at trial of a number of items seized in a January 1990\n\nsearch    of    his   Charlestown     residence       (including       weapons,    a\n\nbulletproof vest, camouflage clothing, and masks).                     The search\n\nwas based on a warrant secured through an affidavit given by a\n\nfederal    agent;     its   gist    was    information       furnished     by     an\n\ninformant, whose prior information had been reliable, that on\n\nthree occasions over the six weeks prior to the affidavit the\n\ninformant had seen a sawed-off shotgun at the residence where\n\nShea was present.           The affiant also said that Shea had no\n\nrequired       federal   registration        for    possessing     a    sawed-off\n\nshotgun.\n\n           The district court relied on the good faith exception\n\nto the exclusionary rule, United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897,\n\n922-25 (1984), in finding that reliance on the warrant was\n\nobjectively reasonable, even if the application was defective.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fWe review probable cause determinations             de novo, Ornelas v.\n\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996), and the same standard\n\napplies to Leon determinations, United States v. Procopio, 88\n\nF.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1046 (1996).\n\nShea says that there is a lack of detailed information about the\n\ncircumstances      in   which   the   informant   saw   the   shotgun    and,\n\nfurther, that there is no explicit basis for the assertion in\n\nthe affidavit that Shea resided at the address in question.\n\n             The reliability of the informant was amply established\n\nby the described record of prior assists, and we see no reason\n\nin   these   circumstances      why   the    informant's   straightforward\n\ndescription of seeing the shotgun in the apartment in Shea's\n\npresence     on   three   different    recent   occasions     needed    to   be\n\nembellished by further detail.           Admittedly, the affidavit does\n\nnot make clear how the informant (or the affiant) knew that Shea\n\nresided at the apartment, which might or might not be viewed as\n\nthe necessary link in the chain.             To the extent it is such a\n\nlink, the failure to spell out the basis for associating Shea\n\nwith the address is a minor error (and not infrequently so,\n\nProcopio, 88 F.3d at 28); given that the informant said he had\n\nseen Shea on the premises on three occasions, the gap in proof\n\nis sufficiently small, if a gap there is, that Leon                     amply\n\napplies.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f             Shea also challenges the use of evidence derived from\n\na search of his vehicle on August 11, 1995, during Shea's\n\nattempted      but   aborted        robbery    of    a    bank      in    Wakefield,\n\nMassachusetts--which       Shea      carried    out      independently        of    the\n\nenterprise and conspiracies charged in this case.                        The evidence\n\nseized included weapons and other paraphernalia.                           Shea also\n\nobjects to fragments of testimony, elicited primarily by co-\n\ndefendants, suggesting Shea's connection with the Wakefield\n\nincident.      Shea says that the cumulative effect was to retry him\n\nfor the Wakefield attempted robbery after he had already been\n\nconvicted of it in a separate trial, see United States v. Shea,\n\n150 F.3d 44 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1030 (1998), and\n\nthat this violated his constitutional rights (e.g., under the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause).\n\n             Evidence of \"other crimes\" relevant to proving the\n\ncrime charged is not subject to the double jeopardy or other\n\nconstitutional objections made by Shea, United States v. Felix,\n\n503   U.S.    378,   386-87     &   n.3   (1992),     nor      is   it    subject    to\n\nlimitations on use of character evidence, if it is offered for\n\nsome purpose other than to prove character.                    See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b).      Here, the weapons seized from Shea during the Wakefield\n\nattempt      were    directly       relevant    to       the   racketeering         and\n\nconspiracy charges because the evidence showed that they were\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fpreviously used by Shea and Burke in a July 28, 1995, bank\n\nrobbery      at   Fall   River,     Massachusetts,    which   is   one    of   the\n\npredicate acts in the racketeering count charged in the present\n\ncase.\n\n              It is less clear how the government justified its\n\nintroduction of other evidence seized from Shea's car (e.g., a\n\nwalkie-talkie and police scanners) apparently not linked to a\n\ncharged act or offense (the government's brief is suspiciously\n\nsilent on this point).            But Shea's objections at trial seemingly\n\ndid    not    pinpoint      the    relevance     objection,   Fed.   R.    Evid.\n\n103(a)(1), and in any event the evidence, even if improperly\n\nadmitted, was harmless in light of the guns and the other\n\nsubstantial evidence offered against Shea.              See United States v.\n\nBenavente Gomez, 921 F.2d 378, 386 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              A few brief testimonial references to Shea's connection\n\nto the Wakefield incident were elicited at trial, primarily by\n\nco-defendants seeking to support their multiple conspiracies\n\ndefense (by showing that Shea engaged in robberies on his own or\n\nwith    other     persons    who    were   not   defendants   in   this   case).\n\nHowever, these references were fleeting, and the district judge,\n\nwho had sought to restrict references to Wakefield, did not err\n\nin refusing to grant a mistrial on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            Shea also claims error in the district court's refusal\n\nto suppress statements made by Shea, incriminating himself in\n\nthe Hudson robbery, to one James Ferguson, with whom Shea was\n\nincarcerated in 1995 in connection with the Wakefield robbery.\n\nAt that time, Ferguson was a government informant wearing a\n\nlistening        device and, because Shea was then represented by\n\ncounsel on the Wakefield robbery, he says that the eliciting of\n\nincriminating statements as to the Hudson robbery violated his\n\nSixth   Amendment        right    to        counsel     during   the   custodial\n\ninterrogation.\n\n            The government's answer, which is adequate, is that at\n\nthe time the statements were obtained, Shea had not been charged\n\nwith the Hudson robbery and his right to counsel with respect to\n\nthat robbery had not yet \"attached.\"                  See McNeil v. Wisconsin,\n\n501 U.S.    171, 175-76 (1991); United States v. LaBare, 191 F.3d\n\n60, 64 (1st Cir. 1999).          This argument is an accepted counter to\n\nsuch claims, United States v. Nocella, 849 F.2d 33, 36-38 (1st\n\nCir. 1988), and there is no indication that the Supreme Court\n\ncontemplates      an   expansion       of    the   Sixth   Amendment   right   to\n\ncounsel.\n\n            In    a    separate    argument,          McDonald   challenges    the\n\ndistrict court's refusal to suppress DNA evidence that derived\n\nfrom blood, saliva and hair samples taken from him pursuant to\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fa December 29, 1994 warrant.        The DNA was matched with DNA from\n\nsaliva left at the scene of a February 1992 robbery in Newton,\n\nMassachusetts, which was one of the racketeering acts charged in\n\nthe indictment.     McDonald says that the affidavit supporting the\n\nwarrant    application    failed   to    establish   probable       cause   and\n\nrested on material misrepresentations.\n\n           Aside from the alleged misrepresentations, the evidence\n\ndescribed in the warrant was more than sufficient to establish\n\nprobable cause to believe that McDonald was involved in the\n\nrobbery.     The story as to the alleged misrepresentation is\n\ncomplicated:      the affidavit relied on a supposed match between\n\na fiber found on McDonald's clothing and the fibers from the\n\ncarpet of one of the vehicles used in the Hudson robbery.\n\nMcDonald says the match was overstated or utterly irrelevant.\n\nBut   we   need   not    resolve   the     issue,   since     the   remaining\n\nconnections between McDonald and the crime were ample to support\n\nthe affidavit without regard to the fiber evidence.                 Franks v.\n\nDelaware, 438 U.S. 154, 171-72 (1978).\n\n           Burke makes an argument, adopted by McDonald, Shea, and\n\nO'Halloran,    that     the   district   court   erred   in    permitting     a\n\ngovernment expert (Dr. Harold Deadman) to testify as to matches\n\nbetween DNA from blood samples of Burke and McDonald and several\n\npieces of physical evidence found at different crime scenes.\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fThe attack on the Deadman testimony rested on this expert's\n\nfailure to note one faint allele dot in a sample of sweat taken\n\nfrom a baseball cap found in a getaway vehicle, the DNA of which\n\nDr. Deadman matched to Burke's blood sample.    This, in turn, led\n\nto an arguable contradiction in Deadman's initial explanation of\n\nhis basis for the match, although Dr. Deadman then provided a\n\ndefense of his position at trial.1\n\n         The district court conducted a lengthy hearing on\n\nadmissibility of the DNA evidence under Daubert v. Merrell Dow\n\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 592 (1993), and held that\n\nany flaws in Dr. Deadman's application of an otherwise reliable\n\nmethodology   went   to   weight   and   credibility   and   not   to\n\nadmissibility.   Most circuits that have spoken have agreed with\n\nthis approach, see, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 56 F.3d 947,\n\n\n    1 At the pre-trial Daubert hearing, Dr. Deadman testified\nthat the DNA testing he performed on the sweat from the cap\nmatched Stephen Burke's blood sample. His opinion was based on\nhis belief that only a \"B\" allele dot was present in the sweat\nalong with his knowledge that Burke's blood sample was typed as\na \"BB.\" On cross-examination, he indicated that, as a general\nmatter, he would not usually conclude that a match was made if\na visible weak dot of a different type was mixed in. Subsequent\nto this testimony, an expert for the defense, Dr. Randell Libby,\nnoted the presence of a faint \"A\" allele dot that Dr. Deadman\nhad not previously noticed, and argued that such a mixture\nprevented a conclusion of a match to an individual typed as\n\"BB.\" Dr. Deadman acknowledged the existence of the weak \"A\"\nallele dot and his failure initially to identify it.      But he\nstated that the presence of a mixture would not--in light of the\nfaint intensity of the \"A\" allele dot--alter his conclusion of\na match with Stephen Burke's DNA.\n\n                               -18-\n\f952-53   (8th      Cir.   1995),    relying       on   the    view    that     \"cross-\n\nexamination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful\n\ninstruction on the burden of proof\" is the proper challenge to\n\n\"shaky but admissible evidence.\"             Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596.               The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\nDeadman evidence.         United States v. Lowe, 145 F.3d 45, 50-51\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 918 (1998).\n\n             A final dispute as to tangible evidence concerns a\n\nlatent thumb print matching defendant Burke that was allegedly\n\nlifted from a truck leased by McGonagle and used in the Hudson\n\nincident.     The print was dusted but not lifted during the first\n\ninspection of the truck (it was concealed because a door was\n\nopen), and Burke argued at trial that the print later lifted\n\ncame   from    a    different      truck    and    that      the    government,       by\n\nreturning the truck to the owner after its collection of prints\n\nwas complete, had prevented him from proving this definitively.\n\n             Although     Burke     calls     the      return       of   the    truck\n\n\"spoliation,\" the government explained both the delay in lifting\n\nthe print and the return of the truck, and there is no basis for\n\nimputing bad faith to the government--a usual precondition to a\n\nspoliation claim in \"missing evidence\" cases.                      United States v.\n\nFemia,   9    F.3d    990,   994    (1st     Cir.      1993).        There     may   be\n\nextraordinary cases where the government's loss of evidence\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\frequires some remedy despite good faith, cf. United States v.\n\nAlston, 112 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 999\n\n(1997), but police do not usually preserve intact a site from\n\nwhich prints are lifted and Burke was free to argue his wrong\n\ntruck theory based on photographs that were available.\n\n             Hearsay.      At trial, various friends or associates of\n\nthe    defendants        testified     to    incriminating       out-of-court\n\nstatements made by individual defendants; these were, of course,\n\nadmissions as to the makers, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), but\n\nhearsay as to the other defendants unless--as the district court\n\nheld--they were admissible against the other defendants as co-\n\nconspirator statements, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), or under the\n\nexception for statements against penal interest, Fed. R. Evid.\n\n804(b)(3).     Appellants claim that the rule-based preconditions\n\nwere   not   met    or   that   the   Confrontation    Clause    provided      an\n\nindependent basis for limiting admissibility.\n\n             Only   Shea    argues    on    appeal   that    certain    of    the\n\nstatements admitted were not in furtherance of the conspiracy\n\nand therefore not within the co-conspirator exception.                        The\n\nstatements in question, which we need not recite, were seemingly\n\nmade   for   such    purposes    as   recruiting     new    members    into   the\n\nconspiracy or passing information between conspirators.                       The\n\ndistrict court did not commit clear error,                  United States v.\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fPatterson, 644 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1981), in finding that\n\nthese statements were, more probably than not, made during and\n\nin   furtherance   of    the   conspiracy.        United      States      v.\n\nPetrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).\n\n          Similarly, the statements challenged by Shea, McDonald,\n\nMcGonagle, and O'Halloran that were admitted as against their\n\npenal interest fell within that rule or at least the district\n\ncourt committed no error in so finding under then-existing\n\nprecedent.   See Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 599-\n\n601 (1994); United States v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1296 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1021 (1997).            The more important\n\nquestion is whether anything is altered by the Supreme Court’s\n\nsubsequent   decision   in   Lilly   v.   Virginia,    119   S.   Ct.   1887\n\n(1999).   Lilly disallowed the out-of-court statement of the\n\ndefendant’s brother who, under police questioning, conceded that\n\nhe was involved in a shooting but identified the defendant as\n\nthe triggerman; the court reasoned that the statement did not\n\nfall within a \"firmly rooted\" exception to the hearsay rule and\n\nfailed under the Confrontation Clause.         Id. at 1899.\n\n          Lilly’s main concern was with statements in which, as\n\nis common in police-station confessions, the declarant admits\n\nonly what the authorities are already capable of proving against\n\nhim and seeks to shift the principal blame to another (against\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fwhom the prosecutor then offers the statement at trial).                 119 S.\n\nCt. at 1901.    While Lilly’s full reach may be unclear--there was\n\nno single \"majority\" opinion--it does not in our view affect the\n\nadmissibility    of    the    statements   at   issue    here:     all   those\n\nidentified in this case were made to friends or companions, not\n\nto the police, and were not of the \"blame shifting\" variety.\n\nBarone, 114 F.3d at 1302.\n\n          The district court also admitted these statements on\n\nthe alternative ground (so far as the Confrontation Clause is\n\nconcerned) that they were attended by \"particularized guarantees\n\nof trustworthiness.\"         Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980).\n\nThe district judge referred specifically to Roberts and the\n\nassessment required by Barone to determine whether a statement\n\nfalls within a firmly-rooted exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nThus, even if Lilly is more far reaching than we think likely,\n\nit would not affect the outcome here.\n\n          Miscellany.           There     remain    various      other   trial\n\nobjections which we take largely in chronological order.                  Four\n\nof the defendants argue that the jury-selection process was\n\nflawed because the district court failed to empty and refill the\n\nmaster jury wheel on a timely basis.               The Jury Selection and\n\nService Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. § 1861 et seq. (1994), requires\n\nthat   \"emptying      and    refilling\"    be   done    periodically,     \"the\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\finterval   for   which   shall   not   exceed   four   years.\"   Id.   §\n\n1863(b)(4).      The aim is to ensure that the jury comes from a\n\n\"fair cross section of the community\" determined by reasonably\n\nrecent data.     Id. § 1861.\n\n           In the New Hampshire jury selection plan, new names are\n\ncollected every four years following a general election from the\n\nlatest New Hampshire voter registration lists and from current\n\ndriver license records; but to provide time to collect and\n\norganize, the plan provides for emptying and refilling every\n\nfour years \"within nine months\" following the general election\n\nin November.     In this case, the chronology is as follows:\n\n           •June 16, 1993: list compiled based on 1992\n           elections\n\n           •August 1, 1993: list put into effect\n\n           •July 24, 1997: list used to mail summonses\n           to jurors for defendants’ jury\n\n           The defendants say that the list used to select their\n\njury had existed for more than four years prior to the date that\n\nit was used to select their jury (June 16, 1993 to July 24,\n\n1997) and so violated the statute’s four-year provision.           The\n\ndistrict court has read the statute’s four year provision to\n\nrequire that the wheel be emptied and refilled within four\n\nyears, and that the list used for defendants’ jury had been used\n\nfor less than four years (August 1, 1993 to July 24, 1997).        The\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fissue is what the statute means, an issue as to which review is\n\nde novo.   United States v. Royal, 174 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           The district court’s reading is literally accurate--the\n\nnames in the wheel had not been used for more than four years--\n\nbut it does not meet a related concern, namely, that the data\n\nitself be reasonably fresh when put into use.         The jury in this\n\ncase was selected based on data more than four years old (the\n\nNovember 1992 election lists).            But the New Hampshire plan\n\nreasonably answers this concern by requiring that the wheel be\n\nrefilled within nine months after the general election, and the\n\nstatute    does   not   preclude   a   reasonable   delay   between   the\n\ncollection of the data and its insertion into the wheel.\n\n           Defendants also assert that the \"random\" selection\n\nrequirement of the statute was frustrated because the use of\n\ndata more than four years old necessarily reduced the number of\n\nboth younger jurors and jurors who had recently relocated to New\n\nHampshire.    But for sound practical reasons the Supreme Court\n\nhas essentially rejected the \"young persons\" claim, Hamling v.\n\nUnited States, 418 U.S. 87, 137-38 (1974); and while later data\n\nmight include more recent immigrants to New Hampshire, there is\n\nnothing in the circumstances of this case to show that recent\n\nimmigrants to the state were the kind of distinctive group whose\n\nslightly reduced representation comprised a violation of the\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fstatute or the Sixth Amendment.       Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S.\n\n357, 364 (1979).\n\n         The next jury selection issue is Shea’s objection, now\n\njoined by other defendants, that one of the jurors should have\n\nbeen dismissed, primarily because she expressed fear of the\n\ndefendants during a pair of voir dires conducted after jury\n\nselection.   Removal of a juror for cause is normally a fact-\n\nsensitive matter on which the district judge’s on-the-scene\n\njudgment deserves great weight.   See Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d\n\n44, 50 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109\n\nF.3d 64, 69 (1st Cir. 1997).      We have reviewed the voir dire\n\ntranscripts and, without recounting the facts in detail, are\n\nsatisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\nCf. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109 F.3d at 69-70.\n\n         Finally, defendants' claim that the district court\n\npersonnel acted outside their authority in dismissing those\n\npotential jurors who were acquainted with counsel in this case\n\nis without merit.   So long as the district court exercises\n\ngeneral oversight, the delegation of excusal tasks to court\n\npersonnel has long been approved of and encouraged.    See United\n\nStates v. Candelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d 19, 31 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited States v. Maskeny, 609 F.2d 183, 193-94 (5th Cir. 1980);\n\nUnited States v. Marrapese, 610 F. Supp. 991, 1000-01 (D.R.I.\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f1985).    The record shows that the trial judge approved of the\n\ncourt personnel excusing jurors on this basis; accordingly,\n\nthere was no violation of the Act.\n\n            The defendants’ next claim of error relates to the\n\nprosecutor’s opening statement.      In outlining the evidence, the\n\nprosecutor began not chronologically but with the most dramatic\n\nincident, the Hudson robbery and murder of the guards; his\n\ndescription was somewhat emotional; and, in the district judge’s\n\nview, the prosecutor did not make it sufficiently clear (despite\n\nthe court's admonitions) that the prosecutor's description of\n\nvarious events was a preview of intended evidence rather than an\n\nexpression of personal belief.      Finding that the latter offense\n\nwas not willful, the district court limited its response to\n\nstrong cautionary instructions.\n\n            O’Halloran, joined by other defendants, says that the\n\ndistrict court should, as requested at the time, have granted a\n\nmistrial based on the opening statement.        However, the district\n\ncourt’s     finding   on   willfulness   is   not   clear   error,   the\n\ncautionary instructions were repeated and emphatic, and the\n\ndistrict judge was best placed to assess the overall effect on\n\nthe jury.     The discretion accorded a judge on whether to grant\n\na motion for mistrial is very broad and it was not abused here.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fSee United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994),\n\ncert. denied, 513 U.S. 1119 (1995).\n\n           During trial, counsel for three of the defendants--\n\nBurke, O’Halloran and McDonald--sought on several occasions to\n\ncross-    examine    government       witnesses   to     show    that     Shea    had\n\nengaged    in    robberies     independently      of   the      others.       Their\n\nasserted purpose was to show that the evidence made out at best\n\nmultiple    conspiracies       for    different    robberies        and   not     the\n\noverarching conspiracy and enterprise charged in the indictment.\n\nIn particular, these defendants sought to show that Shea had\n\nbeen involved in and convicted for the robbery at Wakefield, a\n\ncrime not involving the other defendants.\n\n           The      district    court    refused       to    allow      the   other\n\ndefendants to prove that Shea was arrested and convicted of the\n\nWakefield robbery; seemingly, the court thought the evidence of\n\nlittle relevance to the multiple-conspiracy defense but highly\n\nprejudicial to Shea.         On appeal, the three defendants complain\n\nthat their right to cross-examine was unduly restricted.                      In the\n\nalternative,      they   say   that    the    district      court    should      have\n\ngranted them a severance from Shea, which they requested, to\n\npermit them to develop this defense without prejudicing Shea.\n\n           The government says that the defendants now raising the\n\nclaim did not press the multiple conspiracy argument before the\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fjury and have therefore waived their present claims, but this is\n\nnot fully persuasive:       the defendants might have argued the\n\npoint to the jury if they had been allowed to develop the\n\nevidence.    A better response, also offered by the government, is\n\nthat they had no right to insist on cross-examining beyond the\n\nscope of the direct examination or beyond matters affecting\n\ncredibility, Fed. R. Evid. 611(b); United States v. McLaughlin,\n\n957 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1992), but (among other possible\n\nreplies) this would leave the denial of the severance request to\n\nbe explained.\n\n            In our view, showing that Shea was convicted for a\n\nseparate robbery in the same time frame had some relevance to\n\nthe defense but not much; Shea’s sideline ventures did not\n\nprevent him from also engaging in a broad conspiracy with the\n\ndefendants, and proof of the latter turned primarily on how the\n\njury   assessed   the   relationship    of   the   crimes   in   which   the\n\ndefendants participated.      We are thus dealing with one primary\n\nepisode that is marginal as to the three defendants’ defense but\n\nhighly prejudicial as to Shea.\n\n            The right of cross-examination is important but can be\n\nreasonably limited for all kinds of reasons.           United States v.\n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849\n\n(1990).     Similarly, severance is not an automatic entitlement\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fmerely because it would give the defendant seeking it a marginal\n\nadvantage--at the cost of multiple trials.             Zafiro v. United\n\nStates,   506   U.S.   534,   539   (1993).    Here,   the   evidence   in\n\nquestion was of very limited use and the reasons for restricting\n\ncross-examination and refusing severance were potent.            Tested by\n\nthe abuse of discretion standard that applies in both instances,\n\nUnited States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(severance), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079 (1992); Boylan, 898\n\nF.2d at 254 (cross-examination), the district court is easily\n\nsustained.\n\n          Finally, two of the defendants say that they were\n\ndenied proper counsel.        The first of these claims arises out of\n\nMcDonald’s request, made approximately 30 days before trial, for\n\na new appointed counsel.        Most of the reasons given by McDonald\n\nfor his request are too slight to require mention; but one rises\n\nsomewhat above this level:        four months before trial, a partner\n\nof McDonald’s lawyer was appointed Attorney General of New\n\nHampshire.   Noting that the state was not a party to the federal\n\nprosecution,    the    district     court   found   McDonald’s    concern\n\ninsufficient to justify new counsel.\n\n          Objectively, no conflict was created by the appointment\n\nbut one can imagine situations where, whatever the objective\n\nreality, a client might reasonably feel that his relationship\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fwith his counsel was compromised.               We doubt that this is such a\n\ncase but need not decide the point.                    It is enough that the\n\npartner’s      appointment        occurred      four   months     before    trial,\n\nMcDonald reserved his concern until it was too late to appoint\n\nnew counsel without a severance or a delay in a trial already\n\npostponed more than once, and no evidence existed of a total\n\nbreakdown in communication between lawyer and client.                      United\n\nStates v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92-93 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n479 U.S. 846 (1986).\n\n            The other claim regarding counsel is Burke's assertion\n\nthat his lawyer was ineffective; Burke says that counsel should\n\nhave   moved    for   a     judgment     of     acquittal    on   the    felon-in-\n\npossession counts because no prior felony conviction was proved.\n\nIn fact, there was testimony as to Burke's record from his\n\nparole   officer      and    in    any    event     his     counsel     reasonably\n\nstipulated to a prior conviction to avoid more detailed proof.\n\nThe claim is thus frivolous.\n\n            Sentencing.      The defendants have raised several issues\n\nrelated to sentencing.         The first is formally an attack on the\n\nconviction of four of the defendants (all except McGonagle), for\n\ncarjacking under 18 U.S.C. § 2119, but its significance pertains\n\nto sentencing.     The count, framed in the language of the statute\n\nas it existed at the time of the crime, charged the four with\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fthe carjacking incident to the Hudson robbery.                To satisfy the\n\n\"by force and violence\" requirement of the statute, the count\n\nalleged the assault and murder of the guards.\n\n          In    describing      penalties,       the   carjacking    statute\n\nprovided that \"if death results,\" imprisonment for a term of\n\nyears \"up to life\" shall be imposed (the possibility of a death\n\nsentence was later added).           At the time of the trial, we had\n\ntreated the \"if death results\" provision as a sentencing matter\n\nto be resolved by the judge.          United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67\n\nF.3d 993, 1000 (1st Cir. 1995).            Accordingly, the district judge\n\ndid not instruct the jury to find \"death\" as an element of the\n\ncarjacking     offense    but       did    at   sentencing     impose   life\n\nimprisonment on the four defendants on this count.\n\n          Thereafter, the Supreme Court ruled in a five-to-four\n\ndecision that the carjacking statute should be read to create\n\nthree separate crimes: one where no physical harm occurred, one\n\nfor \"serious bodily injury\" and one \"if death results.\"                 Jones\n\nv.   United   States,    119   S.    Ct.    1215,   1218-28   (1999).    The\n\ndefendants now argue that their life sentences on this count\n\nmust be set aside for lack of instructions and a jury finding\n\nthat death resulted.            In retrospect, the failure to instruct\n\non the \"if death results\" requirement was \"error\" under Jones,\n\nbut it was patently harmless.               The government introduced at\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\ftrial photographs of the dead guards and testimony from the\n\nstate's assistant deputy medical examiner, who participated in\n\nand testified about the autopsies.                 Witnesses testified that\n\neach of the four defendants had admitted that the guards were\n\nkilled during the robbery, and the defendants did not contest\n\nthe point.      In the words of Neder v. United States, 119 S. Ct.\n\n1827, 1837 (1999), we conclude \"beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe   omitted      element        was    uncontested       and      supported       by\n\noverwhelming      evidence,\"       so    the     error    in    instruction     was\n\n\"harmless.\"      See United States v. Perez-Montanez, 202 F.3d 434,\n\n442-43 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n              Another    claim    that    involves       both    convictions    and\n\nsentence is that of McDonald.              He was convicted under separate\n\ncounts   of    being    a   felon-in-possession          and    a   drug   user-in-\n\npossession      with    respect    to    the    same   firearms,     18    U.S.C.    §\n\n922(g)(1), (3), and sentenced concurrently to life imprisonment\n\non the former and 120 months on the latter.                Although he made no\n\nsuch objection in the district court, he now says that the two\n\ncounts are multiplicitous (that is, charge the same offense\n\ntwice) and that his conviction and sentence twice for the same\n\ncrime violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\n              Since each count involves an element that the other\n\ndoes not, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not bar multiple\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fconvictions and punishments under the familiar Blockburger test.\n\nUnited States v. Peterson, 867 F.2d 1110, 1115 (8th Cir. 1989)\n\n(citing Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932)).\n\nHowever, as a matter of statutory construction, several circuits\n\nhave held that Congress did not intend to inflict multiple\n\npunishments   where   a   drug-using,   former   felon   possessed   a\n\nfirearm.   United States v. Munoz-Romo, 989 F.2d 757, 759 (5th\n\nCir. 1993); cf. United States v. Winchester, 916 F.2d 601, 606-\n\n08 (11th Cir. 1990).      The government concedes this point and\n\nsays that the shorter sentence should be vacated (along with the\n\nstatutory $50 assessment).\n\n           However, the government says that the two convictions\n\nshould stand because no objection was made to the indictment on\n\nmultiplicity grounds and the objection is therefore waived.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2).       Whether there is a multiplicity\n\nobjection is a nice question and arguably depends on attributing\n\na further refinement in intent to Congress; it is clear enough\n\nthat the government is entitled to get both theories before the\n\njury, whether in one count or two.       In all events, we do not\n\ntreat the multiple \"convictions\" as clear error.\n\n           The law is somewhat clearer that multiple \"punishments\"\n\nare not proper, although the matter was not previously addressed\n\nby this court; and while no objection was made at sentencing in\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fthe district court, we accept the government's view that relief\n\nshould be granted as to the sentence.       Since the sentence was\n\nconcurrent in any event, the only practical effect of following\n\nthe government's recommendation is to remit the $50 special\n\nassessment, but at least the law on this issue will be clear in\n\nthis circuit in the future.\n\n          A different double jeopardy claim is made by Shea to\n\nhis   separate convictions and sentences for carjacking, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119, and the use of a firearm during a violent crime,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c).    Shea was sentenced, consecutively, to life\n\nimprisonment for the first crime and to 240 months imprisonment\n\non the second.       The carjacking in question was the Hudson\n\nincident and the firearm conviction was for use of a firearm\n\nduring the same robbery.        The claim is foreclosed in this\n\ncircuit by United States v. Centeno-Torres, 50 F.3d 84, 85 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 878 (1995), so we do not discuss\n\nit further.\n\n          In a pure sentencing issue, O'Halloran and three other\n\ndefendants    (all   except   McGonagle)   object   to   the   court's\n\ncomputation of their sentences insofar as the court relied on a\n\ncross-reference to the sentencing guideline for first-degree\n\nmurder.   To understand the objection requires some background.\n\nAll of the defendants were held liable for various offenses\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fpertaining     to   the   Hudson    robbery   and,   for   purposes     of\n\ncalculating a guidelines sentence, these offenses were grouped\n\nas   closely    related    counts     under   U.S.S.G.     §   3D1.2(b).\n\nOrdinarily, the offense level for the group would be the              base\n\noffense level applicable to the highest level crime in the\n\ngroup, modified to reflect any specific offense characteristics.\n\nId. § 3D1.3(a).\n\n          However, the robbery guideline, U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1, also\n\nprovides that \"[i]f a victim was killed under circumstances that\n\nwould constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing\n\ntaken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of\n\nthe United States, apply § 2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).\"           Id. §\n\n2B3.1(c)(1).    The federal murder statute classifies murder as an\n\n\"unlawful killing . . . with malice aforethought\" and then goes\n\non to describe as \"murder in the first degree\" a set of murders\n\nperpetrated in various ways, including \"murder . . . committed\n\nin the perpetration of . . . robbery.\"          18 U.S.C. § 1111(a). 2\n\n\n\n     2\n     18 U.S.C. § 1111(a) provides that \"[m]urder is the unlawful\nkilling of a human being with malice aforethought. Every murder\nperpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of\nwillful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing; or\ncommitted in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any\narson, escape, murder, kidnaping, treason, espionage, sabotage,\naggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, burglary, or robbery;\nor perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and\nmaliciously to effect the death of any human being other than\nhim who is killed, is murder in the first degree.\"\n\n                                   -35-\n\fThe district court ruled that this was such a felony murder,\n\nmaking    applicable   to   all   of   the   defendants   the   very   high\n\nguideline level for first-degree murder.\n\n           On first reading, section 1111 might appear to be\n\nunclear    and open to the construction that, for first-degree\n\nmurder, there must be both an unlawful killing \"with malice\n\naforethought\" (under the first sentence) and satisfaction of one\n\nof the other conditions      (under the second sentence) such as the\n\ncommission of that murder in the perpetration of a robbery.\n\nHowever, the case law makes clear that the second sentence is\n\ndefinitional, that the statute was intended to adopt the felony\n\nmurder rule, and for a stated felony the \"malice\" element is\n\nsatisfied by the intent to commit the unlawful felony.3\n\n           The four defendants argue that the district court had\n\nno basis for finding \"malice aforethought\" and wrongly shifted\n\nto the defendants the burden of showing that they did not\n\nintentionally cause the death of the guards.         However, under the\n\nfelony murder rule adopted by section 1111's second sentence,\n\nthe killing of the guards in the Hudson robbery was first-degree\n\n\n\n    3 See United States v. Nichols, 169 F.3d 1255, 1272 (10th\nCir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 336 (1999); United States v.\nHarris, 104 F.3d 1465, 1474 (5th Cir. 1997); United States v.\nPoindexter, 44 F.3d 406, 409-10 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 514\nU.S. 1132 (1995); United States v. Thomas, 34 F.3d 44, 48-49 (2d\nCir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1007 (1994).\n\n                                   -36-\n\fmurder by those who perpetrated the robbery, regardless of who\n\npulled the trigger or any individual intent.               The district\n\njudge's comments relating to burden appear, in context, to have\n\nbeen an offer to consider a downward departure based on a\n\nshowing that any individual defendant did not intend to commit\n\nmurder.4\n\n            In the end, the district court did grant a downward\n\ndeparture    to   McGonagle   on   the    ground   that   the    jury,    in\n\nacquitting him of the carjacking, had established that he was\n\nnot present when the murders were committed and bore some lesser\n\ndegree of responsibility--a ruling that the government has not\n\nappealed.    The other four defendants appeal from the district\n\ncourt's failure to grant them a downward departure, see U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2A1.1, cmt. n.1; but the denial of a departure is unreviewable\n\nunless the court misapprehends its authority.               18 U.S.C. §\n\n3742(e), (f); United States v. Serrano-Osorio, 191 F.3d 12, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             In addition to prison sentences, the district court\n\nimposed a $250,000 fine on each of the five defendants.                  The\n\nguidelines   provide   that   fines   should   ordinarily       be   imposed\n\n\"except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay\n\n\n     4\n     After referring to the need for \"an affirmative showing\" by\ndefendants, the court continued \"[n]ow if you want a departure,\nyou bear the burden of showing why a departure is justified.\"\n\n                                   -37-\n\fand is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\"            U.S.S.G. §\n\n5E1.2(a).    Here, the defendants reported no appreciable assets\n\nbut the district judge was not persuaded, pointing out that\n\nsubstantial robbery proceeds had not been accounted for and that\n\nthe    defendants   might      also   earn   significant   sums   through\n\ninterviews and the sale of literary rights.          Their objection on\n\nappeal is confined to the claim that they lacked an ability to\n\npay.\n\n            The district court's determination on ability to pay\n\nis a factual one reviewed only for clear error, United States v.\n\nFavorito, 5 F.3d 1338, 1339 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511\n\nU.S. 1006 (1994), and the burden was on defendants to prove\n\ntheir inability to pay.        United States v. Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).    Here, the fact that the defendants had stolen\n\nmore than the amount of their fines and failed to account for a\n\nsubstantial portion of the money is enough for us to sustain the\n\ndistrict court.     That the defendants denied that they had any\n\nmoney created at best a credibility contest and the court was\n\nfree   to   disbelieve   the    self-interested   and   general   denials\n\noffered by the defendants.\n\n            New trial motion.         The final issue pressed on this\n\nappeal is the defendants' claim that the district court erred in\n\ndenying their second motion for a new trial.         The background for\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fthe motion was this:          John Burke, Stephen Burke's brother,\n\npleaded guilty during trial to conspiracy to commit a robbery in\n\nSeabrook, New Hampshire.           18 U.S.C. § 1951.        The government\n\nagreed to dismiss the remaining counts against John Burke at\n\nsentencing.      John Burke then testified for the government at\n\ntrial.\n\n            After the remaining five defendants were convicted, the\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge to which John\n\nBurke had pled guilty, and then for unrelated reasons sought to\n\nwithdraw the motion. Based on what they learned, the defendants\n\nthen filed a new trial motion asserting that before John Burke\n\nhad testified against them, he and the government had discussed\n\nthe possible dismissal of the federal charge against him as a\n\nreward for helpful testimony.          This, said the defendants, was\n\ndramatic information that should have been disclosed under Brady\n\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. United States, 405\n\nU.S. 150 (1972), as useful impeachment evidence.\n\n            In fact, nothing in the record indicates that the\n\nprosecutor discussed with John Burke prior to his testimony the\n\npossible outright dismissal of the federal charge against him.\n\nRather,     it   appears    that    John    Burke   had    only   the    usual\n\ngeneralized expectation that the government would consider some\n\nform   of   leniency   or   other    assistance     to    him.    On    cross-\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fexamination of John Burke at trial, his hope and desire for some\n\nkind of reward was amply established.                   However, in the post-\n\ntrial proceedings, the government conceded to the district judge\n\nthat it had ruled nothing out and was always free to ask for\n\ndismissal of all charges or any other benefit.\n\n           In a written order resolving the new trial motion, the\n\ndistrict court said that the government \"although not compelled\n\nby Brady\" should as a matter of \"better practice\" have revealed\n\nthe    possible        dismissal   option       \"if,     before     [John]     Burke\n\ntestified,       the     prosecutors     even     remotely        considered     the\n\npossibility that they would seek to dismiss all charges against\n\n[him] . . . .\"         However, the district judge ruled that even if\n\nthis obligation existed, a new trial was not warranted because\n\nit was not \"reasonably probable\" that the disclosure would have\n\naltered the verdict.         Strickler v. Greene, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 1952\n\n(1999).\n\n           Without deciding whether the government was obligated\n\nto    disclose     more     than   it    did     (the     facts     are   somewhat\n\nidiosyncratic), we find that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying a new trial.                 United States v. Wright,\n\n625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980).               The evidence against the\n\ndefendants was substantial and rested on a number of witnesses,\n\nmuch forensic evidence, and a series of admissions and co-\n\n\n                                        -40-\n\fconspirator statements.             Further, John Burke was extensively\n\nimpeached    by       questioning   about     his    expectations     of   lenient\n\ntreatment, as well as other subjects that might fairly cast\n\ndoubt on his veracity.         The outcome would not have been changed\n\nby \"the possibility\" of a reward even more generous than usual.\n\n            The judgments of conviction and sentence as to each of\n\nthe defendants is affirmed except that McDonald's sentence on\n\nthe drug-user-in-possession count, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3), is\n\nvacated and remanded to the district court with instructions to\n\nmerge the sentence with that imposed for the felon-in-possession\n\ncount,   id.      §    922(g)(1),     and     with    no   separate    mandatory\n\nassessment fee.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -41-\n\f",

This appeal grows out of a\n\nsecond superseding indictment returned in New Hampshire on May\n\n1, 1997, charging six defendants with a variety of federal\n\noffenses related to a string of bank and armored car robberies\n\nthat took place between 1990 and 1996.                   The trial began on\n\nSeptember 16, 1997, one defendant pled guilty during trial, and\n\nthe remaining five defendants completed the three-month trial,\n\nwere   convicted      and    are   appellants     in   this    court:   they   are\n\nAnthony Shea, Stephen Burke, Matthew McDonald, Patrick McGonagle\n\nand Michael O'Halloran.\n\n           The evidence presented at trial included a wealth of\n\nexhibits   as    well   as    testimony      by   over   150   witnesses.       In\n\nsubstance, the evidence showed that Shea, McDonald and one Dick\n\nDonovan had carried out a series of bank robberies beginning in\n\n1990; that by 1992 Stephen Burke and O'Halloran had joined the\n\nscheme, together with Burke's brother John (who pled guilty at\n\ntrial).    From 1992 onward, the group concentrated on armored car\n\nrobberies (with an occasional bank robbery) in the Northeast and\n\nFlorida.        The   most    notorious      incident    was    a   Hudson,    New\n\nHampshire, armored car robbery in August 1994, in which both\n\narmored car drivers were kidnaped and executed.\n\n           The government's case was substantially aided by the\n\ntestimony of Steven Connolly, who was a longtime friend of two\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fof the defendants and an acquaintance to the others.                                He had\n\nbeen    recruited       into   the    scheme     in    March    1994      and   provided\n\ntestimony, including descriptions of defendants' conduct in\n\nvarious of the offenses, their techniques, and admissions made\n\nby   individual         defendants.         A    number    of       other    government\n\nwitnesses,       some     unwilling,        also       described      admissions          by\n\nindividual defendants to various of the robberies.\n\n            The government charged two armored car robberies--those\n\nthat had occurred in New Hampshire--as substantive offenses, and\n\nit offered proof of a number of other bank or armored car\n\nrobberies as predicate acts or evidence to support the charges\n\nthat    some     or     all    of    the   defendants       were         engaged     in    a\n\nracketeering          enterprise      under      the    RICO    statute,        a     RICO\n\nconspiracy, conspiracy to rob banks, carjacking, and several\n\ndifferent       kinds    of    firearms     offenses.          18    U.S.C.     §§    371,\n\n922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), 924(c), 1951, 1962(c)-(d), 2113(d), 2119\n\n(1994).     The two New Hampshire robberies, including the August\n\n1994 Hudson robbery and another that occurred in Seabrook in May\n\n1993, were the subject of extensive evidence.\n\n            About two months into the trial, the district court\n\n(with     the    government's         agreement)        granted      a    judgment        of\n\nacquittal on several counts and one racketeering act as to\n\ncertain of the defendants and one racketeering act as to all of\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fthe   defendants.        The   remaining    counts,     minus   particular\n\nracketeering acts and overt acts as to which no evidence was\n\npresented,     were    eventually   submitted    to    the   jury   under   a\n\nredacted indictment now containing 14 counts and on December 22,\n\n1997, the jury convicted all five defendants on all submitted\n\ncharges, save that it acquitted McGonagle of carjacking in\n\nrelation to the Hudson robbery.\n\n          All five of the defendants were convicted of conspiracy\n\nto commit armed robberies and of committing and conspiring to\n\ncommit   the   Hudson    robbery.     All   of   the   defendants    except\n\nMcGonagle were convicted of operating a racketeering enterprise,\n\nengaging in a racketeering conspiracy, carjacking in connection\n\nwith the Hudson robbery, and of various firearms offenses.\n\nShea, Burke and O'Halloran were also convicted of committing and\n\nconspiring to commit the Seabrook armored car robbery.\n\n          On May 8, 1998, the court imposed sentences on each of\n\nthe defendants.       Each was sentenced to life imprisonment, except\n\nfor McGonagle, who was sentenced to 360 months.              The defendants\n\nhave now appealed, presenting a series of claims concerning\n\nsufficiency of evidence as to certain counts, pretrial and trial\n\nrulings, the composition of the jury and the instructions given\n\nto it, and sentencing and other post-trial matters.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f         Sufficiency.    On several claims, individual defendants\n\nsay that the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to\n\nconvict, and that their motions for a judgment of acquittal\n\nshould have been granted.      Review of such claims is de novo,\n\nUnited States v.

By this standard, the evidence in each case was\n\nadequate on the contested counts (and on many others it was\n\noverwhelming).\n\n         McGonagle    does   not   contest   that   the   evidence   was\n\nsufficient to convict him of bank robbery and conspiracy to\n\ncommit the Hudson robbery, but he says that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to tie him to a broader conspiracy to commit a\n\nseries of armed robberies--a crime of which all defendants were\n\nconvicted.    However, Connolly testified that Shea had identified\n\nMcGonagle as one of the conspirators in the broader conspiracy\n\nand, in addition to the ample evidence of McGonagle's role in\n\nthe Hudson robbery, there is evidence that linked him to a\n\nseparate armored car robbery by the conspirators almost eight\n\nmonths before the Hudson robbery.        At least two witnesses, in\n\naddition to Connolly, testified to McGonagle's role.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            McDonald, joined by O'Halloran and Burke, says that the\n\ngovernment        failed   to   prove   the   existence   of   a     single\n\nracketeering enterprise, racketeering conspiracy, or a broad\n\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery; at best, he contends, the\n\njury could only have found smaller enterprises or conspiracies\n\nwith a changing cast of conspirators.           No magic formula exists\n\nfor determining when a set of jointly committed crimes adds up\n\nto an overarching conspiracy or enterprise; the courts tend to\n\nlook for common goal, overlap among participants, and a measure\n\nof interdependence, United States v.

Shea was\n\ninvolved from the beginning, and he and Burke were involved in\n\nthe largest number of crimes.            There was also evidence that\n\nMcDonald was involved in the conspiracy from its inception and\n\nthat   he   and    O'Halloran    were   substantially   involved    in   the\n\noverarching racketeering conspiracy and enterprise and a broad\n\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery.           Despite an interruption in\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fMcDonald's role caused by his temporary imprisonment on a parole\n\nviolation, and O'Halloran's somewhat late arrival in the scheme,\n\nenough evidence existed of a common and continuing aim, similar\n\nmethods      of     operation,       continuity      in      personnel,     and\n\ninterdependence to permit the court to send the separate counts\n\nto the jury and the jury to find a RICO enterprise, a RICO\n\nconspiracy, and a broad conspiracy to rob banks and armored\n\ncars.\n\n             McDonald was convicted of three different gun charges\n\n(felon-in-possession,         drug   user-in-possession,        and   use   and\n\npossession     during    a   violent    crime)    relating    to   the    Hudson\n\narmored car robbery.         He says that the evidence was insufficient\n\non   these     counts.        However,        constructive    possession     is\n\nsufficient.       United States v.

Here the evidence showed that the defendants as a\n\ngroup were regularly armed.            In addition, a government witness\n\ntestified that two days before the Hudson robbery, McDonald said\n\nthat he was going to take part in it and displayed a handgun at\n\nthe same time; and at least six weapons were used in the Hudson\n\nrobbery.\n\n             O'Halloran, who was convicted of firearms charges in\n\nconnection with both the Hudson and Seabrook robberies, makes a\n\nsimilar claim that the evidence was insufficient.                  Again, the\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconstructive possession theory was available to the government\n\nand was supported by the evidence.                   In addition, there was\n\ntestimony by government witnesses to support the view that\n\nO'Halloran      had   himself      possessed       weapons   in   both    of    the\n\nrobberies.       The lower court did not err in sending the firearm\n\ncounts to the jury.\n\n           Specific evidence.             We turn next to objections to\n\nparticular pieces of evidence, starting with Shea's objection to\n\nthe use at trial of a number of items seized in a January 1990\n\nsearch    of    his   Charlestown     residence       (including       weapons,    a\n\nbulletproof vest, camouflage clothing, and masks).                     The search\n\nwas based on a warrant secured through an affidavit given by a\n\nfederal    agent;     its   gist    was    information       furnished     by     an\n\ninformant, whose prior information had been reliable, that on\n\nthree occasions over the six weeks prior to the affidavit the\n\ninformant had seen a sawed-off shotgun at the residence where\n\nShea was present.           The affiant also said that Shea had no\n\nrequired       federal   registration        for    possessing     a    sawed-off\n\nshotgun.\n\n           The district court relied on the good faith exception\n\nto the exclusionary rule, United States v.

In this case, the chronology is as follows:\n\n           •June 16, 1993: list compiled based on 1992\n           elections\n\n           •August 1, 1993: list put into effect\n\n           •July 24, 1997: list used to mail summonses\n           to jurors for defendants’ jury\n\n           The defendants say that the list used to select their\n\njury had existed for more than four years prior to the date that\n\nit was used to select their jury (June 16, 1993 to July 24,\n\n1997) and so violated the statute’s four-year provision.           The\n\ndistrict court has read the statute’s four year provision to\n\nrequire that the wheel be emptied and refilled within four\n\nyears, and that the list used for defendants’ jury had been used\n\nfor less than four years (August 1, 1993 to July 24, 1997).

The jury in this\n\ncase was selected based on data more than four years old (the\n\nNovember 1992 election lists).            But the New Hampshire plan\n\nreasonably answers this concern by requiring that the wheel be\n\nrefilled within nine months after the general election, and the\n\nstatute    does   not   preclude   a   reasonable   delay   between   the\n\ncollection of the data and its insertion into the wheel.\n\n           Defendants also assert that the \"random\" selection\n\nrequirement of the statute was frustrated because the use of\n\ndata more than four years old necessarily reduced the number of\n\nboth younger jurors and jurors who had recently relocated to New\n\nHampshire.

In outlining the evidence, the\n\nprosecutor began not chronologically but with the most dramatic\n\nincident, the Hudson robbery and murder of the guards; his\n\ndescription was somewhat emotional; and, in the district judge’s\n\nview, the prosecutor did not make it sufficiently clear (despite\n\nthe court's admonitions) that the prosecutor's description of\n\nvarious events was a preview of intended evidence rather than an\n\nexpression of personal belief.

On appeal, the three defendants complain\n\nthat their right to cross-examine was unduly restricted.

The first of these claims arises out of\n\nMcDonald’s request, made approximately 30 days before trial, for\n\na new appointed counsel.        Most of the reasons given by McDonald\n\nfor his request are too slight to require mention; but one rises\n\nsomewhat above this level:        four months before trial, a partner\n\nof McDonald’s lawyer was appointed Attorney General of New\n\nHampshire.   Noting that the state was not a party to the federal\n\nprosecution,    the    district     court   found   McDonald’s    concern\n\ninsufficient to justify new counsel.\n\n          Objectively, no conflict was created by the appointment\n\nbut one can imagine situations where, whatever the objective\n\nreality, a client might reasonably feel that his relationship\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fwith his counsel was compromised.               We doubt that this is such a\n\ncase but need not decide the point.                    It is enough that the\n\npartner’s      appointment        occurred      four   months     before    trial,\n\nMcDonald reserved his concern until it was too late to appoint\n\nnew counsel without a severance or a delay in a trial already\n\npostponed more than once, and no evidence existed of a total\n\nbreakdown in communication between lawyer and client.

The first is formally an attack on the\n\nconviction of four of the defendants (all except McGonagle), for\n\ncarjacking under 18 U.S.C. § 2119, but its significance pertains\n\nto sentencing.     The count, framed in the language of the statute\n\nas it existed at the time of the crime, charged the four with\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fthe carjacking incident to the Hudson robbery.                To satisfy the\n\n\"by force and violence\" requirement of the statute, the count\n\nalleged the assault and murder of the guards.\n\n          In    describing      penalties,       the   carjacking    statute\n\nprovided that \"if death results,\" imprisonment for a term of\n\nyears \"up to life\" shall be imposed (the possibility of a death\n\nsentence was later added).           At the time of the trial, we had\n\ntreated the \"if death results\" provision as a sentencing matter\n\nto be resolved by the judge.          United States v.

United   States,    119   S.    Ct.    1215,   1218-28   (1999).    The\n\ndefendants now argue that their life sentences on this count\n\nmust be set aside for lack of instructions and a jury finding\n\nthat death resulted.            In retrospect, the failure to instruct\n\non the \"if death results\" requirement was \"error\" under Jones,\n\nbut it was patently harmless.

Here, the fact that the defendants had stolen\n\nmore than the amount of their fines and failed to account for a\n\nsubstantial portion of the money is enough for us to sustain the\n\ndistrict court.

The final issue pressed on this\n\nappeal is the defendants' claim that the district court erred in\n\ndenying their second motion for a new trial.         The background for\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fthe motion was this:          John Burke, Stephen Burke's brother,\n\npleaded guilty during trial to conspiracy to commit a robbery in\n\nSeabrook, New Hampshire.           18 U.S.C. § 1951.        The government\n\nagreed to dismiss the remaining counts against John Burke at\n\nsentencing.      John Burke then testified for the government at\n\ntrial.\n\n            After the remaining five defendants were convicted, the\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge to which John\n\nBurke had pled guilty, and then for unrelated reasons sought to\n\nwithdraw the motion. Based on what they learned, the defendants\n\nthen filed a new trial motion asserting that before John Burke\n\nhad testified against them, he and the government had discussed\n\nthe possible dismissal of the federal charge against him as a\n\nreward for helpful testimony.

On    cross-\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fexamination of John Burke at trial, his hope and desire for some\n\nkind of reward was amply established.                   However, in the post-\n\ntrial proceedings, the government conceded to the district judge\n\nthat it had ruled nothing out and was always free to ask for\n\ndismissal of all charges or any other benefit.\n\n           In a written order resolving the new trial motion, the\n\ndistrict court said that the government \"although not compelled\n\nby Brady\" should as a matter of \"better practice\" have revealed\n\nthe    possible        dismissal   option       \"if,     before     [John]     Burke\n\ntestified,       the     prosecutors     even     remotely        considered     the\n\npossibility that they would seek to dismiss all charges against\n\n[him] . . . .\"         However, the district judge ruled that even if\n\nthis obligation existed, a new trial was not warranted because\n\nit was not \"reasonably probable\" that the disclosure would have\n\naltered the verdict.
