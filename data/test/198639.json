Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Vito Badamo, Jr. on brief pro se.\r\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Donald C.\r\nLockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nSEPTEMBER 16, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  In May 1995, Vito Badamo, Jr. (\"Badamo\r\nJr.\") pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to\r\ndistribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C.  841, and one count of using and\r\ncarrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\r\ncrime and aiding and abetting that firearm offense, 18 U.S.C.\r\n 924(c) and 2.  He did not file any direct appeal.  In March\r\n1997, he filed a  2255 motion, alleging that his firearm\r\nconviction should be vacated in light of Bailey v. United\r\nStates, 516 U.S. 137 (1995).  That motion was denied, see\r\nBadamo v. United States, 17 F.Supp.2d 60 (D. R.I. 1998), and\r\nBadamo Jr. appealed.  The district court granted a certificate\r\nof appealability (COA) on the issue \"whether there was\r\nsufficient evidence in the record to sustain petitioner's plea\r\nto aiding and abetting in the use or carrying of a firearm\r\nduring and in relation to a drug trafficking offense; more\r\nspecifically, whether the petitioner facilitated the use and/or\r\ncarrying of a firearm.\"  We affirm.\r\n          The facts underlying the offenses are amply recited\r\nin the district court's opinion, Badamo v. United States, 17\r\nF.Supp.2d at 61, and in our own opinion affirming the district\r\ncourt's decision in appeals filed by two of Badamo Jr.'s\r\ncodefendants, Santoro v. United States,     F.3d    , 1999 WL\r\n691997, at *1, (1st Cir. June 8, 1999) (per curiam).  We refer\r\nthe reader to that material and do not repeat it here.\r\n          Badamo Jr. must show cause and prejudice for failing\r\nto raise on direct appeal the issue as to the sufficiency of\r\nthe evidence for aiding and abetting.  The fact that Bailey was\r\nnot decided until after his conviction and the expiration of\r\nthe appeal period is not \"cause\" to excuse the procedural\r\ndefault because Bailey did not alter the required elements for\r\naiding and abetting, see, e.g., Wright v. United States, 139\r\nF.3d 551, 552 (7th Cir. 1998), and, although Bailey clarified\r\nthat \"use\" means active employment, two of his codefendants\r\nactively employed firearms.\r\n          Even if unable to establish cause and prejudice,\r\nBadamo, Jr. could, nonetheless, obtain collateral relief from\r\nhis  924(c) conviction if he can show that he is \"actually\r\ninnocent\" of that offense.  Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. \r\nat 623.  But to do so, he \"must demonstrate that, in light of\r\nall the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable\r\njuror would have convicted him.\"  Id. (citations and internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).  This standard, which requires \"a\r\nstronger showing than that needed to establish prejudice,\"\r\nreserves collateral review for the \"truly 'extraordinary'\"\r\ncase, \"while still providing petitioner a meaningful avenue by\r\nwhich to avoid a manifest injustice.\"  Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S.\r\n298, 327 (1995) (internal citation omitted).  Badamo Jr. has\r\nnot met this standard.\r\n          As the district court accurately recited, a\r\nconviction for aiding and abetting a  924(c) offense requires\r\na showing that a defendant knew a firearm would be used or\r\ncarried by another and willingly took some action to facilitate\r\nthe use or carriage.  See United States v. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40,\r\n45 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 845 (1996).  The district\r\ncourt's conclusion that Badamo, Jr. knew that firearms would be\r\nused or carried is unassailable.  Badamo Jr.'s unadorned\r\ncontention to the contrary is not persuasive.  He was present\r\nat the meeting in which firearms were discussed.  He was\r\npresent when codefendant Eugenio was handed a weapon and when\r\nEugenio gave the weapon to one of the robbers as Eugenio opened\r\nthe \"stash house\" door.  And, as the court remarked, \"the\r\nnature of the crime itself should have alerted them to the\r\nlikelihood that the firearms would be actively employed in\r\nwresting possession of a large quantity of drugs from what they\r\nbelieved to be a group of drug traffickers.\"  Badamo v. United\r\nStates, 17 F.Supp. at 62.\r\n          There is also sufficient evidence to support a\r\nconclusion that Badamo Jr. willingly took some action to\r\nfacilitate the use or carrying of firearms. He was in\r\nattendance at a planning meeting and concedes that the\r\ndefendants agreed to pose as police officers.  Most\r\nsignificantly, he recruited his cousin Favaloro to participate\r\nin the job.  Police officers invariably carry firearms as well\r\nas badges and handcuffs (or so a jury could find).  Those\r\nposing as police officers would do likewise (or so a jury could\r\nfind).  In fact, Favaloro carried and brandished a firearm and\r\nNew York City police badges and handcuffs were recovered from\r\nthe routes along which Badamo Jr. and others fled.  A\r\nreasonable juror could conclude that, in recruiting Favaloro to\r\nparticipate in a plan to pose as a police officer, Badamo Jr.\r\nfacilitated the use and carrying of a firearm during and in\r\nrelation to the drug trafficking crime.\r\n          On appeal, Badamo Jr. also contends that his guilty\r\nplea was induced by an \"erroneous instruction\" by the district\r\ncourt.  Although he has not elaborated upon this allegation,\r\nwe presume that Badamo Jr. is complaining that, although he was\r\ntold that, in order to prove aiding and abetting of the use or\r\ncarrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug\r\ntrafficking crime, the government had to prove that a defendant\r\nknew a firearm was going to be used or carried during and in\r\nrelation to the drug trafficking crime, he was not informed\r\nthat the government would also have to prove that a defendant\r\nwillingly took some action to facilitate the use or carrying. \r\nWe will assume, without deciding, that such a claim would be a\r\nnon-technical violation of Fed. R. Crim P. 11 and, thus,\r\ncognizable in a  2255 proceeding. Cf. United States v.\r\nTimmreck, 441 U.S. 780 (1979).\r\n          Badamo Jr., however, did not raise this claim of a\r\ndefective plea colloquy in his  2255 motion.  He first raised\r\nit in his COA request to the district court and it was not the\r\nissue upon which the district court granted a COA.  Cf. Bui v.\r\nDiPaolo 170 F.3d 232, 237-38 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that, in\r\npost-Bui cases, a petitioner must request from the court of\r\nappeals a complementary COA in order to obtain appellate review\r\nof an issue not certified by the district court), petition for\r\ncert. filed (U.S. June 14, 1999) (No. 98-9840).  We will\r\nassume, without deciding, that, despite his failing to raise\r\nthe issue in his  2255 motion, the issue was sufficiently\r\npresented in the district court by his raising it in his\r\nrequest for a COA.  And, as Badamo Jr.'s appeal was pending\r\nwhen Bui was decided, we will not fault him for failing to ask\r\nfor a complementary COA.  See Bui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d at 238. \r\nIn any event, however, a procedural default remains.  Badamo\r\nJr. has failed to establish cause to excuse his failure to\r\nraise this issue on direct appeal.  Cf. United States v.\r\nRomero, 32 F.3d 641, 652 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding no plain\r\nerror when defendants failed to object to the court's alleged\r\nfailure to instruct on one element of the offense).  And, as\r\noutlined supra, Badamo Jr. can not show \"actual innocence.\"\r\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n",
