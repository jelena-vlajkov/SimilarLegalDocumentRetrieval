Appellant Augustine A. Ahanon appeals\r\nfrom the district court's decision to grant the motion of the\r\nUnited States for entry of default and summary judgment in this\r\ncivil forfeiture in rem action.  We affirm the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court because Ahanon failed to raise in the district\r\ncourt the arguments he presents on appeal.  \"Our law is clear\r\nthat a party ordinarily may not raise on appeal issues that\r\nwere not seasonably advanced (and, hence, preserved) below.\" \r\nDaigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  This rule \"applies with full force to constitutional\r\nchallenges.\"  Id. at 688.  Appellant thus has waived his\r\narguments regarding insufficient notice and the failure of the\r\ndistrict court to treat his letter as the functional equivalent\r\nof a claim.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\n",
