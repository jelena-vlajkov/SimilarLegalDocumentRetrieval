Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Lydia Lizarribar-Masini for appellant.\n     Jeanette Mercado Rios, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E.\nVega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal\nDivision, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 2, 2000\n\f\f            COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.             Defendant appellant, a\n\ncorrectional officer employed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n\nat the Metropolitan Detention Center in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico,\n\nwas convicted after a jury trial of engaging in a sexual act\n\nwith an inmate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2243(b).                    The trial\n\ncentered on testimony of the female inmate that, while she was\n\nin segregated custody in the Center’s Special Housing Unit,\n\ndefendant     on    several        occasions   had    her     submit    to   oral\n\ncopulation.      She had managed to save some of the sperm in a pill\n\nbottle, which was ultimately given to the FBI for DNA testing.\n\n\n\n            The major issue in this appeal is whether the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying defendant’s motion, filed\n\non the first day of trial, for funds under the Criminal Justice\n\nAct, 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1), to hire a DNA expert to assist the\n\ndefense.      Other       issues    involve    evidentiary     and     sentencing\n\nrulings.    After close scrutiny of the motion history, we affirm.\n\n            We     note   that     the   specific    motion   for    funds   that\n\ntriggered the ruling at issue was the last event in a history of\n\nmotions and responses which does credit to neither side.                       We\n\nfind the government’s record of less than forthcoming response\n\nto defendant’s repeated requests to be unintentional, however,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fand conclude that defendant bears responsibility for lack of\n\nfocused assertion of rights at critical times.\n\n            On October 13, 1998, defendant filed a motion under\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 16, asking for any statements of defendant,\n\nreports     of   tests,   and,   specifically   referencing   Rule\n\n16(a)(1)(E), a written summary of any expert opinion with bases\n\nand reasons therefor.1    The motion was granted on October 16.\n\n            On October 20, defendant received from the government\n\na four page report.    The first page was entitled “Re: Receipt of\n\nDNA Analysis Results.”     It reported that FBI Examiner Baechtel\n\nhad examined two semen samples and blood samples of a number of\n\ncorrectional officers and inmates; that one semen sample lacked\n\nenough DNA to show a DNA profile; that the other sample revealed\n\nDNA contributed by more than one person, and that the blood\n\nsamples of defendant and another officer did not exclude them as\n\npotential contributors to the second DNA sample.    It also noted\n\nthat Baechtel explained that these results “were not as detail\n\n\n\n\n    1    Since 1993, Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E) has read in\npart:\n\n        (E) Expert Witnesses. At the defendant’s request,\n        the government shall disclose to the defendant a\n        written summary of testimony that the government\n        intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the\n        Federal Rules of Evidence during its case-in-chief\n        at trial.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f[sic] as would be his court testimony on the results of his\n\nfindings.\"\n\n              There    was   added    a    brief   discussion      of   two   tests\n\nperformed on the second sample showing that defendant’s DNA\n\npattern,      though   less    detectible        than   his    fellow   officer’s,\n\n“could be picked up slightly in the sample.”                   Other pages listed\n\nthe   items    examined,      gave   instructions        for    storing   returned\n\nprocessed      DNA     samples,      and     reported     Baechtel’s      findings\n\nconcerning the extremely low probability of finding someone in\n\nthe general Black, Caucasian, or Hispanic populations who could\n\nhave been a contributor to the examined sample.\n\n              Not content with this, defendant filed, on October 28,\n\na request for complete reports and any expert testimony to be\n\npresented by the government.               The motion was granted on October\n\n30.   On November 2, the government filed responses to a number\n\nof discovery motions.          Its response to the two requests noted\n\nabove was simply, “The requested information has been made\n\navailable in the discovery previously provided on October 20,\n\n1998.”\n\n              On December 22, defendant filed a “motion in limine,”\n\nreferring in part to the Rule 16 motions, asserting that they\n\nhad not been complied with, and requesting that any evidence of\n\ntests and expert testimony be excluded from the trial.                           On\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJanuary 8, 1999, the government responded, saying only that\n\ndefendant was in error in asserting that it had not complied\n\nwith the early requests.\n\n          This response, predictably, led to a motion filed\n\nFebruary 11, 1999, entitled, “Urgent Motion Requesting Remedy.”\n\nIt rehearsed the familiar history, specifying the failure to\n\nsupply a written summary of any expert opinion as well as test\n\nresults, and   requested that the government comply with the\n\ncourt’s orders within five days or be barred from using DNA\n\nevidence and testimony.\n\n          Nothing happened for almost three weeks.       Then, on\n\nFebruary 22,   defendant’s counsel drafted the motion for funds\n\nthat was filed, fifteen days later, on the first day of trial.\n\nA pre-trial conference was held on February 23.    We do not know\n\nwhat, if any, mention was made of the motion for funds for a DNA\n\nexpert for the defense.    What we do know is that on the same day\n\nthe court gave “further consideration” to defendant’s “urgent\n\nmotion” and ordered the government to provide defendant with a\n\nwritten   summary   of     FBI   Examiner   Baechtel’s   testimony\n\n“forthwith.”\n\n          In the face of this deliberate command, and against\n\nthis background, one would have thought that the government\n\nwould have complied without delay or at least recorded its\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fserious efforts.       One would also have thought that, armed with\n\nthis weapon, defendant would have wasted no time in invoking\n\nsanctions for delay.           Instead, we face only silence on this\n\nissue for the next two weeks ending with the first day of trial.\n\nOn that day, March 9, 1999, defendant no longer sought to\n\nsuppress evidence and testimony as sanctions for failure of\n\ncompliance, but rather, in a reversal of approach, requested his\n\nown expert.    If the request had been              granted, the recruitment\n\nof   an   expert,     familiarizing       such     expert    with   the        record,\n\nenabling     new    tests      to   be    conducted      and      the        resulting\n\nconsultations with defendant’s attorney would necessarily have\n\ninvolved substantial delay.\n\n            What    the   district       court   faced      on   March       9,   after\n\nattempting to give defendant maximum timely assistance, was the\n\nex parte motion drafted two weeks earlier.                       It recited that\n\ndefendant     had retained counsel for $6,000, had no further\n\nresources, was indigent, and that a financial statement was\n\nbeing     prepared.       It    also      stated    that     “due       to    special\n\ncircumstances of the [DNA] evidence, it has become necessary to\n\ndispute the same.”        It then cited the Criminal Justice Act and\n\nrequested an unspecified amount                “for an investigator and an\n\nexpert witness in DNA.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f           In reviewing the court’s denial of the motion, we are\n\nmindful    of   the   fact   that   the     burden     is    on   the   movant    to\n\ndemonstrate the necessity of the expert services for an adequate\n\ndefense, see United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 240\n\n(lst Cir. 1989), and that we may reverse only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion,     see United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 218 (lst\n\nCir. 1996).       Moreover, a request must be made in a timely\n\nmanner. See Moore v. Kemp, 809 F.2d 702, 710 (llth Cir. 1987)(en\n\nbanc).    In this case, it is clear that the court was well within\n\nthe    bounds   of    its    discretion.         The       very   first    hurdle,\n\neligibility     for   Criminal      Justice     Act    funds,     was     not    even\n\napproached.     Although the motion had been prepared days before,\n\nand had referred to the preparation of an eligibility document,\n\nno financial analysis of defendant’s economic circumstances was\n\never, so far as we know, presented.             Substantive justifications\n\nwere   similarly      lacking.      There     was     no    indication      of    the\n\navailability or identification of an appropriate expert or any\n\nestimate   of   the    expert’s     fee   and   expenses.          There    was    no\n\nenlightenment as to why an investigator was needed in addition\n\nto an expert witness.         Not least, there was no explanation of\n\nwhere and why the assistance of an expert was needed.\n\n           In oral argument, counsel stated that only on the\n\nopening    day of trial did she receive a complete summary and\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fonly then did she realize the complexity of the DNA issues.      But\n\nthere is nothing in the filed motion to reflect this fact.       And\n\nthis is somewhat inconsistent with defendant’s brief, where he\n\ncharges   that    “the   prosecution   never   provided     complete\n\ndisclosure” and that certain DNA testing results were only\n\n“shown to counsel by Mr. Baechtel during trial recess” — which\n\nwould have been the third day of trial, March 15.         Both sides\n\nagree that further materials were made available to defendant\n\nbut disagree as to the time.      All of this becomes academic,\n\nhowever, since nothing is of record.\n\n          We wind down on this issue, unhappily concluding that\n\n(1) the defendant early on was assiduous in pursuing materials,\n\nparticularly a written summary of expert testimony, to which he\n\nwas entitled; (2) the government blindly, blandly, wrongly, and\n\nrepeatedly claimed to have been in full compliance; (3) the\n\ncourt, when it realized the fact of noncompliance, did its best\n\nto empower defendant to get what he wanted; (4) defendant, after\n\nissuance of      the court’s order to the government to comply\n\n“forthwith,” rested on his oars; and (5) after adopting a last\n\nminute change of strategy from suppression to obtaining his own\n\nexpert, defendant confronted the court with a deeply flawed\n\nmotion for funds.   In sum, we find no abuse of discretion in the\n\ncourt’s decision.\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f             The remaining issues merit only brief discussion.               The\n\nfirst is a claim that the court committed error in allowing a\n\ncorrections officer to testify that a policy contained in a\n\npublication,        Standards      of     Employee       Conduct,   prohibited\n\ncorrections     officers     from    \"personal       communications,     sharing\n\none’s personal life\" with inmates.                Counsel had objected on the\n\ngrounds that appellant was not on trial for misconduct and that\n\nproof of any such misconduct would have required notice of\n\n\"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" in advance of trial under Rule\n\n404(b) of the Rules of Evidence.\n\n             We fail to see any basis for the argument.                  In the\n\nfirst place, both the Standards and the fact that appellant had\n\nacknowledged     them      had   already      been   admitted   into   evidence\n\nwithout objection.         This was the only evidence alluded to in the\n\nclosing argument of the prosecutor.               In the second place, one of\n\nthe   standards     read    into    evidence       without   objection     was   a\n\nprohibition of engagement in sexual conduct with an inmate, the\n\nvery conduct stimulating this prosecution.                   Objecting to this\n\nwould   be   much    the    same    as    a   reckless    driving   defendant’s\n\nobjecting to evidence that, while driving recklessly, he had\n\nalso exceeded a speed limit.                    To the extent the reference\n\nconcerned     the    bar     against      personal       communications,    such\n\npreliminary interaction between appellant and an inmate was\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fclearly, as the court ruled, part and parcel of the entire\n\ntransaction, necessary both to place conduct in context and to\n\nshed light on appellant’s state of mind.\n\n            Appellant’s remaining argument is that the court erred\n\nin   refusing   to    depart    downward     in   recognition    of    aberrant\n\nbehavior, since he was a first offender and his course of\n\nconduct    constituted    only    one   crime.      See   United      States   v.\n\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560-61 (lst Cir. 1996).                        If the\n\ncourt’s refusal was in the exercise of its discretion, we have\n\nno jurisdiction.       See United States v. Aker, 181 F.3d 167, 173\n\n(lst Cir. 1999).\n\n            In this case the court said it was not \"inclined to\n\ndepart,\" reflecting that appellant’s conduct was \"planned, was\n\ndone for a certain amount of time,\" and constituted an abuse of\n\nauthority over a person in a vulnerable position.               It also noted\n\nthe absence of any sign of remorse or repentance.\n\n            Appellant’s argument rests on the proposition that the\n\ncourt’s decision was based on an erroneous view of the law.                    It\n\nwas not.     Although we have taken the position in Grandmaison\n\nthat   aberrant      behavior    is   not    limited    to   spontaneous       or\n\nthoughtless acts, see 77 F.3d at 563, we noted that spontaneity\n\nand thoughtlessness are among the factors to be considered in\n\nassessing the totality of circumstances.               So, we add, are their\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fabsence.   The court properly considered the deliberateness and\n\nduration of appellant’s conduct,     particularly in a position of\n\ngrossly unbalanced power as between a corrections officer and an\n\ninmate.\n\n           The court’s decision being an exercise of discretion\n\nwithin its authority, we are powerless to review.\n\n           The judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

What we do know is that on the same day the court gave \"further consideration\" to defendant's \"urgent motion\" and ordered the government to provide defendant with a written summary of FBI Examiner Baechtel's testimony \"forthwith.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of this deliberate command, and against this background, one would have thought that the government would have complied without delay or at least recorded its serious efforts. One would also have thought that, armed with this weapon, defendant would have wasted no time in invoking sanctions for delay. Instead, we face only silence on this issue for the next two weeks ending with the first day of trial. On that day, March 9, 1999, defendant no longer sought to suppress evidence and testimony as sanctions for failure of compliance, but rather, in a reversal of approach, requested his own expert. If the request had been granted, the recruitment of an expert, familiarizing such expert with the record, enabling new tests to be conducted and the resulting consultations with defendant's attorney would necessarily have involved substantial delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the district court faced on March 9, after attempting to give defendant maximum timely assistance, was the ex parte motion drafted two weeks earlier. It recited that defendant had retained counsel for $6,000, had no further resources, was indigent, and that a financial statement was being prepared. It also stated that \"due to special circumstances of the [DNA] evidence, it has become necessary to dispute the same.\" It then cited the Criminal Justice Act and requested an unspecified amount \"for an investigator and an expert witness in DNA.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the court's denial of the motion, we are mindful of the fact that the burden is on the movant to demonstrate the necessity of the expert services for an adequate defense, see United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 240 (lst Cir. 1989), and that we may reverse only for abuse of discretion, see United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 218 (lst Cir. 1996). Moreover, a request must be made in a timely manner. See Moore v. Kemp, 809 F.2d 702, 710 (llth Cir. 1987)(en banc). In this case, it is clear that the court was well within the bounds of its discretion. The very first hurdle, eligibility for Criminal Justice Act funds, was not even approached. Although the motion had been prepared days before, and had referred to the preparation of an eligibility document, no financial analysis of defendant's economic circumstances was ever, so far as we know, presented. Substantive justifications were similarly lacking. There was no indication of the availability or identification of an appropriate expert or any estimate of the expert's fee and expenses. There was no enlightenment as to why an investigator was needed in addition to an expert witness. Not least, there was no explanation of where and why the assistance of an expert was needed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In oral argument, counsel stated that only on the opening day of trial did she receive a complete summary and only then did she realize the complexity of the DNA issues. But there is nothing in the filed motion to reflect this fact. And this is somewhat inconsistent with defendant's brief, where he charges that \"the prosecution never provided complete disclosure\" and that certain DNA testing results were only \"shown to counsel by Mr. Baechtel during trial recess\" - which would have been the third day of trial, March 15. Both sides agree that further materials were made available to defendant but disagree as to the time. All of this becomes academic, however, since nothing is of record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We wind down on this issue, unhappily concluding that (1) the defendant early on was assiduous in pursuing materials, particularly a written summary of expert testimony, to which he was entitled; (2) the government blindly, blandly, wrongly, and repeatedly claimed to have been in full compliance; (3) the court, when it realized the fact of noncompliance, did its best to empower defendant to get what he wanted; (4) defendant, after issuance of the court's order to the government to comply \"forthwith,\" rested on his oars; and (5) after adopting a last minute change of strategy from suppression to obtaining his own expert, defendant confronted the court with a deeply flawed motion for funds. In sum, we find no abuse of discretion in the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining issues merit only brief discussion. The first is a claim that the court committed error in allowing a corrections officer to testify that a policy contained in a publication, Standards of Employee Conduct, prohibited corrections officers from \"personal communications, sharing one's personal life\" with inmates. Counsel had objected on the grounds that appellant was not on trial for misconduct and that proof of any such misconduct would have required notice of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" in advance of trial under Rule 404(b) of the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fail to see any basis for the argument. In the first place, both the Standards and the fact that appellant had acknowledged them had already been admitted into evidence without objection. This was the only evidence alluded to in the closing argument of the prosecutor. In the second place, one of the standards read into evidence without objection was a prohibition of engagement in sexual conduct with an inmate, the very conduct stimulating this prosecution. Objecting to this would be much the same as a reckless driving defendant's objecting to evidence that, while driving recklessly, he had also exceeded a speed limit. To the extent the reference concerned the bar against personal communications, such preliminary interaction between appellant and an inmate was clearly, as the court ruled, part and parcel of the entire transaction, necessary both to place conduct in context and to shed light on appellant's state of mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's remaining argument is that the court erred in refusing to depart downward in recognition of aberrant behavior, since he was a first offender and his course of conduct constituted only one crime. See United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560-61 (lst Cir. 1996). If the court's refusal was in the exercise of its discretion, we have no jurisdiction. See United States v. Aker, 181 F.3d 167, 173 (lst Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the court said it was not \"inclined to depart,\" reflecting that appellant's conduct was \"planned, was done for a certain amount of time,\" and constituted an abuse of authority over a person in a vulnerable position. It also noted the absence of any sign of remorse or repentance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's argument rests on the proposition that the court's decision was based on an erroneous view of the law. It was not. Although we have taken the position in Grandmaison that aberrant behavior is not limited to spontaneous or thoughtless acts, see 77 F.3d at 563, we noted that spontaneity and thoughtlessness are among the factors to be considered in assessing the totality of circumstances. So, we add, are their absence. The court properly considered the deliberateness and duration of appellant's conduct, particularly in a position of grossly unbalanced power as between a corrections officer and an inmate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's decision being an exercise of discretion within its authority, we are powerless to review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTE:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Since 1993, Fed.

Vega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Circuit Judge, Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge, and Lipez, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant appellant, a correctional officer employed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, was convicted after a jury trial of engaging in a sexual act with an inmate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2243(b). The trial centered on testimony of the female inmate that, while she was in segregated custody in the Center's Special Housing Unit, defendant on several occasions had her submit to oral copulation. She had managed to save some of the sperm in a pill bottle, which was ultimately given to the FBI for DNA testing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The major issue in this appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion, filed on the first day of trial, for funds under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(e)(1), to hire a DNA expert to assist the defense. Other issues involve evidentiary and sentencing rulings. After close scrutiny of the motion history, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that the specific motion for funds that triggered the ruling at issue was the last event in a history of motions and responses which does credit to neither side. We find the government's record of less than forthcoming response to defendant's repeated requests to be unintentional, however, and conclude that defendant bears responsibility for lack of focused assertion of rights at critical times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 13, 1998, defendant filed a motion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, asking for any statements of defendant, reports of tests, and, specifically referencing Rule 16(a)(1)(E), a written summary of any expert opinion with bases and reasons therefor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The motion was granted on October 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, defendant received from the government a four page report. The first page was entitled \"Re: Receipt of DNA Analysis Results.\" It reported that FBI Examiner Baechtel had examined two semen samples and blood samples of a number of correctional officers and inmates; that one semen sample lacked enough DNA to show a DNA profile; that the other sample revealed DNA contributed by more than one person, and that the blood samples of defendant and another officer did not exclude them as potential contributors to the second DNA sample. It also noted that Baechtel explained that these results \"were not as detail [sic] as would be his court testimony on the results of his findings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was added a brief discussion of two tests performed on the second sample showing that defendant's DNA pattern, though less detectible than his fellow officer's, \"could be picked up slightly in the sample.\" Other pages listed the items examined, gave instructions for storing returned processed DNA samples, and reported Baechtel's findings concerning the extremely low probability of finding someone in the general Black, Caucasian, or Hispanic populations who could have been a contributor to the examined sample.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not content with this, defendant filed, on October 28, a request for complete reports and any expert testimony to be presented by the government. The motion was granted on October 30. On November 2, the government filed responses to a number of discovery motions. Its response to the two requests noted above was simply, \"The requested information has been made available in the discovery previously provided on October 20, 1998.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, defendant filed a \"motion in limine,\" referring in part to the Rule 16 motions, asserting that they had not been complied with, and requesting that any evidence of tests and expert testimony be excluded from the trial. On January 8, 1999, the government responded, saying only that defendant was in error in asserting that it had not complied with the early requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This response, predictably, led to a motion filed February 11, 1999, entitled, \"Urgent Motion Requesting Remedy.\" It rehearsed the familiar history, specifying the failure to supply a written summary of any expert opinion as well as test results, and requested that the government comply with the court's orders within five days or be barred from using DNA evidence and testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing happened for almost three weeks. Then, on February 22, defendant's counsel drafted the motion for funds that was filed, fifteen days later, on the first day of trial. A pre-trial conference was held on February 23. We do not know what, if any, mention was made of the motion for funds for a DNA expert for the defense. What we do know is that on the same day the court gave \"further consideration\" to defendant's \"urgent motion\" and ordered the government to provide defendant with a written summary of FBI Examiner Baechtel's testimony \"forthwith.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of this deliberate command, and against this background, one would have thought that the government would have complied without delay or at least recorded its serious efforts. One would also have thought that, armed with this weapon, defendant would have wasted no time in invoking sanctions for delay. Instead, we face only silence on this issue for the next two weeks ending with the first day of trial.

It recited that defendant had retained counsel for $6,000, had no further resources, was indigent, and that a financial statement was being prepared. It also stated that \"due to special circumstances of the [DNA] evidence, it has become necessary to dispute the same.\" It then cited the Criminal Justice Act and requested an unspecified amount \"for an investigator and an expert witness in DNA.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the court's denial of the motion, we are mindful of the fact that the burden is on the movant to demonstrate the necessity of the expert services for an adequate defense, see United States v.
