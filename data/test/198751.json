Defendant-appellant Local\r\n254, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO (\"the SEIU\")\r\nappeals from a declaratory judgment denying its right to arbitrate\r\ncertain disputes.  Pursuant to section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act,\r\n29 U.S.C.  185, the district court held that plaintiff-appellee\r\nNew England Cleaning Services, Inc. (\"NECS\") had terminated its\r\ncollective bargaining agreement with the SEIU and that the\r\neffectiveness of the termination was not an arbitrable issue.  We\r\naffirm.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing, the district court\r\nfound the following facts, which the SEIU does not contest on\r\nappeal: \r\nNECS is a maintenance and service contractor.  On March\r\n14, 1994, it entered into a collective bargaining agreement (\"the\r\nAgreement\") with the SEIU, which covered certain employees who\r\nworked at Harvard University.  Article XXVI of the Agreement was\r\ntitled \"Grievances\" and governed \"[a]ll disputes arising out of\r\nthis Agreement or its application to any situation that may arise\r\nduring the term of this Agreement.\" \r\nBy its terms, the Agreement was effective until August\r\n31, 1996; and under an \"evergreen clause,\" the Agreement would\r\ncontinue in effect thereafter until terminated by either party.  A\r\nparty could terminate the Agreement if it did so in writing more\r\nthan 60 days before the stated expiration date.  On August 2, 1994,\r\nHarvard informed NECS that it was discontinuing its use of NECS's\r\nservices.  On or about September 6, 1994, NECS mailed and faxed to\r\nthe SEIU a letter stating that it was terminating the Agreement due\r\nto Harvard's discontinuance.  NECS did not inform the Federal\r\nMediation and Conciliation Service or any state mediation agency of\r\nits termination of the Agreement.\r\nOn June 2, 1998, the SEIU wrote to NECS to request\r\ninformation about employees within the bargaining unit and a\r\nconference to discuss payment of union dues.  The letter referred\r\nto the \"collective bargaining agreement between your company and\r\nthis union,\" and stated that failure to honor SEIU's requests would\r\nresult in its submitting the disputes to arbitration in accordance \r\nwith the Article XXVI of the Agreement.  On June 16, NECS responded\r\nby stating that these grievances were untimely, because it had\r\neffectively terminated the Agreement in 1994.  On August 3, 1998,\r\nthe SEIU filed a demand for arbitration with the American\r\nArbitration Association (\"AAA\"), a not-for-profit organization that\r\nprovides voluntary dispute resolution services, claiming that NECS\r\nhad \"improperly\" terminated the Agreement.\r\nOn September 17, 1998, NECS filed a complaint in the\r\ndistrict court against both the SEIU and the AAA.  Against the\r\nSEIU, it sought a declaration pursuant to section 301 of the Taft-\r\nHartley Act, 29 U.S.C.  185, that there was no collective\r\nbargaining agreement in force between NECS and the SEIU and that\r\nNECS was not obligated to submit to arbitration.  Against the AAA,\r\nNECS sought an injunction preventing further processing of the\r\ndemand for arbitration as well as damages for compelling NECS to\r\narbitrate. \r\nFollowing an expedited evidentiary hearing, the district\r\ncourt held that NECS had properly terminated the Agreement and that\r\nthere was no collective bargaining agreement presently in effect\r\nbetween it and the SEIU.  It further declared that even if the\r\nAgreement were still in effect, the issue of the effectiveness of\r\nthe termination would not be arbitrable.  In a companion memorandum\r\nand order, the court dismissed NECS's complaint against the AAA on\r\nthe ground that its decision to process SEIU's demand for\r\narbitration was protected by arbitral immunity.  See note 1, supra.\r\nThe SEIU appeals from the former ruling. \r\n                          DISCUSSION\r\nWe review the district court's factual determinations for\r\nclear error, but afford plenary review to its formulation of\r\napplicable legal rules.  See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., Inc., 76\r\nF.3d 413, 420 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nOn appeal, the SEIU does not dispute that NECS sent a\r\nletter that was sufficient under the terms of the Agreement to\r\neffect termination.  It argues, however, that the termination was\r\nnonetheless incomplete because NECS failed to comply with the\r\nprovisions set forth in section 8(d) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \r\n159(d).  Hence, the SEIU contends, the evergreen clause kept the\r\nAgreement continuously alive.  Moreover, it argues, whether the\r\nAgreement was effectively terminated was an issue properly subject\r\nto arbitration under Section XXVI.\r\n                             I.\r\nSection 8(d) of the NLRA, titled \"Obligation to bargain\r\ncollectively,\" defines collective bargaining.  It states, in\r\nrelevant part:\r\n  [W]here there is in effect a collective-bargaining\r\ncontract covering employees in an industry affecting\r\ncommerce, the duty to bargain collectively shall also\r\nmean that no party to such contract shall terminate or\r\nmodify such contract, unless the party desiring such\r\ntermination or modification \r\n    (1) serves a written notice upon the other party to the\r\ncontract of the proposed termination or modification\r\nsixty days prior to the expiration date thereof, or in\r\nthe event such contract contains no expiration date,\r\nsixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such\r\ntermination or modification;\r\n    (2) offers to meet and confer with the other party for\r\nthe purpose of negotiating a new contract or a contract\r\ncontaining the proposed modifications;\r\n    (3) notifies the Federal Mediation and Conciliation\r\nService within thirty days after such notice of the\r\nexistence of a dispute, and simultaneously therewith\r\nnotifies any State or Territorial agency established to\r\nmediate and conciliate disputes within the State or\r\nTerritory where the dispute occurred, provided no\r\nagreement has been reached by that time;  and\r\n    (4) continues in full force and effect, without\r\nresorting to strike or lock-out, all the terms and\r\nconditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty\r\ndays after such notice is given or until the expiration\r\ndate of such contract, whichever occurs later . . .\r\n\n29 U.S.C.  159(d).\r\nThe SEIU contends that NECS did not properly terminate\r\nthe Agreement because it failed to satisfy all of these elements. \r\nThe district court found that while NECS had provided adequate\r\nnotice under section 8(d)(1), by faxing and mailing the termination\r\nletter in September, 1994, it did not notify any of the federal or\r\nstate mediation agencies referenced in section 8(d)(3).  The\r\ndistrict court did not address whether or not NECS fulfilled the\r\ntwo other requirements (offering to meet and confer and keeping the\r\nagreement in full force and effect for sixty days), and nothing in\r\nthe record sheds light on those points.\r\nIn Communication Workers of America v. Southwestern Bell\r\nTel. Co.,  713 F.2d 1118 (5th Cir. 1983), failure to notify\r\nmediation services pursuant to section 8(d)(3) was held not to\r\ndefeat the effectiveness of an employer's notice of termination. \r\nCiting case law and legislative history, the Fifth Circuit reasoned\r\nthat \r\n        . . . in requiring that the party desiring to\r\n        terminate a contract notify the mediation\r\n        services, Congress intended only to facilitate\r\n        the intervention of the FMCS when needed in\r\n        contract disputes.  We do not believe Congress\r\n        meant to enact section 8(d)(3) as a hurdle\r\n        over which a company (or union) must jump to\r\n        effectively terminate a contract if it has\r\n        timely notified its union (or company) of its\r\n        intent to terminate.   \r\n\nId. at 1127. \r\nThe purposes of the section 8(d) requirements are to\r\n\"facilitate agreement\" by giving parties to expiring collective\r\nbargaining agreements adequate time to work out their differences,\r\nfree from threats of strikes or lockouts, and to place mediation\r\nservices on notice that their assistance may be necessary.  Id. at\r\n1125-26.  While a failure to notify mediation services might have\r\nramifications for an unfair labor practice claim, it does not serve\r\nto extend a contract that could be terminated via notice under\r\nsection 8(d)(1).  See id. at 1126.  See also Procter &amp; Gamble\r\nIndep. Union of Port Ivory, N.Y. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 312\r\nF.2d 181, 189 (2d Cir. 1962) (failure to give timely notice to\r\nagencies under section 8(d)(3) did not extend the period of an\r\nexpired agreement).\r\nThe present case is very similar on its facts to\r\nSouthwestern Bell.  It was not brought to determine whether or not\r\nNECS committed an unfair labor practice or breached the duty to\r\nbargain collectively.  Rather, the relevant issue is whether the \r\nAgreement was terminated.  See id. at 1125.  The federal policies\r\nunderlying section 8(d) would not be furthered by declaring the\r\nAgreement to be prolonged in the present circumstances.  Here, as\r\nin Southwestern Bell, there was no threat of a strike or lockout. \r\nSee id.  Because Harvard had terminated its contract with NECS, it\r\ndoes not appear there were any issues of contention between NECS\r\nand the SEIU to be resolved; nor does it seem that a successor\r\nagreement was likely.  No practical need for the mediation services\r\nhas been demonstrated.  See id. at 1126.\r\nThe SEIU attempts to distinguish Southwestern Bell on the\r\nground that in that case, the employer had complied with three out\r\nof the four requirements set forth at section 8(d), while here,\r\nNECS complied with only one (the notice requirement set forth in\r\nsubsection (1)).  Even were the record clear that NECS failed to\r\ncomply with sections (2) and (4), this distinction is not\r\npersuasive.  The SEIU points to no evidence showing how it was\r\nprejudiced by NECS's failures to offer to meet and confer for\r\ncontract talks and to extend the contract for sixty days after the\r\nnotice of termination.  See id. at 1127.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, the requirements at sections 8(d)(2) and (4), like\r\nsection 8(d)(3), were not prerequisites to effecting termination of\r\nthe Agreement.  \r\n                            II.\r\nThe SEIU also argues that the district court erred in\r\nholding, as an alternative basis for decision, that even if the\r\nAgreement were still viable, the issue of the effectiveness of the\r\ntermination would not be arbitrable under Article XXVI. \r\nWhether a dispute concerning the termination of a\r\ncollective bargaining agreement should be adjudicated by an\r\narbitrator or by a court depends on whether the arbitration clause\r\nin the agreement is \"broad\" or \"narrow.\"  See Int'l Bhd. of Elec.\r\nWorkers, Local 1228 v. Freedom WLNE-TV, Inc., 760 F.2d 8, 10 (1st\r\nCir. 1985) (citing Rochdale Village, Inc. v. Public Service Emp.\r\nUnion, Local No. 80, 605 F.2d 1290, 1295-96 (2d Cir. 1979)).  Under\r\na broad arbitration clause, i.e. one covering all types of\r\ndisputes, \"all questions, including those regarding termination,\r\nwill be properly consigned to the arbitrator.\"  Id.  A \"narrow\"\r\nclause, however, covers only a limited range of disputes, such as\r\nemployee grievances.  In such cases, the court has a more involved\r\nrole, and must consider \"whether the conduct in issue is on its\r\nface within the purview of the clause.\"  Id.  We have adopted the\r\nSecond Circuit's rule that under a narrow arbitration clause\r\ncovering only employee grievances, \"the court should not compel\r\narbitration of questions of contract termination.\"  Id.\r\nHere, the district court correctly determined that the\r\narbitration clause was \"narrow.\"  Although Article XXVI had general\r\nlanguage at the beginning of the section, the four-step grievance\r\nprocess governed only grievances asserted by individual employees,\r\nnot complaints brought directly by the union.  In the absence of\r\nexplicit indication that the parties intended Article XXVI to cover\r\ncontract termination issues, we conclude that it does not.  See id. \r\nAccordingly, it was the proper role of the district court, not an\r\narbitrator, to decide whether the Agreement was effectively\r\nterminated.\r\nThe SEIU contends that the district court erred in\r\nconstruing Article XXVI to be a \"narrow\" arbitration clause.  While\r\nconceding that the first three steps in the procedure pertain to\r\nemployees' grievances, the SEIU points out that step four refers to\r\n\"parties,\" not employees.  Thus, it argues, the union could be\r\nconsidered a \"party\" and itself submit grievances to arbitration,\r\nincluding issues of contract termination.\r\nStep four does not, however, stand alone, but rather is\r\nthe final step in a process that can be initiated only by an\r\nemployee, not the union.  Whether step four permits the union to\r\ndemand arbitration on behalf of the employee, or only the \r\naggrieved employee, is academic: in either case, arbitration\r\nrelates solely to a grievance initiated by an individual employee. \r\nHence, the district court correctly determined that Article XXVI's\r\narbitration clause covers only employee grievances and does not\r\ncontemplate the arbitration of contract termination issues.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Workers, Local 1228 v. Freedom WLNE-TV, Inc., 760 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1985) (citing Rochdale Village, Inc. v. Public Service Emp. Union, Local No. 80, 605 F.2d 1290, 1295-96 (2d Cir. 1979)). Under a broad arbitration clause, i.e. one covering all types of disputes, \"all questions, including those regarding termination, will be properly consigned to the arbitrator.\" Id.  A \"narrow\" clause, however, covers only a limited range of disputes, such as employee grievances. In such cases, the court has a more involved role, and must consider \"whether the conduct in issue is on its face within the purview of the clause.\" Id. We have adopted the Second Circuit's rule that under a narrow arbitration clause covering only employee grievances, \"the court should not compel arbitration of questions of contract termination.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court correctly determined that the arbitration clause was \"narrow.\" Although Article XXVI had general language at the beginning of the section, the four-step grievance process governed only grievances asserted by individual employees, not complaints brought directly by the union. In the absence of explicit indication that the parties intended Article XXVI to cover contract termination issues, we conclude that it does not. See id. Accordingly, it was the proper role of the district court, not an arbitrator, to decide whether the Agreement was effectively terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEIU contends that the district court erred in construing Article XXVI to be a \"narrow\" arbitration clause. While conceding that the first three steps in the procedure pertain to employees' grievances, the SEIU points out that step four refers to \"parties,\" not employees. Thus, it argues, the union could be considered a \"party\" and itself submit grievances to arbitration, including issues of contract termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Step four does not, however, stand alone, but rather is the final step in a process that can be initiated only by an employee, not the union. Whether step four permits the union to demand arbitration on behalf of the employee, or only the aggrieved employee, is academic: in either case, arbitration relates solely to a grievance initiated by an individual employee. Hence, the district court correctly determined that Article XXVI's arbitration clause covers only employee grievances and does not contemplate the arbitration of contract termination issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  NECS's appeal from the district court's determination that the AAA was protected by arbitral immunity from civil liability was argued to us on the same day as the instant appeal, and is the subject of a separate opinion, issued simultaneously.

Pursuant to section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185, the district court held that plaintiff-appellee New England Cleaning Services, Inc. (\"NECS\") had terminated its collective bargaining agreement with the SEIU and that the effectiveness of the termination was not an arbitrable issue. We affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court found the following facts, which the SEIU does not contest on appeal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NECS is a maintenance and service contractor. On March 14, 1994, it entered into a collective bargaining agreement (\"the Agreement\") with the SEIU, which covered certain employees who worked at Harvard University. Article XXVI of the Agreement was titled \"Grievances\" and governed \"[a]ll disputes arising out of this Agreement or its application to any situation that may arise during the term of this Agreement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the Agreement was effective until August 31, 1996; and under an \"evergreen clause,\" the Agreement would continue in effect thereafter until terminated by either party. A party could terminate the Agreement if it did so in writing more than 60 days before the stated expiration date. On August 2, 1994, Harvard informed NECS that it was discontinuing its use of NECS's services. On or about September 6, 1994, NECS mailed and faxed to the SEIU a letter stating that it was terminating the Agreement due to Harvard's discontinuance. NECS did not inform the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or any state mediation agency of its termination of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1998, the SEIU wrote to NECS to request information about employees within the bargaining unit and a conference to discuss payment of union dues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The letter referred to the \"collective bargaining agreement between your company and this union,\" and stated that failure to honor SEIU's requests would result in its submitting the disputes to arbitration in accordance with the Article XXVI of the Agreement. On June 16, NECS responded by stating that these grievances were untimely, because it had effectively terminated the Agreement in 1994. On August 3, 1998, the SEIU filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), a not-for-profit organization that provides voluntary dispute resolution services, claiming that NECS had \"improperly\" terminated the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 1998, NECS filed a complaint in the district court against both the SEIU and the AAA. Against the SEIU, it sought a declaration pursuant to section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185, that there was no collective bargaining agreement in force between NECS and the SEIU and that NECS was not obligated to submit to arbitration. Against the AAA, NECS sought an injunction preventing further processing of the demand for arbitration as well as damages for compelling NECS to arbitrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an expedited evidentiary hearing, the district court held that NECS had properly terminated the Agreement and that there was no collective bargaining agreement presently in effect between it and the SEIU. It further declared that even if the Agreement were still in effect, the issue of the effectiveness of the termination would not be arbitrable. In a companion memorandum and order, the court dismissed NECS's complaint against the AAA on the ground that its decision to process SEIU's demand for arbitration was protected by arbitral immunity. See note <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">1,</span> supra</span>.

It argues, however, that the termination was nonetheless incomplete because NECS failed to comply with the provisions set forth in section 8(d) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 159(d). Hence, the SEIU contends, the evergreen clause kept the Agreement continuously alive.

See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370146\"><a href=\"/opinion/370146/rochdale-village-inc-v-public-service-employees-union-local-no-80/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Accordingly, it </a></span>was the proper role of the district court, not an arbitrator, to decide whether the Agreement was effectively terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEIU contends that the district court erred in construing Article XXVI to be a \"narrow\" arbitration clause. While conceding that the first three steps in the procedure pertain to employees' grievances, the SEIU points out that step four refers to \"parties,\" not employees. Thus, it argues, the union could be considered a \"party\" and itself submit grievances to arbitration, including issues of contract termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Step four does not, however, stand alone, but rather is the final step in a process that can be initiated only by an employee, not the union. Whether step four permits the union to demand arbitration on behalf of the employee, or only the aggrieved employee, is academic: in either case, arbitration relates solely to a grievance initiated by an individual employee. Hence, the district court correctly determined that Article XXVI's arbitration clause covers only employee grievances and does not contemplate the arbitration of contract termination issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  NECS's appeal from the district court's determination that the AAA was protected by arbitral immunity from civil liability was argued to us on the same day as the instant appeal, and is the subject of a separate opinion, issued simultaneously.

If no settlement is reached within 10 days after the occurrence of the act which is the subject of the grievance, either party may, by written notice to the other given within 30 days of the occurrence of such act, demand that the matter be submitted to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, subject to review by courts of competent jurisdiction.

Although the termination letter stated that NECS would no longer be providing services at the facility effective September 2, 1994, it did not set forth a date upon which the termination of the Agreement would be effective. The SEIU does not point to any events taking place within the 60 days following the termination letter that would indicate, or were affected by, whether the Agreement was in effect during that time.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
