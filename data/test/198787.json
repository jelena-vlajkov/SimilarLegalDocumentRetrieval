This case comes before the court\r\nagainst a backdrop of Puerto Rico and federal case law limiting the\r\nscope of the Puerto Rico Dealers' Act of 1964, 10 L.P.R.A.  278a-\r\nd (1994), commonly referred to as Act 75.  Act 75 was enacted to\r\n\"remedy the abusive practices of suppliers who arbitrarily\r\neliminated distributors after they had invested in the business\"\r\nand had successfully established a market in Puerto Rico for the\r\nsupplier's product or service.  Gonzlez v. Brown Group, Inc., 628\r\nF. Supp. 436, 438-39 (D.P.R. 1985) (citing Warner Lambert v.\r\nTribunal Superior, 101 D.P.R. 378, 1 P.R. Offic. Trans. 527\r\n(1973)).  The Act protects dealers only, see Roberco Inc. &amp; Roberto\r\nColn, v. Oxford Indus., Inc., 122 D.P.R. 115, 132-33 (1988)\r\n(relying on the legislative history), and provides a broad\r\ndefinition thereof, see 10 L.P.R.A.  278(a).  However, the blurred\r\nline between dealers and other middlemen in the distribution\r\nprocess, see Gonzlez, 628 F. Supp. at 439, induced a succession of\r\ncases to flesh out the controversial confines of Act 75.\r\nThus, we arrive at the case in hand.  The plaintiff-\r\nappellant, Triangle Trading Co., Inc., purports to be a dealer\r\nprotected by Act 75 with a claim against Robroy Industries for\r\nterminating its sales agreement without just cause.  The district\r\ncourt, however, concluded that Triangle is not a dealer under the\r\nAct and granted summary judgment in favor of Robroy.  For the\r\nreasons discussed below, we affirm.\r\n             I.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is an accepted \"means of determining\r\nwhether a trial is actually required.\"  Serapin v. Martnez, 119\r\nF.3d 982, 987 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch.\r\nof Med., 976 F.2d 791, 793-94 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[S]ummary\r\njudgment's role is to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and\r\nassay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is\r\nactually required.\").  Unless the party opposing a motion for\r\nsummary judgment can identify a genuine issue as to a material\r\nfact, the motion may end the case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\r\nSmith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., Inc., 76 F.3d 413, 428 (1st Cir. 1996). \r\nA \"genuine\" issue is one supported by such evidence that \"a\r\nreasonable jury, drawing favorable inferences,\" could resolve it in\r\nfavor of the nonmoving party.  Id. at 427; see also Libertad v.\r\nWelch, 53 F.3d 428, 435 (1st Cir. 1995).  \r\nTo defeat Robroy's Motion for Summary Judgment, Triangle\r\nis required to produce \"specific facts, in suitable evidentiary\r\nform, to . . . establish the presence of a trialworthy issue.\" \r\nMorris v. Government Dev't Bank of Puerto Rico, 27 F.3d 746, 748\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  \"'[C]onclusory allegations, improbable\r\ninferences, and unsupported speculation,'\" are insufficient to\r\nestablish a genuine dispute of fact.  Smith, 76 F.3d at 428\r\n(quoting Medina-Muoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8\r\n(1st Cir. 1990)); see Serapin, 119 F.3d  at 986; Libertad, 53 F.3d\r\nat 435; Morris, 27 F.3d at 748.  \r\nWe review the district court's summary judgment de novo\r\nand assess the facts in a light most favorable to Triangle.  See\r\nMorris, 27 F.3d at 748.  This standard of review permits us to\r\nuphold the district court's order of summary judgment regardless of\r\nwhether we reject or adopt its rationale, so long as an\r\n\"independently sufficient ground\" is made manifest by the record. \r\nMesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(citing Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir.\r\n1990)); see also Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,\r\n175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999); Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502,\r\n504 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n                II.  DISCUSSION\r\n                    A. FACTS\r\nThe following facts are not in dispute.  On April 22,\r\n1985, Triangle and Robroy entered into a Sales Agency Agreement, \r\nand thereby Triangle became Robroy's exclusive sales agent in\r\nPuerto Rico for certain products manufactured by Robroy.  Per the\r\nAgreement, Triangle was to \"use [its] best efforts to promote the\r\nsale\" of Robroy's products, and in exchange for all sales procured\r\nin Puerto Rico, Triangle would receive a commission. \r\nOn February 7, 1996, Robroy announced the termination of\r\nthe relationship, effective March 31, 1996.  Triangle initiated\r\nthis action on June 2, 1996.  Robroy responded with a Motion for\r\nSummary Judgment asserting that Triangle is not a \"dealer\" within\r\nthe meaning of Act 75.  See 10 L.P.R.A.  278.  After concluding\r\nthat, as a matter of law, Triangle's contention that it is a dealer\r\nunder the Act is untenable, the district court granted summary\r\njudgment in favor of Robroy on the Act 75 claim.\r\nThe appellant argues that the district court improperly\r\nweighed the evidence and made factual findings in reaching its\r\ndetermination that Triangle is not an Act 75 Dealer.  Particularly\r\ntroublesome is the district court's statement, \"the preponderance\r\nof the evidence heavily weighs against Triangle's alleged\r\ndistributor status.\"  Although we concur that the district court's\r\nchoice of words is unfortunate, any error is harmless, as we\r\nconclude that the record before us, as a matter of law, does not\r\nsupport Triangle's Act 75 dealer status.  See Houlton Citizens'\r\nCoalition, 175 F.3d at 184; Hachikian, 96 F.3d at 504; Mesnick, 950\r\nF.2d at 822.\r\nConstruing all facts in favor of Triangle, we acknowledge\r\nthat Triangle maintained a facility and dedicated two employees to\r\nRobroy sales; it invested $7,000 per year into building a customer\r\nbase for and  promotion of Robroy's products; it received a\r\ncommission for each sale in Puerto Rico, even if the customer dealt\r\nwith Robroy directly; it held some Robroy inventory in its\r\nwarehouse for which it was compensated in the form of an additional\r\ntwo percent commission; and it assisted Robroy with collection\r\nefforts.  However, we are compelled by Triangle's admissions that\r\nit did not purchase Robroy products for resale; it had no control\r\nover the price or authority to approve credit, discounts, rebates,\r\nconcessions or inducements; it did not handle billing or delivery\r\nof products; it did not pay for promotional literature; and it bore\r\nno financial risk in a sale, other than loss of commission.  In\r\naddition, Triangle identified itself as a \"commissionist\" in its\r\ntax returns and annual reports.                            B.  ACT 75\r\nThe sole issue before us is whether, on the current\r\nrecord, the district court properly concluded that Triangle was not\r\na dealer under Act 75, as a matter of law.  The statute itself does\r\nnot resolve the matter.  The Act defines a dealer as a \"person\r\nactually interested in a dealer's contract because of his having\r\neffectively in his charge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency,\r\nconcession or representation of a given merchandise or service.\" \r\n10 L.P.R.A.  278(a).  The Act expands on this definition by\r\nexplaining that a dealer's contract is a \r\n         relationship established between a dealer and\r\na principal or grantor whereby and\r\nirrespectively of the manner in which the\r\nparties may call, characterize or execute such\r\nrelationship, the former actually and\r\neffectively takes charge of the distribution\r\nof a merchandise, or of the rendering of a\r\nservice, by concession or franchise, on the\r\nmarket of Puerto Rico.\r\n\nId.  278(b).\r\nDespite the intent of the legislature to protect dealers,\r\nthe statutory definition of dealer encompasses a wide range of\r\nactors within the distribution process and threatens to extend Act\r\n75's protective sweep well beyond the end that the statute sought\r\nto achieve.  See Sudouest Import Sales Corp. v. Union Carbide, 732\r\nF.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1984) (citing San Juan Mercantile Co., v.\r\nCanadian Trans. Co., 108 D.P.R. 211, 215, 8 P.R. Offic. Trans. 218\r\n(1978)); Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 124 (citing J. Soler Motors, Inc.\r\nv. Kaiser Keep Int'l Corp., 108 D.P.R. 134, 139, 8 P.R. Offic.\r\nTrans. 138 (1978)).  Consequently, the courts directed their\r\nattention to the key requirement that the dealer \"actually and\r\neffectively take[] charge of the distribution.\"  In other words,\r\nthe core question is whether the dealer obtained a certain level of\r\ncontrol over the distribution of the supplier's products in Puerto\r\nRico.  See EBI, Inc. v. Gator Indus., Inc., 807 F.2d 1, 2-4 (1st\r\nCir. 1986); Sudouest, 732 F.3d at 15-17; Kolthoff v. Fernndez,\r\n1996 WL 288486, at *3-*6 (D.P.R. 1996); Jorge Rivera Surillo &amp; Co.,\r\nInc. v. Cerro Copper Prods. Co., 885 F. Supp. 358, 361-62 (D.P.R.\r\n1995); Gonzlez, 628 F. Supp. at 439-41; Mario R. Franceschini,\r\nInc. v. Riley Co., 591 F. Supp. 414, 415-20 (D.P.R. 1984); Cruz\r\nRamos, 445 F. Supp. at 984-85; Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 125-26\r\n(citing Cruz Ramos v. Brother Int'l Corp., 445 F. Supp. 983 (D.P.R.\r\n1978)); San Juan Mercantile, 108 D.P.R. at 215, 8 P.R. Offic.\r\nTrans. 218; J. Soler Motors, 108 D.P.R. at 139, 8 P.R. Offic.\r\nTrans. 138.\r\nAlthough we previously suggested criteria by which to\r\nmeasure this level of control in Sudouest Import Sales Corp. v.\r\nUnion Carbide, 732 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1984), and EBI, Inc. v. Gator\r\nIndustries, Inc., 807 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1986), we defer to the\r\nanalysis set out in the 1988 opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico in Roberco, Inc. &amp; Roberto Coln v. Oxford Industries, Inc.,\r\n122 D.P.R. 115.  The Roberco court reviewed the legislative history\r\nof Act 75 and the existing case law, of both Puerto Rico and\r\nfederal courts, to develop an inclusive list of factors to be\r\nweighed equally in consideration of whether a party has the\r\nrequisite autonomy to be a dealer under the Act.  See Roberco, 122\r\nD.P.R. at 120-32.  Observing that something beyond \"mere contact\r\nwith the product as it moves down the chain from manufacturer to\r\nsupplier\" is necessary, the court restricted the definition of a\r\ndealer to \"an independent entrepreneur who has established a\r\ncontinuing relationship, either fixed or indeterminate, with\r\nanother principal for the distribution of a product or\r\nservice. . . . geared to create, develop, and coordinate a market\r\nand to obtain new clients.\"  Id. at 131.  From this definition, the\r\ncourt derived the following characteristics of a dealership: \r\npromotion of the product, keeping an inventory, fixing prices,\r\ndelivery and billing responsibilities, authority to extend credit,\r\nadvertising campaigns, assumption of risk, purchasing the product,\r\nmaintaining facilities, and offering product-related services to\r\nclients.  See id. at 131-32.\r\n             C.  TRIANGLE'S STATUS\r\nWe agree with the appellant that our examination does not\r\nend with the fact that the contract between the parties is entitled\r\na \"Sales Agency Agreement,\" see 10 L.P.R.A.  278(b), but it\r\ncertainly is a point from which to begin, particularly as the\r\nundisputed evidence shows that Triangle identified itself as a\r\ncommissionist for tax purposes.  Although we find some support in\r\nthe record for Triangle's contention that it developed a market for\r\nRobroy and made a financial investment, those facts alone are not\r\ndeterminative as they apply to any sales agent or middleman.  See\r\nGonzlez, 628 F. Supp. at 440; see also Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 132\r\n(\"No single factor is conclusive by itself and none has more weight\r\nor importance than the others.\").  Instead, we are swayed by the\r\nfacts which demonstrate a lack of the requisite control of the\r\ndistribution chain.\r\nIn Roberco, the plaintiff obtained purchase orders in\r\nPuerto Rico and forwarded them to the defendant on a commission\r\nbasis.  The commissions were based exclusively on sales, regardless\r\nof whether the orders were billed later.  The plaintiff did not buy\r\nthe defendant's merchandise to resell it or keep an inventory of\r\nthe merchandise, and it was therefore not responsible for\r\ndelivering the merchandise.  The plaintiff's contribution to\r\ndefendant's advertising was minimal, and in fact most ads placed by\r\nRoberco were for the company itself.  The plaintiff had no\r\ndiscretion to extend credit to its customers, nor did the plaintiff\r\nhandle the billing.  See Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 119-21.  Similarly,\r\nEBI involved a sales representative that \"ma[de] no investment in\r\npromotion, inventories, or facilities; [and] ha[d] no\r\nresponsibilities for credit, collections, shipment or\r\ndeliveries. . . .\"  EBI, 807 F.2d at 4; see also Gonzlez, 628 F.\r\nSupp. at 437-38, 441 (holding that plaintiff who hired no\r\nemployees, carried no inventory, rented no warehouse, and did no\r\nadvertising, is not an Act 75 dealer).\r\nTriangle more closely resembles the plaintiffs in\r\nFranceschini and Kolthoff, who arguably invested in the development\r\nof a market and promotion of the suppliers' product, but \"'assumed\r\nneither the risks nor the responsibilities that go with an Act 75\r\ndealership.'\"  Gonzlez, 628 F. Supp. at 441 (quoting Franceschini,\r\n591 F. Supp. at 420).  The plaintiff in Franceschini, like\r\nTriangle, invested in the business by hiring employees and\r\nadvertising the product, but did not have authority to approve or\r\nreject orders, fix prices, or extend credit.  In addition, it did\r\nnot bill the customers or handle deliveries.  See Franceschini, 591\r\nF. Supp. at 414-15.   Kolthoff was not a dealer because he could\r\nnot close deals, determine prices, or grant discounts or credit. \r\nLikewise, he did not purchase products for resale and assumed no\r\ncredit risk.  See Kolthoff, 1996 WL 288486, at *5.  The distinctive\r\nfact that Triangle actually had a warehouse where it would hold\r\nRobroy's products is insignificant once one accounts for the\r\ncontractual requirement that Robroy pay Triangle for this service.\r\nBased on the record, we are compelled to conclude that\r\nTriangle is indistinguishable from \"route or area salesmen who,\r\nwithout making any investment or commitment or taking any risk\r\nother than the value of their own time, are permitted to take\r\norders and are paid commissions on orders finally accepted by the\r\nprincipal.\"  EBI, 807 F.2d at 3.  We concur with the district court\r\nthat, as a matter of law, Triangle is not a dealer and does not\r\nqualify for protection under Act 75.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

Triangle initiated this action on June 2, 1996. Robroy responded with a Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that Triangle is not a \"dealer\" within the meaning of Act 75. See 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278. After concluding that, as a matter of law, Triangle's contention that it is a dealer under the Act is untenable, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Robroy on the Act 75 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that the district court improperly weighed the evidence and made factual findings in reaching its determination that Triangle is not an Act 75 Dealer. Particularly troublesome is the district court's statement, \"the preponderance of the evidence heavily weighs against Triangle's alleged distributor status.\" Although we concur that the district court's choice of words is unfortunate, any error is harmless, as we conclude that the record before us, as a matter of law, does not support Triangle's Act 75 dealer status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Houlton Citizens' Coalition, 175 F.3d at 184; Hachikian, 96 F.3d at 504; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construing all facts in favor of Triangle, we acknowledge that Triangle maintained a facility and dedicated two employees to Robroy sales; it invested $7,000 per year into building a customer base for and promotion of Robroy's products; it received a commission for each sale in Puerto Rico, even if the customer dealt with Robroy directly; it held some Robroy inventory in its warehouse for which it was compensated in the form of an additional two percent commission; and it assisted Robroy with collection efforts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> However, we are compelled by Triangle's admissions that it did not purchase Robroy products for resale; it had no control over the price or authority to approve credit, discounts, rebates, concessions or inducements; it did not handle billing or delivery of products; it did not pay for promotional literature; and it bore no financial risk in a sale, other than loss of commission. In addition, Triangle identified itself as a \"commissionist\" in its tax returns and annual reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. ACT 75</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue before us is whether, on the current record, the district court properly concluded that Triangle was not a dealer under Act 75, as a matter of law. The statute itself does not resolve the matter. The Act defines a dealer as a \"person actually interested in a dealer's contract because of his having effectively in his charge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency, concession or representation of a given merchandise or service.\" 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278(a). The Act expands on this definition by explaining that a dealer's contract is a</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">relationship established between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute such relationship, the former actually and effectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or of the rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the market of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 278(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the intent of the legislature to protect dealers, the statutory definition of dealer encompasses a wide range of actors within the distribution process and threatens to extend Act 75's protective sweep well beyond the end that the statute sought to achieve. See Sudouest Import Sales Corp. v. Union Carbide, 732 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1984) (citing San Juan Mercantile Co., v. Canadian Trans. Co., 108 D.P.R. 211, 215, 1978 WL 48787 (1978) 8 P.R. Offic.

Consequently, the courts directed their attention to the key requirement that the dealer \"actually and effectively take[] charge of the distribution.\" In other words, the core question is whether the dealer obtained a certain level of control over the distribution of the supplier's products in Puerto Rico. See EBI, Inc. v. Gator Indus., Inc., 807 F.2d 1, 2-4 (1st Cir. 1986); Sudouest, 732 F.3d at 15-17; Kolthoff v. Fernandez, 1996 WL 288486, at *3-*6 (D.P.R. 1996); Jorge Rivera Surillo &amp; Co., Inc. v. Cerro Copper Prods. Co., 885 F. Supp. 358, 361-62 (D.P.R. 1995); Gonzalez, 628 F. Supp. at 439-41; Mario R.

Trans. 138.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we previously suggested criteria by which to measure this level of control in Sudouest Import Sales Corp. v. Union Carbide, 732 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1984), and EBI, Inc. v. Gator Industries, Inc., 807 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1986), we defer to the analysis set out in the 1988 opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in Roberco, Inc. &amp; Roberto Colon v. Oxford Industries, Inc., 122 D.P.R. 115. The Roberco court reviewed the legislative history of Act 75 and the existing case law, of both Puerto Rico and federal courts, to develop an inclusive list of factors to be weighed equally in consideration of whether a party has the requisite autonomy to be a dealer under the Act. See Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 120-32. Observing that something beyond \"mere contact with the product as it moves down the chain from manufacturer to supplier\" is necessary, the court restricted the definition of a dealer to \"an independent entrepreneur who has established a continuing relationship, either fixed or indeterminate, with another principal for the distribution of a product or service. . . . geared to create, develop, and coordinate a market and to obtain new clients.\" Id. at 131. From this definition, the court derived the following characteristics of a dealership: promotion of the product, keeping an inventory, fixing prices, delivery and billing responsibilities, authority to extend credit, advertising campaigns, assumption of risk, purchasing the product, maintaining facilities, and offering product-related services to clients. See id. at 131-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. TRIANGLE'S STATUS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellant that our examination does not end with the fact that the contract between the parties is entitled a \"Sales Agency Agreement,\" see 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278(b), but it certainly is a point from which to begin, particularly as the undisputed evidence shows that Triangle identified itself as a commissionist for tax purposes. Although we find some support in the record for Triangle's contention that it developed a market for Robroy and made a financial investment, those facts alone are not determinative as they apply to any sales agent or middleman. See Gonzalez, 628 F. Supp. at 440; see also Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 132 (\"No single factor is conclusive by itself and none has more weight or importance than the others.\"). Instead, we are swayed by the facts which demonstrate a lack of the requisite control of the distribution chain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Roberco, the plaintiff obtained purchase orders in Puerto Rico and forwarded them to the defendant on a commission basis. The commissions were based exclusively on sales, regardless of whether the orders were billed later. The plaintiff did not buy the defendant's merchandise to resell it or keep an inventory of the merchandise, and it was therefore not responsible for delivering the merchandise. The plaintiff's contribution to defendant's advertising was minimal, and in fact most ads placed by Roberco were for the company itself. The plaintiff had no discretion to extend credit to its customers, nor did the plaintiff handle the billing. See Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 119-21. Similarly, EBI involved a sales representative that \"ma[de] no investment in promotion, inventories, or facilities; [and] ha[d] no responsibilities for credit, collections, shipment or deliveries. . . .\" EBI, 807 F.2d at 4; see also Gonzalez, 628 F. Supp. at 437-38, 441 (holding that plaintiff who hired no employees, carried no inventory, rented no warehouse, and did no advertising, is not an Act 75 dealer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Triangle more closely resembles the plaintiffs in Franceschini and Kolthoff, who arguably invested in the development of a market and promotion of the suppliers' product, but \"'assumed neither the risks nor the responsibilities that go with an Act 75 dealership.'\" Gonzalez, 628 F. Supp. at 441 (quoting Franceschini, 591 F. Supp. at 420). The plaintiff in Franceschini, like Triangle, invested in the business by hiring employees and advertising the product, but did not have authority to approve or reject orders, fix prices, or extend credit. In addition, it did not bill the customers or handle deliveries. See Franceschini, 591 F. Supp. at 414-15. Kolthoff was not a dealer because he could not close deals, determine prices, or grant discounts or credit. Likewise, he did not purchase products for resale and assumed no credit risk. See Kolthoff, 1996 WL 288486, at *5. The distinctive fact that Triangle actually had a warehouse where it would hold Robroy's products is insignificant once one accounts for the contractual requirement that Robroy pay Triangle for this service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record, we are compelled to conclude that Triangle is indistinguishable from \"route or area salesmen who, without making any investment or commitment or taking any risk other than the value of their own time, are permitted to take orders and are paid commissions on orders finally accepted by the principal.\" EBI, 807 F.2d at 3. We concur with the district court that, as a matter of law, Triangle is not a dealer and does not qualify for protection under Act 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Act 75 controls the method by which a supplier may terminate its relationship with a dealer.

Per the Agreement, Triangle was to \"use [its] best efforts to promote the sale\" of Robroy's products, and in exchange for all sales procured in Puerto Rico, Triangle would receive a commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 1996, Robroy announced the termination of the relationship, effective March 31, 1996. Triangle initiated this action on June 2, 1996. Robroy responded with a Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that Triangle is not a \"dealer\" within the meaning of Act 75. See 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278. After concluding that, as a matter of law, Triangle's contention that it is a dealer under the Act is untenable, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Robroy on the Act 75 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that the district court improperly weighed the evidence and made factual findings in reaching its determination that Triangle is not an Act 75 Dealer. Particularly troublesome is the district court's statement, \"the preponderance of the evidence heavily weighs against Triangle's alleged distributor status.\" Although we concur that the district court's choice of words is unfortunate, any error is harmless, as we conclude that the record before us, as a matter of law, does not support Triangle's Act 75 dealer status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Houlton Citizens' <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763565\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Coalition,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/763565/houlton-citizens-coalition-v-town-of-houlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196973\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hachikian,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196973/hachikian-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mesnick,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construing all facts in favor of Triangle, we acknowledge that Triangle maintained a facility and dedicated two employees to Robroy sales; it invested $7,000 per year into building a customer base for and promotion of Robroy's products; it received a commission for each sale in Puerto Rico, even if the customer dealt with Robroy directly; it held some Robroy inventory in its warehouse for which it was compensated in the form of an additional two percent commission; and it assisted Robroy with collection efforts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> However, we are compelled by Triangle's admissions that it did not purchase Robroy products for resale; it had no control over the price or authority to approve credit, discounts, rebates, concessions or inducements; it did not handle billing or delivery of products; it did not pay for promotional literature; and it bore no financial risk in a sale, other than loss of commission. In addition, Triangle identified itself as a \"commissionist\" in its tax returns and annual reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. ACT 75</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue before us is whether, on the current record, the district court properly concluded that Triangle was not a dealer under Act 75, as a matter of law. The statute itself does not resolve the matter. The Act defines a dealer as a \"person actually interested in a dealer's contract because of his having effectively in his charge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency, concession or representation of a given merchandise or service.\" 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278(a). The Act expands on this definition by explaining that a dealer's contract is a</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">relationship established between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute such relationship, the former actually and effectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or of the rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the market of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 278(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the intent of the legislature to protect dealers, the statutory definition of dealer encompasses a wide range of actors within the distribution process and threatens to extend Act 75's protective sweep well beyond the end that the statute sought to achieve.

Consequently, the courts directed their attention to the key requirement that the dealer \"actually and effectively take[] charge of the distribution.\" In other words, the core question is whether the dealer obtained a certain level of control over the distribution of the supplier's products in Puerto Rico.

Oxford Industries, Inc., 122 D.P.R. 115. The Roberco court reviewed the legislative history of Act 75 and the existing case law, of both Puerto Rico and federal courts, to develop an inclusive list of factors to be weighed equally in consideration of whether a party has the requisite autonomy to be a dealer under the Act. See Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 120-32. Observing that something beyond \"mere contact with the product as it moves down the chain from manufacturer to supplier\" is necessary, the court restricted the definition of a dealer to \"an independent entrepreneur who has established a continuing relationship, either fixed or indeterminate, with another principal for the distribution of a product or service. . . . geared to create, develop, and coordinate a market and to obtain new clients.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480418\"><a href=\"/opinion/480418/ebi-inc-v-gator-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 131. </a></span>From this definition, the court derived the following characteristics of a dealership: promotion of the product, keeping an inventory, fixing prices, delivery and billing responsibilities, authority to extend credit, advertising campaigns, assumption of risk, purchasing the product, maintaining facilities, and offering product-related services to clients. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480418\"><a href=\"/opinion/480418/ebi-inc-v-gator-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 131-32.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. TRIANGLE'S STATUS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellant that our examination does not end with the fact that the contract between the parties is entitled a \"Sales Agency Agreement,\" see 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278(b), but it certainly is a point from which to begin, particularly as the undisputed evidence shows that Triangle identified itself as a commissionist for tax purposes. Although we find some support in the record for Triangle's contention that it developed a market for Robroy and made a financial investment, those facts alone are not determinative as they apply to any sales agent or middleman. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596097\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gonzalez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2596097/gonzalez-v-brown-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Instead, we are swayed by the facts which demonstrate a lack of the requisite control of the distribution chain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Roberco, the plaintiff obtained purchase orders in Puerto Rico and forwarded them to the defendant on a commission basis. The commissions were based exclusively on sales, regardless of whether the orders were billed later. The plaintiff did not buy the defendant's merchandise to resell it or keep an inventory of the merchandise, and it was therefore not responsible for delivering the merchandise. The plaintiff's contribution to defendant's advertising was minimal, and in fact most ads placed by Roberco were for the company itself. The plaintiff had no discretion to extend credit to its customers, nor did the plaintiff handle the billing. See Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 119-21. Similarly, EBI involved a sales representative that \"ma[de] no investment in promotion, inventories, or facilities; [and] ha[d] no responsibilities for credit, collections, shipment or deliveries. . . .\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480418\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">EBI,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/480418/ebi-inc-v-gator-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596097\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gonzalez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2596097/gonzalez-v-brown-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>). The plaintiff in Franceschini, like Triangle, invested in the business by hiring employees and advertising the product, but did not have authority to approve or reject orders, fix prices, or extend credit. In addition, it did not bill the customers or handle deliveries.

Likewise, he did not purchase products for resale and assumed no credit risk. See Kolthoff, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">288486</span></span>, at *5.
