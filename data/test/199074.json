Crazy Bob's, a discount computer\n\nproducts     store     in    Wakefield,      Massachusetts,        sold     stolen\n\nMicrosoft software.          The owners of Crazy Bob's, Robert Simons\n\nand his wife Maxine,1 and several employees were charged with,\n\ninter    alia,    a   conspiracy     to    transport      stolen    property    in\n\ninterstate       commerce.        Robert   and   Crazy     Bob's    buyer,    Marc\n\nRosenberg, pled guilty and now appeal their sentences.                      Maxine\n\nand Gerald Coviello (a friend of Robert's who sold some of the\n\nstolen    merchandise)        went   to    trial,   and    now     appeal    their\n\nconvictions and sentences.\n\n           The central issue, common to all appellants, is whether\n\nthe district court erred in calculating the \"loss\" caused by the\n\ncrime under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. See USSG §\n\n2B1.1(b)(1).          The appellants also assert other sentencing\n\nerrors: (1) the Simonses and Rosengard argue that they were not\n\n\"in the business\" of receiving and selling stolen property, id.\n\n§   2B1.1(b)(4)(B);         (2)   Robert   argues   that     restitution       and\n\nsupervised release should not be imposed because of errors in\n\nhis Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 colloquy; (3) Coviello argues that he\n\nwas a \"minimal\" or \"minor\" participant, USSG § 3B1.2; and (4)\n\n\n\n     1\n     For the sake of convenience, we will identify the Simonses\nby their first names, Robert and Maxine, following the\nconvention used by their counsel.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fRosengard    claims      he   was    entitled          to     a    greater    downward\n\ndeparture.     Maxine and Coviello raise trial errors as well,\n\nclaiming    that   the    court      should      have        dismissed     the   stolen\n\nproperty    counts    because       the    physical          discs    containing    the\n\nsoftware were \"virtually worthless\" and that the court should\n\nnot have given a \"willful blindness\" jury instruction.                           Maxine\n\nalso challenges the district court's ruling that the government\n\ncould impeach a witness by establishing that the witness had\n\nbeen represented by Maxine's trial counsel during grand jury\n\nproceedings.       We reject all of these arguments and affirm the\n\nconvictions and sentences.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            During the 1990s, Robert and Maxine Simons operated a\n\ndiscount computer products outlet in Wakefield, Massachusetts\n\nknown as Crazy Bob's.           In 1994, Robert and Maxine met David\n\nLaPointe    and,   acting     through      Crazy       Bob's,      began     purchasing\n\ncomputer diskettes, tapes, and CDs which had been stolen from\n\nKAO Infosystems (\"KAO\"), a computer disc manufacturer.                         LaPointe\n\nobtained the products through several KAO employees, including\n\nJohn   Costello.      Each    shipment          of    stolen       goods   was   either\n\ndelivered    by    LaPointe     to    Crazy          Bob's    or     picked    up   from\n\nCostello's shed by Marc Rosengard, a long-time employee and\n\nbuyer for Crazy Bob's.\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                  In    June    1996,    LaPointe     obtained     more   than   10,000\n\nMicrosoft Windows 95 (\"Windows\") CD-ROMS, which were sold to\n\nCrazy Bob's for fifteen dollars each even though the wholesale\n\nvalue was approximately $165 per disc.                        Almost all of the discs\n\nwere    sold       to     Crazy     Bob's     without   any    legitimate      packaging\n\nmaterials,             such    as   Microsoft     boxes,     licenses,    manuals,     or\n\ncertificates of authenticity.                   Instead, the discs were packaged\n\non spindles of 100 discs each and shrink-wrapped in plastic.\n\nCrazy Bob's then resold the stolen Windows discs to companies in\n\nGreat Britain and California.                   LaPointe told Crazy Bob's buyer\n\nRosengard that he insisted on cash for the Windows discs so that\n\nthere would be no \"paper trail.\"                     This request was approved by\n\nBob    and    Maxine          Simons    and   more    than    $240,000    in   cash   was\n\ndelivered to LaPointe over the course of several transactions,\n\nmostly by Rosengard.                Maxine often structured these payments so\n\nthat each check for cash would be for less than $10,000, thereby\n\navoiding the requirement that banks file with the Treasury\n\nDepartment a currency transaction report of any cash transaction\n\nof $10,000 or more.\n\n                  In December 1996, LaPointe met with Rosengard and\n\nRobert Simons to negotiate the sale of at least 32,000 Microsoft\n\nOffice       97    Professional         Edition      (\"Office\")    CD-ROMs.       Robert\n\nagreed to pay LaPointe in a series of installment payments\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fbecause, as Robert explained, he would have to sell the discs\n\nslowly to avoid attracting suspicion.           Maxine Simons then wrote\n\na $116,000 check to Costello for his role in obtaining the\n\nstolen property, falsely documenting his status with the IRS so\n\nthat he would appear to be a Crazy Bob's employee.               Like the\n\nWindows   discs,   the   Office   discs   did    not   contain   Microsoft\n\npackaging materials and were on spindles of 100 discs apiece.\n\nAs the stolen discs did not include the \"key codes\" necessary to\n\naccess the software, Rosengard and other Crazy Bob's employees\n\ndevised a formula for creating their own key codes and printed\n\nkey code stickers.       Between February and July 1997 Crazy Bob's\n\nsold a total of 13,962 Office discs, at prices ranging from\n\nfifty to one hundred dollars per disc, for a total of $908,108.\n\n\n\n            On March 22, 1997, Costello was arrested by the FBI.\n\nAt Robert's direction, Crazy Bob's began executing documents to\n\ntransfer $425,000 of stolen property proceeds from Crazy Bob's\n\nbank account through another account, which was then closed so\n\nthat checks could be distributed to Bob, Maxine, and their\n\nchildren.    When the FBI interviewed Maxine about Costello, she\n\ninformed them that he was a \"consultant\" for the store and that\n\nLaPointe had sold back-up tapes to Crazy Bob's on one occasion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           Crazy Bob's was able to remove at least 8,000 of the\n\nOffice discs before the FBI obtained a search warrant and seized\n\nthe remainder.       Robert then offered to sell the 8,000 discs to\n\nJasper \"Jay\" Knabb, who operated a computer store in North\n\nCarolina, informing him that they were \"hot\" and would need to\n\nbe sold out of the country and for cash.                 Knabb reported these\n\nconversations       to   Microsoft     and   to    the   FBI,   and   agreed    to\n\ncooperate.       Knabb then told Robert that he had a customer in\n\nSouth America who would buy the discs.                    After settling on a\n\nprice, they agreed that defendant Gerald Coviello (a friend of\n\nRobert's) would handle the transaction and receive ten dollars\n\nper disc (which amounted to over $80,000) for his troubles.\n\nCoviello negotiated a cash payment from Knabb and set a meeting\n\nin a restaurant parking lot to deliver the discs.                       At that\n\nmeeting, he was arrested.\n\n           Robert, Maxine, Coviello and Rosengard (along with\n\nthree   co-defendants       not   parties     to    this    appeal)   were     all\n\nindicted     for    conspiracy    to     transport       stolen   property     in\n\ninterstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.                   Robert,\n\nMaxine,    and     Rosengard   were    charged     with    sixteen    counts   of\n\ninterstate transportation of stolen property.                   See id. § 2314.\n\nRobert and Maxine were also charged with one count of conspiracy\n\nto launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and eleven\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fcounts    of    money    laundering,      in   violation   of   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n1956(a)(1)(B)(i).2       Finally, Maxine was charged with three counts\n\nof structuring to evade reporting requirements, in violation of\n\n31 U.S.C. § 5324, and one count of making false statements to\n\nfederal agents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.\n\n           Robert and Rosengard pled guilty and were sentenced to\n\nseventy        months    and     thirty-three       months      imprisonment,\n\nrespectively.      Maxine and Coviello were convicted on all counts\n\nfollowing a jury trial, and were sentenced to thirty-three and\n\nthirty months each.\n\n           We will first address the loss calculation issue,\n\nraised by all appellants, and then turn to the other sentencing\n\nand trial error issues.\n\n                             II. Loss Calculation\n\n           The Simonses, Coviello and Rosengard all argue that the\n\ndistrict court misapplied Section 2B1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.       Section 2B1.1(b)(1) provides for enhancements to\n\nthe base offense level in cases involving the transfer of stolen\n\nproperty depending on the amount of \"loss.\"                  The application\n\nnotes explain that \"'[l]oss' means the value of the property\n\ntaken,    damaged,      or   destroyed\"    and   that   \"[o]rdinarily,   when\n\n\n\n    2The money laundering counts against Maxine were dismissed\nprior to trial.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fproperty is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market value\n\nof   the    particular    property     at     issue.\"        USSG    §    2B1.1(B)(1)\n\n(Comment n.2); see also United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa, 34\n\nF.3d 33, 43 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Skrodzki, 9 F.3d\n\n198, 203 (1st Cir. 1993).             We note that \"the loss need not be\n\ndetermined with precision\" and that the court need only \"make a\n\nreasonable       estimate      of     the     loss,        given    the    available\n\ninformation.\" USSG § 2B1.1 (Comment n.3); see also United States\n\nv. Paquette, 201 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             The district court calculated the loss by considering\n\nthe \"valu[e] of the property at the time it [was] taken from the\n\nrightful owner.\"         Applying this standard, the court determined\n\nthat Microsoft was the owner of the property for purposes of\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1) (despite the fact that the discs were stolen from\n\nKAO) and that the loss should be based on Microsoft's wholesale\n\nprices for these products.            Relying on testimony from Microsoft\n\nand one of its large wholesale customers, the court concluded\n\nthat    Microsoft      could   have    sold     the    32,000       Office    CD-ROMs\n\nwholesale for $486 each and that it could have sold the 10,000\n\nWindows CD-ROMs wholesale for $165 each.                    Thus the loss caused\n\nby the Simonses and Rosengard through the sale of all of these\n\ndiscs      was   $17   million,     resulting         in    the     seventeen-level\n\nenhancement that applies to loss between $10 and $20 million.\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fSee § 2B1.1(B)(1)(R).     The court found Coviello responsible only\n\nfor the 8,000 Office discs he attempted to sell, resulting in a\n\nloss figure of $3.9 million and a sentencing enhancement of 15\n\nlevels.   See § 2B1.1(B)(1)(P) (15 level enhancement for loss\n\nbetween $2.5 and $5 million).\n\n          The appellants' challenges to the loss calculation fall\n\ninto   three   basic   categories.      First,   they   claim   that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in identifying Microsoft (rather than KAO)\n\nas the victim, resulting in a higher loss figure.                Second,\n\naccepting the \"fair market value\" approach to loss calculation\n\nused by the district court, the appellants make several related\n\narguments that the discs had a lower market value than the\n\ndistrict court identified.      Third, the appellants suggest that\n\nsome method other than the \"fair market value\" approach should\n\nhave been employed.\n\n          We analyze each of these claims in turn, keeping in\n\nmind that the defendants bear a \"heavy burden of demonstrating\n\nthat the district court finding is clearly erroneous,\" and that\n\nloss does not have to be determined with precision.             Skrodzki,\n\n9 F.3d at 203; see also United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1238,\n\n1283 (1st Cir. 1992) (district court's finding reversed only if\n\n\"outside the universe of acceptable computations\").               As the\n\nSimonses and Rosengard received the seventeen-point enhancement\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fapplicable to losses between $10 and $20 million, they can only\n\nprevail on appeal if they demonstrate that the loss was clearly\n\nless than $10 million rather than the $17 million the district\n\ncourt identified.    Similarly, as Coviello received the fifteen\n\npoint enhancement for losses falling within the $2.5 to $5\n\nmillion range, he can only prevail by showing that the loss was\n\nbelow $2.5 million rather than the $3.9 million the district\n\ncourt found.\n\n\n\n\nA. Identifying the Victim\n\n            The appellants claim that because the CD-ROMs were\n\nstolen from the custody of KAO, and because KAO was required to\n\nindemnify Microsoft for lost discs, the \"victim\" in this case\n\nwas KAO, and the district court should have considered the loss\n\ncaused to it, not to Microsoft.    There is much at stake in this\n\nargument.    Although Microsoft sold Windows for $165 and Office\n\nfor $486, the fair market value of the discs to KAO would be no\n\nmore than the $7 they charged Microsoft for the duplication\n\nservices.    Indeed, the appellants even argue that the discs were\n\n\"overages\" and destined for destruction, having no market value\n\nto KAO whatsoever.     They also note that KAO could replace the\n\ndiscs for thirty-six cents per unit.\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f             The argument that KAO should have been treated as the\n\nvictim is flawed in several ways.         First, there was sufficient\n\nevidence for the district court to conclude that Microsoft had\n\na more significant ownership interest in the CD-ROMs.             Kristi\n\nBankhead, a product ID specialist at Microsoft, testified that\n\nalthough KAO was under contract to manufacture and package the\n\ndiscs, Microsoft retained ownership rights in the software.            The\n\nFacility Agreement between KAO and Microsoft provides additional\n\nsupport, as it states that the entire inventory of discs is held\n\nby KAO \"exclusively for distribution to Customers as authorized\n\nby Microsoft and for no other purpose, use or disposition,\n\nexcept as may be directed in writing by Microsoft.\"             While the\n\nFacility Agreement did give KAO some ownership interest in the\n\nphysical CD-ROMs in its possession, the substantial value here\n\nwas not the discs themselves, but the computer programs on those\n\ndiscs--intellectual property that plainly belonged to Microsoft.\n\n             Appellants attempt to defeat this finding by noting\n\nthat the Agreement gave KAO some interest in the physical CD-\n\nROMs, and that the Agreement required KAO to indemnify Microsoft\n\nfor   lost    or   damaged   product,    typically   at   the   rate   of\n\nMicrosoft's replacement cost.3          However, the district court is\n\n\n      3\n      Notably, the appellants simply ignore the most relevant\n\"risk of loss provision\" in the Agreement--the one that requires\nKAO to pay 55% of the retail price of the software (rather than\n\n                                  -12-\n\fnot charged with resolving a contract dispute.                 It is charged\n\nwith   assessing   the   value   of   the    property     so    that   the   §\n\n2B1.1(b)(1) determination comports with the magnitude of the\n\ntheft.    Whatever the arrangements between KAO and Microsoft on\n\nthe duplication of thirty-six cent discs, those discs contained\n\nintellectual property, indisputably belonging to Microsoft, with\n\na wholesale market value of $168 for Windows and $486 for\n\nOffice.   It was this intellectual property that Crazy Bob's was\n\ninterested in buying and selling, not the KAO plastic on which\n\nit was contained.     Treating KAO as the \"victim\" and measuring\n\nloss in terms of the value of the CD duplication services rather\n\nthan the value of the intellectual property would simply be\n\nignoring reality.     See United States v. Lyons, 992 F.2d 1029,\n\n1033   (10th   Cir.   1993)   (\"In    an    age   where   the     intangible\n\nintellectual property value of goods may vastly exceed the\n\nintrinsic worth of accompanying tangible goods, application of\n\nthe letter and intent of the Sentencing Guidelines mandates that\n\ncourts include intangible value when thefts of tangible objects\n\noccur.\").\n\nB. Calculation of Market Value\n\n\n\n\nthe mere replacement costs) if KAO fails to take \"reasonable\nsecurity precautions\" or if it loses more than 25,000 copies of\nsoftware.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            The appellants argue that even if Microsoft owned the\n\ndiscs, the court erred in relying on the price of $486 per unit\n\nof Office and $165 per unit of Windows.                           Appellants advance\n\nseveral related arguments as to why the \"fair market value\"\n\nshould be calculated on the basis of lower wholesale prices.\n\n                First,       they   claim       that    the     wholesale    price      the\n\ndistrict    court       relied      upon    was      too   high    because       Microsoft\n\nsometimes       sold    its    products         at   lower    rates.        Bankhead     of\n\nMicrosoft stated that the standard wholesale price of Windows\n\nwas $165 and that the wholesale price of Office was $486.                                 A\n\nrepresentative from Staples, an international office supplies\n\nstore, stated that these were the prices it paid for Microsoft\n\nproducts during the relevant time period.                            While there was\n\nevidence,       as    the    district      court       noted,     that   \"Microsoft     on\n\noccasion disposed of its product in channels other than the\n\nregular wholesale distribution channel,\" there was no evidence\n\nthat the stolen discs were destined for such lower price sales.\n\nUnder   these        circumstances,        it    was    not     clear    error    for   the\n\ndistrict court to reason that the full wholesale price was the\n\nappropriate figure since Microsoft \"would have the option to\n\ndispose    of    [the       property]      at    the    higher     rather    than    lower\n\nprice.\"     See United States v. Colletti, 984 F.2d 1339, 1345 (3d\n\nCir. 1992) (value of stolen jewelry properly calculated based on\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\fretail value, despite evidence that victim sold product at\n\ndiscount); United States v. Ellerbee, 73 F.3d 105, 109 (6th Cir.\n\n1996) (compact discs valued at full retail price, despite fact\n\nthat victim actually sold discs for less).\n\n              The appellants also argue that the discs were worth\n\nmuch       less     (or   even   nothing    at    all)   because   they   were\n\n\"blemished.\"          In support, the appellants point out that John\n\nCostello, the KAO employee who stole the discs, testified that\n\nthere was a minor silkscreen blemish on the disc artwork.4\n\nHowever, the record supports the district court's conclusion\n\nthat the discs were not blemished.               Bankhead testified that she\n\nhad the expertise to identify flaws in the discs; based on her\n\nexamination, they had no defects.             LaPointe described the discs\n\nas in \"perfect condition.\"                 There is no evidence that the\n\npurchasers of the discs were told of defects or ever complained\n\nof them.          Although the defense had samples of the stolen discs\n\n(as did the court), they offered no expert or other witnesses on\n\nthis point.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n     The government also acknowledges that when the FBI searched\nCrazy Bob's it found some scratched Office discs that had been\ndumped, unwrapped, into a large box. As the evidence was clear\nthat the discs were delivered to Crazy Bob's in shrink-wrapped\nspindles, it was not erroneous for the district court to\nconclude that any scratches were caused by Crazy Bob's.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f            The appellants next claim that the price should be\n\ndiscounted      because    the      CD-ROMs   did    not   contain    legitimate\n\nlicenses.     We easily reject this claim.             The lack of a license\n\ndid not prevent the users from accessing the software.                         It\n\nsimply prevented them from doing so with Microsoft's blessing.\n\nThis argument, then, boils down to the claim that the loss\n\nshould be discounted because the goods were \"hot\" and therefore\n\ncould not be sold at the market price for legitimate products.\n\nObviously, the fact that a product is sold for less because it\n\nis stolen provides no basis for lowering the loss calculation,\n\nwhich is based on the wholesale price in a legitimate market\n\nrather than the black market price.               See e.g., United States v.\n\nPervaz,   118    F.3d     1,   10   (1st   Cir.     1997);   United   States   v.\n\nCarrington, 96 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Finally, we reject the appellants' related claim that\n\nthe wholesale price of the discs should be discounted because\n\nthe discs did not contain packaging materials.                For the Simonses\n\nand Rosengard to prevail on this theory, they would have to show\n\nthat the lack of packaging reduced the fair market value of the\n\ndiscs from $17 million by approximately forty percent to the\n\nless than $10 million required for a lower enhancement under the\n\nGuidelines.     Coviello would have to demonstrate that the missing\n\npackaging reduced the value from $3.9 million by approximately\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthirty-five percent to less than $2.5 million.                  The district\n\ncourt did not clearly err in failing to make such a dramatic\n\nreduction.\n\n            Bankhead stated that \"almost all of the value in the\n\n$486 price charged by Microsoft for [Office] and the $165 price\n\ncharged for Windows[] derived from the intellectual property–-\n\nthat is, the software code contained on the CD-ROM.\"                  Indeed,\n\nMicrosoft paid KAO only seven dollars per unit for its services\n\nin performing disc duplication and adding packaging.                       Even\n\nassuming that the lack of packaging or any other offset (such as\n\na blemish on the disc artwork) warranted some reduction in the\n\nmarket value, this would only be a minor discount that would not\n\naffect the sentences.        The court supportably found that the\n\nmarket value of the software attributable to the Simonses and\n\nRosengard    was   between   $10    and    $20    million    and    the   value\n\nattributable to Coviello was between $2.5 and $5 million.\n\nC. Alternative Measures of Loss\n\n            The appellants suggest that \"fair market value\" may be\n\nan   inappropriate   measure   of    loss    in    this     case.    Coviello\n\nactually proposes that the replacement cost of the discs should\n\nbe the basis for calculating loss–-thirty-six cents per unit\n\n(for a total of $2,880 rather than $3.9 million).              Acknowledging\n\nthat this replacement cost would be inadequate, the Simonses\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fpropose   that   loss    should      be    measured    by    the     gain    for    the\n\ndefendants, about $1.3 million.                  Rosengard suggests a similar\n\napproach.\n\n            In support of departing from fair market value, the\n\nappellants     point    to   an    application       note    which    states       that\n\n\"[w]here the fair market value is difficult to ascertain or\n\ninadequate to measure harm to the victim, the court may measure\n\nloss in some other way, such as reasonable replacement cost to\n\nthe victim.\"     USSG § 2B1.1 (Comment n.2).                  Courts have noted\n\nthat market value is inadequate in cases where the products--\n\nsuch as government documents--have no market value.                     See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Gottfried, 58 F.3d 648, 651 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\n\n(government documents, with no market value, considered in terms\n\nof replacement costs);            United States v.          Berkowitz, 927 F.2d\n\n1376,   1390   (7th     Cir.      1991)    (same).          Here,    however,       the\n\nMicrosoft products had a market value and, as the above analysis\n\nindicates, one that can be calculated with sufficient precision\n\nunder the Guidelines.             See USSG § 2B1.1(B)(1) (Comment n.3)\n\n(\"The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,\n\ngiven the available information.\").                  It does not matter, as\n\nappellants     claim,    that      Crazy     Bob's    sales    might        not    have\n\ndisplaced $17 million worth of legitimate Microsoft product.\n\nWhat matters is that the stolen CD-ROMs contained intellectual\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fproperty that was worth between $10 million and $20 million if\n\nthey       had       been   sold    legitimately.       Appellants     present       no\n\nauthority or persuasive argument as to why the ordinary market\n\nvalue approach should be abandoned here.5\n\n                       III. Other Alleged Sentencing Errors\n\nA. \"In the Business of Receiving and Selling Stolen Property\"\n\n                 The Simonses and Rosengard argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in finding that they, through Crazy Bob's, were \"in\n\nthe business of receiving and selling stolen property,\" so as to\n\nwarrant          a    four-level        guideline   enhancement     under    USSG     §\n\n2B1.1(b)(4)(B). In determining whether the \"in-the-business\" or\n\n\"ITB\" enhancement should apply, the district court must consider\n\n\"the totality of the circumstances, with particular emphasis on\n\nthe regularity and sophistication of a defendant's operation.\"\n\nUnited States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d 666, 674 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nsee also United States v. McMinn, 103 F.3d 216, 222 (1st Cir.\n\n1997); United States v. St. Cyr., 977 F2.d 698, 703 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).           While      de   novo    review   applies   with   respect   to     the\n\n\"meaning and scope\" of the ITB enhancement, St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at\n\n\n\n\n       5\n     Coviello claims that the high loss should have served as a\nbasis for a downward departure.     The court's discretionary\nrefusal to depart downward is not subject to appellate review.\nSee United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1044 (1st Cir.\n1990).\n\n                                             -19-\n\f701, challenges to the evidentiary support are reviewed only for\n\nclear error, see Richardson, 14 F.3d at 673.\n\n            The Simonses argue that they cannot be considered \"in-\n\nthe-business\" of buying and selling stolen property because\n\nCrazy Bob's was a legitimate business that sold many lawful\n\nproducts.    We disagree.    There is nothing in the Guidelines, the\n\ncommentary or our case law to suggest that the enhancement\n\napplies to a \"fence\" who sells only stolen goods, but not to a\n\n\"fence\" who sells stolen goods through the cover of a legitimate\n\nbusiness.     To the contrary, we have noted that the concern with\n\nthose in the business of receiving and selling stolen property\n\nis   \"especially   serious   .   .    .     when   the    professional   fence\n\nutilizes a legitimate 'front,' such as a pawn shop or an outlet\n\ndealing in distressed goods at sharply lower prices.\"                McMinn,\n\n103 F.3d at 221 n.4; see also United States v. Koehler, 24 F.3d\n\n867, 871 (6th Cir. 1994) (rejecting argument that the business\n\nenhancement was precluded by defendant's claim that he \"was a\n\nlegitimate businessman who, in his 24 years in the auto parts\n\nbusiness, had engaged in only two transactions regarding stolen\n\nproperty\").\n\n            The district court did not clearly err in determining\n\nthat the Simonses, through Crazy Bob's, were in the business of\n\nreceiving and selling stolen property.                   The \"most important\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f[factor] . . .   the regularity of defendant's dealings in stolen\n\nmerchandise,\"    Richardson, 14 F.3d at 674, was easily satisfied.\n\nLikewise, the sales \"proceeded with all the accouterments of a\n\nbusiness.\"   Id. at 675.   From late 1994 until the arrest of John\n\nCostello in March 1997, Crazy Bob's purchased, in multiple\n\ntransactions, roughly 40,000 stolen Windows and Office CD-ROMs\n\nworth approximately $17 million, as well as recordable compact\n\ndiscs, back-up tapes, and other items stolen from KAO.      These\n\ntransactions involved a number of Crazy Bob's employees, and\n\nthey generated some of the largest profits the business had ever\n\nseen.   Finally, the Simonses conducted the fencing operation in\n\na sophisticated fashion, see id. at 674, selling to multiple\n\nout-of-state and foreign buyers to avoid attracting suspicion\n\nand laundering the proceeds through various bank accounts.6\n\n          While Rosengard does not challenge the district court's\n\nfinding that Crazy Bob's was in the business of receiving and\n\nselling stolen property, he claims that the enhancement cannot\n\n\n    6 The Simonses suggest that the business enhancement is\nparticularly inappropriate for Maxine.     However, Maxine was\nhighly involved in Crazy Bob's business of selling stolen\nproperty. She was the President, director, and sole officer of\nthe company, and, as the 60% owner, received 60% of the profits.\nShe was personally involved with the sale of stolen property,\nissuing forty-nine checks for payment to LaPointe, falsely\ndocumenting the $116,000 payroll check to Costello, approving\nthe purchase prices for the stolen goods, structuring financial\ntransactions to conceal the profits from stolen property, and\npersonally receiving the stolen property from LaPointe.\n\n                                -21-\n\fapply to him as a mere employee.       The government responds that\n\neven a \"delivery boy\" involved in the sale of stolen property is\n\nsubject to the enhancement, citing United States v. Cottman, 142\n\nF.3d 160, 166 (3rd Cir. 1998) (rejecting argument that in the\n\nbusiness enhancement cannot apply to \"low level delivery boy\" in\n\nfencing scheme).\n\n            The evidence shows that Rosengard was far more than a\n\ndelivery boy.     As Crazy Bob's buyer, Rosengard was LaPointe's\n\nprimary   contact   in   virtually   all   of   the    stolen   property\n\ndealings, arranging which items would be purchased, for how\n\nmuch, and how LaPointe was to be paid.            Moreover, Rosengard\n\npersonally delivered the payments to LaPointe and personally\n\nreceived the stolen Microsoft software.         Rosengard was the only\n\ndefendant personally involved with making sales of the stolen\n\nOffice discs to some of Crazy Bob's buyers.           Rosengard's claim\n\nthat \"he did not sell the Windows95 or the Office 97 for his own\n\ngain or business\" is belied by his admission that he received\n\n\"approximately $20,000\" in commissions for his role in the\n\npurchase and sale of the stolen Office discs.             Indeed, from\n\nMarch 6 to July 10, 1997–-when most of the Office discs were\n\nstolen-– Rosengard's salary jumped from $500 per week to $2,350\n\nper week.      The district court did not err in applying the ITB\n\nenhancement.\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fB. Robert Simons' Restitution and Supervised Release\n\n         Robert Simons pled guilty and received a sentence of\n\nseventy months imprisonment, three years supervised release, and\n\nrestitution of $908,108.   He now argues, for the first time,\n\nthat because he was not warned of the possibility of restitution\n\nor supervised release in his Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 plea colloquy,\n\nwe should eliminate these portions of his sentence.   Under these\n\ncircumstances, where there has been a failure by the defendant\n\nto raise the error in the Rule 11 colloquy before the trial\n\ncourt, we nevertheless will determine Rule 11 compliance for the\n\nfirst time on appeal. See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69\n\nF.3d 1215, 1219 (1st. Cir. 1995).7\n\n         The government concedes that Robert did not receive\n\nthese warnings.   There is no question that the district court\n\nshould have warned Robert of the possibilities of supervised\n\nrelease and restitution, as Rule 11(c)(1) explicitly requires.\n\nThe omission represented a partial failure to address Rule 11's\n\n\n\n    7The government suggests that Robert waived the right to\nchallenge the Rule 11 errors by proposing supervised release and\nrestitution in his sentencing memorandum, and hence cannot\nchallenge these errors on appeal. However, we find no waiver\nbecause these recommendations at the time of sentencing did not\namount to \"an intentional relinquishment or abandonment\" of the\nclaim that the Rule 11 colloquy was defective. United States v.\nMitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir. 1996).                These\nrecommendations are relevant, however, to the Rule 11 harmless\nerror inquiry. See infra.\n\n                             -23-\n\f\"core     concern\"       that    the   defendant     have    \"knowledge    of     the\n\nconsequences of the guilty plea.\"                 United States v. Bierd, 217\n\nF.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2000).             However, even the partial failure\n\nto address a core concern is harmless under Rule 11 if it does\n\nnot affect \"substantial rights.\"                 Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h) (\"Any\n\nvariance from the procedures required by this rule which does\n\nnot     affect      substantial        rights     shall     be   disregarded.\").8\n\nSubstantial rights are not affected by\n\na failure to fully explain the consequence of the guilty plea\n\nwhere the defendant had no reason to expect a lesser penalty\n\nthan he ultimately received.              See United States v. Raineri, 42\n\nF.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                The failure to warn of supervised release was harmless\n\nbecause Robert \"receive[d] a combined sentence of imprisonment\n\nand supervised release that was less than the maximum term of\n\nimprisonment\" of which he was warned.\"                Id. (noting that in such\n\ncases     the    error    is    ordinarily      harmless).       With   respect    to\n\n\n      8\n     It is not entirely clear whether a defendant raising a Rule\n11 challenge for the first time on appeal must satisfy only the\nharmless error test in Rule 11(h), or whether the defendant must\nalso show \"a fundamental defect which inherently results in a\ncomplete miscarriage of justice\" or \"an omission inconsistent\nwith the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\" Martinez, 69\nF.3d at 1219; see also Bierd, 217 F.3d at 19 (noting two\nstandards); Noriega-Milan, 110 F.3d 162, 166 n.4 (1st Cir. 1997)\n(same); United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 522 &\nn.9 (1st Cir. 1996) (same). We need not address this issue as\nRobert's claim fails under either standard.\n\n                                         -24-\n\frestitution, we have previously held that \"where a defendant who\n\nis not warned of the potential for restitution is nevertheless\n\nordered to pay such restitution, but in an amount less than the\n\ntotal    potential     criminal     fine    of    which    he   was   warned,       the\n\narguable error is harmless.\"               United States v. Gonzalez, 202\n\nF.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Padin-Torres, 988 F.2d at\n\n284.     This principle, however, does not dispose of Robert's\n\nclaim.    Although he was warned of the possibility of fines, the\n\nplea colloquy did not make clear that the monetary assessment\n\ncould reach $908,108.\n\n            Still,     there   is    no     indication       that     the    missing\n\ninformation \"led [Robert] to expect a lesser penalty than he\n\nactually received.\" Raineri, 42 F.3d at 42.                     Robert has never\n\nalleged    that   he   was   unaware       that   the     restitution       would    be\n\nordered at the time he entered his plea, let alone that he pled\n\nguilty in reliance on that belief.                   Moreover, the evidence\n\nindicates that Robert was aware at the time of his plea that\n\nmonetary remunerations in these amounts could be required.                           At\n\nthe arraignment, Robert was told that the maximum fines on each\n\nof the twenty-five counts against him ranged from $250,000 to\n\n$925,000. Finally, Robert affirmatively requested a restitution\n\norder at the time of his sentencing, suggesting that he had been\n\nwell aware of this possibility at the time of the plea hearing.\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fAs the Rule 11 errors were harmless, we need not consider the\n\nunusual remedy Robert seeks (vacating the challenged portions of\n\nthe sentences rather than withdrawing the guilty plea).                         Cf.\n\nPadin-Torres, 988 F2d at 284 (discussing this remedy).\n\nC. Coviello's Role In Offense Adjustment\n\n            Coviello argues that the district court should have\n\nfound him to be a \"minimal participant\" (entitled to a four-\n\nlevel decrease) or \"minor participant\" (entitled to a two-level\n\ndecrease) pursuant to         USSG § 3B1.2.         To be eligible for either\n\n\"role in the offense\" adjustment, the defendant must demonstrate\n\nthat   he   was    \"substantially        less   culpable     than    the    average\n\nparticipant.\"       United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st\n\nCir.   1990)      (quoting   USSG    §    3B1.2     commentary,     background).\n\nCoviello    contends    that    he    is    entitled    to    at    least   \"minor\n\nparticipant\"       status    because       he   participated        in   only   one\n\ntransaction (the sale of 8,000 stolen Office discs) during the\n\ntwo-year long conspiracy.            Our review is for clear error.             See\n\nid.\n\n            For    Coviello    to    obtain     a   \"role    in    the   offense,\"\n\nadjustment, he cannot simply show that he was a minimal or minor\n\nparticipant in the conspiracy overall.               He must demonstrate that\n\nhe was a minimal or minor participant in the conduct that formed\n\nthe basis of his sentence.           See, e.g., United States v. James,\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f157 F.3d 1218, 1220 (10th Cir. 1998) (where sentence \"was based\n\nnot on the collective amount of drugs distributed by all members\n\nof the conspiracy, but only on the amount of drugs distributed\"\n\nby the defendant, no role reduction is appropriate); United\n\nStates v. Atanda, 60 F.3d 196, 198 (5th Cir. 1995) (\"When a\n\nsentence is based on an activity in which a defendant was\n\nactually involved, § 3B1.2 does not require a reduction in the\n\nbase offense level even though the defendant's activity in a\n\nlarger conspiracy may have been minor or minimal.\"); cf. United\n\nStates v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1211 (1st Cir. 1994) (defendant\n\n\"mistakenly refers to the overall conspiracy encompassing five\n\nrobberies as the benchmark for arguing that he played a minimal\n\nrole,\" rather than the offenses for which he was convicted).\n\nCoviello's offense level was not based on the broader two-year\n\nconspiracy: it was based only on the single transaction in which\n\nCoviello engaged.   Coviello received a fifteen-level increase\n\nfor his participation in the attempted sale of $3.9 million\n\nworth of stolen Office discs.       He did not receive the full\n\nseventeen-level increase other defendants received for selling\n\nall $17 million worth of stolen property.\n\n         Given these principles, the district court properly\n\nfound that Coviello's sentence was based on \"his part in this\n\naspect of the conspiracy, as to which he was a full, not a minor\n\n\n                             -27-\n\fparticipant.\"     Coviello played a critical role in the sale of\n\nthe 8,000 stolen Office discs–-the largest single sale attempted\n\nby Crazy Bob's, representing twenty-five percent of the total of\n\n32,000   stolen    Office       discs.           Coviello      made    the    final\n\narrangements    with    the    buyer;       he   sent   sample   discs;      he   had\n\ncustody of the stolen property and he delivered the property.\n\nCoviello was also set to keep a full one-third of the proceeds\n\nfor the sale, amounting to about $80,000.\n\nD. Downward Departure for Rosengard\n\n          Rosengard      received       a    two-level      downward    departure\n\nbecause the court found such a departure was needed \"to provide\n\na rough proportionality amongst the various sentences for all\n\nthe   participants      so    that   this        sentence,     dictated      by   the\n\nguidelines, is not out of sync . . . with the other sentences,\n\nsome of which have been arrived at by departures as well for\n\nother reasons.\"      Rosengard now argues that the district court\n\ndid not depart far enough because he was less culpable than\n\nother defendants who received downward departures.\n\n          We have \"no jurisdiction to review the extent of a\n\ndeparture merely because the affected defendant is dissatisfied\n\nwith the quantification of the district court's generosity.\"\n\nUnited States v. Pighetti, 898 F.2d 3, 4 (1st Cir. 1990); United\n\nStates   v.   Fisher,    3    F.3d   456,        464    (1st   Cir.    1993)      (no\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fjurisdiction      to    hear    claim   that   defendant    was   entitled    to\n\ngreater downward departure because his sentence was \"excessive\n\nin light of the amount of time given to codefendant\").                        The\n\ngovernment also notes that any downward departure based solely\n\non the perceived need \"to equalize sentencing outcomes for\n\nsimilarly situated codefendants\" is unlawful.               United States v.\n\nKneeland, 148 F.3d 6, 16 (1st Cir. 1998) (collecting cases); see\n\nalso United States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 153 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    As the government has not cross-appealed, this issue is\n\nnot before us.         See United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, Nos. 98-\n\n2108 & 98-2109, 2000 WL 967224,           at *5 (1st Cir. July 18, 2000).\n\n\n\n                                IV. Trial Errors\n\n              Maxine Simons and Coviello–-the two appellants who went\n\nto trial–-raise several alleged errors by the trial court.\n\nA. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n              The National Stolen Property Act applies, in relevant\n\npart,    to   \"[w]hoever       transports,     transmits,   or    transfers    in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise,\n\nsecurities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the\n\nsame to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"                        18\n\nU.S.C. § 2314.          Maxine argues that the district court should\n\nhave granted her motion for judgment of acquittal on the stolen\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fproperty counts because the property consisted solely of CD-ROM\n\ndiscs     which    were     \"virtually      worthless,\"      aside     from     the\n\nintellectual property contained on them.                   Maxine relies on\n\nDowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 216 (1985), in which the\n\nSupreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. § 2314 does not apply to the\n\ntheft of copyrighted material without \"physical taking of the\n\nsubject goods.\"\n\n            Maxine ignores the fact that Crazy Bob's committed\n\nhigh-tech piracy the old-fashioned way--by buying and selling\n\nmore than 40,000 pieces of tangible stolen property.                    There is\n\nno authority for Maxine's proposition that when the physical\n\nproperty    derives       most   of   its   value   from   its   intellectual\n\ncontent,    the    defendant     cannot     be   prosecuted    under    §     2314.\n\nIndeed,    Dowling    itself      forecloses      Maxine's    argument.          In\n\ndiscussing the law of\n\n§ 2314, the       Supreme Court stated:\n\n            Nor does it matter that the item owes a\n            major portion of its value to an intangible\n            component.    See, e.g., United States v.\n            Seagraves,   265   F.2d   876   (CA3   1959)\n            (geophysical maps identifying possible oil\n            deposits); United States v. Greenwald, 479\n            F.2d 320 (CA 6 1973) (documents bearing\n            secret chemical formulae) [citation].    But\n            these cases and others prosecuted under §\n            2314 have always involved physical \"goods,\n            wares [or] merchandise\" that have themselves\n            been \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"\n\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\f473 U.S. at 216.      See also United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d\n\n1301, 1308 n.14 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"[F]or § 2314 to apply there\n\nmust be some tangible item taken, however insignificant or\n\nvalueless it may be, absent the intangible component.\")\n\nB. References To Maxine's Trial Attorney\n\n          Leatha Bowdoin, an employee of Crazy Bob's, testified\n\nfor the government at trial pursuant to a grant of immunity.\n\nAlthough she had implicated Maxine Simons in her grand jury\n\ntestimony, her trial testimony presented Maxine as playing a\n\nmore minimal role.         On redirect examination, the government\n\nattempted to demonstrate that Bowdoin had a motive to slant her\n\ntestimony in favor of the defense.          The government asked Bowdoin\n\nwhether Maxine was paying her attorney's fees, to which Bowdoin\n\nanswered \"Maxine or myself.           It hasn't been determined yet.\"\n\nThe government then asked whether, at her initial grand jury\n\nappearance,   she    was    represented     by   \"the   same   or   different\n\ncounsel as who was representing Robert and Maxine Simons at the\n\ntime.\"   When Bowdoin answered \"I believe it was the company's\n\nlawyers,\" the government asked whether this meant she had been\n\nrepresented   by    Mr.    Sultan,   one    of   Maxine's   trial   counsel.\n\nBowdoin responded that Sultan was indeed her lawyer during the\n\ngrand jury and she admitted that Crazy Bob's had paid those\n\nfees.\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\f            Maxine objected to this line of questioning and now\n\nargues   that    the    district      court     abused      its    discretion    in\n\nadmitting the evidence because it was irrelevant, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 401, and, even if relevant, unduly prejudicial, see Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403.       In support, she cites our recent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Gaines, 170 F.3d 72, 82 (1st Cir. 1999), as\n\nlaying down a broad rule against such evidence.                   It does no such\n\nthing.   In that case, Gaines was accused of supplying drugs to\n\nFranklin, a government witness.             As Gaines's defense was that he\n\nbarely knew Franklin and did not know he was involved in drugs,\n\nwe found Franklin's testimony that Gaines had once referred him\n\nto an attorney to defend him on a drug charge \"highly relevant.\"\n\nId.   However, given that the actual identity of the lawyer was\n\nnot necessary to challenge Gaines' defense, we were troubled\n\nthat the government had \"needlessly\" elicited the fact that the\n\nlawyer   Franklin      was    referred     to   was   the    very    same   lawyer\n\ndefending Gaines at trial.            Id.       Although we found any error\n\nharmless,   we   noted       that   this    irrelevant      fact    \"created    the\n\ntroubling possibility that Gaines's choice of a trial attorney\n\ncould be used by the jury to draw a negative inference about\n\nGaines's involvement with drugs.\"               Id.\n\n            While Gaines makes clear that some evidence of prior\n\nrepresentations may be irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, the\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fevidence of prior representation in this case was neither.\n\nBowdoin's    trial      testimony      minimized        Maxine's    role    in     the\n\nconspiracy    and    contradicted         earlier   statements.          Thus,     she\n\nopened the door for the government to attack her credibility.\n\nTo show bias, it was relevant to show that Maxine might pay for\n\nBowdoin's attorney's fees at trial; that Maxine in fact had paid\n\nthese fees during the grand jury proceedings; and that Crazy\n\nBob's   lawyers     had     provided      the   prior    representation.           The\n\ngovernment only brought out the fact that it was Maxine's trial\n\ncounsel,     Sultan,        who     had     provided       the     shared        prior\n\nrepresentation when Bowdoin evaded a more general question about\n\nwhether    they   had      shared   the    same   lawyer    during       grand    jury\n\nproceedings.      The only inference the jury might have drawn-–\n\nthat Bowdoin was slanting her testimony to protect Maxine in\n\npart because she had been represented by Crazy Bob's lawyers and\n\nmight have her legal fees paid by Maxine–-was permissible.\n\nContrary to Maxine's protestations, where evidence of prior\n\nrepresentation is relevant and not unduly prejudicial, there is\n\nno per se rule barring its admission.                    See United States v.\n\nFrazier,    944     F.2d    820,    823-27      (11th    Cir.    1991)    (allowing\n\nevidence of source of defendant's attorney's fees to show, in\n\nperjury prosecution, the defendant's motive to cover up for her\n\nemployer); cf. United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934, 948-49\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\f(2d Cir. 1991) (holding that when members of alleged conspiracy\n\nall used same attorney, and one member paid for attorney, the\n\nmultiple representation could be used to show the association\n\nbetween   clients    provided    other    evidence       existed   of   the\n\nassociation).\n\nC. Willful Blindness\n\n           The sole defense offered by Coviello and Maxine Simons\n\nwas that they lacked knowledge that the software was stolen.\n\nThe   government    requested,   and    the   district    court    gave,   a\n\nstandard \"willful blindness\" instruction.9 Maxine and Coviello\n\nobjected to the instruction, and they now appeal this ruling.\n\nWe review the propriety of a willful blindness instruction for\n\nabuse of discretion.       See United States v. Cunan, 152 F.3d 29,\n\n39 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           A willful blindness instruction is appropriate \"if [1]\n\na defendant claims a lack of knowledge, [2] the facts suggest a\n\n\n      9The court stated:\n\n           In addition, you may infer that a defendant\n           had knowledge of a particular fact if you\n           find beyond a reasonable doubt that he or\n           she deliberately avoided information about\n           the fact that would otherwise have been\n           obvious . . . . [This] does not mean that a\n           person's carelessness or mistake in failing\n           to learn about a fact would support an\n           inference of knowledge; it would not. There\n           must be a deliberate effort to remain\n           ignorant of the fact.\n\n                                 -34-\n\fconscious    course         of   deliberate        ignorance,      and    [3]     the\n\ninstruction,      taken     as   a   whole,      cannot   be    misunderstood     as\n\nmandating    an    inference         of    knowledge.\"         United    States    v.\n\nRichardson, 14 F.3d 666, 671 (1st Cir. 1994).                            Maxine and\n\nCoviello challenge the second element,10 claiming that the facts\n\ndid not suggest that they were deliberately avoiding knowledge\n\nthat the products were stolen.                    In determining whether the\n\nfacts suggest the type of deliberate avoidance warranting an\n\ninstruction,      we   must      consider     whether     the    record    evidence\n\nreveals   \"flags\"      of    suspicion      that,    uninvestigated,        suggest\n\nwillful blindness.          Richardson, 14 F.3d at 668, 671-672; see\n\nalso Gabriele, 63 F.3d at 66-67 (looking to presence of red\n\nflags); Cunan, 152 F.3d at 39 (same).\n\n            There were sufficient \"flags of suspicion\" to justify\n\nthe instruction.          Maxine knew that: (1) the supplier of the\n\nstolen goods, LaPointe, used a business name (\"Dave's Media\")\n\nthat had no bank account or place of business, and that he told\n\nher he was having trouble cashing checks in the business name;\n\n\n    10In her reply brief, Maxine argues for the first time on\nappeal that the willful blindness instruction was inappropriate\nbecause she was not raising a \"lack of knowledge\" defense. The\nwell-settled rule is that arguments made for the first time in\na reply brief are waived. See United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d\n918, 922 n.7 (1st Cir. 1993).     In any event, the argument is\nfrivolous, as both Maxine's closing and her cross-examination\nmade plain that her only defense was that she did not know the\nproducts were stolen.\n\n                                          -35-\n\f(2) that LaPointe insisted upon being paid in cash as the volume\n\nof their dealings increased; (3) when LaPointe delivered goods\n\nto   Maxine,    he   never   provided   invoices,   receipts   or   other\n\npaperwork; (4) LaPointe discussed with Maxine issuing a $116,000\n\ncheck to John Costello, whom Maxine falsely documented as an\n\nemployee.      The jury could have also inferred that Maxine was\n\naware, through her employee Rosengard, that the computer goods\n\nwere picked up at a shed at a private home and that LaPointe\n\ntold Rosengard \"ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies\"\n\non the one occasion when Rosengard asked about the source of the\n\ngoods.\n\n            Similarly, there were sufficient \"flags\" that Coviello\n\nshould have taken note of, including the fact that: (1) Knabb\n\nreferred to the Office discs in code as         \"Wheaties Boxes\"; (2)\n\nthe $245,000 payment for the discs would be made in cash, after\n\ndelivering the CDs to a restaurant parking lot; (3) Coviello was\n\nto personally receive about $80,000 for simply finalizing the\n\ndeal and delivering the product; (4) the Office discs did not\n\ninclude any legitimate licenses, manuals, or other packaging;\n\n(5) Crazy Bob's created a formula to fabricate unauthorized key\n\ncodes to access the software, which Coviello provided to Knabb;\n\nand (6) the goods were unaccompanied by any documentation such\n\nas a bill of sale, invoice or receipt.\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\f           Coviello further argues that even if the \"flags of\n\nsuspicion\" were present, the instruction was inappropriate in\n\nhis case because he was prosecuted only for conspiracy, and the\n\ninstruction might cause a jury to conclude that he could join a\n\nconspiracy      without    actually      entering    an    agreement.         This\n\nargument   is    unpersuasive.          The    district    court    first     gave\n\ncomplete instructions on the conspiracy elements (emphasizing\n\nthat the evidence must show \"that the defendant knowingly and\n\nintentionally      became       a     participant     or     member     of    the\n\nconspiracy\"), and only then turned to the instructions on the\n\nsubstantive crimes, including the willful blindness instruction.\n\nIt is plain that the willful blindness instruction related to\n\nwhether the defendants knew that the property was stolen, not to\n\njoining the conspiracy.             As such, the instruction was proper.\n\nSee United States v.        Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(instruction      proper    where       district     court     gave     detailed\n\nexplanation of conspiracy count and then gave willful blindness\n\ninstruction      \"aimed    at   the     'knowing'    requirements        of    the\n\nsubstantive counts\"); United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 453\n\nn.75 (1st Cir. 1994) (rejecting claim that willful blindness\n\ninstruction      was   improper        in     conspiracy     case     where    the\n\ninstruction \"had to do with the finding that 'defendant acted\n\n\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fknowingly' and not with a finding that defendant willfully\n\njoined the conspiracy.\")\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                           -38-\n\f",

Crazy Bob's, a discount computer\n\nproducts     store     in    Wakefield,      Massachusetts,        sold     stolen\n\nMicrosoft software.          The owners of Crazy Bob's, Robert Simons\n\nand his wife Maxine,1 and several employees were charged with,\n\ninter    alia,    a   conspiracy     to    transport      stolen    property    in\n\ninterstate       commerce.        Robert   and   Crazy     Bob's    buyer,    Marc\n\nRosenberg, pled guilty and now appeal their sentences.

See USSG §\n\n2B1.1(b)(1).          The appellants also assert other sentencing\n\nerrors: (1) the Simonses and Rosengard argue that they were not\n\n\"in the business\" of receiving and selling stolen property, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\n\n§   2B1.1(b)(4)(B); </span><pre class=\"inline\">        (2)   Robert   argues   that     restitution       and\n\nsupervised release should not be imposed because of errors in\n\nhis Fed. R. Crim.

Maxine and Coviello raise trial errors as well,\n\nclaiming    that   the    court      should      have        dismissed     the   stolen\n\nproperty    counts    because       the    physical          discs    containing    the\n\nsoftware were \"virtually worthless\" and that the court should\n\nnot have given a \"willful blindness\" jury instruction.                           Maxine\n\nalso challenges the district court's ruling that the government\n\ncould impeach a witness by establishing that the witness had\n\nbeen represented by Maxine's trial counsel during grand jury\n\nproceedings.       We reject all of these arguments and affirm the\n\nconvictions and sentences.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            During the 1990s, Robert and Maxine Simons operated a\n\ndiscount computer products outlet in Wakefield, Massachusetts\n\nknown as Crazy Bob's.           In 1994, Robert and Maxine met David\n\nLaPointe    and,   acting     through      Crazy       Bob's,      began     purchasing\n\ncomputer diskettes, tapes, and CDs which had been stolen from\n\nKAO Infosystems (\"KAO\"), a computer disc manufacturer.                         LaPointe\n\nobtained the products through several KAO employees, including\n\nJohn   Costello.      Each    shipment          of    stolen       goods   was   either\n\ndelivered    by    LaPointe     to    Crazy          Bob's    or     picked    up   from\n\nCostello's shed by Marc Rosengard, a long-time employee and\n\nbuyer for Crazy Bob's.\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                  In    June    1996,    LaPointe     obtained     more   than   10,000\n\nMicrosoft Windows 95 (\"Windows\") CD-ROMS, which were sold to\n\nCrazy Bob's for fifteen dollars each even though the wholesale\n\nvalue was approximately $165 per disc.                        Almost all of the discs\n\nwere    sold       to     Crazy     Bob's     without   any    legitimate      packaging\n\nmaterials,             such    as   Microsoft     boxes,     licenses,    manuals,     or\n\ncertificates of authenticity.                   Instead, the discs were packaged\n\non spindles of 100 discs each and shrink-wrapped in plastic.\n\nCrazy Bob's then resold the stolen Windows discs to companies in\n\nGreat Britain and California.                   LaPointe told Crazy Bob's buyer\n\nRosengard that he insisted on cash for the Windows discs so that\n\nthere would be no \"paper trail.\"                     This request was approved by\n\nBob    and    Maxine          Simons    and   more    than    $240,000    in   cash   was\n\ndelivered to LaPointe over the course of several transactions,\n\nmostly by Rosengard.                Maxine often structured these payments so\n\nthat each check for cash would be for less than $10,000, thereby\n\navoiding the requirement that banks file with the Treasury\n\nDepartment a currency transaction report of any cash transaction\n\nof $10,000 or more.\n\n                  In December 1996, LaPointe met with Rosengard and\n\nRobert Simons to negotiate the sale of at least 32,000 Microsoft\n\nOffice       97    Professional         Edition      (\"Office\")    CD-ROMs.       Robert\n\nagreed to pay LaPointe in a series of installment payments\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fbecause, as Robert explained, he would have to sell the discs\n\nslowly to avoid attracting suspicion.           Maxine Simons then wrote\n\na $116,000 check to Costello for his role in obtaining the\n\nstolen property, falsely documenting his status with the IRS so\n\nthat he would appear to be a Crazy Bob's employee.               Like the\n\nWindows   discs,   the   Office   discs   did    not   contain   Microsoft\n\npackaging materials and were on spindles of 100 discs apiece.\n\nAs the stolen discs did not include the \"key codes\" necessary to\n\naccess the software, Rosengard and other Crazy Bob's employees\n\ndevised a formula for creating their own key codes and printed\n\nkey code stickers.       Between February and July 1997 Crazy Bob's\n\nsold a total of 13,962 Office discs, at prices ranging from\n\nfifty to one hundred dollars per disc, for a total of $908,108.\n\n\n\n            On March 22, 1997, Costello was arrested by the FBI.\n\nAt Robert's direction, Crazy Bob's began executing documents to\n\ntransfer $425,000 of stolen property proceeds from Crazy Bob's\n\nbank account through another account, which was then closed so\n\nthat checks could be distributed to Bob, Maxine, and their\n\nchildren.    When the FBI interviewed Maxine about Costello, she\n\ninformed them that he was a \"consultant\" for the store and that\n\nLaPointe had sold back-up tapes to Crazy Bob's on one occasion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           Crazy Bob's was able to remove at least 8,000 of the\n\nOffice discs before the FBI obtained a search warrant and seized\n\nthe remainder.       Robert then offered to sell the 8,000 discs to\n\nJasper \"Jay\" Knabb, who operated a computer store in North\n\nCarolina, informing him that they were \"hot\" and would need to\n\nbe sold out of the country and for cash.                 Knabb reported these\n\nconversations       to   Microsoft     and   to    the   FBI,   and   agreed    to\n\ncooperate.       Knabb then told Robert that he had a customer in\n\nSouth America who would buy the discs.                    After settling on a\n\nprice, they agreed that defendant Gerald Coviello (a friend of\n\nRobert's) would handle the transaction and receive ten dollars\n\nper disc (which amounted to over $80,000) for his troubles.\n\nCoviello negotiated a cash payment from Knabb and set a meeting\n\nin a restaurant parking lot to deliver the discs.                       At that\n\nmeeting, he was arrested.\n\n           Robert, Maxine, Coviello and Rosengard (along with\n\nthree   co-defendants       not   parties     to    this    appeal)   were     all\n\nindicted     for    conspiracy    to     transport       stolen   property     in\n\ninterstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.                   Robert,\n\nMaxine,    and     Rosengard   were    charged     with    sixteen    counts   of\n\ninterstate transportation of stolen property.                   See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> § 2314.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\nRobert and Maxine were also charged with one count of conspiracy\n\nto launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and eleven\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fcounts    of    money    laundering,      in   violation   of   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n1956(a)(1)(B)(i).2       Finally, Maxine was charged with three counts\n\nof structuring to evade reporting requirements, in violation of\n\n31 U.S.C. § 5324, and one count of making false statements to\n\nfederal agents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.\n\n           Robert and Rosengard pled guilty and were sentenced to\n\nseventy        months    and     thirty-three       months      imprisonment,\n\nrespectively.

Section 2B1.1(b)(1) provides for enhancements to\n\nthe base offense level in cases involving the transfer of stolen\n\nproperty depending on the amount of \"loss.\"                  The application\n\nnotes explain that \"'[l]oss' means the value of the property\n\ntaken,    damaged,      or   destroyed\"    and   that   \"[o]rdinarily,   when\n\n\n\n    2The money laundering counts against Maxine were dismissed\nprior to trial.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fproperty is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market value\n\nof   the    particular    property     at     issue.\"        USSG    §    2B1.1(B)(1)\n\n(Comment n.2); see also United States v.

Relying on testimony from Microsoft\n\nand one of its large wholesale customers, the court concluded\n\nthat    Microsoft      could   have    sold     the    32,000       Office    CD-ROMs\n\nwholesale for $486 each and that it could have sold the 10,000\n\nWindows CD-ROMs wholesale for $165 each.                    Thus the loss caused\n\nby the Simonses and Rosengard through the sale of all of these\n\ndiscs      was   $17   million,     resulting         in    the     seventeen-level\n\nenhancement that applies to loss between $10 and $20 million.\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fSee § 2B1.1(B)(1)(R).     The court found Coviello responsible only\n\nfor the 8,000 Office discs he attempted to sell, resulting in a\n\nloss figure of $3.9 million and a sentencing enhancement of 15\n\nlevels.   See § 2B1.1(B)(1)(P) (15 level enhancement for loss\n\nbetween $2.5 and $5 million).\n\n          The appellants' challenges to the loss calculation fall\n\ninto   three   basic   categories.      First,   they   claim   that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in identifying Microsoft (rather than KAO)\n\nas the victim, resulting in a higher loss figure.                Second,\n\naccepting the \"fair market value\" approach to loss calculation\n\nused by the district court, the appellants make several related\n\narguments that the discs had a lower market value than the\n\ndistrict court identified.      Third, the appellants suggest that\n\nsome method other than the \"fair market value\" approach should\n\nhave been employed.\n\n          We analyze each of these claims in turn, keeping in\n\nmind that the defendants bear a \"heavy burden of demonstrating\n\nthat the district court finding is clearly erroneous,\" and that\n\nloss does not have to be determined with precision.             </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195031\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Skrodzki,</span>\n\n<a href=\"/opinion/195031/united-states-v-skrodzki/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also United States v.

As the\n\nSimonses and Rosengard received the seventeen-point enhancement\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fapplicable to losses between $10 and $20 million, they can only\n\nprevail on appeal if they demonstrate that the loss was clearly\n\nless than $10 million rather than the $17 million the district\n\ncourt identified.    Similarly, as Coviello received the fifteen\n\npoint enhancement for losses falling within the $2.5 to $5\n\nmillion range, he can only prevail by showing that the loss was\n\nbelow $2.5 million rather than the $3.9 million the district\n\ncourt found.\n\n\n\n\nA. Identifying the Victim\n\n            The appellants claim that because the CD-ROMs were\n\nstolen from the custody of KAO, and because KAO was required to\n\nindemnify Microsoft for lost discs, the \"victim\" in this case\n\nwas KAO, and the district court should have considered the loss\n\ncaused to it, not to Microsoft.    There is much at stake in this\n\nargument.    Although Microsoft sold Windows for $165 and Office\n\nfor $486, the fair market value of the discs to KAO would be no\n\nmore than the $7 they charged Microsoft for the duplication\n\nservices.    Indeed, the appellants even argue that the discs were\n\n\"overages\" and destined for destruction, having no market value\n\nto KAO whatsoever.     They also note that KAO could replace the\n\ndiscs for thirty-six cents per unit.\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f             The argument that KAO should have been treated as the\n\nvictim is flawed in several ways.         First, there was sufficient\n\nevidence for the district court to conclude that Microsoft had\n\na more significant ownership interest in the CD-ROMs.             Kristi\n\nBankhead, a product ID specialist at Microsoft, testified that\n\nalthough KAO was under contract to manufacture and package the\n\ndiscs, Microsoft retained ownership rights in the software.            The\n\nFacility Agreement between KAO and Microsoft provides additional\n\nsupport, as it states that the entire inventory of discs is held\n\nby KAO \"exclusively for distribution to Customers as authorized\n\nby Microsoft and for no other purpose, use or disposition,\n\nexcept as may be directed in writing by Microsoft.\"             While the\n\nFacility Agreement did give KAO some ownership interest in the\n\nphysical CD-ROMs in its possession, the substantial value here\n\nwas not the discs themselves, but the computer programs on those\n\ndiscs--intellectual property that plainly belonged to Microsoft.\n\n             Appellants attempt to defeat this finding by noting\n\nthat the Agreement gave KAO some interest in the physical CD-\n\nROMs, and that the Agreement required KAO to indemnify Microsoft\n\nfor   lost    or   damaged   product,    typically   at   the   rate   of\n\nMicrosoft's replacement cost.3          However, the district court is\n\n\n      3\n      Notably, the appellants simply ignore the most relevant\n\"risk of loss provision\" in the Agreement--the one that requires\nKAO to pay 55% of the retail price of the software (rather than\n\n                                  -12-\n\fnot charged with resolving a contract dispute.                 It is charged\n\nwith   assessing   the   value   of   the    property     so    that   the   §\n\n2B1.1(b)(1) determination comports with the magnitude of the\n\ntheft.    Whatever the arrangements between KAO and Microsoft on\n\nthe duplication of thirty-six cent discs, those discs contained\n\nintellectual property, indisputably belonging to Microsoft, with\n\na wholesale market value of $168 for Windows and $486 for\n\nOffice.   It was this intellectual property that Crazy Bob's was\n\ninterested in buying and selling, not the KAO plastic on which\n\nit was contained.     Treating KAO as the \"victim\" and measuring\n\nloss in terms of the value of the CD duplication services rather\n\nthan the value of the intellectual property would simply be\n\nignoring reality.

Appellants advance\n\nseveral related arguments as to why the \"fair market value\"\n\nshould be calculated on the basis of lower wholesale prices.\n\n                First,       they   claim       that    the     wholesale    price      the\n\ndistrict    court       relied      upon    was      too   high    because       Microsoft\n\nsometimes       sold    its    products         at   lower    rates.        Bankhead     of\n\nMicrosoft stated that the standard wholesale price of Windows\n\nwas $165 and that the wholesale price of Office was $486.                                 A\n\nrepresentative from Staples, an international office supplies\n\nstore, stated that these were the prices it paid for Microsoft\n\nproducts during the relevant time period.                            While there was\n\nevidence,       as    the    district      court       noted,     that   \"Microsoft     on\n\noccasion disposed of its product in channels other than the\n\nregular wholesale distribution channel,\" there was no evidence\n\nthat the stolen discs were destined for such lower price sales.\n\nUnder   these        circumstances,        it    was    not     clear    error    for   the\n\ndistrict court to reason that the full wholesale price was the\n\nappropriate figure since Microsoft \"would have the option to\n\ndispose    of    [the       property]      at    the    higher     rather    than    lower\n\nprice.\"     See United States v.

Bankhead testified that she\n\nhad the expertise to identify flaws in the discs; based on her\n\nexamination, they had no defects.             LaPointe described the discs\n\nas in \"perfect condition.\"                 There is no evidence that the\n\npurchasers of the discs were told of defects or ever complained\n\nof them.          Although the defense had samples of the stolen discs\n\n(as did the court), they offered no expert or other witnesses on\n\nthis point.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n     The government also acknowledges that when the FBI searched\nCrazy Bob's it found some scratched Office discs that had been\ndumped, unwrapped, into a large box. As the evidence was clear\nthat the discs were delivered to Crazy Bob's in shrink-wrapped\nspindles, it was not erroneous for the district court to\nconclude that any scratches were caused by Crazy Bob's.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f            The appellants next claim that the price should be\n\ndiscounted      because    the      CD-ROMs   did    not   contain    legitimate\n\nlicenses.     We easily reject this claim.             The lack of a license\n\ndid not prevent the users from accessing the software.                         It\n\nsimply prevented them from doing so with Microsoft's blessing.\n\nThis argument, then, boils down to the claim that the loss\n\nshould be discounted because the goods were \"hot\" and therefore\n\ncould not be sold at the market price for legitimate products.\n\nObviously, the fact that a product is sold for less because it\n\nis stolen provides no basis for lowering the loss calculation,\n\nwhich is based on the wholesale price in a legitimate market\n\nrather than the black market price.

For the Simonses\n\nand Rosengard to prevail on this theory, they would have to show\n\nthat the lack of packaging reduced the fair market value of the\n\ndiscs from $17 million by approximately forty percent to the\n\nless than $10 million required for a lower enhancement under the\n\nGuidelines.     Coviello would have to demonstrate that the missing\n\npackaging reduced the value from $3.9 million by approximately\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthirty-five percent to less than $2.5 million.                  The district\n\ncourt did not clearly err in failing to make such a dramatic\n\nreduction.\n\n            Bankhead stated that \"almost all of the value in the\n\n$486 price charged by Microsoft for [Office] and the $165 price\n\ncharged for Windows[] derived from the intellectual property–-\n\nthat is, the software code contained on the CD-ROM.\"                  Indeed,\n\nMicrosoft paid KAO only seven dollars per unit for its services\n\nin performing disc duplication and adding packaging.                       Even\n\nassuming that the lack of packaging or any other offset (such as\n\na blemish on the disc artwork) warranted some reduction in the\n\nmarket value, this would only be a minor discount that would not\n\naffect the sentences.        The court supportably found that the\n\nmarket value of the software attributable to the Simonses and\n\nRosengard    was   between   $10    and    $20    million    and    the   value\n\nattributable to Coviello was between $2.5 and $5 million.\n\nC. Alternative Measures of Loss\n\n            The appellants suggest that \"fair market value\" may be\n\nan   inappropriate   measure   of    loss    in    this     case.    Coviello\n\nactually proposes that the replacement cost of the discs should\n\nbe the basis for calculating loss–-thirty-six cents per unit\n\n(for a total of $2,880 rather than $3.9 million).              Acknowledging\n\nthat this replacement cost would be inadequate, the Simonses\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fpropose   that   loss    should      be    measured    by    the     gain    for    the\n\ndefendants, about $1.3 million.                  Rosengard suggests a similar\n\napproach.\n\n            In support of departing from fair market value, the\n\nappellants     point    to   an    application       note    which    states       that\n\n\"[w]here the fair market value is difficult to ascertain or\n\ninadequate to measure harm to the victim, the court may measure\n\nloss in some other way, such as reasonable replacement cost to\n\nthe victim.\"     USSG § 2B1.1 (Comment n.2).                  Courts have noted\n\nthat market value is inadequate in cases where the products--\n\nsuch as government documents--have no market value.                     See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v.

As Crazy Bob's buyer, Rosengard was LaPointe's\n\nprimary   contact   in   virtually   all   of   the    stolen   property\n\ndealings, arranging which items would be purchased, for how\n\nmuch, and how LaPointe was to be paid.

Rosengard's claim\n\nthat \"he did not sell the Windows95 or the Office 97 for his own\n\ngain or business\" is belied by his admission that he received\n\n\"approximately $20,000\" in commissions for his role in the\n\npurchase and sale of the stolen Office discs.             Indeed, from\n\nMarch 6 to July 10, 1997–-when most of the Office discs were\n\nstolen-– Rosengard's salary jumped from $500 per week to $2,350\n\nper week.

Robert Simons' Restitution and Supervised Release\n\n         Robert Simons pled guilty and received a sentence of\n\nseventy months imprisonment, three years supervised release, and\n\nrestitution of $908,108.   He now argues, for the first time,\n\nthat because he was not warned of the possibility of restitution\n\nor supervised release in his Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 plea colloquy,\n\nwe should eliminate these portions of his sentence.   Under these\n\ncircumstances, where there has been a failure by the defendant\n\nto raise the error in the Rule 11 colloquy before the trial\n\ncourt, we nevertheless will determine Rule 11 compliance for the\n\nfirst time on appeal. See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707600\"><a href=\"/opinion/707600/united-states-v-olivia-martinez-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (1st.

There is no question that the district court\n\nshould have warned Robert of the possibilities of supervised\n\nrelease and restitution, as Rule 11(c)(1) explicitly requires.\n\nThe omission represented a partial failure to address Rule 11's\n\n\n\n    7The government suggests that Robert waived the right to\nchallenge the Rule 11 errors by proposing supervised release and\nrestitution in his sentencing memorandum, and hence cannot\nchallenge these errors on appeal. However, we find no waiver\nbecause these recommendations at the time of sentencing did not\namount to \"an intentional relinquishment or abandonment\" of the\nclaim that the Rule 11 colloquy was defective.

The only inference the jury might have drawn-–\n\nthat Bowdoin was slanting her testimony to protect Maxine in\n\npart because she had been represented by Crazy Bob's lawyers and\n\nmight have her legal fees paid by Maxine–-was permissible.\n\nContrary to Maxine's protestations, where evidence of prior\n\nrepresentation is relevant and not unduly prejudicial, there is\n\nno per se rule barring its admission.

In determining whether the\n\nfacts suggest the type of deliberate avoidance warranting an\n\ninstruction,      we   must      consider     whether     the    record    evidence\n\nreveals   \"flags\"      of    suspicion      that,    uninvestigated,        suggest\n\nwillful blindness.          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Richardson,</span> <span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">668</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671-672; see\n\nalso </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gabriele,</span> <span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">66-67</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(looking to presence of red\n\nflags); </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198097\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cunan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198097/united-states-v-cunan/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">39</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(same).\n\n            There were sufficient \"flags of suspicion\" to justify\n\nthe instruction.

The\nwell-settled rule is that arguments made for the first time in\na reply brief are waived. See United States v.

In any event, the argument is\nfrivolous, as both Maxine's closing and her cross-examination\nmade plain that her only defense was that she did not know the\nproducts were stolen.\n\n                                          -35-\n\f(2) that LaPointe insisted upon being paid in cash as the volume\n\nof their dealings increased; (3) when LaPointe delivered goods\n\nto   Maxine,    he   never   provided   invoices,   receipts   or   other\n\npaperwork; (4) LaPointe discussed with Maxine issuing a $116,000\n\ncheck to John Costello, whom Maxine falsely documented as an\n\nemployee.      The jury could have also inferred that Maxine was\n\naware, through her employee Rosengard, that the computer goods\n\nwere picked up at a shed at a private home and that LaPointe\n\ntold Rosengard \"ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies\"\n\non the one occasion when Rosengard asked about the source of the\n\ngoods.\n\n            Similarly, there were sufficient \"flags\" that Coviello\n\nshould have taken note of, including the fact that: (1) Knabb\n\nreferred to the Office discs in code as         \"Wheaties Boxes\"; (2)\n\nthe $245,000 payment for the discs would be made in cash, after\n\ndelivering the CDs to a restaurant parking lot; (3) Coviello was\n\nto personally receive about $80,000 for simply finalizing the\n\ndeal and delivering the product; (4) the Office discs did not\n\ninclude any legitimate licenses, manuals, or other packaging;\n\n(5) Crazy Bob's created a formula to fabricate unauthorized key\n\ncodes to access the software, which Coviello provided to Knabb;\n\nand (6) the goods were unaccompanied by any documentation such\n\nas a bill of sale, invoice or receipt.\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\f           Coviello further argues that even if the \"flags of\n\nsuspicion\" were present, the instruction was inappropriate in\n\nhis case because he was prosecuted only for conspiracy, and the\n\ninstruction might cause a jury to conclude that he could join a\n\nconspiracy      without    actually      entering    an    agreement.         This\n\nargument   is    unpersuasive.          The    district    court    first     gave\n\ncomplete instructions on the conspiracy elements (emphasizing\n\nthat the evidence must show \"that the defendant knowingly and\n\nintentionally      became       a     participant     or     member     of    the\n\nconspiracy\"), and only then turned to the instructions on the\n\nsubstantive crimes, including the willful blindness instruction.\n\nIt is plain that the willful blindness instruction related to\n\nwhether the defendants knew that the property was stolen, not to\n\njoining the conspiracy.
