(Lynch, Circuit Judge, joined by Torruella,\n\nChief Judge and by Lipez, Circuit Judge as to Parts II and III).\n\n\n\n\n                                     By the Court:\n\n\n\n                                    Phoebe Morse, Clerk.\n\n\n\n\n                              -2-\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge, with whom TORRUELLA, Chief Judge,\n\njoins, and with whom LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, joins as to Parts II and\n\nIII, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the denial of defendant\n\nWoodrum's petition for rehearing en banc for two reasons: the case has\n\ngreat constitutional and societal significance, and so meets the\n\nrequirements of Rule 35(a), Fed. R. App. P., and there is reason to\n\ndoubt that the opinion is correctly decided.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          This case is an important one, not just for the development\n\nof Fourth Amendment law, but also for the quality of life in urban\n\nareas and the protection of individual rights. These factors alone\n\nargue for rehearing en banc.    The panel decision permits police,\n\nwithout any particular justification, to stop and look over taxicabs\n\noccupied with passengers. This is a seizure under the Constitution, as\n\nthe government concedes. See Townes v. City of New York, 176 F.3d 138,\n\n144 (2d Cir. 1999). Normally, the government would need probable\n\ncause, or at least reasonable suspicion, of a crime to make such a\n\nstop.   If, after the stop, the police see anything that looks\n\nsuspicious, they may then get the passenger out of the cab. If the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fpolice see that the passenger has something illicit (here a gun), the\n\npassenger may be arrested and the evidence seized. The latter two \"if\"\n\npropositions are well established under Fourth Amendment law. But the\n\nopening premise -- that the police may randomly stop a cab with a\n\npassenger -- is a new rule and is the crux of the matter here.\n\n           According to the panel, a voluntary, police-sponsored program\n\n(called the Taxi Inspection Program for Safety or TIPS) justifies this\n\nnew rule. By its participation in TIPS, the cab company consents to\n\nthe police stopping the cab, the company's consent can be attributed to\n\nthe cab driver, and from there, consent can be imputed to the passenger\n\nbecause of his decision to enter the cab.       See United States v.\n\nWoodrum, 202 F.3d 1, 9-11 (1st Cir. 2000). Thus, effectively, the cab\n\ncompany is permitted to waive the Fourth Amendment rights of citizens\n\nto be free from seizure.\n\n           There are important interests on both sides of this case.\n\nBegun in 1991 as \"Operation Taxi,\" and modified in 1996 to become TIPS,1\n\nthe program is a well-intentioned response to a rash of attacks and\n\nshootings, some fatal, of cab drivers by passengers, particularly in\n\nminority urban areas. Cab driving -- in Boston, as elsewhere -- is a\n\n\n     1    The program was revised after a number of Massachusetts trial\ncourts granted motions to suppress items seized in searches that\nresulted from \"Operation Taxi\" stops. See Commonwealth v. Carle, Nos.\n94-11050, 94-11049, 1995 WL 737537, at *3 (Mass. Super. Ct. Oct. 31,\n1995); Commonwealth v. Bland, No. 94-10127, 1994 WL 879833, at *3-*4\n(Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 23, 1994); Commonwealth v. Cosme, No. 94-10014,\n1994 WL 879664, at *4 (Mass. Super. Ct. May 9, 1994).\n\n                                  -4-\n\fnotoriously dangerous occupation and the safety of drivers has been,\n\nand continues to be, at risk. Efforts to protect the safety of cab\n\ndrivers are certainly warranted. And one of the collateral benefits of\n\nthe TIPS program may be to encourage cab drivers to provide service to\n\ncertain neighborhoods, neighborhoods they would otherwise shy away\n\nfrom.    Given the realities of urban life, the panel's decision\n\naffirming the validity of consent to seizure through the TIPS program\n\nmay mean that the TIPS program will be emulated in other cities and in\n\nother sectors of the economy.2\n\n           But there are also interests on the other side, particularly\n\nFourth Amendment interests. The very purpose of many constitutional\n\nguarantees, particularly those contained in the Fourth Amendment, is to\n\nfetter the exercise of discretion by the police. Indeed, it may be\n\nunhealthy for the police themselves to have such unfettered discretion,\n\nas such discretion could easily lead to dishonest and sloppy police\n\nwork. Further, unfettered police discretion has at times led to racial\n\nbias in law enforcement, whether intended or not. Commentators and\n\ncases have noted that being \"stopped for being black\" is a frequent\n\n\n\n     2     New York City implemented a similar program, now called TRIP\n(Taxi and Livery Robbery Inspection Program), in 1993. Recently, the\nNew York Court of Appeals found seizures conducted under the program\nconstitutionally invalid, thereby tainting evidence acquired as a\nresult. See In re Muhammad F., 722 N.E.2d 45, 51-52 (N.Y. 1999),\npetition for cert. filed sub nom. New York v. Muhammad F., 68 U.S.L.W.\n3577 (U.S. Mar. 14, 2000) (No. 99-1443); see also United States v.\nSantiago, 950 F. Supp. 590, 596-98 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).\n\n                                 -5-\n\foccurrence. See, e.g., Randall Kennedy, Race, Crime, and the Law 138-\n\n63 (1997). A decade ago, the Massachusetts Attorney General issued a\n\nreport assailing the Boston Police Department for the practice of\n\nsubjecting black citizens to unconstitutional searches and seizures.\n\nSee Report of the Attorney General's Civil Rights Division on Boston\n\nPolice Department Practices (Dec. 18, 1990), cited in David Cole, No\n\nEqual Justice 25-26 & 57 n.30 (1999).       And in 1992, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts held unconstitutional, under the Fourth\n\nAmendment, another policy of the Boston Police, under which the police\n\nstopped and searched known or suspected gang members and their\n\nassociates on sight.3 See Commonwealth v. Phillips, 595 N.E.2d 310,\n\n314-16 (Mass. 1992).\n\n          The police already have considerable discretion to stop\n\npersons. A police officer can stop a person based simply on reasonable\n\nsuspicion, see Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968), and in determining\n\nwhether they have reasonable suspicion, the police may consider the\n\n\n\n     3    As Judge Newman has said,\n\n     [t]he risk inherent in such a practice is that some police\n     officers will use the pretext of traffic violations or other minor\n     infractions to harass members of groups identified by factors that\n     are totally impermissible as a basis for law enforcement activity\n     -- factors such as race or ethnic origin, or simply appearances\n     that some police officers do not like, such as young men with long\n     hair, heavy jewelry, and flashy clothing.\n\nUnited States v. Scopo, 19 F.3d 777, 785 (2d Cir. 1994) (Newman, C.J.,\nconcurring).\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffact that a person turns and runs, see Illinois v. Wardlow, 120 S. Ct.\n\n673, 676 (2000). In addition, traffic stops, in practice, may be used\n\nas a pretext to investigate other crimes because courts will not\n\nusually inquire into the actual motives of the police. See Whren v.\n\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996). Although police may not make\n\nstops based on race, it is difficult to show such motivation, and even\n\nobtaining discovery about racial practices is difficult. See United\n\nStates v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 468-70 (1996). When one sector of\n\nthe community feels the brunt of discretionary police action more than\n\nothers, that sector may be less likely to accept that the purpose of\n\nthe law is to protect them. The extension of police discretion that\n\nresults from the panel decision and its societal consequences make this\n\ncase worthy of a rehearing en banc.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          The case should be reheard by the en banc court because a\n\nnovel constitutional issue is involved. It is far from clear that the\n\npanel's decision (even as amended) is correct. The case turns on the\n\nfollowing question: Does the participation of the cab company in a\n\nvoluntary program, which gives the company's consent to the police\n\nstopping a company's cab, amount to a consent by the passenger of the\n\ncab to being stopped, seized, and visually searched when there is\n\nneither reasonable suspicion nor probable cause to believe there is any\n\ncriminal activity?\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          This question and the panel's answer raise a number of\n\nconcerns. To begin with, the opinion applies third-party consent\n\nprinciples derived from the search context to the seizure context.\n\nThis is novel. Woodrum made no individual decision to submit to police\n\nauthority. Rather, that decision was made for him by the taxicab\n\nowner, and imputedly, the driver.4\n\n          The panel opinion correctly points out that \"when the\n\nprosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary\n\nconsent, it . . . may show that permission to search was obtained from\n\na third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient\n\nrelationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\"\n\nUnited States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 171 (1974). Common authority\n\n\"rests . . . on mutual use of the property by persons generally having\n\njoint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to\n\nrecognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the\n\ninspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk\n\nthat one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\"\n\nId. at 171 n.7.\n\n          But there is no authority cited for the application of third-\n\nparty consent rules to the seizure context. Indeed, the only authority\n\n     4     Even if the cab company could consent to stops and seizures\nof its cabs when the cab had only the driver in it, it does not follow\nthat the driver has any authority to consent to the seizure of the\npassenger. It would be a fiction to characterize the consent given by\nthe driver and the passenger as \"direct.\"\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcited by the panel for the proposition that \"[s]eizures by consent\n\ngenerally are considered reasonable\" is Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S.\n\n248, 250-51 (1991). See Woodrum, 202 F.3d at 11. But that case is a\n\nsearch case, not a seizure case; it is a first-party consent case, not\n\na third-party consent case; and it is a search of an automobile case,\n\nnot a seizure of a person case. See Jimeno, 500 U.S. at 249. Indeed,\n\nthe panel opinion acknowledges that third-party consent has only been\n\napplied to searches, not seizures.       See Woodrum, 202 F.3d at 10-11.\n\n          Critical to the panel's decision is the analogy it draws\n\nbetween the shared control over the taxicab and the shared control over\n\na living space. The analogy is weak. In the latter instance, one co-\n\nhabitant's consent is imputed to other co-habitants because persons\n\nliving together reasonably understand that their housemates may invite\n\noutsiders (including the police) to enter the premises and look around\n\n\"common areas.\"\n\n          Although the passenger, in entering a taxicab, certainly\n\nrelinquishes some control over the technical driving decisions of the\n\ntaxicab driver, the relationship is not like the sharing expected\n\nbetween housemates. When a passenger hires a taxicab, the expectation\n\nis that the passenger assumes control over all the important decisions,\n\nincluding the vehicle's travel route (should the passenger choose to\n\nspecify) and its ultimate destiny. It is doubtful that a passenger,\n\nthrough nothing more than this relationship with the taxicab driver,\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fconsents to the unfettered discretion of the police to stop the taxicab\n\nin order to make sure that he himself is not a dangerous criminal.\n\n          Further, the relevant seizure, here, is not of the taxicab,\n\nand so the cab driver and passenger's overlapping authority over the\n\nvehicle is beside the point. For the purposes of third-party consent\n\nin this seizure, the relevant object over which the cab driver and\n\npassenger would need to have common authority is the taxicab passenger.\n\nBut the cab driver does not, cannot, have common authority over the\n\npassenger’s person; simply, and obviously, a person cannot give third-\n\nparty consent to the search or seizure of another person.\n\n          The opinion also discounts the privacy interests of someone\n\nwho hails a cab. There is in fact a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nby the passenger in a cab.    Sometimes people take cabs precisely\n\nbecause cabs give a greater degree of privacy than public mass transit\n\nor even than walking along a sidewalk. If a cab driver were to stop\n\nthe cab against the will of the passenger, the fare would normally end;\n\nthe passenger's expectation is that the cab will not normally stop\n\nuntil it reaches the destination dictated by the passenger; and the\n\npassenger expects he will enjoy the privacy of the passenger\n\ncompartment.\n\n          The cab passenger is not like someone who visits a prison and\n\nso \"consents\" to certain special prison procedures that are driven by\n\nsecurity needs. Cf. United States v. Sihler, 562 F.2d 349, 350-51 (5th\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fCir. 1977). The better analogy may be to a hotel room, which, like a\n\ncab, is rented for sole occupancy for a period of time. We would not\n\nsay that the owner of a hotel could consent to the search of hotel\n\nrooms occupied by guests through the owner's voluntary participation in\n\na program that authorized police to enter the rooms at their discretion\n\nto protect the cleaning staff or to prevent theft of hotel property.5\n\nIn Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483 (1964), the Supreme Court held\n\nthat the Fourth Amendment protected a hotel guest from use of evidence\n\nseized under a \"consent\" to search his hotel room given by the desk\n\nclerk.   See id. at 490.\n\n          Further, the purported \"consent\" here is of an odd sort --\n\nit is not a consent to specific police action in a specific factual\n\nsetting, as is usually the situation in consent to search cases. In\n\n\n\n     5     It is a weak argument that a passenger who hails a cab,\nperhaps the only cab in sight and perhaps after dark, has voluntarily\nconsented to being seized because there is a small decal on the cab\nindicating its participation in the TIPS program. In this case,\nWoodrum apparently hailed the cab in the dark between midnight and 1\na.m. on a January night in Boston. In Massachusetts, a cab is a public\naccommodation and a common carrier, and citizens have every reason to\nthink that their constitutional rights will be protected, not waived,\nwhen they take a cab. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 92A (public\naccommodation); Hathaway v. Checker Taxi Co., 73 N.E.2d 603, 606-07\n(Mass. 1947) (taxicab drivers, as common carriers for hire, owe their\npassengers the \"highest degree of care\"). As the Seventh Circuit has\nsaid, \"Courts confronted with claims of implied consent have been\nreluctant to uphold a warrantless search based simply on actions taken\nin the light of a posted notice.\" McGann v. Northeast Reg'l Commuter\nR.R. Corp., 8 F.3d 1174, 1180 (7th Cir. 1993). In any event, the\nstandards for a voluntary waiver of a constitutional right are not met\nby hailing a cab and then getting in one that bears a TIPS decal.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fthose situations, the voluntariness of the consent is determined from\n\nthe circumstances. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 248-49\n\n(1973). Here, by contrast, the anticipatory consent to seize given by\n\nthe cab company is open-ended: the seizure may be at any time and under\n\nany circumstances. Cf. United States v. Patrick, 959 F.2d 991, 996\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1992). Further, there is no mechanism for the cab company,\n\nthe driver, or the passenger to revoke the anticipatorily given consent\n\nin a given situation. Indeed, the passenger here has no option to\n\nterminate the seizure and so this situation is unlike the search in\n\nFlorida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 436-37 (1991). Thus, the panel\n\napproves a new and questionable Fourth Amendment doctrine of\n\nirrevocable anticipatory consent to seizure (and third-party consent at\n\nthat).\n\n          In some respects, this case is more akin to random stops of\n\nmotorists on public highways by the police that are not supported by\n\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion. In Delaware v. Prouse, 440\n\nU.S. 648 (1979), the Supreme Court held that such stops were\n\nunconstitutional. See id. at 663. In Prouse, the Court distinguished\n\nbetween impermissible \"sporadic and random stops of individual vehicles\n\nmaking their way through city traffic\" and permissible \"roadblocks\n\nwhere all vehicles are brought to a halt or a near halt.\" Id. at 657.\n\nThis case is unlike sobriety checkpoints where all cars and all drivers\n\nare stopped and inspected for signs of intoxication, a practice that\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fwas upheld in Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S.\n\n444, 447 (1990). Indeed, the government has made no argument here that\n\nthe stop can be justified under Sitz. The government's justification\n\nfor the stop turns entirely on the issue of consent. As in Prouse, the\n\npolice here had virtually unfettered discretion and the ability to\n\nengage in selective enforcement.\n\n          \"[T]he Fourth Amendment requires that a seizure must be based\n\non specific, objective facts indicating that society's legitimate\n\ninterests require the seizure of the particular individual, or that the\n\nseizure must be carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit,\n\nneutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.\" Brown v.\n\nTexas, 443 U.S. 47, 51 (1979).      The TIPS program is not a plan\n\n\"embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual\n\nofficers.\" There is a purported limit in the police manual for the\n\nTIPS program that the \"[s]tops should be conducted when and wherever\n\nnecessary, particularly during the evening and early morning hours.\n\nAttention will be given to isolated and high crime areas.\" These\n\ninstructions are so broad that they most likely will not act as limits\n\nat all.6 In fact, the legend on the decal may be the most accurate\n\n\n     6    A Massachusetts Superior Court judge held that almost\n\nidentical instructions, in a predecessor program to TIPS, did not act\nto limit \"the arbitrary and unbridled discretion of the police\nofficers.\" Commonwealth v. Cosme, No. 9410014, 1994 WL 879664, at *4\n(Mass. Super. Ct. May 9, 1994).\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fdescription: \"This vehicle may be stopped . . . at any time . . . .\"\n\nIf an open-ended anticipatory third-party consent to the seizure of a\n\npassenger in a cab is doubtful, and if the random stopping of cabs\n\nabsent such consent is forbidden, then the result reached here is\n\nquestionable.\n\n                                III.\n\n          This is a difficult case and the panel opinion is a lucid\n\narticulation of an alternative analysis. But, for the reasons stated,\n\nI respectfully dissent from the denial of the petition for\n\n rehearing en banc.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f-15-\n\f[cc: Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Wortman, Mr. Richardson, Mr. Hamilton & Ms\n\nChaitowitz]\n\n\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f",

I respectfully dissent from the denial of defendant\n\nWoodrum's petition for rehearing en banc for two reasons: the case has\n\ngreat constitutional and societal significance, and so meets the\n\nrequirements of Rule 35(a), Fed. R. App. P., and there is reason to\n\ndoubt that the opinion is correctly decided.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          This case is an important one, not just for the development\n\nof Fourth Amendment law, but also for the quality of life in urban\n\nareas and the protection of individual rights. These factors alone\n\nargue for rehearing en banc.    The panel decision permits police,\n\nwithout any particular justification, to stop and look over taxicabs\n\noccupied with passengers. This is a seizure under the Constitution, as\n\nthe government concedes. See Townes v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763761\"><a href=\"/opinion/763761/victor-townes-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-the-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n144 (2d Cir. 1999). Normally, the government would need probable\n\ncause, or at least reasonable suspicion, of a crime to make such a\n\nstop.   If, after the stop, the police see anything that looks\n\nsuspicious, they may then get the passenger out of the cab. If the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fpolice see that the passenger has something illicit (here a gun), the\n\npassenger may be arrested and the evidence seized. The latter two \"if\"\n\npropositions are well established under Fourth Amendment law. But the\n\nopening premise -- that the police may randomly stop a cab with a\n\npassenger -- is a new rule and is the crux of the matter here.\n\n           According to the panel, a voluntary, police-sponsored program\n\n(called the Taxi Inspection Program for Safety or TIPS) justifies this\n\nnew rule. By its participation in TIPS, the cab company consents to\n\nthe police stopping the cab, the company's consent can be attributed to\n\nthe cab driver, and from there, consent can be imputed to the passenger\n\nbecause of his decision to enter the cab.

Thus, effectively, the cab\n\ncompany is permitted to waive the Fourth Amendment rights of citizens\n\nto be free from seizure.\n\n           There are important interests on both sides of this case.\n\nBegun in 1991 as \"Operation Taxi,\" and modified in 1996 to become TIPS,1\n\nthe program is a well-intentioned response to a rash of attacks and\n\nshootings, some fatal, of cab drivers by passengers, particularly in\n\nminority urban areas.

Efforts to protect the safety of cab\n\ndrivers are certainly warranted. And one of the collateral benefits of\n\nthe TIPS program may be to encourage cab drivers to provide service to\n\ncertain neighborhoods, neighborhoods they would otherwise shy away\n\nfrom.    Given the realities of urban life, the panel's decision\n\naffirming the validity of consent to seizure through the TIPS program\n\nmay mean that the TIPS program will be emulated in other cities and in\n\nother sectors of the economy.2\n\n           But there are also interests on the other side, particularly\n\nFourth Amendment interests. The very purpose of many constitutional\n\nguarantees, particularly those contained in the Fourth Amendment, is to\n\nfetter the exercise of discretion by the police. Indeed, it may be\n\nunhealthy for the police themselves to have such unfettered discretion,\n\nas such discretion could easily lead to dishonest and sloppy police\n\nwork. Further, unfettered police discretion has at times led to racial\n\nbias in law enforcement, whether intended or not.

And in 1992, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts held unconstitutional, under the Fourth\n\nAmendment, another policy of the Boston Police, under which the police\n\nstopped and searched known or suspected gang members and their\n\nassociates on sight.3 See Commonwealth v.

In addition, traffic stops, in practice, may be used\n\nas a pretext to investigate other crimes because courts will not\n\nusually inquire into the actual motives of the police.

Although police may not make\n\nstops based on race, it is difficult to show such motivation, and even\n\nobtaining discovery about racial practices is difficult. See United\n\nStates v.

When one sector of\n\nthe community feels the brunt of discretionary police action more than\n\nothers, that sector may be less likely to accept that the purpose of\n\nthe law is to protect them. The extension of police discretion that\n\nresults from the panel decision and its societal consequences make this\n\ncase worthy of a rehearing en banc.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          The case should be reheard by the en banc court because a\n\nnovel constitutional issue is involved. It is far from clear that the\n\npanel's decision (even as amended) is correct. The case turns on the\n\nfollowing question: Does the participation of the cab company in a\n\nvoluntary program, which gives the company's consent to the police\n\nstopping a company's cab, amount to a consent by the passenger of the\n\ncab to being stopped, seized, and visually searched when there is\n\nneither reasonable suspicion nor probable cause to believe there is any\n\ncriminal activity?\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          This question and the panel's answer raise a number of\n\nconcerns. To begin with, the opinion applies third-party consent\n\nprinciples derived from the search context to the seizure context.\n\nThis is novel. Woodrum made no individual decision to submit to police\n\nauthority. Rather, that decision was made for him by the taxicab\n\nowner, and imputedly, the driver.4\n\n          The panel opinion correctly points out that \"when the\n\nprosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary\n\nconsent, it . . . may show that permission to search was obtained from\n\na third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient\n\nrelationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\"\n\nUnited States v. Matlock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108967\"><a href=\"/opinion/108967/united-states-v-matlock/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171 (1974). Common authority\n\n\"rests . . . on mutual use of the property by persons generally having\n\njoint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to\n\nrecognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the\n\ninspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk\n\nthat one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\"\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108967\"><a href=\"/opinion/108967/united-states-v-matlock/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 171 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">n.7.\n\n          But there is no authority cited for the application of third-\n\nparty consent rules to the seizure context. Indeed, the only authority\n\n     4     Even if the cab company could consent to stops and seizures\nof its cabs when the cab had only the driver in it, it does not follow\nthat the driver has any authority to consent to the seizure of the\npassenger. It would be a fiction to characterize the consent given by\nthe driver and the passenger as \"direct.\"\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcited by the panel for the proposition that \"[s]eizures by consent\n\ngenerally are considered reasonable\" is Florida v. Jimeno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112595\"><a href=\"/opinion/112595/florida-v-jimeno/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250-51 (1991).

But that case is a\n\nsearch case, not a seizure case; it is a first-party consent case, not\n\na third-party consent case; and it is a search of an automobile case,\n\nnot a seizure of a person case. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112595\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jimeno,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112595/florida-v-jimeno/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Indeed,\n\nthe panel opinion acknowledges that third-party consent has only been\n\napplied to searches, not seizures.       See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767456\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Woodrum,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/767456/united-states-v-ronald-woodrum/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">10-11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n          Critical to the panel's decision is the analogy it draws\n\nbetween the shared control over the taxicab and the shared control over\n\na living space. The analogy is weak. In the latter instance, one co-\n\nhabitant's consent is imputed to other co-habitants because persons\n\nliving together reasonably understand that their housemates may invite\n\noutsiders (including the police) to enter the premises and look around\n\n\"common areas.\"\n\n          Although the passenger, in entering a taxicab, certainly\n\nrelinquishes some control over the technical driving decisions of the\n\ntaxicab driver, the relationship is not like the sharing expected\n\nbetween housemates. When a passenger hires a taxicab, the expectation\n\nis that the passenger assumes control over all the important decisions,\n\nincluding the vehicle's travel route (should the passenger choose to\n\nspecify) and its ultimate destiny. It is doubtful that a passenger,\n\nthrough nothing more than this relationship with the taxicab driver,\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fconsents to the unfettered discretion of the police to stop the taxicab\n\nin order to make sure that he himself is not a dangerous criminal.\n\n          Further, the relevant seizure, here, is not of the taxicab,\n\nand so the cab driver and passenger's overlapping authority over the\n\nvehicle is beside the point. For the purposes of third-party consent\n\nin this seizure, the relevant object over which the cab driver and\n\npassenger would need to have common authority is the taxicab passenger.\n\nBut the cab driver does not, cannot, have common authority over the\n\npassenger’s person; simply, and obviously, a person cannot give third-\n\nparty consent to the search or seizure of another person.\n\n          The opinion also discounts the privacy interests of someone\n\nwho hails a cab. There is in fact a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nby the passenger in a cab.    Sometimes people take cabs precisely\n\nbecause cabs give a greater degree of privacy than public mass transit\n\nor even than walking along a sidewalk. If a cab driver were to stop\n\nthe cab against the will of the passenger, the fare would normally end;\n\nthe passenger's expectation is that the cab will not normally stop\n\nuntil it reaches the destination dictated by the passenger; and the\n\npassenger expects he will enjoy the privacy of the passenger\n\ncompartment.\n\n          The cab passenger is not like someone who visits a prison and\n\nso \"consents\" to certain special prison procedures that are driven by\n\nsecurity needs. Cf. United States v. Sihler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349265\"><a href=\"/opinion/349265/united-states-v-clifford-george-sihler/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350-51 (5th\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fCir. 1977). The better analogy may be to a hotel room, which, like a\n\ncab, is rented for sole occupancy for a period of time. We would not\n\nsay that the owner of a hotel could consent to the search of hotel\n\nrooms occupied by guests through the owner's voluntary participation in\n\na program that authorized police to enter the rooms at their discretion\n\nto protect the cleaning staff or to prevent theft of hotel property.5\n\nIn Stoner v.

See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106777\"><a href=\"/opinion/106777/stoner-v-california/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 490.\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n          Further, the purported \"consent\" here is of an odd sort --\n\nit is not a consent to specific police action in a specific factual\n\nsetting, as is usually the situation in consent to search cases. In\n\n\n\n     5     It is a weak argument that a passenger who hails a cab,\nperhaps the only cab in sight and perhaps after dark, has voluntarily\nconsented to being seized because there is a small decal on the cab\nindicating its participation in the TIPS program. In this case,\nWoodrum apparently hailed the cab in the dark between midnight and 1\na.m. on a January night in Boston. In Massachusetts, a cab is a public\naccommodation and a common carrier, and citizens have every reason to\nthink that their constitutional rights will be protected, not waived,\nwhen they take a cab. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 92A (public\naccommodation); Hathaway v. Checker Taxi Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606-07\n(Mass. 1947) (taxicab drivers, as common carriers for hire, owe their\npassengers the \"highest degree of care\"). As the Seventh Circuit has\nsaid, \"Courts confronted with claims of implied consent have been\nreluctant to uphold a warrantless search based simply on actions taken\nin the light of a posted notice.\" McGann v. Northeast Reg'l Commuter\nR.R.

In any event, the\nstandards for a voluntary waiver of a constitutional right are not met\nby hailing a cab and then getting in one that bears a TIPS decal.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fthose situations, the voluntariness of the consent is determined from\n\nthe circumstances. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108800\"><a href=\"/opinion/108800/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248-49\n\n(1973). Here, by contrast, the anticipatory consent to seize given by\n\nthe cab company is open-ended: the seizure may be at any time and under\n\nany circumstances. Cf. United States v. Patrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580259\"><a href=\"/opinion/580259/united-states-v-gary-anthony-patrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 996\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1992). Further, there is no mechanism for the cab company,\n\nthe driver, or the passenger to revoke the anticipatorily given consent\n\nin a given situation. Indeed, the passenger here has no option to\n\nterminate the seizure and so this situation is unlike the search in\n\nFlorida v. Bostick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112631\"><a href=\"/opinion/112631/florida-v-bostick/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436-37 (1991). Thus, the panel\n\napproves a new and questionable Fourth Amendment doctrine of\n\nirrevocable anticipatory consent to seizure (and third-party consent at\n\nthat).\n\n          In some respects, this case is more akin to random stops of\n\nmotorists on public highways by the police that are not supported by\n\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion. In Delaware v. Prouse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110045\"><a href=\"/opinion/110045/delaware-v-prouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1979), the Supreme Court held that such stops were\n\nunconstitutional.

Indeed, the government has made no argument here that\n\nthe stop can be justified under Sitz. The government's justification\n\nfor the stop turns entirely on the issue of consent. As in Prouse, the\n\npolice here had virtually unfettered discretion and the ability to\n\nengage in selective enforcement.\n\n          \"[T]he Fourth Amendment requires that a seizure must be based\n\non specific, objective facts indicating that society's legitimate\n\ninterests require the seizure of the particular individual, or that the\n\nseizure must be carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit,\n\nneutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.\" Brown v.\n\nTexas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110128\"><a href=\"/opinion/110128/brown-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (1979).      The TIPS program is not a plan\n\n\"embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual\n\nofficers.\" There is a purported limit in the police manual for the\n\nTIPS program that the \"[s]tops should be conducted when and wherever\n\nnecessary, particularly during the evening and early morning hours.\n\nAttention will be given to isolated and high crime areas.\" These\n\ninstructions are so broad that they most likely will not act as limits\n\nat all.6 In fact, the legend on the decal may be the most accurate\n\n\n     6    A Massachusetts Superior Court judge held that almost\n\nidentical instructions, in a predecessor program to TIPS, did not act\nto limit \"the arbitrary and unbridled discretion of the police\nofficers.\" Commonwealth v. Cosme, No. 9410014, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">879664</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4\n(Mass.
