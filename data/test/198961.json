Scher, Attorney, Appellate Staff, Civil Division,\nUnited States Department of Justice, with whom David W. Ogden,\nActing Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and William\nKanter, Attorney, Appellate Staff, were on brief, for\nrespondent.\n\fMay 25, 2000\n\f          Per Curiam.       This proceeding began when the American\n\nFederation of Government Employees, Local 3936 (the union) filed\n\nan unfair labor practice charge against the respondent under 5\n\nU.S.C. § 7116(a)(1), (5).          In substance, the union accused the\n\nrespondent of reneging on a memorandum of understanding that\n\ncontemplated the inauguration of a flex-time work schedule, at\n\nleast for a six-month trial period.            An administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ)   determined       that    the    respondent    had    repudiated    the\n\nagreement without cause and had thereby violated the statute.\n\nThe   respondent    took    no    exceptions     to   this    determination.\n\nConsequently,      the   Federal       Labor   Relations     Authority    (the\n\nAuthority), acting pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 2423.41(a), accepted\n\nthe ALJ's recommendation and issued a final decision and order\n\non May 15, 1998.\n\n          Several months went by, during which the respondent\n\nignored the remedial order.              When pressed, it claimed that\n\nchanged circumstances rendered compliance impossible (or, at\n\nleast, impracticable).          Unmoved, the Authority repaired to this\n\ncourt, seeking enforcement of the order.               On the eve of oral\n\nargument, however, the respondent began filing a series of\n\nmotions indicating that circumstances again had changed (this\n\ntime for the better), and that it was now willing and able to\n\ncomply with the Authority's remedial order.                  The respondent\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsuggested, on the basis of this assurance, that we dismiss the\n\npetition as moot.        The Authority objected.\n\n            We heard oral argument on May 8, 2000.             The respondent\n\nurged us to decline enforcement as unnecessary and to dismiss\n\nthe petition as moot.        The Authority, citing the long delay and\n\nthe    tortuous    history   of   the    proposed      flex-time    experiment,\n\nimplored us to enforce the order.\n\n            We grant the petition for enforcement.                 In doing so,\n\nwe take no view of the merits of the respondent's impossibility\n\ndefense.       Assuming, arguendo, as the respondent has asserted,\n\nthat    altered    circumstances        rendered     implementation     of   the\n\nremedial       order   impossible    for      some    period   of    time,   the\n\nrespondent nonetheless concedes that the circumstances have\n\nchanged again and that no impediment now exists to compliance\n\nwith the terms of the remedial order.              That being so, we believe\n\nthat the Authority is entitled to an enforcement decree.                     Cf.\n\nNLRB v. Raytheon Co., 398 U.S. 25, 27 (1970); NLRB v. Pearl\n\nBookbinding Co., 517 F.2d 1108, 1114 (1st Cir. 1975).                  Although\n\nwe do not doubt that courts have a modicum of discretion to\n\nwithhold enforcement of orders like the order sub judice in the\n\ninterests, say, of permitting voluntary compliance, we see no\n\nreason    to    invoke   that     seldom-used        discretion     here.    The\n\nAuthority has satisfied all of the prerequisites for judicial\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fenforcement, and the entry of an enforcement decree will not\n\nunfairly prejudice the respondent. Rather, judicial enforcement\n\nwill serve as an effective reminder to the respondent of its\n\ncontinuing obligation fully and seasonably to effectuate the\n\nterms of the Authority's remedial order.\n\n\n\n         The application for enforcement is GRANTED and the\n\nAuthority's order is ENFORCED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\f",
