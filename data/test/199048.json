Appellant Manuel Rodríguez-Santana was convicted\n\nof conspiring to illegally import and possess with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine and of illegally importing cocaine. He was sentenced to serve\n\n360 months of imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised\n\nrelease. Appellant claims on appeal (1) that he received ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel; (2) that the prosecution's closing argument was\n\nimproper; and (3) that the court's instructions to the jury constitute\n\nreversible error. None of appellant's claims has merit, and we affirm\n\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\nI.   INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL CLAIM\n\n          Appellant    argues   that   his   trial   counsel   rendered\n\nconstitutionally deficient assistance by (1) failing to join a\n\ncodefendant's successful motion for a mistrial; (2) failing to move to\n\nstrike a juror with limited English language ability; and (3) making an\n\nimproper closing argument. To succeed on his ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim, appellant must demonstrate both that counsel's\n\nperformance fell below the applicable standard of reasonable\n\ndecisionmaking under the circumstances and that such substandard\n\nperformance resulted in prejudice. See United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d\n\n456, 463 (1st Cir. 1993). Particularly where tactical decisions are at\n\nissue, appellant must overcome a \"strong presumption that counsel's\n\nconduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional\n\nassistance.\"   Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984).\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          1.   Motion for Mistrial\n\n          On the fifth day of appellant's trial, a court security\n\nofficer informed the trial judge that he had overheard a member of the\n\njury remark that she recognized codefendant Modesto Molina from a\n\nprevious criminal proceeding, in which she had been a member of the\n\njury pool but was excused without participating in the actual trial.\n\nThe district court also learned that, when this comment was made,\n\nanother juror remarked that Molina \"seemed to be in every courtroom in\n\nthe district,\" in apparent reference to having seen Molina's name on a\n\ncourt calendar posted near the public telephones. After learning of\n\nthese remarks, the district court individually interviewed, in the\n\npresence of counsel, each member of the jury. During these interviews,\n\nit was established that the comments were made in reference to Molina\n\nonly, and not to appellant Rodríguez-Santana.\n\n          Based on the jurors' remarks, Molina's counsel moved for a\n\nmistrial, which was granted by the district court. Rodríguez-Santana's\n\ncounsel declined to join the motion, explaining to the court (1) that\n\nhe considered the comments to implicate only Molina and not his client;\n\n(2) that his client's trial had already been delayed two years for\n\nMolina's benefit; (3) that both he and his client were pleased with the\n\ncross-examination of the government's main witness and otherwise felt\n\nthat the evidence was \"coming in\" well for appellant; and (4) that,\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbased on those factors, appellant had instructed him not to join the\n\nmotion for a mistrial.\n\n          We find counsel's decision not to join the motion for a\n\nmistrial to fall well within the \"wide range of reasonable professional\n\nassistance.\" See id. It was apparent from the interviews with the\n\njurors that appellant was implicated only marginally, if at all, by the\n\ngrounds for the mistrial motion.        Furthermore, counsel expressed\n\nreasonable grounds for declining to join the motion, most notably\n\nappellant's own wishes.     See id. at 691 (\"The reasonableness of\n\ncounsel's actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the\n\ndefendant's own statements or actions.\"). Under the circumstances, we\n\nhold that the failure to join the motion for mistrial did not\n\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n          2.   Motion to Strike\n\n          Appellant next contends that it was ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel for his attorney not to move to strike a juror who\n\nindicated, during the interviews discussed above, that although she\n\nunderstood English and was fully able to understand the proceedings she\n\nnevertheless was not comfortable speaking English.\n\n          The qualifications for federal jury service, set forth at 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1865, state that any person is qualified for jury service\n\nunless, inter alia, she \"is unable to speak the English language.\" Id.\n\n§ 1865(b)(3); see also McDonough Power Equip. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f548, 555 (1984) (\"[T]he statutory qualifications for jurors require\n\nonly a minimal competency in the English language.\") (citing 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1865). When the juror at issue here indicated to the court that she\n\ndid not speak English easily,1 the district court conducted an in camera\n\nhearing with the juror in the presence of counsel to evaluate her\n\nproficiency in English. During that hearing, it was established (1)\n\nthat the juror had completed twenty-two credits of English courses in\n\nconnection with receiving a bachelor's degree in secretarial sciences;\n\n(2) that she used textbooks in English; (3) that she had participated\n\nin two previous criminal cases in federal court and was satisfied that\n\nshe could follow the case and the evidence; and (4) that she understood\n\nthe judge's questions in English during the in camera hearing, although\n\nshe responded in Spanish.     On the basis of the hearing, both the\n\nprosecutor and appellant's trial counsel indicated that they were\n\nsatisfied with the juror's capacity to understand the case and continue\n\nher service on the jury.\n\n           Under the circumstances, we think that the juror's minimum\n\ncompetency in the English language was sufficiently established so that\n\nappellant's trial counsel was not unreasonable in determining not to\n\nmove to strike the juror. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688 (\"In any\n\ncase presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must\n\n\n\n1 We note that this occurred after the juror had successfully filled\nout the juror qualification form and participated in voir dire.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fbe whether counsel's assistance was reasonable considering all the\n\ncircumstances.\"). The attorney for the United States obviously agreed\n\nwith counsel's evaluation of the juror's language skills,2 and the\n\ndistrict court also appears to have been satisfied with the juror's\n\nEnglish-language ability. See United States v. González-Soberal, 109\n\nF.3d 64, 69 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We are hesitant to reverse the reasoned\n\nconclusion of the trial judge on the question of a juror's ability to\n\nunderstand English because the trial judge is in a much better position\n\nto assess the language competency of a particular juror.\").\n\nConsequently, we hold counsel's decision not to constitute ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. See id. (\"Although . . . the juror's command of\n\nthe English language was less than that of a native speaker, [it does]\n\nnot warrant the conclusion that the juror was unable to follow the\n\nproceedings or understand the evidence and therefore do[es] not merit\n\nreversal.\").\n\n          3.   Defense Counsel's Closing Argument\n\n          Appellant also claims that his attorney's closing argument\n\nconstituted ineffective assistance by breaching the attorney's ethical\n\nduty of loyalty to his client. However, the portions of the transcript\n\nemphasized by appellant, when read in the context of the closing\n\nargument as a whole, were not unconstitutionally deficient.\n\n2 We note that neither prosecution nor defense could reasonably have\nexpected to obtain any tactical advantage from a juror with limited\nEnglish language ability.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          Although appellant complains about his trial counsel's\n\ndecision to concede that the United States had proven a conspiracy,\n\nthis decision was not unreasonable under the circumstances.        See\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688. In light of the substantial evidence of\n\nthe conspiracy, and considering the guilty pleas of twelve of the\n\nfourteen defendants named in the indictment, defense counsel made a\n\nreasonable tactical decision not to dispute the existence of a\n\nconspiracy but instead to focus on the alleged lack of evidence tying\n\nhis client to that conspiracy, while also attacking the credibility of\n\nthe government's witnesses. This is a defense strategy that has been\n\nsuccessful in other cases, and there is nothing in this case to suggest\n\nthat defense counsel's purely tactical decision in this regard was\n\nindicative of any disloyalty or other defect in his representation of\n\nappellant. We therefore hold that defense counsel's closing argument\n\ndid not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nII.   PROSECUTION'S CLOSING ARGUMENT\n\n          Appellant next objects to the prosecutor's statement during\n\nclosing that \"The Honorable Court will also instruct you in more detail\n\nthat Manuel Rodríguez Santana participated in a conspiracy.\" That\n\nstatement is flatly improper. Nonetheless, it is quite clear from the\n\nadjoining parts of the prosecution's closing argument that what the\n\nprosecutor meant was that the district court would instruct the jury in\n\ndetail about the elements of a criminal conspiracy charge. In fact,\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe prosecutor himself proceeded to explain the necessary elements and\n\nthat the government bore the burden of proving them. The impropriety\n\nof the prosecutor's isolated comment surely did not affect the outcome\n\nof trial, and therefore does not merit reversal. See United States v.\n\nHughes, 211 F.3d 676, 684 (1st Cir. 2000) (applying plain error review\n\nto prosecution's comments during closing argument where defendant did\n\nnot object at trial, and stating that \"[w]e will not reverse a\n\nconviction for plain error unless it is clear that, inter alia, the\n\nerror 'affected the outcome of the proceedings.'\").\n\n          Appellant also claims that the prosecutor improperly vouched\n\nfor the credibility of the government's cooperating witnesses when he\n\ntold the jury that the United States \"depends on persons like them to\n\ncome forward and provide the details of how Manual Rodríguez Santana\n\nwas involved in the conspiracy,\" and also when he reminded the jury\n\nthat a cooperating witness had pled guilty. See United States v.\n\nRosario-Díaz, 202 F.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[P]rosecutors may not\n\nplace the prestige of the United States behind a witness by making\n\npersonal assurances about the credibility of a witness or by indicating\n\nthat facts not before the jury support the witness's testimony.\").\n\n          First, we do not find reversible error in the prosecutor's\n\nstatement that the government depends upon cooperating witnesses in its\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions of criminal defendants. Such statement\n\nis certainly true, and more important it does not suggest that such\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcooperating witnesses are reliable or credible. Particularly in light\n\nof the clear jury instructions given by the court advising the jury to\n\nuse caution when evaluating the testimony of cooperating witnesses, the\n\nprosecutor's statement was very unlikely to affect the outcome of the\n\nproceedings and therefore does not warrant reversal. See Hughes, 211\n\nF.2d at 684.\n\n          Second, the prosecutor's reminder that a cooperating witness\n\nhad pled guilty in the case was accurately based in the record and made\n\nno assurance as to the credibility of the witnesses's testimony. Under\n\nthe circumstances, we hold that this statement did not constitute\n\nimproper vouching.\n\nIII.   JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n          Finally, appellant challenges two aspects of the jury\n\ninstructions given by the district court. First, appellant contends\n\nthat the court erred when it instructed the jury that \"[i]t is only\n\nrequired that the government's proof exclude any reasonable doubt\n\nconcerning the defendant's guilt.\" This statement by the district\n\ncourt came at the end of a thorough and correct articulation of the\n\nprosecution's burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The\n\ninstruction explicitly stated that the defendant need not prove his\n\ninnocence nor even produce any evidence at all, and also emphasized the\n\n\"strict and heavy\" nature of the government's burden. Taken in the\n\ncontext of the complete jury instruction on burden of proof, the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fcourt's reference to the \"exclusion\" of reasonable doubt was not\n\nmisleading and by no means constitutes reversible error. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d 1148, 1159-60 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(upholding nearly identical instruction, without discussion of the\n\n\"exclude\" language).\n\n          Second, appellant complains of the district court's\n\ninstruction that \"[t]he fact that an accomplice has entered a plea of\n\nguilty to the offense charged is not evidence in and of itself, of the\n\nguilt of the other person.\" In United States v. González-González, 136\n\nF.3d 6, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1998), we discouraged the use of \"in and of\n\nitself\" language in reference to the guilty plea of an accomplice, and\n\nwe repeat today that the district courts should not use such language.\n\nHowever, because the court's instructions in González-González, taken\n\nas a whole, unequivocally told the jury not to consider an accomplice's\n\nguilty plea as evidence of the defendant's guilt, we held that a new\n\ntrial was not warranted.     See id. at 11.\n\n          The district court in this case failed to give the kind of\n\nemphatic clarifying instructions present in González-González.\n\nHowever, we nevertheless find that the erroneous \"in and of itself\"\n\ninstruction was harmless error under these particular circumstances.\n\nThe jury instructions as a whole made clear to the jury that they\n\nshould find appellant guilty only if the prosecution had proven his\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including all of the elements of the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcrimes and including in particular proof of appellant's individual\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy and substantive offense. Given the\n\nsubstantial evidence submitted to the jury of appellant's guilt, we\n\ncannot conclude that the court's ambiguous instruction as to the\n\nprobative value of an accomplice's guilty plea would have affected the\n\njury's verdict.    The error, therefore, does not require reversal.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

During that hearing, it was established (1)\n\nthat the juror had completed twenty-two credits of English courses in\n\nconnection with receiving a bachelor's degree in secretarial sciences;\n\n(2) that she used textbooks in English; (3) that she had participated\n\nin two previous criminal cases in federal court and was satisfied that\n\nshe could follow the case and the evidence; and (4) that she understood\n\nthe judge's questions in English during the in camera hearing, although\n\nshe responded in Spanish.     On the basis of the hearing, both the\n\nprosecutor and appellant's trial counsel indicated that they were\n\nsatisfied with the juror's capacity to understand the case and continue\n\nher service on the jury.\n\n           Under the circumstances, we think that the juror's minimum\n\ncompetency in the English language was sufficiently established so that\n\nappellant's trial counsel was not unreasonable in determining not to\n\nmove to strike the juror.

The attorney for the United States obviously agreed\n\nwith counsel's evaluation of the juror's language skills,2 and the\n\ndistrict court also appears to have been satisfied with the juror's\n\nEnglish-language ability. See United States v. González-Soberal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We are hesitant to reverse the reasoned\n\nconclusion of the trial judge on the question of a juror's ability to\n\nunderstand English because the trial judge is in a much better position\n\nto assess the language competency of a particular juror.\").\n\nConsequently, we hold counsel's decision not to constitute ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.

Defense Counsel's Closing Argument\n\n          Appellant also claims that his attorney's closing argument\n\nconstituted ineffective assistance by breaching the attorney's ethical\n\nduty of loyalty to his client. However, the portions of the transcript\n\nemphasized by appellant, when read in the context of the closing\n\nargument as a whole, were not unconstitutionally deficient.\n\n2 We note that neither prosecution nor defense could reasonably have\nexpected to obtain any tactical advantage from a juror with limited\nEnglish language ability.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          Although appellant complains about his trial counsel's\n\ndecision to concede that the United States had proven a conspiracy,\n\nthis decision was not unreasonable under the circumstances.        See\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Strickland,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In light of the substantial evidence of\n\nthe conspiracy, and considering the guilty pleas of twelve of the\n\nfourteen defendants named in the indictment, defense counsel made a\n\nreasonable tactical decision not to dispute the existence of a\n\nconspiracy but instead to focus on the alleged lack of evidence tying\n\nhis client to that conspiracy, while also attacking the credibility of\n\nthe government's witnesses. This is a defense strategy that has been\n\nsuccessful in other cases, and there is nothing in this case to suggest\n\nthat defense counsel's purely tactical decision in this regard was\n\nindicative of any disloyalty or other defect in his representation of\n\nappellant. We therefore hold that defense counsel's closing argument\n\ndid not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nII.   PROSECUTION'S CLOSING ARGUMENT\n\n          Appellant next objects to the prosecutor's statement during\n\nclosing that \"The Honorable Court will also instruct you in more detail\n\nthat Manuel Rodríguez Santana participated in a conspiracy.\" That\n\nstatement is flatly improper. Nonetheless, it is quite clear from the\n\nadjoining parts of the prosecution's closing argument that what the\n\nprosecutor meant was that the district court would instruct the jury in\n\ndetail about the elements of a criminal conspiracy charge. In fact,\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe prosecutor himself proceeded to explain the necessary elements and\n\nthat the government bore the burden of proving them. The impropriety\n\nof the prosecutor's isolated comment surely did not affect the outcome\n\nof trial, and therefore does not merit reversal. See United States v.\n\nHughes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198913\"><a href=\"/opinion/198913/united-states-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 (1st Cir. 2000) (applying plain error review\n\nto prosecution's comments during closing argument where defendant did\n\nnot object at trial, and stating that \"[w]e will not reverse a\n\nconviction for plain error unless it is clear that, inter alia, the\n\nerror 'affected the outcome of the proceedings.'\").\n\n          Appellant also claims that the prosecutor improperly vouched\n\nfor the credibility of the government's cooperating witnesses when he\n\ntold the jury that the United States \"depends on persons like them to\n\ncome forward and provide the details of how Manual Rodríguez Santana\n\nwas involved in the conspiracy,\" and also when he reminded the jury\n\nthat a cooperating witness had pled guilty. See United States v.\n\nRosario-Díaz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767458\"><a href=\"/opinion/767458/united-states-v-ralph-rosario-diaz-aka-juni-united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[P]rosecutors may not\n\nplace the prestige of the United States behind a witness by making\n\npersonal assurances about the credibility of a witness or by indicating\n\nthat facts not before the jury support the witness's testimony.\").\n\n          First, we do not find reversible error in the prosecutor's\n\nstatement that the government depends upon cooperating witnesses in its\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions of criminal defendants. Such statement\n\nis certainly true, and more important it does not suggest that such\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcooperating witnesses are reliable or credible. Particularly in light\n\nof the clear jury instructions given by the court advising the jury to\n\nuse caution when evaluating the testimony of cooperating witnesses, the\n\nprosecutor's statement was very unlikely to affect the outcome of the\n\nproceedings and therefore does not warrant reversal. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hughes,</span> <span class=\"volume\">211</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">684</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n          Second, the prosecutor's reminder that a cooperating witness\n\nhad pled guilty in the case was accurately based in the record and made\n\nno assurance as to the credibility of the witnesses's testimony. Under\n\nthe circumstances, we hold that this statement did not constitute\n\nimproper vouching.\n\nIII.   JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n          Finally, appellant challenges two aspects of the jury\n\ninstructions given by the district court. First, appellant contends\n\nthat the court erred when it instructed the jury that \"[i]t is only\n\nrequired that the government's proof exclude any reasonable doubt\n\nconcerning the defendant's guilt.\" This statement by the district\n\ncourt came at the end of a thorough and correct articulation of the\n\nprosecution's burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The\n\ninstruction explicitly stated that the defendant need not prove his\n\ninnocence nor even produce any evidence at all, and also emphasized the\n\n\"strict and heavy\" nature of the government's burden. Taken in the\n\ncontext of the complete jury instruction on burden of proof, the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fcourt's reference to the \"exclusion\" of reasonable doubt was not\n\nmisleading and by no means constitutes reversible error. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez-Cardona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555433\"><a href=\"/opinion/555433/united-states-v-osvaldo-rodriguez-cardona-aka-valdo/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1159-60 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(upholding nearly identical instruction, without discussion of the\n\n\"exclude\" language).\n\n          Second, appellant complains of the district court's\n\ninstruction that \"[t]he fact that an accomplice has entered a plea of\n\nguilty to the offense charged is not evidence in and of itself, of the\n\nguilt of the other person.\" In United States v. González-González, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1998), we discouraged the use of \"in and of\n\nitself\" language in reference to the guilty plea of an accomplice, and\n\nwe repeat today that the district courts should not use such language.\n\nHowever, because the court's instructions in González-González, taken\n\nas a whole, unequivocally told the jury not to consider an accomplice's\n\nguilty plea as evidence of the defendant's guilt, we held that a new\n\ntrial was not warranted.     See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 11.\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n          The district court in this case failed to give the kind of\n\nemphatic clarifying instructions present in González-González.\n\nHowever, we nevertheless find that the erroneous \"in and of itself\"\n\ninstruction was harmless error under these particular circumstances.\n\nThe jury instructions as a whole made clear to the jury that they\n\nshould find appellant guilty only if the prosecution had proven his\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including all of the elements of the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcrimes and including in particular proof of appellant's individual\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy and substantive offense. Given the\n\nsubstantial evidence submitted to the jury of appellant's guilt, we\n\ncannot conclude that the court's ambiguous instruction as to the\n\nprobative value of an accomplice's guilty plea would have affected the\n\njury's verdict.    The error, therefore, does not require reversal.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f</pre>",
