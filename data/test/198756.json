Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n     Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nBjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Defender, for appellant.\r\nMark E. Howard, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Paul M.\r\nGagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 23, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  Appellant Sean Gray was\r\nconvicted by a jury on one count of bank robbery and sentenced to\r\n71 months in prison.  His sole claim on appeal is that the district\r\ncourt committed prejudicial error when it instructed the jury that\r\nits view of the robber's escape route was not evidence in the case. \r\nAlthough we acknowledge that a jury view may at times be treated as\r\nevidence, we find no reversible error and therefore affirm\r\nappellant's conviction.\r\n                 I. Factual Background\r\nThe Community Bank and Trust in Exeter, New Hampshire, was\r\nrobbed shortly after 1 p.m. on June 23, 1998.  Bank employees\r\ndescribed the lone robber as a male with a goatee and \"Fu Manchu\"\r\nmustache who was wearing mirrored sunglasses and a blue hooded\r\nsweatshirt.  He approached the center teller window, pulled a bag\r\nfrom under the sweatshirt, and said, \"This is no joke; give me your\r\nmoney.\"  Two bank employees described the robber as having a\r\nsignificant limp.  He \"left in a hurry\" and was seen running across\r\nthe street, along railroad tracks, and then up a hill toward a\r\nbridge that passes over the tracks near Park Street (the \"Park\r\nStreet bridge\"), where he apparently was picked up by a woman in a\r\nwhite car with Florida license plates.  A teacher who lives near\r\nthe Park Street bridge saw a man emerge from the footpath near the\r\nrailroad tracks and described him as having a very distinct gait\r\nirregularity, or limp. The man was clutching a bag at the time.\r\nPolice found a blue hooded sweatshirt on the footpath leading up to\r\nPark Street and a pair of shattered mirrored sunglasses on the\r\nstreet where the white vehicle had been parked.\r\nGray was arrested a week later and charged with bank robbery. \r\nThe district court granted Gray's unopposed motion seeking to allow\r\nthe jury to view the bank and the robber's escape route, but\r\nrefused his requested instruction that the jury consider the view\r\nas evidence.  Instead, the court advised the jurors that their view\r\nof the bank and surrounding area was not evidence, explaining that\r\nit was \"intended simply to provide you with points of reference or\r\na context in which to consider the evidence in this case.\"\r\nDefense counsel objected to the instruction, though\r\nrecognizing that it was consistent with First Circuit case law.  In\r\nClemente v. Carnicon-Puerto Rico Management Assocs., 52 F.3d 383\r\n(lst Cir. 1995), we stated that \"the rule in this circuit is that\r\na view does not itself constitute or generate evidence,\" id. at\r\n386, reflecting the widely adopted position that a view is\r\npermitted in the discretion of the trial judge \"only to assist the\r\ntrier of fact in understanding and evaluating the evidence\"\r\nintroduced in court, see 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on\r\nEvidence  216, at 29 (5th ed. 1999).  \r\nOn appeal, Gray argues that the language in Clemente was\r\ndictum, and therefore not binding, and that, in any event, it is\r\nillogical as well as incorrect by contemporary standards to exclude\r\na view from consideration as evidence.  He argues that he is\r\nentitled to a new trial because the view was integral to his\r\ndefense and the court's instruction unfairly prejudiced him.  He\r\nhad attempted at trial to prove that he could not have been the\r\nrobber because a work-related leg injury left him physically\r\nincapable of fleeing quickly along the uneven, hilly escape route\r\nthat the robber had followed.  He maintains that the court's\r\ninstruction precluded him from relying on the jury's own\r\nexperiences with the difficult terrain to support his doctor's\r\ntestimony that he could not have covered the route as quickly as\r\nthe robber. \r\nOur review of the relevant law and commentary now leads us to\r\nconclude that it is unrealistic to exclude a view from the status\r\nof evidence in every circumstance.  We do not go further in this\r\nopinion than to remove this blanket prohibition. But even if the\r\ncourt's instruction on the view was error, it must be deemed\r\nharmless because, as we shall explain, it foreclosed very little\r\nbenefit from the view that a permissive instruction would have\r\nallowed, and because the testimonial evidence points so\r\noverwhelmingly to the appellant's guilt.\r\n               II. The Nature of the View\r\nAlthough our unconditional statement in Clemente that a jury\r\nview \"does not itself constitute or generate evidence\" may\r\nrepresent the  majority position, see 52 F.3d at 386 &amp; n.3, the\r\nmomentum appears to be headed in the opposite direction.  Indeed,\r\nmost of the usual commentators on matters of evidence either\r\nquestion the rationale for excluding views from evidentiary status,\r\nobserve that that position has lost favor, or both.   See McCormick\r\non Evidence  216, at 29 (the \"preferable\" position is that a view\r\nis \"evidence like any other\"); 22 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W.\r\nGraham Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure  5176, at 141 (1978)\r\n(\"The notion that a view is not 'evidence' has been discredited by\r\nthe writers, and explicitly rejected by one modern code.\")\r\n(citations omitted); 2 Joseph McLaughlin, ed., Weinstein's Federal\r\nEvidence  403.07[4] (2d ed. 1999) (\"[T]he modern position is that\r\nthe view does provide independent evidence.\"); 4 John Henry\r\nWigmore, Wigmore on Evidence  1168, at 391, 388 (1972) (referring\r\nto the \"unsound theory\" that a view \"does not involve the\r\nconsideration of evidence by the jury\" and noting that \"it has in\r\nmost jurisdictions been repudiated\").  Cf. John M. Maguire,  Cases\r\nand Materials on Evidence 141 (1973) (noting that courts are\r\ndivided on the question but not taking a position).\r\nGiven the invitation to look more closely than was necessary\r\nin Clemente, we have found no reason to disagree with the experts. \r\nPerhaps the most compelling and pragmatic observation is that the\r\ndistinction between non-evidence that aids a jury's understanding\r\nand traditional, independent evidence is \"lost on a jury,\" see 2\r\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence  403.07[4].  We agree that it is\r\nunlikely that jurors, confronted with testimonial evidence at odds\r\nwith what they have seen, \"will apply the metaphysical distinction\r\nsuggested and ignore the evidence of their own senses,\" McCormick\r\non Evidence  216, at 29.  The Tenth Circuit has expressed a\r\nsimilar thought:\r\n     We acknowledge that jurisdictions vary as to whether a\r\nview is treated as evidence or simply as an aid to help\r\nthe trier of fact understand the evidence.  However, we\r\nbelieve such a distinction is only semantic, because any\r\nkind of presentation to the jury or the judge to help the\r\nfact finder determine what the truth is and assimilate\r\nand understand the evidence is itself evidence.  The\r\nUnited States Supreme Court has stated that the\r\n\"inevitable effect [of a view] is that of evidence no\r\nmatter what label the judge may choose to give it.\" \r\nSnyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 121 (1934),\r\noverruled on other grounds . . . .\r\n\nLillie v. United States, 953 F.2d 1188, 1190 (10th Cir. 1992)\r\n(footnote omitted); see also Wigmore on Evidence  1168, at 385-86\r\n(\"The suggestion that, in a view or any other mode of inspection by\r\nthe jury, they are merely `enabled better to comprehend the\r\ntestimony,' and do not consult an additional source of knowledge,\r\nis simply not correct in fact . . . .\"); Carpenter v. Carpenter, 78\r\nN.H. 440, 447, 101 A. 628, 631 (1917) (quoted in Maguire, at 141\r\nn.3) (\"If the object is black when seen by the jury it would be\r\nabsurd to expect them to find that it was white, in the absence of\r\nevidence indicating that they had been imposed upon.\").\r\nMoreover, the rationale for the distinction increasingly lacks\r\nforce as technology advances.  The position that a view should not\r\nbe considered evidence appears to derive from a concern that the\r\n\"facts\" gathered by the jury from an on-the-scene observation\r\ncannot be made part of the record for purposes of appeal.  See,\r\ne.g., In re Application, 102 F.R.D. 521, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 1984)\r\n(Weinstein, C.J.); McCormick on Evidence  216, at 29; 4 Wigmore on\r\nEvidence  1168, at 381-82, 385; Thomas P. Hardman, \"The\r\nEvidentiary Effect of a View: Stare Decisis or Stare Dictis?\"  53\r\nW. Va. L. Rev. 103, 113 (1951) [hereinafter \"Evidentiary Effect of\r\na View\"].  A record of a view can be made, however, through the use\r\nof video or other photographic equipment, as well as through\r\ntranscription of any remarks made.  See In re Application, 102\r\nF.R.D. at 524; H.D. Wendorf, \"Some Views on Jury Views,\" 15 Baylor\r\nL. Rev. 379, 384 (1963) [hereinafter \"Jury Views\"] (\"Even conceding\r\nthe objection directed to a lack of record . . . , it can be\r\nadequately answered by providing a summary of the view proceedings\r\nin the record.\").  Although such a record may not capture every\r\nnuance of the experience, that difficulty is equally applicable to\r\nother kinds of evidence:\r\n     A witness' countenance, tone of voice, mode and manner of\r\nexpression, and general demeanor on the stand, oftentimes\r\ninfluence the jury as much in estimating the weight they\r\ngive and attach to his testimony as the words he utters,\r\nand yet they cannot be sent up with the record.\r\n\nHart v. State, 15 Tex. App. 202, 228 (1883) (cited in \"Jury Views,\"\r\n15 Baylor L. Rev. at 384); see also 4 Wigmore on Evidence  1168,\r\nat 384-85 (quoting same case); \"The Evidentiary Effect of a View,\" \r\n53 W. Va. Law Rev. at 113 (same).\r\nPrecautions, of course, must be taken to minimize problems,\r\nbecause jury supervision is more difficult outside the courtroom. \r\nSee \"Jury Views,\" 15 Baylor L. Rev. at 384-85.  Certain of the\r\nsafeguards we outlined in Clemente respond to these concerns,\r\nincluding the recommendation that the judge be present and that\r\nlimits be placed on the interaction between counsel, the subject of\r\nthe view, and the jurors.   See 52 F.3d at 386; see also \"Jury\r\nViews,\" 15 Baylor L. Rev. at 394, 396 (\"[P]roper judicial\r\nadministration demands the presence and supervision of the judge at\r\nthe view . . . and definitive instructions to refrain from\r\nconversation and independent exploration should be given the jury\r\nprior to a view.\").  Of obvious importance is the court's\r\nresponsibility to ensure that what transpires at the view is fully\r\nand accurately recorded, most likely by a court reporter.  See\r\nClemente, 52 F.3d at 386.\r\nWe emphasize that, by recognizing that the information\r\nobtained through a view may constitute independent evidence at\r\ntrial, we do not diminish the trial court's inherent power to\r\ndecide whether to allow a view at all.  Determining if a view is\r\nappropriate in a particular situation remains a matter committed to\r\nthe trial court's informed discretion.  See Clemente, 52 F.3d at\r\n386.\r\nMoreover, the fact that we now regard a view to be within the\r\ncategory of admissible evidence not only endows a trial court with\r\nthe same discretion to control its admission that the court has in\r\ndealing with all evidentiary matters, but also may in the future\r\nrequire special techniques and practices as experience indicates. \r\nThis opinion does not purport to resolve all issues that may arise\r\nstemming from the status of a view as evidence; it simply removes\r\nthe concept of a view from the highly ambiguous state of being\r\nsomething to consider but not evidence.  Our holding thus increases\r\nthe range of admissible evidence but leaves intact the district\r\ncourt's authority to refuse a view in particular cases, or to\r\nexclude a view, or portions of it, from evidence when an on-the-\r\nscene observation does not transpire as the court had anticipated.\r\n               III. The View in this Case\r\nAlthough the district court in this case excluded the view\r\nfrom evidence without considering whether it satisfied the standard\r\nrequirements of admissibility, its decision does not require\r\nreversal of appellant's conviction, because any error\r\nunquestionably was harmless.  See United States v. Crochiere, 129\r\nF.3d 233, 236 (lst Cir. 1997).  As we explain below, Gray was able\r\nto rely on other evidence to attempt to show his inability to\r\ntraverse the difficult terrain of the robber's getaway path and,\r\nthough the view was not treated as evidence, the jurors' exposure\r\nto the scene presumably influenced their evaluation of what they\r\nsaw and heard in the courtroom.  In addition, considerable evidence\r\npointed to  appellant as the bank robber.\r\nA. Other evidence of the terrain.  The government introduced\r\nphotographs of the railroad tracks and footpath area that had been\r\nseen by the jury as part of the view.  Although the court's\r\ninstruction limited defendant's formal use of the jurors' direct\r\nexposure to the scene, their first-hand experiences obviously\r\ninformed their examination of the photographs.  In reality, the\r\ndistrict court's directive that the jury could use the view as a\r\n\"context\" for considering other evidence provided appellant with\r\nnearly all he could have expected from using the view as direct\r\nevidence.  The jurors essentially were encouraged to bring to mind\r\nwhat they had seen when reviewing evidence, including the\r\nphotographs, relating to the difficulty of the terrain.  As we\r\nacknowledged earlier in concluding that a view may constitute\r\nevidence, the distinction between context and evidence is likely to\r\nbe lost on the jury in the ordinary case.  See supra at 5-7. This\r\ncase seems well within that norm. \r\nDefendant's assertion that the jurors' observations at the\r\nscene were not captured equivalently by the photographs and other\r\ntrial evidence, while perhaps true, thus misses the point.  Indeed,\r\ndefense counsel made multiple references to the view in guiding the\r\njury's recollection of the evidence, noting at one point that the\r\nrobber ran down the left side of the railroad right-of-way and\r\nthat, \"[a]s you know from the view, that's the rougher side.\" At\r\nanother point, presumably seeking to discount the significance of\r\nappellant's leg injury, counsel stated that the jury could find,\r\n\"based on your view of the path,\" that the robber might have been\r\nseen limping because he twisted his ankle along the way.  The\r\ndegree by which treatment of the view as evidence rather than\r\ncontext would have strengthened appellant's case is thus minimal,\r\nparticularly in light of the substantial evidence of his guilt, to\r\nwhich we now turn.\r\nB. Robbery evidence.  \r\nThe evidence that appellant committed the bank robbery\r\nincluded the testimony of eight witnesses who identified him in a\r\nbank surveillance photograph, including his mother-in-law and\r\nbrother-in-law, the latter of whom called police to report that the\r\nrobber was Gray after seeing a televised picture of the suspect. \r\nThree longtime friends also were among those who identified him in\r\nthe surveillance photograph, and a bank employee, Sue Palmer,\r\ntestified that the robber was the same man with whom she had spoken\r\nin the bank on June 2, 1998.  Gray admitted in his testimony that\r\nhe was in the bank on that date.\r\nThe circumstantial evidence included the blue hooded\r\nsweatshirt found on the footpath near the railroad tracks, which\r\nGray's brother-in-law identified as resembling one belonging to\r\nGray.  As noted earlier, witnesses reported that the robber had\r\nworn such a garment. An FBI hair and fiber expert testified that\r\nhairs found on the sweatshirt were consistent with samples taken\r\nfrom Gray.  The getaway vehicle was identified as white with\r\nFlorida license plates, and Gray drove a white Suzuki with Florida\r\nplates.  Both Gray and the robber were described as having a\r\ndistinctive Fu Manchu style mustache.  Several witnesses said the\r\nrobber had a pronounced limp, and Gray's treating physician\r\nacknowledged that Gray would exhibit a significant limp when\r\nrunning.  The day after the robbery, Gray paid $310 cash for a room\r\nat a Boston hotel, even though he had been receiving welfare\r\nassistance to pay for a motel room in New Hampshire for the two\r\nweeks before the robbery.  Finally, when Gray was arrested at a\r\nManchester, New Hampshire hotel a week after the robbery, a\r\nnewspaper clipping that named him as a suspect was found on the\r\nnight stand between the two beds in his room.\r\nIn light of this considerable evidence linking appellant to\r\nthe crime, and the negligible effect of the court's instruction\r\nthat the view was not evidence, we conclude that any error in the\r\ntreatment of the view must be deemed harmless.\r\nThe judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.       \r\n",

See \"Jury Views,\" 15 Baylor L. Rev. at 384-85. Certain of the safeguards we outlined in Clemente respond to these concerns, including the recommendation that the judge be present and that limits be placed on the interaction between counsel, the subject of the view, and the jurors. See 52 F.3d at 386; see also \"Jury Views,\" 15 Baylor L. Rev. at 394, 396 (\"[P]roper judicial administration demands the presence and supervision of the judge at the view . . . and definitive instructions to refrain from conversation and independent exploration should be given the jury prior to a view.\"). Of obvious importance is the court's responsibility to ensure that what transpires at the view is fully and accurately recorded, most likely by a court reporter. See Clemente, 52 F.3d at 386.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that, by recognizing that the information obtained through a view may constitute independent evidence at trial, we do not diminish the trial court's inherent power to decide whether to allow a view at all. Determining if a view is appropriate in a particular situation remains a matter committed to the trial court's informed discretion. See Clemente, 52 F.3d at 386.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the fact that we now regard a view to be within the category of admissible evidence not only endows a trial court with the same discretion to control its admission that the court has in dealing with all evidentiary matters, but also may in the future require special techniques and practices as experience indicates. This opinion does not purport to resolve all issues that may arise stemming from the status of a view as evidence; it simply removes the concept of a view from the highly ambiguous state of being something to consider but not evidence. Our holding thus increases the range of admissible evidence but leaves intact the district court's authority to refuse a view in particular cases, or to exclude a view, or portions of it, from evidence when an on-the-scene observation does not transpire as the court had anticipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. The View in this Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court in this case excluded the view from evidence without considering whether it satisfied the standard requirements of admissibility, its decision does not require reversal of appellant's conviction, because any error unquestionably was harmless. See United States v. Crochiere, 129 F.3d 233, 236 (lst Cir. 1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As we explain below, Gray was able to rely on other evidence to attempt to show his inability to traverse the difficult terrain of the robber's getaway path and, though the view was not treated as evidence, the jurors' exposure to the scene presumably influenced their evaluation of what they saw and heard in the courtroom. In addition, considerable evidence pointed to appellant as the bank robber.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Other evidence of the terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced photographs of the railroad tracks and footpath area that had been seen by the jury as part of the view. Although the court's instruction limited defendant's formal use of the jurors' direct exposure to the scene, their first-hand experiences obviously informed their examination of the photographs. Inreality, the district court's directive that the jury could use the view as a \"context\" for considering other evidence provided appellant with nearly all he could have expected from using the view as direct evidence. The jurors essentially were encouraged to bring to mind what they had seen when reviewing evidence, including the photographs, relating to the difficulty of the terrain. As we acknowledged earlier in concluding that a view may constitute evidence, the distinction between context and evidence is likely to be lost on the jury in the ordinary case. See supra at 549-50. This case seems well within that norm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's assertion that the jurors' observations at the scene were not captured equivalently by the photographs and other trial evidence, while perhaps true, thus misses the point. Indeed, defense counsel made multiple references to the view in guiding the jury's recollection of the evidence, noting at one point that the robber ran down the left side of the railroad right-of-way and that, \"[a]s you know from the view, that's the rougher side.\" At another point, presumably seeking to discount the significance of appellant's leg injury, counsel stated that the jury could find, \"based on your view of the path,\" that the robber might have been seen limping because he twisted his ankle along the way. The degree by which treatment of the view as evidence rather than context would have strengthened appellant's case is thus minimal, particularly in light of the substantial evidence of his guilt, to which we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Robbery evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence that appellant committed the bank robbery included the testimony of eight witnesses who identified him in a bank surveillance photograph, including his mother-in-law and brother-in-law, the latter of whom called police to report that the robber was Gray after seeing a televised picture of the suspect. Three longtime friends also were among those who identified him in the surveillance photograph, and a bank employee, Sue Palmer, testified that the robber was the same man with whom she had spoken in the bank on June 2, 1998. Gray admitted in his testimony that he was in the bank on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstantial evidence included the blue hooded sweatshirt found on the footpath near the railroad tracks, which Gray's brother-in-law identified as resembling one belonging to Gray. As noted earlier, witnesses reported that the robber had worn such a garment. An FBI hair and fiber expert testified that hairs found on the sweatshirt were consistent with samples taken from Gray. The getaway vehicle was identified as white with Florida license plates, and Gray drove a white Suzuki with Florida plates. Both Gray and the robber were described as having a distinctive Fu Manchu style mustache. Several witnesses said the robber had a pronounced limp, and Gray's treating physician acknowledged that Gray would exhibit a significant limp when running. The day after the robbery, Gray paid $310 cash for a room at a Boston hotel, even though he had been receiving welfare assistance to pay for a motel room in New Hampshire for the two weeks before the robbery. Finally, when Gray was arrested at a Manchester, New Hampshire hotel a week after the robbery, a newspaper clipping that named him as a suspect was found on the night stand between the two beds in his room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this considerable evidence linking appellant to the crime, and the negligible effect of the court's instruction that the view was not evidence, we conclude that any error in the treatment of the view must be deemed harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  We do not mean to suggest that recording the view is a condition of its treatment as evidence.

If defendant believed the record was lacking in proof of any matter, he could have provided alternative evidence as to the difficulty of the terrain, in the form, for example, of photographs of the scene or testimony by witnesses familiar with the topography.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

His sole claim on appeal is that the district court committed prejudicial error when it instructed the jury that its view of the robber's escape route was not evidence in the case. Although we acknowledge that a jury view may at times be treated as evidence, we find no reversible error and therefore affirm appellant's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Community Bank and Trust in Exeter, New Hampshire, was robbed shortly after 1 p.m. on June 23, 1998. Bank employees described the lone robber as a male with a goatee and \"Fu Manchu\" mustache who was wearing mirrored sunglasses and a blue hooded sweatshirt. He approached the center teller window, pulled a bag from under the sweatshirt, and said, \"This is no joke; give me your money.\" Two bank employees described the robber as having a significant limp. He \"left in a hurry\" and was seen running across the street, along railroad tracks, and then up a hill toward a bridge that passes over the tracks near Park Street (the \"Park Street bridge\"), where he apparently was picked up by a woman in a white car with Florida license plates. A teacher who lives near the Park Street bridge saw a man emerge from the footpath near the railroad tracks and described him as having a very distinct gait irregularity, or limp. The man was clutching a bag at the time. Police found a blue hooded sweatshirt on the footpath leading up to Park Street and a pair of shattered mirrored sunglasses on the street where the white vehicle had been parked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gray was arrested a week later and charged with bank robbery. The district court granted Gray's unopposed motion seeking to allow the jury to view the bank and the robber's escape route, but refused his requested instruction that the jury consider the view as evidence. Instead, the court advised the jurors that their view of the bank and surrounding area was not evidence, explaining that it was \"intended simply to provide you with points of reference or a context in which to consider the evidence in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel objected to the instruction, though recognizing that it was consistent with First Circuit case law. In Clemente v. Carnicon-Puerto Rico Management Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196018\"><a href=\"/opinion/196018/clemente-v-carnicon-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span> </a></span>(lst Cir. 1995), we stated that \"the rule in this circuit is that a view does not itself constitute or generate evidence,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196018\"><a href=\"/opinion/196018/clemente-v-carnicon-management/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 386, </a></span>reflecting the widely adopted position that a view is permitted in the discretion of the trial judge \"only to assist the trier of fact in understanding and evaluating the evidence\" introduced in court, see 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence &#167; 216, at 29 (5th ed. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gray argues that the language in Clemente was dictum, and therefore not binding, and that, in any event, it is illogical as well as incorrect by contemporary standards to exclude a view from consideration as evidence. He argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the view was integral to his defense and the court's instruction unfairly prejudiced him. He had attempted at trial to prove that he could not have been the robber because a work-related leg injury left him physically incapable of fleeing quickly along the uneven, hilly escape route that the robber had followed. He maintains that the court's instruction precluded him from relying on the jury's own experiences with the difficult terrain to support his doctor's testimony that he could not have covered the route as quickly as the robber.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the relevant law and commentary now leads us to conclude that it is unrealistic to exclude a view from the status of evidence in every circumstance. We do not go further in this opinion than to remove this blanket prohibition. But even if the court's instruction on the view was error, it must be deemed harmless because, as we shall explain, it foreclosed very little benefit from the view that a permissive instruction would have allowed, and because the testimonial evidence points so overwhelmingly to the appellant's guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. The Nature of the View</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our unconditional statement in Clemente that a jury view \"does not itself constitute or generate evidence\" may represent the majority position, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196018\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196018/clemente-v-carnicon-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">386</span> </a></span>&amp; n.3, the momentum appears to be headed in the opposite direction. Indeed, most of the usual commentators on matters of evidence either question the rationale for excluding views from evidentiary status, observe that that position has lost favor, or both. See McCormick on Evidence &#167; 216, at 29 (the \"preferable\" position is that a view is \"evidence like any other\"); 22 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 5176, at 141 (1978) (\"The notion that a view is not 'evidence' has been discredited by the writers, and explicitly rejected by one modern code.\") (citations omitted); 2 Joseph McLaughlin, ed., Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 403.07[4] (2d ed. 1999) (\"[T]he modern position is that the view does provide independent evidence.\"); 4 John Henry Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1168, at 391, 388 (1972) (referring to the \"unsound theory\" that a view \"does not involve the consideration of evidence by the jury\" and noting that \"it has in most jurisdictions been repudiated\"). Cf. John M. Maguire, Cases and Materials on Evidence 141 (1973) (noting that courts are divided on the question but not taking a position).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the invitation to look more closely than was necessary in Clemente, we have found no reason to disagree with the experts. Perhaps the most compelling and pragmatic observation is that the distinction between non-evidence that aids a jury's understanding and traditional, independent evidence is \"lost on a jury,\" see 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 403.07[4]. We agree that it is unlikely that jurors, confronted with testimonial evidence at odds with what they have seen, \"will apply the metaphysical distinction suggested and ignore the evidence of their own senses,\" McCormick on Evidence &#167; 216, at 29. The Tenth Circuit has expressed a similar thought:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that jurisdictions vary as to whether a view is treated as evidence or simply as an aid to help the trier of fact understand the evidence. However, we believe such a distinction is only semantic, because any kind of presentation to the jury or the judge to help the fact finder determine what the truth is and assimilate and understand the evidence is itself evidence.

See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196018\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Clemente,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196018/clemente-v-carnicon-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that, by recognizing that the information obtained through a view may constitute independent evidence at trial, we do not diminish the trial court's inherent power to decide whether to allow a view at all. Determining if a view is appropriate in a particular situation remains a matter committed to the trial court's informed discretion. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196018\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Clemente,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196018/clemente-v-carnicon-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the fact that we now regard a view to be within the category of admissible evidence not only endows a trial court with the same discretion to control its admission that the court has in dealing with all evidentiary matters, but also may in the future require special techniques and practices as experience indicates. This opinion does not purport to resolve all issues that may arise stemming from the status of a view as evidence; it simply removes the concept of a view from the highly ambiguous state of being something to consider but not evidence. Our holding thus increases the range of admissible evidence but leaves intact the district court's authority to refuse a view in particular cases, or to exclude a view, or portions of it, from evidence when an on-the-scene observation does not transpire as the court had anticipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. The View in this Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court in this case excluded the view from evidence without considering whether it satisfied the standard requirements of admissibility, its decision does not require reversal of appellant's conviction, because any error unquestionably was harmless. See United States v. Crochiere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197656\"><a href=\"/opinion/197656/united-states-v-crochiere/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span>, 236 (lst Cir. 1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As we explain below, Gray was able to rely on other evidence to attempt to show his inability to traverse the difficult terrain of the robber's getaway path and, though the view was not treated as evidence, the jurors' exposure to the scene presumably influenced their evaluation of what they saw and heard in the courtroom. In addition, considerable evidence pointed to appellant as the bank robber.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Other evidence of the terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced photographs of the railroad tracks and footpath area that had been seen by the jury as part of the view. Although the court's instruction limited defendant's formal use of the jurors' direct exposure to the scene, their first-hand experiences obviously informed their examination of the photographs. Inreality, the district court's directive that the jury could use the view as a \"context\" for considering other evidence provided appellant with nearly all he could have expected from using the view as direct evidence. The jurors essentially were encouraged to bring to mind what they had seen when reviewing evidence, including the photographs, relating to the difficulty of the terrain. As we acknowledged earlier in concluding that a view may constitute evidence, the distinction between context and evidence is likely to be lost on the jury in the ordinary case. See supra at 549-50. This case seems well within that norm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's assertion that the jurors' observations at the scene were not captured equivalently by the photographs and other trial evidence, while perhaps true, thus misses the point. Indeed, defense counsel made multiple references to the view in guiding the jury's recollection of the evidence, noting at one point that the robber ran down the left side of the railroad right-of-way and that, \"[a]s you know from the view, that's the rougher side.\" At another point, presumably seeking to discount the significance of appellant's leg injury, counsel stated that the jury could find, \"based on your view of the path,\" that the robber might have been seen limping because he twisted his ankle along the way. The degree by which treatment of the view as evidence rather than context would have strengthened appellant's case is thus minimal, particularly in light of the substantial evidence of his guilt, to which we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Robbery evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence that appellant committed the bank robbery included the testimony of eight witnesses who identified him in a bank surveillance photograph, including his mother-in-law and brother-in-law, the latter of whom called police to report that the robber was Gray after seeing a televised picture of the suspect. Three longtime friends also were among those who identified him in the surveillance photograph, and a bank employee, Sue Palmer, testified that the robber was the same man with whom she had spoken in the bank on June 2, 1998. Gray admitted in his testimony that he was in the bank on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstantial evidence included the blue hooded sweatshirt found on the footpath near the railroad tracks, which Gray's brother-in-law identified as resembling one belonging to Gray. As noted earlier, witnesses reported that the robber had worn such a garment. An FBI hair and fiber expert testified that hairs found on the sweatshirt were consistent with samples taken from Gray. The getaway vehicle was identified as white with Florida license plates, and Gray drove a white Suzuki with Florida plates. Both Gray and the robber were described as having a distinctive Fu Manchu style mustache. Several witnesses said the robber had a pronounced limp, and Gray's treating physician acknowledged that Gray would exhibit a significant limp when running. The day after the robbery, Gray paid $310 cash for a room at a Boston hotel, even though he had been receiving welfare assistance to pay for a motel room in New Hampshire for the two weeks before the robbery. Finally, when Gray was arrested at a Manchester, New Hampshire hotel a week after the robbery, a newspaper clipping that named him as a suspect was found on the night stand between the two beds in his room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this considerable evidence linking appellant to the crime, and the negligible effect of the court's instruction that the view was not evidence, we conclude that any error in the treatment of the view must be deemed harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  We do not mean to suggest that recording the view is a condition of its treatment as evidence. Our point is only that the concern expressed by some about the problem of creating a record is not without solutions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  We hasten to add that we use the term \"error\" without any criticism intended of the district judge, who was properly following our language in Clemente.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  While we see no deficiency in the evidence, we add that since the Clemente case was on the books prior to this trial, defendant was fully on notice of the risk inherent in relying on the view alone as providing needed \"evidence\" in the case. If defendant believed the record was lacking in proof of any matter, he could have provided alternative evidence as to the difficulty of the terrain, in the form, for example, of photographs of the scene or testimony by witnesses familiar with the topography.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
