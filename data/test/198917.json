Egbert, with whom Mary Ellen Kelleher was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Ariane D. Vuono, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Donald K.\nStern, United States Attorney, and Shelbey Wright, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                        ____________________\n\n                             May 5, 2000\n\f____________________\n\n\n\n\n        -2-\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Herbert Derman, a lawyer, was charged\n\nwith eight counts stemming from a marijuana-growing operation on the\n\nproperty of his weekend home along the Massachusetts-New York border.\n\nA jury convicted Derman of two counts: conspiracy to manufacture,\n\ndistribute, and possess with intent to manufacture and distribute\n\nmarijuana, see 21 U.S.C. § 846, and criminal forfeiture, see 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 853. Derman was sentenced to a term of 121 months in prison; five\n\nyears of supervised release; a fine of $20,000; and forfeiture of his\n\nweekend home and property. Derman appeals his conviction and sentence\n\non four grounds: (1) claimed prosecutorial misconduct through a\n\npersistent appeal to class prejudice; (2) denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress evidence obtained during searches of his properties; (3)\n\nfailure of the court to offer and his trial counsel to request an\n\nopportunity for closing arguments on the forfeiture count; and (4)\n\nerrors regarding the timing of his appeal of the forfeiture sentence.\n\nThis last issue involves an important point of criminal procedure: we\n\ndecide when an order of forfeiture, entered after the 1996 amendments\n\nto Rule 32, becomes final, thereby triggering the time for appeal. We\n\naffirm the judgment and sentence.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Herbert Derman owned property, consisting of two parcels,\n\nthat straddled the Massachusetts-New York border. Derman, together\n\nwith his wife, Barbara Derman, had a weekend home on the New York side,\n\nin the town of Hillsdale. In 1983, Derman leased a portion of the\n\nproperty on the Massachusetts side, in the towns of North Egremont and\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fAlford, to Marcel Rosenzweig for the purpose of erecting a greenhouse.\n\nRosenzweig erected the greenhouse in the spring of 1984. Above ground\n\nthe new structure appeared to be a commercial greenhouse, below ground\n\nthe space was designed for the greenhouse's true purpose: growing\n\nmarijuana. Marijuana was grown in the underground location until\n\nSeptember 1991 when Richard Haber, an indicted co-conspirator, was\n\narrested at the site for possession of a small amount of marijuana.\n\nThough the underground operation was not discovered at this time, as a\n\nprecautionary measure, the operation was moved to Rosenzweig's property\n\nin Sandisfield, Massachusetts, where it continued until it was exposed\n\non August 17, 1995.\n\n          In December 1995, agents obtained and executed search\n\nwarrants on Derman's New York City apartment, his New York City law\n\noffice, his Hillsdale residence, his Massachusetts property, and his\n\nVail, Colorado home. Eventually, Derman and six others, including\n\nRosenzweig and Haber, were charged with various federal crimes relating\n\nto the marijuana-growing operation.1\n\n          In contrast to his indicted co-conspirators, who pled guilty\n\n\n     1     In a superseding indictment dated October 1, 1996, a grand\njury charged Derman with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and\npossess with intent to manufacture and distribute marijuana, see 21\nU.S.C. § 846 (count one); manufacture and possession of marijuana with\nintent to distribute, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (count two); conspiracy\nto commit money laundering, see 18 U.S.C. § 371 (count five); money\nlaundering and aiding and abetting, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 2,\n1956(a)(1)(A)(i), 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) (counts six, eight, ten, and\ntwelve); and criminal forfeiture, see 21 U.S.C. § 853 (count thirteen).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fin accordance with plea agreements,2 Derman decided to stand trial. His\n\nprincipal defense was that he had no knowledge of the marijuana-growing\n\noperation on his property. Derman's motion to suppress the evidence\n\nseized during the searches of his properties was denied on July 23,\n\n1998. See United States v. Derman, 23 F. Supp. 2d 95, 98 (D. Mass.\n\n1998). On July 29, 1998, a jury returned guilty verdicts on counts one\n\nand thirteen and not guilty verdicts on the remaining counts. On the\n\ngovernment's motion, the court, after issuing three stays to allow\n\nDerman time to file a brief, entered a preliminary order of forfeiture\n\non November 6, 1998. On December 15, 1998, Derman filed a motion for\n\nleave to file a late notice of appeal of the preliminary forfeiture\n\norder. The court denied this motion on January 4, 1999. Two days\n\nlater, Derman filed another motion, which the court construed as a\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the motion for leave to file a late\n\nnotice of appeal. On March 5, 1999, Derman was sentenced and on March\n\n22, 1999, the court denied Derman's motion for reconsideration. He now\n\nappeals.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           Derman's appeal concentrates on the charge of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct through a persistent appeal to class prejudice.         His\n\naccusation focuses not only on statements by the prosecutor, the usual\n\nsubject of misconduct allegations, but also on the government's trial\n\n     2     Save Rosenzweig, who died of cancer prior to trial.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fstrategy, which, Derman says, combined inappropriate prosecutorial\n\nstatements with the introduction of class-biased evidence. Derman\n\npoints, in particular, to nine instances during the trial:\n\n          1. the admission into evidence of a photograph of Barbara\n          Derman in a ski outfit with mountains in the background and\n          a witness's identification of Mrs. Derman in the photograph;\n\n          2. the questioning of Derman's secretary about \"Derman's\n          life-style back in the early 1970s when [she] began to work\n          for him;\"\n\n          3. the questioning of another secretary about Derman's\n          property, possessions, and vacations;\n\n          4. the admission into evidence of a part of a videotape of\n          Derman's Hillsdale home, which had been searched;\n\n          5. the admission into evidence of certain photographs from\n          a photo album, as well as the cover page to the album, which\n          was labeled \"Special Memories\" and which identified the\n          locations photographed in the album, including some other\n          than the locations in the admitted photographs;\n\n          6. the testimony of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent\n          that the photo album contained photographs depicting all of\n          the locations named in the \"Special Memories\" list;\n\n          7. the cross-examination of Barbara Derman regarding the\n          locations identified in the \"Special Memories\" list;\n\n          8. the introduction into evidence of receipts from Cartier\n          jewelers and another jeweler and the questioning of Barbara\n          Derman regarding these items;\n\n          9. the references in the prosecutor's closing argument and\n          rebuttal to vacations and jewelry and the statement that \"if\n          there is one thing that this case has shown[, it] is that\n          the Dermans needed and wanted to get more money.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fAt trial, Derman objected to items 1,3 2, 3,4 and 8 on various grounds\n\nand to items 4 and 5 on the basis of class bias. At trial, Derman did\n\nnot make the allegation he now makes that the prosecution engaged in a\n\ncourse of conduct at trial that was based on class prejudice.\n\n          The government contends that the prosecutor's comments during\n\nthe trial \"focused directly on Derman's claim . . . that he had no\n\nmotive, financial or otherwise, to engage in a drug conspiracy.\"\n\nFurther, it says that \"[e]vidence of Derman's lifestyle was specially\n\nrelevant . . . to show how he used the proceeds.\" The government also\n\ncontended at oral argument that Derman's attorney opened the door to\n\nthis line of inquiry when he asked rhetorically in his opening\n\nargument, \"where is the money?\"\n\n          Courts have found prosecutorial misconduct for introducing\n\nclass bias when prosecutors have engaged in actions that might inflame\n\nthe passions of the jury to such an extent as to call into doubt the\n\nfairness of the trial. The Second Circuit, in United States v. Stahl,\n\n616 F.2d 30 (2d Cir. 1980), reversed a judgment of conviction in a jury\n\ntrial where the record indicated that the prosecutor \"intend[ed] to\n\narouse prejudice against the defendant because of his wealth and\n\n\n\n     3    Derman objected to the number of photographs the government\nsought to introduce; he agreed to the admission of the one photo of\nMrs. Derman.\n     4    Derman objected to the characterization of the neighborhood\nof his New York City apartment as the \"Upper East Side.\"\n\n                                 -7-\n\fengaged in calculated and persistent efforts to arouse such prejudice\n\nthroughout the trial . . . [and] made several statements . . . that\n\nwere not supported by the evidence and may, in some instances, have\n\nbeen intentionally misleading.\" Id. at 32. Similarly, the Sixth\n\nCircuit, in Sizemore v. Fletcher, 921 F.2d 667 (6th Cir. 1990), upheld\n\nthe issuance of a writ of habeas corpus in a case where the prosecutor\n\n\"made repeated and deliberate statements clearly designed to inflame\n\nthe jury and prejudice the rights of the accused, and the court [did]\n\nnot offer[] appropriate admonishments to the jury.\" Id. at 670; see\n\nalso Read v. United States, 42 F.2d 636, 645 (8th Cir. 1930) (reversing\n\nguilty verdict in misappropriation of funds case). As this court\n\nstated in United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d 318 (1st Cir. 1986),\n\n\"[a]rgument, especially the government's, should not degenerate into an\n\nappeal to prejudice.\"     Id. at 323.\n\n          That said, the line between statements that are \"appeals to\n\nclass prejudice [that] are highly improper and cannot be condoned\" and\n\nstatements regarding class that are \"relevant to the issues at hand\" is\n\nnot easily drawn. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S.\n\n150, 239 (1940). It is especially difficult to draw when an accused's\n\nmotivation is at issue, and when, as here, the alleged motivation is\n\nfinancial. Derman says that the government crossed the line and that\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fhis conviction should be reversed and his sentence vacated.5\n\n           We have no need to worry about the remedy because there was\n\nno misconduct. The statements by the prosecutor, during the trial and\n\nduring closing arguments, went to the motive for the alleged crimes and\n\ndid not impermissibly stray into class bias. Derman's motive was not\n\nonly essential to the government's case, but also crucial to the\n\ndefense, as is evidenced by defense counsel's question, in his opening\n\nargument, \"where is the money?,\" and by his statement, in his closing,\n\n\"There is no money, they can't find any money.\"\n\n          Additionally, the district court judge was sensitive to the\n\npotential prejudicial effect of the evidence admitted.6 With this in\n\nmind, he limited the introduction of the number of photographs of\n\nBarbara Derman, he restricted the extent to which the photo album could\n\n\n\n     5     If we were to find misconduct, the remedy of a new trial\nwould not necessarily be in order. \"The determination of whether\nprosecutorial misconduct has so poisoned the well that a new trial is\nrequired involves the weighing of several factors: (1) the severity of\nthe misconduct; (2) the context in which it occurred; (3) whether the\njudge gave any curative instructions and the likely effect of such\ninstructions; and (4) the strength of the evidence against the\ndefendant.\" United States v. Rodríguez-De Jesús, 202 F.3d 482, 485\n(1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see\nalso United States v. Canas, 595 F.2d 73, 77-78 (1st Cir. 1979). In\nmaking this determination, we would \"take a balanced view of the\nevidence in the record.\" Rodríguez-De Jesús, 202 F.3d at 485.\n     6     It might seem curious that item 1, a photograph of a woman\nin a ski outfit and sunglasses on a ski slope, was used to identify\nBarbara Derman. But defense counsel did not object to the photograph,\nmuch less object on the ground that the photograph would evoke class\nbias.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fbe used, and he curtailed the use of the videotape. Further, he made\n\nan offer to give a limiting instruction on some of the admitted\n\nevidence, an offer which the defense did not accept.\n\n            Finally, there is no indication, looking at the totality of\n\nthe evidence admitted and the statements made by the prosecutor, that\n\nthere was a trial strategy or course of conduct that, intentionally or\n\nunintentionally, would lead to the unlawful enkindling of class bias in\n\nthe jury.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            Derman also contests the denial of his motion to suppress.\n\nSee Derman, 23 F. Supp. 2d at 102. He specifies three errors: (1) the\n\nwarrants were not sufficiently particular; (2) the scope of the search\n\nat the law firm exceeded the authority of the warrant; and (3) the\n\nwarrant was not provided to Derman's agent at his law office when\n\nrequested.7\n\n            First, Derman alleges that the search warrants were\n\ninsufficiently particular. \"[T]here is no guidance whatsoever in the\n\nwarrant[s],\" he says, \"to assist the executing officers in their\n\ndetermination of what items are authorized to be seized.\" He cites to\n\nfour of the warrants' descriptions of items to be seized:\n\n            \"5. All unprivileged documents in client files\"\n\n     7    Derman does not challenge on appeal the probable cause\ndetermination underlying the warrants, as he did before the district\ncourt. See Derman, 23 F. Supp. 2d at 99.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f          relating to certain individuals and companies;\n\n          \"6. All documents relating to any transaction\n          between [the various alleged co-conspirators]\n          identified in the . . . affidavit . . . including\n          canceled checks, cashier's checks, money orders,\n          invoices, contracts, agreements, correspondence,\n          memoranda and photographs;\"\n\n          \"9. Letters and other documents reflecting\n          communications between\" Derman and others \"and\n          their criminal associates identified in the . . .\n          affidavit;\" and\n\n          \"11. Address and phone books reflecting the names\n          and addresses of associates identified in the\n          . . . affidavit.\"\n\nDerman asserts that \"[t]he descriptions offer no assistance to the\n\nexecuting officers as to how to determine what items will fall within\n\nthose categories.\" He finds especially problematic the instruction\n\nregarding privileged information.\n\n          The Fourth Amendment requires that \"no Warrants shall issue,\n\nbut upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\n\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or\n\nthings to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. We have used a two-\n\npronged test to determine whether \"the goods to be described [can] not\n\nbe precisely described . . . : first, the degree to which the evidence\n\npresented to the magistrate establishes reason to believe that a large\n\ncollection of similar contraband is present on the premises to be\n\nsearched, and, second, the extent to which, in view of the\n\npossibilities, the warrant distinguishes, or provides the executing\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fagents with criteria for distinguishing, the [sought-after evidence]\n\nfrom the rest of an individual's possessions.\"       United States v.\n\nFuccillo, 808 F.2d 173, 176 (1st Cir. 1987) (first set of alterations\n\nin original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also\n\nUnited States v. Abrams, 615 F.2d 541, 544-46 (1st Cir. 1980); Montilla\n\nRecords, Inc. v. Morales, 575 F.2d 324, 325 (1st Cir. 1978). Derman\n\ncontends that the warrants issued in this case did not satisfy\n\nFuccillo's second prong.\n\n          The particularity of the warrant and the breadth of the\n\nsearch (which we will discuss below) are matters that should be\n\nconsidered with special care in the context of a law office because of\n\nthe pervasiveness there of privileged items. See Klitzman, Klitzman &\n\nGallagher v. Krut, 744 F.2d 955, 959 (3d Cir. 1984); People v. Hearty,\n\n644 P.2d 302, 313 (Colo. 1982) (en banc); see also Andresen v.\n\nMaryland, 427 U.S. 463, 466-69, 478-82 (1976) (allowing the search of\n\na law office when the lawyer was a target of the investigation.); Law\n\nOffices of Bernard D. Morley, P.C. v. MacFarlane, 647 P.2d 1215, 1222-\n\n23 (Colo. 1982) (en banc) (same); cf. Hearty, 644 P.2d at 313 (applying\n\nrule where the attorney is not a subject of the investigation). But\n\ncf. O'Connor v. Johnson, 287 N.W.2d 400, 402, 405 (Minn. 1979)\n\n(instituting a rule against searches by warrant of law offices when the\n\nattorney is not a subject of an investigation).\n\n          In this case, the warrants provided sufficient criteria in\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fthe list of \"Items to be Seized\" to distinguish the evidence sought\n\nfrom other materials, including privileged materials. Further, a\n\nmemorandum directed to the agents, investigators, and attorneys\n\nparticipating in the search of the law office emphasized that \"[c]lient\n\nfiles for persons or entities other than [Rosenzweig, Haber, and a\n\nrealty company allegedly connected with the marijuana-growing\n\noperation] cannot be opened or seized pursuant to the warrant.\"\n\nAdditionally, a \"privilege team\" composed of attorneys, separate from\n\nthe team of searching agents, was on hand \"to answer any legal\n\nquestions which may arise during the search\" and, following the\n\ngathering of evidence, to \"conduct a thorough review of all items\n\nseized . . . and determine whether any of the seized items contain any\n\nprivileged information.\"\n\n          Second, Derman asserts that the actual search of the law\n\noffice was overbroad in scope. The district court found that the\n\nagents made a \"cursory\" review of all the files and dictation tapes.\n\nSee Derman, 23 F. Supp. 2d at 102. Derman points to the affidavit of\n\nAghavni Ellian, a secretary in Derman's law office, which states that\n\nthe agents looked through \"each and every\" file, looked through\n\ndocuments, and took notes \"and/or took the file[s] into Herbert\n\nDerman's office where other agents were stationed.\" We review the\n\ndistrict court's findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard.\n\nSee United States v. Ferreras, 192 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 1999), cert.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fdenied, 120 S. Ct. 969 (2000). The district court's finding that the\n\nagents made a cursory review of the files is not clearly erroneous.\n\nCf. Andresen, 427 U.S. at 482 n.11 (\"In searches for papers, . . . some\n\ninnocuous documents will be examined, at least cursorily, in order to\n\ndetermine whether they are, in fact, among those papers authorized to\n\nbe seized.\").\n\n          Third, Derman claims that the officers' failure to give\n\nEllian a copy of the search warrant violates Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 41(d) and justifies suppression.8 See United States v. Gantt,\n\n194 F.3d 987, 1000-05 (9th Cir. 1999).      But cf. United States v.\n\nBonner, 808 F.2d 864, 868-69 (1st Cir. 1986). This argument has been\n\nwaived. Ellian's affidavit asserting that she was never served with\n\nthe warrant was before the district court judge for the purpose of\n\nsupporting Derman's claim that the search exceeded its scope, not for\n\na Rule 41(d) claim. The trial court did not consider Rule 41(d) in its\n\ndecision, and neither do we.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Derman raises several issues pertaining the forfeiture of the\n\nproperty, some of which pose the question of whether there is appellate\n\n\n     8    Rule 41(d) states in pertinent part:\n\n     The officer taking property under the warrant shall give to the\n     person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken a\n     copy of the warrant . . . .\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 41(d).\n\n                                 -14-\n\fjurisdiction.    We start with the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n          Before Derman was sentenced, but after the guilty verdict,\n\nthe court entered, on the government's unopposed motion, a \"preliminary\n\norder of forfeiture.\" Derman sought and was denied leave to file a\n\nlate notice of appeal, then asked for and was denied reconsideration.\n\nApparently, the district court took the view that the date of entry of\n\nthe pre-sentence preliminary order of forfeiture triggered the running\n\nof the time to appeal. Defense counsel says that that was unlikely,\n\nbut, in an abundance of caution, he tried to appeal from the order.\n\nThereafter, on March 5 (amended on March 9), 1999, the district court\n\nimposed judgment and sentence, including an order that the property be\n\nforfeited. Derman promptly appealed the judgment, including the final\n\norder of forfeiture.\n\n          The issue of whether the district court abused its discretion\n\nin not permitting Derman an extension to file a notice from the\n\npreliminary order of forfeiture has been briefed.       It raises the\n\nquestion of which order -- the preliminary pre-sentence order or the\n\nfinal judgment order -- is the final order for purposes of appeal.\n\n          As amended in 1996, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n32(d)(2) states:\n\n          If a verdict contains a finding that property is subject to\n          a criminal forfeiture, . . . the court may enter a\n          preliminary order of forfeiture after providing notice to\n          the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on\n          the timing and form of the order. The order of forfeiture\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f          shall authorize the Attorney General to seize the property\n          subject to forfeiture, to conduct any discovery that the\n          court considers proper to help identify, locate, or dispose\n          of the property, and to begin proceedings consistent with\n          any statutory requirements pertaining to ancillary hearings\n          and the rights of third parties. At sentencing, a final\n          order of forfeiture shall be made part of the sentence and\n          included in the judgment. The court may include in the\n          final order such conditions as may be reasonably necessary\n          to preserve the value of the property pending any appeal.\n\nThus, the forfeiture order, as the government now concedes, is a part\n\nof the sentence, see Libretti v. United States, 516 U.S. 29, 38-39\n\n(1995), and becomes final for purposes of appeal when the court issues\n\nits judgment.9   See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b).\n\n     9     The case law regarding this issue can be confusing because\nof the varying usages of the term \"preliminary order of forfeiture.\"\nBefore the 1996 amendments, a court could issue a preliminary order of\nforfeiture at (or following) sentencing. The pre-1996 preliminary\norder was preliminary, however, only in the sense that the government's\ninterest was not finalized until the court could evaluate ancillary\nthird-party claims to the forfeited property; the preliminary order was\nfinal, and thus appealable, as to the defendant. See United States v.\nPelullo, 178 F.3d 196, 202 (3d Cir. 1999); United States v. Bennett,\n147 F.3d 912, 914 (9th Cir. 1998); United States v. Christunas, 126\nF.3d 765, 767-68 (6th Cir. 1997); cf. United States v. Libretti, 38\nF.3d 523, 527 (10th Cir. 1994), aff'd, 516 U.S. 29 (1995). If, before\n1996, the government was concerned that a delay between verdict and\nsentencing might hamper recovery of the forfeited property, it could\nrequest a restraining order to maintain the status quo until\nsentencing. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32, advisory committee's note to\n32(d)(2), 1996 amendments; United States v. Alexander, 772 F. Supp.\n440, 442 (D. Minn. 1990). To solve this problem, the 1996 amendments\nallowed a court to issue a \"preliminary order\" before sentencing.\nBecause this preliminary order is issued before sentencing, it is\ndifferent from the pre-1996 preliminary order: it is not final as to\nthe defendant and thus not appealable. Cf. United States v. Coon, 187\nF.3d 888, 901 (8th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1417 (2000).\nThe post-1996 preliminary order acts much like the pre-1996 restraining\norder. After the 1996 amendments, the forfeiture order entered at\nsentencing is called \"final order of forfeiture,\" and it is this order\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          As a result, Derman has properly appealed from the final\n\norder of forfeiture contained in his sentence. Derman raises two sorts\n\nof objections to the forfeiture order itself. He attacks the order on\n\ngrounds of \"sufficiency, prosecutorial misconduct and Constitutional\n\nerrors.\"10 Derman, however, did not preserve this issue for appeal.\n\nWe would normally review his claim for plain error. See United States\n\nv. Badeaux, 42 F.3d 245, 246 (5th Cir. 1994). But Derman's argument on\n\nthis point, in his brief, is perfunctory and unaccompanied by developed\n\nargumentation and we consider it waived. See Romero v. Colegio de\n\nAbogados de Puerto Rico, 204 F.3d 291, 296 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Derman also says he should have been given an opportunity to\n\nargue the forfeiture issue to the jury before it decided the forfeiture\n\ncount. After the jury found Derman guilty on count one and not guilty\n\non the other substantive counts, the judge instructed the jurors on the\n\nforfeiture count. The trial judge did not offer, nor did counsel\n\nrequest, additional argument. Derman now claims that it was error for\n\nthe judge not to have offered counsel the opportunity to give closing\n\n\n\nthat is appealable. Thus, regardless of the name given to the order of\nforfeiture (preliminary or final), both before and after the 1996\namendments the key moment for determining finality for the purpose of\nappeal is sentencing. Of course, if the forfeiture order is entered\nafter sentencing, the time for appeal runs from the date of the post-\nsentencing order.\n     10   In his brief, Derman characterizes this as an error of the\njury verdict. As the discussion in the text suggests, the error\ncomplained of is more properly described as an error in the sentence.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fargument on this count. Derman also claims that the failure of his\n\ntrial counsel to request further argument on the forfeiture count\n\nconstitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel, Derman claims,\n\ncould have informed the jury of \"the fact that there are two separate\n\nparcels [that make up Derman's property, i.e., a parcel in New York and\n\na parcel in Massachusetts], and . . . [argued] that forfeiture of the\n\nentire two parcels was disproportionate to the defendant's crime.\"\n\n          Since Derman's counsel did not object to the lack of closing\n\nargument on forfeiture, we review for plain error. See United States\n\nv. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 551\n\n(1999). Thus, \"before an appellate court can correct an error not\n\nraised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, . . . (3)\n\nthat affects substantial rights\" and (4) that \"seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nJohnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997) (alterations in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          The district court did not commit plain error by not offering\n\ncounsel the opportunity to present arguments to the jury on the\n\nforfeiture count. While it may be error for a judge to deny counsel's\n\nrequest for argument on forfeiture, Derman's counsel made no such\n\nrequest. Cf. Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862 (1975) (\"In a\n\ncriminal trial, which is in the end basically a factfinding process, no\n\naspect of such advocacy could be more important than the opportunity\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\ffinally to marshal the evidence for each side before submission of the\n\ncase to judgment.\"); United States v. Feldman, 853 F.2d 648, 662 (9th\n\nCir. 1988) (holding that \"trial courts should bifurcate forfeiture\n\nproceedings from ascertainment of guilt, requiring separate jury\n\ndeliberations and allowing argument of counsel\"). Even if we thought\n\nthat the trial judge should have offered counsel additional argument on\n\nthe forfeiture count, we would not be convinced that this failure would\n\nsatisfy the third and fourth tests of the plain error doctrine. There\n\nwas sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's finding\n\nand, as explained below, it is unclear what argument Derman's counsel\n\ncould have made that would have altered the forfeiture verdict.\n\n          Derman's ineffective assistance of counsel argument also\n\nfails. Usually, we will \"not entertain an ineffective-assistance-of-\n\ncounsel claim on direct appeal unless the record is sufficiently\n\ndeveloped.\" United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1225\n\n(1st Cir. 1995). The record is sufficiently developed here. See United\n\nStates v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          In Natanel, we found that \"trial counsel's decision to waive\n\na separate closing statement [on a count that was to be sent to the\n\njury separately] strikes us as a strategy choice . . . well within the\n\nrange of professionally reasonable judgments.\" Id. at 310 (alteration\n\nin original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Counsel's decision in\n\nNatanel was deliberate. See id. at 309. In this case, however, it is\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\ftoo much to assume, as the government asks us to, that Derman's counsel\n\npurposefully waived argument on the forfeiture count. There is little\n\nreason to think that this was true.\n\n          In Strickland v. Washington, the Supreme Court found that\n\n\"[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be\n\nwhether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the\n\nadversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having\n\nproduced a just result.\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686\n\n(1984). A conviction will be overturned if (1) \"counsel's performance\n\nwas deficient,\" that is, \"counsel made errors so serious that counsel\n\nwas not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the\n\nSixth Amendment;\" and (2) \"the deficient performance prejudiced the\n\ndefense,\" that is, \"counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the\n\ndefendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\" Id. at\n\n687.\n\n          Even assuming trial counsel's performance was deficient,\n\nwhich we doubt, Derman has not demonstrated prejudice. The two\n\narguments that Derman now asserts his erstwhile counsel should have\n\nmade to the jury would have been irrelevant to its decision. The jury\n\nwas only to answer the judge's question: \"Was the property owned by\n\ndefendant, Herbert Derman, specifically the real property, together\n\nwith all improvements thereon, at 83 Whites Hill Road, Hillsdale, New\n\nYork, North Egremont and Alford, Massachusetts, . . . used or intended\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fto be used in any manner or part to commit or to facilitate commission\n\nof violations of the narcotics laws?\" The questions of whether all of\n\nDerman's property or just some parcels should have been subject to\n\nforfeiture, see United States v. Bieri, 21 F.3d 819, 824 (8th Cir.\n\n1994) (holding that \"tracts of real property subject to forfeiture\n\nunder section 853 are defined by the instruments and documents that\n\ncreated the defendant's interest in the property\") (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); United States v. Smith, 966 F.2d 1045, 1053-54 (6th\n\nCir. 1992) (same); United States v. Reynolds, 856 F.2d 675, 677 (4th\n\nCir. 1988) (same for civil forfeiture), and whether the forfeiture was\n\nexcessive, see Bieri, 21 F.3d at 824, were for the judge, not for the\n\njury, to answer.\n\n                                 V.\n\n          For these reasons, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f",

A jury convicted Derman of two  counts: conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with  intent to manufacture and distribute marijuana, see 21 U.S.C.  &#167; 846, and criminal forfeiture, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  Derman was  sentenced to a term of 121 months in prison; five years of  supervised release; a fine of $20,000; and forfeiture of his  weekend home and property.  Derman appeals his conviction and  sentence on four grounds: (1) claimed prosecutorial misconduct  through a persistent appeal to class prejudice; (2) denial of his  motion to suppress evidence obtained during searches of his  properties; (3) failure of the court to offer and his trial counsel  to request an opportunity for closing arguments on the forfeiture  count; and (4) errors regarding the timing of his appeal of the  forfeiture sentence.  This last issue involves an important point  of criminal procedure: we decide when an order of forfeiture,  entered after the 1996 amendments to Rule 32, becomes final,  thereby triggering the time for appeal.  We affirm the judgment and  sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Herbert Derman owned property, consisting of two parcels,  that straddled the Massachusetts-New York border.  Derman, together  with his wife, Barbara Derman, had a weekend home on the New York  side, in the town of Hillsdale.  In 1983, Derman leased a portion  of the property on the Massachusetts side, in the towns of North  Egremont and Alford, to Marcel Rosenzweig for the purpose of  erecting a greenhouse.  Rosenzweig erected the greenhouse in the  spring of 1984.  Above ground the new structure appeared to be a  commercial greenhouse, below ground the space was designed for the  greenhouse's true purpose: growing marijuana.  Marijuana was grown  in the underground location until September 1991 when Richard  Haber, an indicted co-conspirator, was arrested at the site for  possession of a small amount of marijuana.  Though the underground  operation was not discovered at this time, as a precautionary  measure, the operation was moved to Rosenzweig's property in  Sandisfield, Massachusetts, where it continued until it was exposed  on August 17, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1995, agents obtained and executed search  warrants on Derman's New York City apartment, his New York City law  office, his Hillsdale residence, his Massachusetts property, and  his Vail, Colorado home.  Eventually, Derman and six others,  including Rosenzweig and Haber, were charged with various federal  crimes relating to the marijuana-growing operation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to his indicted co-conspirators, who pled  guilty in accordance with plea agreements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Derman decided to stand  trial.  His principal defense was that he had no knowledge of the  marijuana-growing operation on his property.  Derman's motion to  suppress the evidence seized during the searches of his properties  was denied on July 23, 1998.  See United States v. Derman, 23 F.  Supp. 2d 95, 98 (D. Mass. 1998).  On July 29, 1998, a jury returned  guilty verdicts on counts one and thirteen and not guilty verdicts  on the remaining counts.  On the government's motion, the court,  after issuing three stays to allow Derman time to file a brief,  entered a preliminary order of forfeiture on November 6, 1998.  On  December 15, 1998, Derman filed a motion for leave to file a late  notice of appeal of the preliminary forfeiture order.  The court  denied this motion on January 4, 1999.  Two days later, Derman  filed another motion, which the court construed as a motion for  reconsideration of the motion for leave to file a late notice of  appeal.  On March 5, 1999, Derman was sentenced and on March 22,  1999, the court denied Derman's motion for reconsideration.  He now  appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman's appeal concentrates on the charge of  prosecutorial misconduct through a persistent appeal to class  prejudice.  His accusation focuses not only on statements by the  prosecutor, the usual subject of misconduct allegations, but also  on the government's trial strategy, which, Derman says, combined  inappropriate prosecutorial statements with the introduction of  class-biased evidence.  Derman points, in particular, to nine  instances during the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. the admission into evidence of a photograph of Barbara  Derman in a ski outfit with mountains in the background  and a witness's identification of Mrs. Derman in the  photograph;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. the questioning of Derman's secretary about \"Derman's  life-style back in the early 1970s when [she] began to  work for him;\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. the questioning of another secretary about Derman's  property, possessions, and vacations;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. the admission into evidence of a part of a videotape  of Derman's Hillsdale home, which had been searched;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. the admission into evidence of certain photographs  from a photo album, as well as the cover page to the  album, which was labeled \"Special Memories\" and which  identified the locations photographed in the album,  including some other than the locations in the admitted  photographs;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. the testimony of a Drug Enforcement Administration  agent that the photo album contained photographs  depicting all of the locations named in the \"Special  Memories\" list;  7. the cross-examination of Barbara Derman regarding the  locations identified in the \"Special Memories\" list;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. the introduction into evidence of receipts from  Cartier jewelers and another jeweler and the questioning  of Barbara Derman regarding these items;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. the references in the prosecutor's closing argument  and rebuttal to vacations and jewelry and the statement  that \"if there is one thing that this case has shown[,  it] is that the Dermans needed and wanted to get more  money.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Derman objected to items 1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 2, 3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and 8 on various  grounds and to items 4 and 5 on the basis of class bias.  At trial,  Derman did not make the allegation he now makes that the  prosecution engaged in a course of conduct at trial that was based  on class prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the prosecutor's comments  during the trial \"focused directly on Derman's claim . . . that he  had no motive, financial or otherwise, to engage in a drug  conspiracy.\"  Further, it says that \"[e]vidence of Derman's  lifestyle was specially relevant . . . to show how he used the  proceeds.\"  The government also contended at oral argument that  Derman's attorney opened the door to this line of inquiry when he  asked rhetorically in his opening argument, \"where is the money?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have found prosecutorial misconduct for  introducing class bias when prosecutors have engaged in actions  that might inflame the passions of the jury to such an extent as to  call into doubt the fairness of the trial.  The Second Circuit, in United States v. Stahl, 616 F.2d 30 (2d Cir. 1980), reversed a  judgment of conviction in a jury trial where the record indicated  that the prosecutor \"intend[ed] to arouse prejudice against the  defendant because of his wealth and engaged in calculated and  persistent efforts to arouse such prejudice throughout the trial  . . . [and] made several statements . . . that were not supported  by the evidence and may, in some instances, have been intentionally  misleading.\"  Id. at 32.  Similarly, the Sixth Circuit, in Sizemore v. Fletcher, 921 F.2d 667 (6th Cir. 1990), upheld the issuance of  a writ of habeas corpus in a case where the prosecutor \"made  repeated and deliberate statements clearly designed to inflame the  jury and prejudice the rights of the accused, and the court [did]  not offer[] appropriate admonishments to the jury.\"  Id. at 670; see also Read v. United States, 42 F.2d 636, 645 (8th Cir. 1930)  (reversing guilty verdict in misappropriation of funds case).  As  this court stated in United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d 318 (1st  Cir. 1986), \"[a]rgument, especially the government's, should not  degenerate into an appeal to prejudice.\"  Id. at 323.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the line between statements that are \"appeals  to class prejudice [that] are highly improper and cannot be  condoned\" and statements regarding class that are \"relevant to the  issues at hand\" is not easily drawn.  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 239 (1940).  It is especially  difficult to draw when an accused's motivation is at issue, and  when, as here, the alleged motivation is financial.  Derman says  that the government crossed the line and that his conviction should  be reversed and his sentence vacated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no need to worry about the remedy because there  was no misconduct.  The statements by the prosecutor, during the  trial and during closing arguments, went to the motive for the  alleged crimes and did not impermissibly stray into class bias. Derman's motive was not only essential to the government's case,  but also crucial to the defense, as is evidenced by defense  counsel's question, in his opening argument, \"where is the money?,\"  and by his statement, in his closing, \"There is no money, they  can't find any money.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the district court judge was sensitive to  the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence admitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  With  this in mind, he limited the introduction of the number of  photographs of Barbara Derman, he restricted the extent to which  the photo album could be used, and he curtailed the use of the  videotape.  Further, he made an offer to give a limiting  instruction on some of the admitted evidence, an offer which the  defense did not accept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no indication, looking at the totality  of the evidence admitted and the statements made by the prosecutor,  that there was a trial strategy or course of conduct that,  intentionally or unintentionally, would lead to the unlawful  enkindling of class bias in the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman also contests the denial of his motion to  suppress.  See Derman, 23 F. Supp. 2d at 102.  He specifies three  errors: (1) the warrants were not sufficiently particular; (2) the  scope of the search at the law firm exceeded the authority of the  warrant; and (3) the warrant was not provided to Derman's agent at  his law office when requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Derman alleges that the search warrants were  insufficiently particular.  \"[T]here is no guidance whatsoever in  the warrant[s],\" he says, \"to assist the executing officers in  their determination of what items are authorized to be seized.\"  He  cites to four of the warrants' descriptions of items to be seized:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"5.

IV.  We have  used a two-pronged test to determine whether \"the goods to be  described [can] not be precisely described . . . : first, the  degree to which the evidence presented to the magistrate  establishes reason to believe that a large collection of similar  contraband is present on the premises to be searched, and, second,  the extent to which, in view of the possibilities, the warrant  distinguishes, or provides the executing agents with criteria for  distinguishing, the [sought-after evidence] from the rest of an  individual's possessions.\"  United States v. Fuccillo, 808 F.2d  173, 176 (1st Cir. 1987) (first set of alterations in original)  (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also United  States v. Abrams, 615 F.2d 541, 544-46 (1st Cir. 1980); Montilla  Records, Inc. v. Morales, 575 F.2d 324, 325 (1st Cir. 1978). Derman contends that the warrants issued in this case did not  satisfy Fuccillo's second prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The particularity of the warrant and the breadth of the  search (which we will discuss below) are matters that should be  considered with special care in the context of a law office because  of the pervasiveness there of privileged items.  See Klitzman,  Klitzman &amp; Gallagher v. Krut, 744 F.2d 955, 959 (3d Cir. 1984); People v. Hearty, 644 P.2d 302, 313 (Colo. 1982) (en banc); see  also Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 466-69, 478-82 (1976)  (allowing the search of a law office when the lawyer was a target  of the investigation.); Law Offices of Bernard D. Morley, P.C. v. MacFarlane, 647 P.2d 1215, 1222-23 (Colo. 1982) (en banc) (same); cf. Hearty, 644 P.2d at 313 (applying rule where the attorney is  not a subject of the investigation).  But cf. O'Connor v. Johnson,  287 N.W.2d 400, 402, 405 (Minn. 1979) (instituting a rule against  searches by warrant of law offices when the attorney is not a  subject of an investigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the warrants provided sufficient criteria  in the list of \"Items to be Seized\" to distinguish the evidence  sought from other materials, including privileged materials. Further, a memorandum directed to the agents, investigators, and  attorneys participating in the search of the law office emphasized  that \"[c]lient files for persons or entities other than  [Rosenzweig, Haber, and a realty company allegedly connected with  the marijuana-growing operation] cannot be opened or seized  pursuant to the warrant.\"  Additionally, a \"privilege team\"  composed of attorneys, separate from the team of searching agents,  was on hand \"to answer any legal questions which may arise during  the search\" and, following the gathering of evidence, to \"conduct  a thorough review of all items seized . . . and determine whether  any of the seized items contain any privileged information.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Derman asserts that the actual search of the law  office was overbroad in scope.  The district court found that the  agents made a \"cursory\" review of all the files and dictation  tapes.  See Derman, 23 F. Supp. 2d at 102.  Derman points to the  affidavit of Aghavni Ellian, a secretary in Derman's law office,  which states that the agents looked through \"each and every\" file,  looked through documents, and took notes \"and/or took the file[s]  into Herbert Derman's office where other agents were stationed.\" We review the district court's findings of fact under the clearly  erroneous standard.  See United States v. Ferreras, 192 F.3d 5, 9  (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 969 (2000).  The district  court's finding that the agents made a cursory review of the files  is not clearly erroneous.  Cf. Andresen, 427 U.S. at 482 n.11 (\"In  searches for papers, . . . some innocuous documents will be  examined, at least cursorily, in order to determine whether they  are, in fact, among those papers authorized to be seized.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Derman claims that the officers' failure to give  Ellian a copy of the search warrant violates Federal Rule of  Criminal Procedure 41(d) and justifies suppression.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> See United  States v. Gantt, 194 F.3d 987, 1000-05 (9th Cir. 1999).  But cf.United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 868-69 (1st Cir. 1986). This argument has been waived.  Ellian's affidavit asserting that  she was never served with the warrant was before the district court  judge for the purpose of supporting Derman's claim that the search  exceeded its scope, not for a Rule 41(d) claim.  The trial court  did not consider Rule 41(d) in its decision, and neither do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman raises several issues pertaining the forfeiture of  the property, some of which pose the question of whether there is  appellate jurisdiction.  We start with the issue of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Derman was sentenced, but after the guilty  verdict, the court entered, on the government's unopposed motion,  a \"preliminary order of forfeiture.\"  Derman sought and was denied  leave to file a late notice of appeal, then asked for and was  denied reconsideration.  Apparently, the district court took the  view that the date of entry of the pre-sentence preliminary order  of forfeiture triggered the running of the time to appeal.  Defense  counsel says that that was unlikely, but, in an abundance of  caution, he tried to appeal from the order.  Thereafter, on March  5 (amended on March 9), 1999, the district court imposed judgment  and sentence, including an order that the property be forfeited. Derman promptly appealed the judgment, including the final order of  forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether the district court abused its  discretion in not permitting Derman an extension to file a notice  from the preliminary order of forfeiture has been briefed.  It  raises the question of which order -- the preliminary pre-sentence  order or the final judgment order -- is the final order for  purposes of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As amended in 1996, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure  32(d)(2) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a verdict contains a finding that property is subject  to a criminal forfeiture, . . . the court may enter a  preliminary order of forfeiture after providing notice to  the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on  the timing and form of the order.  The order of  forfeiture shall authorize the Attorney General to seize  the property subject to forfeiture, to conduct any  discovery that the court considers proper to help  identify, locate, or dispose of the property, and to  begin proceedings consistent with any statutory  requirements pertaining to ancillary hearings and the  rights of third parties.  At sentencing, a final order of  forfeiture shall be made part of the sentence and  included in the judgment.  The court may include in the  final order such conditions as may be reasonably  necessary to preserve the value of the property pending  any appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the forfeiture order, as the government now concedes, is a  part of the sentence, see Libretti v. United States, 516 U.S. 29,  38-39 (1995), and becomes final for purposes of appeal when the  court issues its judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, Derman has properly appealed from the final  order of forfeiture contained in his sentence.  Derman raises two  sorts of objections to the forfeiture order itself.  He attacks the  order on grounds of \"sufficiency, prosecutorial misconduct and  Constitutional errors.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Derman, however, did not preserve this  issue for appeal.  We would normally review his claim for plain  error.  See United States v. Badeaux, 42 F.3d 245, 246 (5th Cir.  1994).  But Derman's argument on this point, in his brief, is  perfunctory and unaccompanied by developed argumentation and we  consider it waived. See Romero v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto  Rico, 204 F.3d 291, 296 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman also says he should have been given an opportunity  to argue the forfeiture issue to the jury before it decided the  forfeiture count.  After the jury found Derman guilty on count one  and not guilty on the other substantive counts, the judge  instructed the jurors on the forfeiture count.  The trial judge did  not offer, nor did counsel request, additional argument.  Derman  now claims that it was error for the judge not to have offered  counsel the opportunity to give closing argument on this count. Derman also claims that the failure of his trial counsel to request  further argument on the forfeiture count constitutes ineffective  assistance of counsel.  Counsel, Derman claims, could have informed  the jury of \"the fact that there are two separate parcels [that  make up Derman's property, i.e., a parcel in New York and a parcel  in Massachusetts], and . . . [argued] that forfeiture of the entire  two parcels was disproportionate to the defendant's crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Derman's counsel did not object to the lack of  closing argument on forfeiture, we review for plain error.  SeeUnited States v. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  120 S. Ct. 551 (1999).  Thus, \"before an appellate court can  correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2)  that is plain, . . . (3) that affects substantial rights\" and (4)  that \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public  reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Johnson v. United States, 520  U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997) (alterations in original) (internal  quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not commit plain error by not  offering counsel the opportunity to present arguments to the jury  on the forfeiture count.  While it may be error for a judge to deny  counsel's request for argument on forfeiture, Derman's counsel made  no such request.  Cf. Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862 (1975)  (\"In a criminal trial, which is in the end basically a factfinding  process, no aspect of such advocacy could be more important than  the opportunity finally to marshal the evidence for each side  before submission of the case to judgment.\"); United States v. Feldman, 853 F.2d 648, 662 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that \"trial  courts should bifurcate forfeiture proceedings from ascertainment  of guilt, requiring separate jury deliberations and allowing  argument of counsel\").  Even if we thought that the trial judge  should have offered counsel additional argument on the forfeiture  count, we would not be convinced that this failure would satisfy  the third and fourth tests of the plain error doctrine.  There was  sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's finding  and, as explained below, it is unclear what argument Derman's  counsel could have made that would have altered the forfeiture  verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman's ineffective assistance of counsel argument also  fails.  Usually, we will \"not entertain an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal unless the record is sufficiently  developed.\"  United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1225  (1st Cir. 1995).  The record is sufficiently developed here. SeeUnited States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Natanel, we found that \"trial counsel's decision to  waive a separate closing statement [on a count that was to be sent  to the jury separately] strikes us as a strategy choice . . . well  within the range of professionally reasonable judgments.\"  Id. at  310 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Counsel's decision in Natanel was deliberate.  See id. at 309.  In  this case, however, it is too much to assume, as the government  asks us to, that Derman's counsel purposefully waived argument on  the forfeiture count.  There is little reason to think that this  was true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Strickland v. Washington, the Supreme Court found that  \"[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be  whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of  the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as  having produced a just result.\"  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.  668, 686 (1984).  A conviction will be overturned if (1) \"counsel's  performance was deficient,\" that is, \"counsel made errors so  serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel'  guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment;\" and (2) \"the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,\" that is, \"counsel's  errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,  a trial whose result is reliable.\"  Id. at 687.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming trial counsel's performance was deficient,  which we doubt, Derman has not demonstrated prejudice. The two  arguments that Derman now asserts his erstwhile counsel should have  made to the jury would have been irrelevant to its decision.  The  jury was only to answer the judge's question: \"Was the property  owned by defendant, Herbert Derman, specifically the real property,  together with all improvements thereon, at 83 Whites Hill Road,  Hillsdale, New York, North Egremont and Alford, Massachusetts,  . . . used or intended to be used in any manner or part to commit  or to facilitate commission of violations of the narcotics laws?\"  The questions of whether all of Derman's property or just some  parcels should have been subject to forfeiture, see United States v. Bieri, 21 F.3d 819, 824 (8th Cir. 1994) (holding that \"tracts of  real property subject to forfeiture under section 853 are defined  by the instruments and documents that created the defendant's  interest in the property\") (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v.

The  pre-1996 preliminary order was preliminary, however, only in the  sense that the government's interest was not finalized until the  court could evaluate ancillary third-party claims to the forfeited  property; the preliminary order was final, and thus appealable, as  to the defendant.  See United States v. Pelullo, 178 F.3d 196, 202  (3d Cir. 1999); United States v. Bennett, 147 F.3d 912, 914 (9th  Cir. 1998); United States v. Christunas, 126 F.3d 765, 767-68 (6th  Cir. 1997); cf. United States v. Libretti, 38 F.3d 523, 527 (10th  Cir. 1994), aff'd, 516 U.S. 29 (1995).  If, before 1996, the  government was concerned that a delay between verdict and  sentencing might hamper recovery of the forfeited property, it  could request a restraining order to maintain the status quo until  sentencing.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32, advisory committee's note to  32(d)(2), 1996 amendments; United States v. Alexander, 772 F. Supp.  440, 442 (D. Minn. 1990).  To solve this problem, the 1996  amendments allowed a court to issue a \"preliminary order\" before  sentencing.  Because this preliminary order is issued before  sentencing, it is different from the pre-1996 preliminary order: it  is not final as to the defendant and thus not appealable.  Cf.United States v. Coon, 187 F.3d 888, 901 (8th Cir. 1999), cert.  denied, 120 S. Ct. 1417 (2000).  The post-1996 preliminary order  acts much like the pre-1996 restraining order.  After the 1996  amendments, the forfeiture order entered at sentencing is called  \"final order of forfeiture,\" and it is this order that is  appealable.  Thus, regardless of the name given to the order of  forfeiture (preliminary or final), both before and after the 1996  amendments the key moment for determining finality for the purpose  of appeal is sentencing.  Of course, if the forfeiture order is  entered after sentencing, the time for appeal runs from the date of  the post-sentencing order.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  In his brief, Derman characterizes this as an error of  the jury verdict.

A jury convicted Derman of two  counts: conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with  intent to manufacture and distribute marijuana, see 21 U.S.C.  &#167; 846, and criminal forfeiture, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  Derman was  sentenced to a term of 121 months in prison; five years of  supervised release; a fine of $20,000; and forfeiture of his  weekend home and property.  Derman appeals his conviction and  sentence on four grounds: (1) claimed prosecutorial misconduct  through a persistent appeal to class prejudice; (2) denial of his  motion to suppress evidence obtained during searches of his  properties; (3) failure of the court to offer and his trial counsel  to request an opportunity for closing arguments on the forfeiture  count; and (4) errors regarding the timing of his appeal of the  forfeiture sentence.  This last issue involves an important point  of criminal procedure: we decide when an order of forfeiture,  entered after the 1996 amendments to Rule 32, becomes final,  thereby triggering the time for appeal.  We affirm the judgment and  sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Herbert Derman owned property, consisting of two parcels,  that straddled the Massachusetts-New York border.  Derman, together  with his wife, Barbara Derman, had a weekend home on the New York  side, in the town of Hillsdale.  In 1983, Derman leased a portion  of the property on the Massachusetts side, in the towns of North  Egremont and Alford, to Marcel Rosenzweig for the purpose of  erecting a greenhouse.  Rosenzweig erected the greenhouse in the  spring of 1984.  Above ground the new structure appeared to be a  commercial greenhouse, below ground the space was designed for the  greenhouse's true purpose: growing marijuana.  Marijuana was grown  in the underground location until September 1991 when Richard  Haber, an indicted co-conspirator, was arrested at the site for  possession of a small amount of marijuana.  Though the underground  operation was not discovered at this time, as a precautionary  measure, the operation was moved to Rosenzweig's property in  Sandisfield, Massachusetts, where it continued until it was exposed  on August 17, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1995, agents obtained and executed search  warrants on Derman's New York City apartment, his New York City law  office, his Hillsdale residence, his Massachusetts property, and  his Vail, Colorado home.  Eventually, Derman and six others,  including Rosenzweig and Haber, were charged with various federal  crimes relating to the marijuana-growing operation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to his indicted co-conspirators, who pled  guilty in accordance with plea agreements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Derman decided to stand  trial.  His principal defense was that he had no knowledge of the  marijuana-growing operation on his property.  Derman's motion to  suppress the evidence seized during the searches of his properties  was denied on July 23, 1998.  See United States v. Derman, 23 F.  Supp. 2d 95, 98 (D. Mass. 1998).  On July 29, 1998, a jury returned  guilty verdicts on counts one and thirteen and not guilty verdicts  on the remaining counts.  On the government's motion, the court,  after issuing three stays to allow Derman time to file a brief,  entered a preliminary order of forfeiture on November 6, 1998.  On  December 15, 1998, Derman filed a motion for leave to file a late  notice of appeal of the preliminary forfeiture order.  The court  denied this motion on January 4, 1999.  Two days later, Derman  filed another motion, which the court construed as a motion for  reconsideration of the motion for leave to file a late notice of  appeal.  On March 5, 1999, Derman was sentenced and on March 22,  1999, the court denied Derman's motion for reconsideration.  He now  appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman's appeal concentrates on the charge of  prosecutorial misconduct through a persistent appeal to class  prejudice.  His accusation focuses not only on statements by the  prosecutor, the usual subject of misconduct allegations, but also  on the government's trial strategy, which, Derman says, combined  inappropriate prosecutorial statements with the introduction of  class-biased evidence.  Derman points, in particular, to nine  instances during the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. the admission into evidence of a photograph of Barbara  Derman in a ski outfit with mountains in the background  and a witness's identification of Mrs. Derman in the  photograph;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. the questioning of Derman's secretary about \"Derman's  life-style back in the early 1970s when [she] began to  work for him;\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. the questioning of another secretary about Derman's  property, possessions, and vacations;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. the admission into evidence of a part of a videotape  of Derman's Hillsdale home, which had been searched;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. the admission into evidence of certain photographs  from a photo album, as well as the cover page to the  album, which was labeled \"Special Memories\" and which  identified the locations photographed in the album,  including some other than the locations in the admitted  photographs;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. the testimony of a Drug Enforcement Administration  agent that the photo album contained photographs  depicting all of the locations named in the \"Special  Memories\" list;  7. the cross-examination of Barbara Derman regarding the  locations identified in the \"Special Memories\" list;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. the introduction into evidence of receipts from  Cartier jewelers and another jeweler and the questioning  of Barbara Derman regarding these items;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. the references in the prosecutor's closing argument  and rebuttal to vacations and jewelry and the statement  that \"if there is one thing that this case has shown[,  it] is that the Dermans needed and wanted to get more  money.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Derman objected to items 1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 2, 3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and 8 on various  grounds and to items 4 and 5 on the basis of class bias.  At trial,  Derman did not make the allegation he now makes that the  prosecution engaged in a course of conduct at trial that was based  on class prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the prosecutor's comments  during the trial \"focused directly on Derman's claim . . . that he  had no motive, financial or otherwise, to engage in a drug  conspiracy.\"  Further, it says that \"[e]vidence of Derman's  lifestyle was specially relevant . . . to show how he used the  proceeds.\"  The government also contended at oral argument that  Derman's attorney opened the door to this line of inquiry when he  asked rhetorically in his opening argument, \"where is the money?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have found prosecutorial misconduct for  introducing class bias when prosecutors have engaged in actions  that might inflame the passions of the jury to such an extent as to  call into doubt the fairness of the trial.

As  this court stated in United States v. Rothrock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480164\"><a href=\"/opinion/480164/united-states-v-albert-h-rothrock-and-vivian-s-rothrock/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span> </a></span>(1st  Cir. 1986), \"[a]rgument, especially the government's, should not  degenerate into an appeal to prejudice.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480164\"><a href=\"/opinion/480164/united-states-v-albert-h-rothrock-and-vivian-s-rothrock/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 323.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the line between statements that are \"appeals  to class prejudice [that] are highly improper and cannot be  condoned\" and statements regarding class that are \"relevant to the  issues at hand\" is not easily drawn.  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103352\"><a href=\"/opinion/103352/united-states-v-socony-vacuum-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span>, 239 (1940).  It is especially  difficult to draw when an accused's motivation is at issue, and  when, as here, the alleged motivation is financial.  Derman says  that the government crossed the line and that his conviction should  be reversed and his sentence vacated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no need to worry about the remedy because there  was no misconduct.  The statements by the prosecutor, during the  trial and during closing arguments, went to the motive for the  alleged crimes and did not impermissibly stray into class bias. Derman's motive was not only essential to the government's case,  but also crucial to the defense, as is evidenced by defense  counsel's question, in his opening argument, \"where is the money?,\"  and by his statement, in his closing, \"There is no money, they  can't find any money.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the district court judge was sensitive to  the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence admitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  With  this in mind, he limited the introduction of the number of  photographs of Barbara Derman, he restricted the extent to which  the photo album could be used, and he curtailed the use of the  videotape.  Further, he made an offer to give a limiting  instruction on some of the admitted evidence, an offer which the  defense did not accept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no indication, looking at the totality  of the evidence admitted and the statements made by the prosecutor,  that there was a trial strategy or course of conduct that,  intentionally or unintentionally, would lead to the unlawful  enkindling of class bias in the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman also contests the denial of his motion to  suppress.

This argument has been waived.  Ellian's affidavit asserting that  she was never served with the warrant was before the district court  judge for the purpose of supporting Derman's claim that the search  exceeded its scope, not for a Rule 41(d) claim.  The trial court  did not consider Rule 41(d) in its decision, and neither do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman raises several issues pertaining the forfeiture of  the property, some of which pose the question of whether there is  appellate jurisdiction.  We start with the issue of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Derman was sentenced, but after the guilty  verdict, the court entered, on the government's unopposed motion,  a \"preliminary order of forfeiture.\"  Derman sought and was denied  leave to file a late notice of appeal, then asked for and was  denied reconsideration.  Apparently, the district court took the  view that the date of entry of the pre-sentence preliminary order  of forfeiture triggered the running of the time to appeal.  Defense  counsel says that that was unlikely, but, in an abundance of  caution, he tried to appeal from the order.  Thereafter, on March  5 (amended on March 9), 1999, the district court imposed judgment  and sentence, including an order that the property be forfeited. Derman promptly appealed the judgment, including the final order of  forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether the district court abused its  discretion in not permitting Derman an extension to file a notice  from the preliminary order of forfeiture has been briefed.  It  raises the question of which order -- the preliminary pre-sentence  order or the final judgment order -- is the final order for  purposes of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As amended in 1996, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure  32(d)(2) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a verdict contains a finding that property is subject  to a criminal forfeiture, . . . the court may enter a  preliminary order of forfeiture after providing notice to  the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on  the timing and form of the order.  The order of  forfeiture shall authorize the Attorney General to seize  the property subject to forfeiture, to conduct any  discovery that the court considers proper to help  identify, locate, or dispose of the property, and to  begin proceedings consistent with any statutory  requirements pertaining to ancillary hearings and the  rights of third parties.  At sentencing, a final order of  forfeiture shall be made part of the sentence and  included in the judgment.  The court may include in the  final order such conditions as may be reasonably  necessary to preserve the value of the property pending  any appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the forfeiture order, as the government now concedes, is a  part of the sentence, see Libretti v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117979\"><a href=\"/opinion/117979/libretti-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>,  38-39 (1995), and becomes final for purposes of appeal when the  court issues its judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Fed.

App. P. 4(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, Derman has properly appealed from the final  order of forfeiture contained in his sentence.  Derman raises two  sorts of objections to the forfeiture order itself.  He attacks the  order on grounds of \"sufficiency, prosecutorial misconduct and  Constitutional errors.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Derman, however, did not preserve this  issue for appeal.  We would normally review his claim for plain  error.  See United States v. Badeaux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6852\"><a href=\"/opinion/6852/united-states-v-badeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, 246 (5th Cir.  1994).  But Derman's argument on this point, in his brief, is  perfunctory and unaccompanied by developed argumentation and we  consider it waived. See Romero v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto  Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198842\"><a href=\"/opinion/198842/romero-v-colegio-de-abogados/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 296 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman also says he should have been given an opportunity  to argue the forfeiture issue to the jury before it decided the  forfeiture count.  After the jury found Derman guilty on count one  and not guilty on the other substantive counts, the judge  instructed the jurors on the forfeiture count.  The trial judge did  not offer, nor did counsel request, additional argument.  Derman  now claims that it was error for the judge not to have offered  counsel the opportunity to give closing argument on this count. Derman also claims that the failure of his trial counsel to request  further argument on the forfeiture count constitutes ineffective  assistance of counsel.  Counsel, Derman claims, could have informed  the jury of \"the fact that there are two separate parcels [that  make up Derman's property, i.e., a parcel in New York and a parcel  in Massachusetts], and . . . [argued] that forfeiture of the entire  two parcels was disproportionate to the defendant's crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Derman's counsel did not object to the lack of  closing argument on forfeiture, we review for plain error.  SeeUnited States v. DeLeon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198562\"><a href=\"/opinion/198562/united-states-v-deleon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span> </span>(1999).  Thus, \"before an appellate court can  correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2)  that is plain, . . . (3) that affects substantial rights\" and (4)  that \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public  reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Johnson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 466-67 (1997) (alterations in original) (internal  quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not commit plain error by not  offering counsel the opportunity to present arguments to the jury  on the forfeiture count.  While it may be error for a judge to deny  counsel's request for argument on forfeiture, Derman's counsel made  no such request.  Cf. Herring v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109310\"><a href=\"/opinion/109310/herring-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 862 (1975)  (\"In a criminal trial, which is in the end basically a factfinding  process, no aspect of such advocacy could be more important than  the opportunity finally to marshal the evidence for each side  before submission of the case to judgment.\"); United States v.

Even if we thought that the trial judge  should have offered counsel additional argument on the forfeiture  count, we would not be convinced that this failure would satisfy  the third and fourth tests of the plain error doctrine.  There was  sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's finding  and, as explained below, it is unclear what argument Derman's  counsel could have made that would have altered the forfeiture  verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Derman's ineffective assistance of counsel argument also  fails.

A conviction will be overturned if (1) \"counsel's  performance was deficient,\" that is, \"counsel made errors so  serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel'  guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment;\" and (2) \"the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,\" that is, \"counsel's  errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,  a trial whose result is reliable.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 687.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming trial counsel's performance was deficient,  which we doubt, Derman has not demonstrated prejudice.

The  pre-1996 preliminary order was preliminary, however, only in the  sense that the government's interest was not finalized until the  court could evaluate ancillary third-party claims to the forfeited  property; the preliminary order was final, and thus appealable, as  to the defendant.

If, before 1996, the  government was concerned that a delay between verdict and  sentencing might hamper recovery of the forfeited property, it  could request a restraining order to maintain the status quo until  sentencing.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32, advisory committee's note to  32(d)(2), 1996 amendments; United States v. Alexander, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1866565\"><a href=\"/opinion/1866565/united-states-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>  <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 442 (D. Minn. 1990).  To solve this problem, the 1996  amendments allowed a court to issue a \"preliminary order\" before  sentencing.  Because this preliminary order is issued before  sentencing, it is different from the pre-1996 preliminary order: it  is not final as to the defendant and thus not appealable.  Cf.United States v.

After the 1996  amendments, the forfeiture order entered at sentencing is called  \"final order of forfeiture,\" and it is this order that is  appealable.  Thus, regardless of the name given to the order of  forfeiture (preliminary or final), both before and after the 1996  amendments the key moment for determining finality for the purpose  of appeal is sentencing.  Of course, if the forfeiture order is  entered after sentencing, the time for appeal runs from the date of  the post-sentencing order.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  In his brief, Derman characterizes this as an error of  the jury verdict.  As the discussion in the text suggests, the  error complained of is more properly described as an error in the  sentence.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
