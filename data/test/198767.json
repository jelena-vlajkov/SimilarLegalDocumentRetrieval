Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n         Selya, Boudin, and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nRoberto C. Quiones-Rivera, with whom Samuel T. Cspedes,\r\nCarmen Hilda Bus, and McConnell Valds were on brief, for\r\nappellants.\r\nCornelius J. Moynihan, Jr., with whom Alberto Cuevas\r\nTrisn and Juan A. Perez Lopez were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       January 6, 2000\r\n                                           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. In 1992, Autoridad de Energa\r\nElctrica de Puerto Rico (the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority)\r\nentered into a $7.5 million contract with Ericsson GE Mobile\r\nCommunications, Inc., to purchase a trunk radio system guaranteed\r\nto function for fifteen years. The Authority, or PREPA, generates,\r\ntransmits, and distributes almost all of the electricity used in\r\nthe Commonwealth. PREPA came to think that the equipment it had\r\npurchased was not Y2K-compliant. In July 1999, PREPA sued Ericsson\r\nin the courts of the Commonwealth for a declaration that Ericsson\r\nwas required to upgrade the equipment (without further charge)\r\nunder the contract and for injunctive relief to the same effect.\r\nEricsson removed the case to federal court based on\r\ndiversity and moved to stay all proceedings under the Y2K Act, Pub.\r\nL. No. 106-37, 113 Stat. 185 (1999) (codified at 15 U.S.C.  6601-\r\n6617). In the meantime, PREPA moved to remand to the Commonwealth\r\ncourt based on Article 28 of the contract, which PREPA\r\ncharacterized as a forum-selection clause. Without acting on\r\nEricsson's Y2K Act stay motion, the federal district court remanded\r\nthe matter to the Commonwealth court. \r\nEricsson appealed and this court issued a stay of the\r\nremand order. Our stay order permitted the district court to\r\naddress ordinary matters that were not inconsistent with the\r\nprosecution of the appeal. PREPA had taken no action in the\r\ndistrict court in the interim as of the time of oral argument.\r\nThe appeal raises several issues, most of which are of\r\nfirst impression for this court. First, does 28 U.S.C.  1447\r\npreclude jurisdiction in this court in a removed case to review a\r\nremand order based on a contract's forum-selection clause? The\r\nquestion is complicated by the need to consider the effect of the\r\n1996 amendment to 28 U.S.C.  1447(c). Second, does the final\r\njudgment rule nonetheless bar review of this case, or does the case\r\nfall within one of that rule's exceptions? Third, does the language\r\nof the contractual clause mean that the parties agreed only that\r\nthey would consent to jurisdiction in the Commonwealth courts or,\r\nalternatively, that those courts would have exclusive jurisdiction?\r\nFourth, should this court address Ericsson's contention that the\r\nY2K Act mandates that a stay of the district court proceedings be\r\nissued? \r\nWe conclude that we have jurisdiction. Remand orders\r\nbased on contractual forum clauses are not within the bar on\r\nappellate review in 28 U.S.C.  1447(d). We also join every other\r\ncircuit court that has addressed the issue in holding that forum\r\nclause-based remand orders fall within the collateral order\r\ndoctrine, are final for the purpose of the final judgment rule,\r\nand, consequently, are subject to review by direct appeal. Further,\r\nwe conclude that the district court erred in its reading of the\r\nclause and that its remand of the case to the Commonwealth courts\r\nwas improper. A clause that simply consents to jurisdiction in one\r\ncourt does not by its terms exclude jurisdiction in another court.\r\nThis case is properly in the federal courts and we conclude that\r\nthe district court should address the matter of the Y2K Act stay in\r\nthe first instance.\r\n\nI. Jurisdiction in this Court\r\nA. The Effect of 28 U.S.C.  1447\r\nThis court has not previously addressed the issue of\r\nwhether review is available when the remand was based on a forum-\r\nselection clause; other circuits have concluded that there is\r\nappellate jurisdiction because a forum-selection clause is not a\r\nground stated in  1447(c) as to which review is precluded. See\r\nSnapper, Inc. v. Redan, 171 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 nn.8 &amp; 15 (11th Cir.\r\n1999) (citing cases). At oral argument, PREPA's able counsel\r\nconceded that we would have jurisdiction to review the remand order\r\nunless the 1996 amendment to 28 U.S.C.  1447(c) altered the prior\r\nanalysis in the case law. He also admitted that there would be\r\njurisdiction if this court accepted the Eleventh Circuit's analysis\r\nin Snapper.\r\nWe briefly explain what is at issue. The question is\r\nwhether to apply here the bar to review of certain remand orders\r\ncontained in  1447(d):\r\n      [a]n order remanding a case to the State court\r\n  from which it was removed is not reviewable on\r\n  appeal or otherwise. \r\n\nIn 1976, the Supreme Court held that the prohibition in  1447(d)\r\napplies only to remand orders based on the grounds specified in\r\n1447(c). See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S.\r\n336, 346 (1976). In 1988, the text of  1447(c) was revised. It no\r\nlonger spoke of remands for cases \"improvidently removed\" or\r\n\"without jurisdiction,\" the language interpreted by Thermtron.\r\nInstead, the new language spoke of remands \"on the basis of any\r\ndefect in removal procedure\" or for lack of \"subject matter\r\njurisdiction.\" In 1996, the statute was amended again. It now\r\nprovides:\r\n  A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect\r\nother than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be\r\nmade within 30 days after the filing of the notice of\r\nremoval under section 1446(a). \r\n\nCommentators have suggested a possible reading of the amendments to\r\nthe effect that  1447(c) now covers all remand orders. See David\r\nD. Siegel, Commentary on 1996 Revision of Section 1447(c), 28\r\nU.S.C.A.  1447 (West Supp. 1999) (the new language is \"like a\r\nresiduary clause\"); see also Thomas R. Hrdlick, Appellate Review of\r\nRemand Orders in Removed Cases: Are They Losing a Certain Appeal?,\r\n82 Marq. L. Rev. 535, 561-69 (1999).\r\nThe basic issue, since there is no question of lack of\r\nfederal subject matter jurisdiction, is whether the term \"defect,\"\r\nas used in the statute, encompasses a remand order that is based on\r\nan interpretation of a forum clause in a contract. We think not,\r\nfor two reasons. First, the text of the statute provides a\r\nreasonable meaning for the term \"defect,\" a meaning that refers to\r\nthe failure to comply with the various requirements for a\r\nsuccessful removal, as set forth in  1446(a) and (b). Much less\r\nplausible would be a reading of the term \"defect\" that encompassed\r\na remand based on a forum-selection clause.\r\nThere is a second consideration. If Congress had truly\r\ndesired to overrule Thermtron and its progeny, we think it would\r\nhave chosen less oblique means. The Eleventh Circuit's well-\r\ndocumented analysis of the context and history of the legislative\r\nrevisions to the statute convince us that Congress had no such\r\nintent. See Snapper, 171 F.3d at 1254-59; see also Hrdlick, supra,\r\nat 576 (arguing that the legislative \"history suggests Congress did\r\nnot intend a radical alteration of . . . the appellate bar\"). We\r\njoin the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion in Snapper that  1447(d) is\r\nnot a bar to review of a remand order based on a forum-selection\r\nclause.\r\n\nB. Final Judgment Rule\r\nThis circuit has never addressed the question of whether\r\nforum clause-based remand orders are reviewable by appeal, as an\r\nexception to the normal rule that only final judgments are\r\nreviewable. In Thermtron, the Supreme Court had stated that \"an\r\norder remanding a removed action does not represent a final\r\njudgment reviewable by appeal.\" Thermtron, 423 U.S. at 352-53. But\r\nthis language was limited by Quackenbush v. Allstate Insurance Co.,\r\n517 U.S. 706, 711-15 (1996), which held that an abstention-based\r\nremand order was reviewable by an interlocutory appeal. The Court\r\nfound that this type of remand order was reviewable since it\r\nsatisfied the collateral order doctrine and was final in the sense\r\nthat it put the plaintiff out of federal court. See id. at 714-15.\r\nPREPA says that Quackenbush cannot be transferred to remand orders\r\nbased on forum clauses.\r\nThe circuit courts of appeals that have addressed this\r\nissue have all concluded that remand orders based on forum-\r\nselection clauses are reviewable by interlocutory appeal. See\r\nFlorida Polk County v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 170 F.3d 1081,\r\n1083 (11th Cir. 1999); Milk 'N' More, Inc. v. Beavert, 963 F.2d\r\n1342, 1344-45 (10th Cir. 1992); McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Lloyds\r\nUnderwriters, 944 F.2d 1199, 1204 &amp; n.7 (5th Cir. 1991); Foster v.\r\nChesapeake Ins. Co., 933 F.2d 1207, 1211 &amp; n.6 (3d Cir. 1991);\r\nRegis Assocs. v. Rank Hotels (Mgmt.) Ltd., 894 F.2d 193, 194-95\r\n(6th Cir. 1990); Karl Koch Erecting Co. v. New York Convention Ctr.\r\nDev. Corp., 838 F.2d 656, 658-59 &amp; n.1 (2d Cir. 1988); Pelleport\r\nInvestors, Inc. v. Budco Quality Theatres, Inc., 741 F.2d 273, 277-\r\n78 (9th Cir. 1984); see also Benson v. SI Handling Sys., Inc., 188\r\nF.3d 780, 782 (7th Cir. 1999) (holding that remand order in\r\nsuccessive removal is reviewable); Pennsylvania Nurses Ass'n v.\r\nPennsylvania State Educ. Ass'n, 90 F.3d 797, 801 (3d Cir. 1996)\r\n(same for supplemental jurisdiction-based remand order); Gaming\r\nCorp. of Am. v. Dorsey &amp; Whitney, 88 F.3d, 536, 542 (8th Cir. 1996)\r\n(same). For the same reasons the abstention-based remand order was\r\nreviewable in Quackenbush, we find that the forum-based remand\r\norder is reviewable and we join the other circuits that have so\r\nfound.\r\nThe two circuit cases on which PREPA relies predate\r\nQuackenbush and have been abrogated. See Doughty v. Underwriters at\r\nLloyd's, London, 6 F.3d 856, 864 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding no\r\nappellate jurisdiction over abstention-based remand order); Garcia\r\nv. Island Program Designer, Inc., 4 F.3d 57, 59-60 (1st Cir. 1993)\r\n(same).\r\n\nII. The Forum Clause\r\nHaving confirmed our jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we\r\nturn to the forum clause, the basis for the district court's remand\r\norder. The forum clause, Article 28 of the contract between the\r\nparties, provides:\r\n      This contract will be governed and interpreted\r\n  pursuant to the Laws of the Commonwealth of\r\n  Puerto Rico and the parties agree to submit to\r\n  the jurisdiction of the courts of the\r\n  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\r\n\nThe district court summarily allowed the remand motion, saying only\r\nthat \"Article 28 demonstrates the parties' clear intention to\r\nlitigate matters related to the contract in the Commonwealth\r\ncourts.\" \r\nEricsson urges error on two bases: first, the language is\r\nplain that the clause is nothing more than a consent to personal\r\njurisdiction in the courts of the Commonwealth; and, second, if\r\nthere were any obscurity in the language, the clause must, under\r\nPuerto Rico law, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3478, be construed\r\nagainst the originator of the language. Ericsson is incorporated\r\nand has its principal place of business outside of Puerto Rico,\r\nfacts that support Ericsson's reading. \r\nPREPA counters with two arguments: the clause is not\r\nambiguous and Puerto Rico law requires, even if the language were\r\nunclear, that the evident intention of the parties shall prevail.\r\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3471. If the language were ambiguous,\r\nPREPA says, the usual rule under Puerto Rico law -- that any\r\nobscurity should be read against the drafter -- should not apply.\r\nThe clause should not be construed against PREPA because, while\r\nPREPA drafted the clause, it says it considers itself the underdog \r\nfighting against a big international corporation. The parties agree\r\nthat Puerto Rico law governs the contract interpretation question.\r\nOur review of the contract interpretation question is de\r\nnovo. See Lambert v. Kysar, 983 F.2d 1110, 1112 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nThe outcome of this question is determined by our 1993 decision in\r\nRedondo Construction Corp. v. Banco Exterior de Espaa S.A., 11\r\nF.3d 3 (1st Cir. 1993). There, plaintiff sued in federal court in\r\nPuerto Rico and defendant defended on the basis that a forum clause\r\nrequired the action to be brought in Florida. See id. at 5. This\r\ncourt disagreed. The contract clause in Redondo stated:\r\n      Borrower and the Guarantors each hereby expressly\r\n  submits to the jurisdiction of all Federal and\r\n  State Courts located in the State of Florida. \r\n\nId. We read the clause to be an affirmative conferral of personal\r\njurisdiction by consent, and not a negative exclusion of\r\njurisdiction in other courts. See id. at 6. We do so here as well.\r\nSeveral circuits have interpreted such forum clause language\r\nsimilarly. See John Boutari &amp; Son, Wines &amp; Spirits, S.A. v. Attiki\r\nImporters &amp; Distribs., Inc., 22 F.3d 51, 53 (2d Cir. 1994); Caldas\r\n&amp; Sons, Inc. v. Willingham, 17 F.3d 123, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1994);\r\nHunt Wesson Foods, Inc. v. Supreme Oil Co., 817 F.2d 75, 77 (9th\r\nCir. 1987).\r\nOf some weight is PREPA's argument that this clause would\r\nbe rendered mere surplusage by such a reading given that Ericsson\r\nhad qualified to do business in Puerto Rico at the time of the\r\ncontract and so there was no need for a consent to personal\r\njurisdiction in the courts of Puerto Rico. See, e.g., Florida Polk,\r\n170 F.3d at 1083-84. But the argument is not persuasive. PREPA, a\r\nfrequent litigant in the federal courts, could easily have drafted\r\nthe contract to provide for exclusive jurisdiction in the\r\nCommonwealth courts if that were its intent. And that Ericsson had\r\nqualified to do business at the time of the contract did not mean\r\nthat it would continue to do so at all times within the statute of\r\nlimitations on the contract. Finally, PREPA had an obvious interest\r\nin cutting off any possible litigation on personal jurisdiction\r\ngrounds, even if the issue was unlikely to be raised. See McDermott\r\nInt'l, 944 F.2d at 1206 n.10 (explaining the value of consent to\r\npersonal jurisdiction by foreign corporations). Because we decide\r\nthis as a matter of the language of the contract, we do not\r\ndiscuss Ericsson's alternative argument that a waiver of a\r\nstatutory right of removal must be \"clear and unequivocal.\" See,\r\ne.g., In re Delta Am. Re Ins. Co., 900 F.2d 890, 892 (6th Cir.\r\n1990).\r\nAccordingly, the order remanding the case to the\r\nCommonwealth courts was error.\r\n\nIII. The Y2K Act and the Motion for Stay\r\nThe Y2K Act, which generally governs civil actions\r\nrelated to Y2K failure, establishes an initial cooling-off period\r\ndesigned to facilitate resolution of Y2K problems through voluntary\r\nefforts or alternative dispute resolution. In particular, the Act\r\nrequires potential plaintiffs to file a pre-litigation notice. See\r\n15 U.S.C.  6606(a). The potential defendant has thirty days to\r\nrespond with a plan to remediate or to enter into alternative\r\ndispute resolution. See id.  6606(c). If the defendant fails to\r\nrespond within thirty days, the plaintiff may file suit on the\r\nthirty-first day. See id.  6606(d). If the defendant does respond,\r\nan additional sixty days is allowed to resolve the problem. See id.\r\n6606(e). Where, as here, the plaintiff fails to provide pre-\r\nlitigation notice, the defendant may treat the complaint as such\r\nnotice by so informing the court. See id.  6606(f). If any\r\ndefendant elects to treat the complaint as notice, the Act\r\nprovides that \"the court shall stay all discovery and all other\r\nproceedings in the action for the appropriate period after filing\r\nof the complaint.\" Id. (emphasis added). PREPA concedes that the\r\nY2K Act applies, but disputes Ericsson's contention that it was\r\nentitled to a stay.\r\nEricsson continues to press for a stay, pointing out that\r\nit has been in litigation since this action started. PREPA, in\r\nturn, points out that a stay, under the statute, should be \"for an\r\nappropriate period,\" id.  6606(f), and that five months have\r\npassed since the complaint was filed. In response to questions from\r\nthis court at oral argument, both parties conceded that the matter\r\nof a stay is better decided by the district court in the first\r\ninstance. We agree.\r\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court's order of\r\nremand to the Commonwealth court and remand the case to the\r\ndistrict court for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion. Costs are awarded to appellants.\n",

In 1992, Autoridad de Energa\r\nElctrica de Puerto Rico (the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority)\r\nentered into a $7.5 million contract with Ericsson GE Mobile\r\nCommunications, Inc., to purchase a trunk radio system guaranteed\r\nto function for fifteen years.

No. 106-37, 113 Stat. 185 (1999) (codified at 15 U.S.C.  6601-\r\n6617). In the meantime, PREPA moved to remand to the Commonwealth\r\ncourt based on Article 28 of the contract, which PREPA\r\ncharacterized as a forum-selection clause. Without acting on\r\nEricsson's Y2K Act stay motion, the federal district court remanded\r\nthe matter to the Commonwealth court. \r\nEricsson appealed and this court issued a stay of the\r\nremand order.

Remand orders\r\nbased on contractual forum clauses are not within the bar on\r\nappellate review in 28 U.S.C.  1447(d). We also join every other\r\ncircuit court that has addressed the issue in holding that forum\r\nclause-based remand orders fall within the collateral order\r\ndoctrine, are final for the purpose of the final judgment rule,\r\nand, consequently, are subject to review by direct appeal. Further,\r\nwe conclude that the district court erred in its reading of the\r\nclause and that its remand of the case to the Commonwealth courts\r\nwas improper. A clause that simply consents to jurisdiction in one\r\ncourt does not by its terms exclude jurisdiction in another court.\r\nThis case is properly in the federal courts and we conclude that\r\nthe district court should address the matter of the Y2K Act stay in\r\nthe first instance.\r\n\nI. Jurisdiction in this Court\r\nA. The Effect of 28 U.S.C.  1447\r\nThis court has not previously addressed the issue of\r\nwhether review is available when the remand was based on a forum-\r\nselection clause; other circuits have concluded that there is\r\nappellate jurisdiction because a forum-selection clause is not a\r\nground stated in  1447(c) as to which review is precluded. See\r\nSnapper, Inc. v. Redan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73676\"><a href=\"/opinion/73676/snapper-inc-v-redan/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255-56 nn.8 &amp; 15 (11th Cir.\r\n1999) (citing cases). At oral argument, PREPA's able counsel\r\nconceded that we would have jurisdiction to review the remand order\r\nunless the 1996 amendment to 28 U.S.C.  1447(c) altered the prior\r\nanalysis in the case law. He also admitted that there would be\r\njurisdiction if this court accepted the Eleventh Circuit's analysis\r\nin Snapper.\r\nWe briefly explain what is at issue. The question is\r\nwhether to apply here the bar to review of certain remand orders\r\ncontained in  1447(d):\r\n      [a]n order remanding a case to the State court\r\n  from which it was removed is not reviewable on\r\n  appeal or otherwise. \r\n\nIn 1976, the Supreme Court held that the prohibition in  1447(d)\r\napplies only to remand orders based on the grounds specified in\r\n1447(c). See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109348\"><a href=\"/opinion/109348/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (1976). In 1988, the text of  1447(c) was revised. It no\r\nlonger spoke of remands for cases \"improvidently removed\" or\r\n\"without jurisdiction,\" the language interpreted by Thermtron.\r\nInstead, the new language spoke of remands \"on the basis of any\r\ndefect in removal procedure\" or for lack of \"subject matter\r\njurisdiction.\" In 1996, the statute was amended again. It now\r\nprovides:\r\n  A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect\r\nother than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be\r\nmade within 30 days after the filing of the notice of\r\nremoval under section 1446(a). \r\n\nCommentators have suggested a possible reading of the amendments to\r\nthe effect that  1447(c) now covers all remand orders. See David\r\nD. Siegel, Commentary on 1996 Revision of Section 1447(c), 28\r\nU.S.C.A.  1447 (West Supp. 1999) (the new language is \"like a\r\nresiduary clause\"); see also Thomas R. Hrdlick, Appellate Review of\r\nRemand Orders in Removed Cases: Are They Losing a Certain Appeal?,\r\n82 Marq. L. Rev. 535, 561-69 (1999).\r\nThe basic issue, since there is no question of lack of\r\nfederal subject matter jurisdiction, is whether the term \"defect,\"\r\nas used in the statute, encompasses a remand order that is based on\r\nan interpretation of a forum clause in a contract. We think not,\r\nfor two reasons. First, the text of the statute provides a\r\nreasonable meaning for the term \"defect,\" a meaning that refers to\r\nthe failure to comply with the various requirements for a\r\nsuccessful removal, as set forth in  1446(a) and (b). Much less\r\nplausible would be a reading of the term \"defect\" that encompassed\r\na remand based on a forum-selection clause.\r\nThere is a second consideration. If Congress had truly\r\ndesired to overrule Thermtron and its progeny, we think it would\r\nhave chosen less oblique means. The Eleventh Circuit's well-\r\ndocumented analysis of the context and history of the legislative\r\nrevisions to the statute convince us that Congress had no such\r\nintent. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73676\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Snapper,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/73676/snapper-inc-v-redan/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1254-59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hrdlick,</span> supra,\r\nat <span class=\"page\">576</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(arguing that the legislative \"history suggests Congress did\r\nnot intend a radical alteration of . . . the appellate bar\"). We\r\njoin the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion in Snapper that  1447(d) is\r\nnot a bar to review of a remand order based on a forum-selection\r\nclause.\r\n\nB. Final Judgment Rule\r\nThis circuit has never addressed the question of whether\r\nforum clause-based remand orders are reviewable by appeal, as an\r\nexception to the normal rule that only final judgments are\r\nreviewable. In Thermtron, the Supreme Court had stated that \"an\r\norder remanding a removed action does not represent a final\r\njudgment reviewable by appeal.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109348\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Thermtron,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109348/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">352-53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The Forum Clause\r\nHaving confirmed our jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we\r\nturn to the forum clause, the basis for the district court's remand\r\norder. The forum clause, Article 28 of the contract between the\r\nparties, provides:\r\n      This contract will be governed and interpreted\r\n  pursuant to the Laws of the Commonwealth of\r\n  Puerto Rico and the parties agree to submit to\r\n  the jurisdiction of the courts of the\r\n  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\r\n\nThe district court summarily allowed the remand motion, saying only\r\nthat \"Article 28 demonstrates the parties' clear intention to\r\nlitigate matters related to the contract in the Commonwealth\r\ncourts.\" \r\nEricsson urges error on two bases: first, the language is\r\nplain that the clause is nothing more than a consent to personal\r\njurisdiction in the courts of the Commonwealth; and, second, if\r\nthere were any obscurity in the language, the clause must, under\r\nPuerto Rico law, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3478, be construed\r\nagainst the originator of the language. Ericsson is incorporated\r\nand has its principal place of business outside of Puerto Rico,\r\nfacts that support Ericsson's reading. \r\nPREPA counters with two arguments: the clause is not\r\nambiguous and Puerto Rico law requires, even if the language were\r\nunclear, that the evident intention of the parties shall prevail.\r\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3471. If the language were ambiguous,\r\nPREPA says, the usual rule under Puerto Rico law -- that any\r\nobscurity should be read against the drafter -- should not apply.\r\nThe clause should not be construed against PREPA because, while\r\nPREPA drafted the clause, it says it considers itself the underdog \r\nfighting against a big international corporation. The parties agree\r\nthat Puerto Rico law governs the contract interpretation question.\r\nOur review of the contract interpretation question is de\r\nnovo. See Lambert v. Kysar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598967\"><a href=\"/opinion/598967/george-lambert-dba-rainbow-fruit-v-sam-kysar-and-joan-kysar-dba/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1112 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nThe outcome of this question is determined by our 1993 decision in\r\nRedondo Construction Corp. v. Banco Exterior de Espaa S.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195055\"><a href=\"/opinion/195055/redondo-construction-v-banco-exterior/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1993). There, plaintiff sued in federal court in\r\nPuerto Rico and defendant defended on the basis that a forum clause\r\nrequired the action to be brought in Florida.

See John Boutari &amp; Son, Wines &amp; Spirits, S.A. v. Attiki\r\nImporters &amp; Distribs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668256\"><a href=\"/opinion/668256/john-boutari-and-son-wines-and-spirits-sa-v-attiki-importers-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (2d Cir. 1994); Caldas\r\n&amp; Sons, Inc. v. Willingham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6302\"><a href=\"/opinion/6302/caldas-sons-inc-v-willingham/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1994);\r\nHunt Wesson Foods, Inc. v.

See, e.g., Florida </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Polk,</span>\r\n<span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1083-84</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But the argument is not persuasive. PREPA, a\r\nfrequent litigant in the federal courts, could easily have drafted\r\nthe contract to provide for exclusive jurisdiction in the\r\nCommonwealth courts if that were its intent. And that Ericsson had\r\nqualified to do business at the time of the contract did not mean\r\nthat it would continue to do so at all times within the statute of\r\nlimitations on the contract. Finally, PREPA had an obvious interest\r\nin cutting off any possible litigation on personal jurisdiction\r\ngrounds, even if the issue was unlikely to be raised. See McDermott\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568511\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Int'l,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/568511/mcdermott-international-inc-v-lloyds-underwriters-of-london-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1206</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">n.10 (explaining the value of consent to\r\npersonal jurisdiction by foreign corporations). Because we decide\r\nthis as a matter of the language of the contract, we do not\r\ndiscuss Ericsson's alternative argument that a waiver of a\r\nstatutory right of removal must be \"clear and unequivocal.\" See,\r\ne.g., In re Delta Am. Re Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892 (6th Cir.\r\n1990).\r\nAccordingly, the order remanding the case to the\r\nCommonwealth courts was error.\r\n\nIII. The Y2K Act and the Motion for Stay\r\nThe Y2K Act, which generally governs civil actions\r\nrelated to Y2K failure, establishes an initial cooling-off period\r\ndesigned to facilitate resolution of Y2K problems through voluntary\r\nefforts or alternative dispute resolution. In particular, the Act\r\nrequires potential plaintiffs to file a pre-litigation notice. See\r\n15 U.S.C.  6606(a). The potential defendant has thirty days to\r\nrespond with a plan to remediate or to enter into alternative\r\ndispute resolution. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  6606(c). If </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">the defendant fails to\r\nrespond within thirty days, the plaintiff may file suit on the\r\nthirty-first day. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  6606(d). If </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">the defendant does respond,\r\nan additional sixty days is allowed to resolve the problem. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\r\n6606(e). Where, </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">as here, the plaintiff fails to provide pre-\r\nlitigation notice, the defendant may treat the complaint as such\r\nnotice by so informing the court. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  6606(f). If </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">any\r\ndefendant elects to treat the complaint as notice, the Act\r\nprovides that \"the court shall stay all discovery and all other\r\nproceedings in the action for the appropriate period after filing\r\nof the complaint.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added). </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">PREPA concedes that the\r\nY2K Act applies, but disputes Ericsson's contention that it was\r\nentitled to a stay.\r\nEricsson continues to press for a stay, pointing out that\r\nit has been in litigation since this action started. PREPA, in\r\nturn, points out that a stay, under the statute, should be \"for an\r\nappropriate period,\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  6606(f), and </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">that five months have\r\npassed since the complaint was filed. In response to questions from\r\nthis court at oral argument, both parties conceded that the matter\r\nof a stay is better decided by the district court in the first\r\ninstance. We agree.\r\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court's order of\r\nremand to the Commonwealth court and remand the case to the\r\ndistrict court for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion. Costs are awarded to appellants.\n</pre>",
