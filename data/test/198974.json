On August 7, 1998, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Miguel A. Andino-Pastrana, a career employee of the\n\nMunicipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico (\"Municipality\"), brought\n\nthis damages action under a number of federal and Commonwealth\n\ncivil rights and tort statutes.            Plaintiff alleged that his\n\nformer    supervisor,    defendant-appellee      Eduardo   Rivero-Albino,\n\ntransferred him and took additional adverse employment actions\n\nagainst him because of his race and his political beliefs.\n\nPlaintiff also named as defendants the Municipality itself and\n\nMayor Sila Maria Calderon, who was in office at all relevant\n\ntimes.    But because plaintiff sued the individual defendants in\n\ntheir official capacities only, the suit was and is for all\n\npractical purposes solely against the Municipality.           See Will v.\n\nMichigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).\n\n            Defendants moved to dismiss the action as time-barred\n\nbecause plaintiff was aware of his allegedly discriminatory\n\ntransfer no later than July 10, 1997, yet waited more than a\n\nyear from the date of transfer to file his complaint.                 See,\n\ne.g., Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275-80 (1985) (directing\n\nfederal    courts   to   borrow   and    apply   state   personal   injury\n\nlimitations statutes in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actions); Guzman-Rivera\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fv. Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d 3, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying Puerto\n\nRico's one-year personal injury statute of limitations in a\n\ncivil rights damages action brought in the District of Puerto\n\nRico).     In his opposition papers, plaintiff agreed that his\n\ncause of action accrued no later than July 10, 1997, and that he\n\nwas required to file suit within one year of its accrual.                        But\n\nplaintiff argued that an administrative appeal filed less than\n\na month after his transfer with the Commonwealth's Merit Systems\n\nProtection Board (\"JASAP\" is the Spanish acronym for the Board)\n\nshould be regarded as an \"extrajudicial claim\" sufficient to\n\ntoll the running of the limitations period.                 See P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 31, § 5303 (providing that the \"[p]rescription of actions\n\nis   interrupted    by     their   institution     before     the    courts,     by\n\nextrajudicial      claim    of     the    creditor,   and    by     any    act    of\n\nacknowledgment of the debt by the debtor\").                    In a carefully\n\nreasoned    opinion      and     order,    the   district     court       rejected\n\nplaintiff's argument and entered judgment for defendants.                        We\n\naffirm.\n\n           Although \"an extrajudicial claim is subject to only a\n\nfew requirements,\" Tokyo Marine & Fire Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Perez\n\n& Cia., 142 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that such a claim\n\n\"must be made by the holder of the substantive right (or his\n\nlegal representative), . . .               be addressed to the debtor or\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fpassive subject of the right, not to a third party, and . . .\n\nrequire or demand the same conduct or relief ultimately sought\n\nin the subsequent lawsuit\") (citation, internal quotation marks,\n\nand ellipses omitted), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has\n\ninsisted on strict enforcement of the requirement that there be\n\n\"a certain identity between the action instituted and the action\n\ntolled,\"   Cintron v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, No. CE-88-761,\n\nslip op., translation, at 8 (P.R. Supreme Court Dec. 7, 1990)\n\n(citation omitted); see also Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 59 (1st          Cir. 1998) (applying Puerto\n\nRico law in deciding whether to toll as an extrajudicial claim\n\nthe limitations period for the filing of a 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\naction).      Even   substantial      overlap    between   the    putative\n\nextrajudicial claim and the subsequent lawsuit is not enough;\n\nrather,    there   must   be   a   \"'precise   and   specific'\"   identity\n\nbetween the two.      Ramos Baez v. Bossolo Lopez, 54 F. Supp.2d\n\n121, 125 (D. Puerto Rico 1999) (quoting              Jiminez v. District\n\nCourt, 65 P.R.R. 35, 42 (1945)); see also Fernandez v. Chardon,\n\n681 F.2d 42, 53 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n           Here, the identity between plaintiff's administrative\n\nappeal and this lawsuit is insufficiently precise and specific\n\nfor the appeal to constitute an extrajudical claim.                In the\n\nlawsuit, plaintiff has alleged that defendant Municipality,\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthrough the official acts of its agents, violated rights secured\n\nhim under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\nUnited States Constitution; Article II, §§ 1, 6, and 7 of the\n\nPuerto Rico Constitution; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and 1985; and\n\n31 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141 and 5142.                   In his appeal\n\nbefore the JASAP, however, plaintiff asserted only that he\n\nsuffered a discriminatory transfer and sundry other work related\n\npersecution \"in violation of the Merit Principle and . . .\n\ncurrent Personnel Regulations.\"             There is not even an indirect\n\nsuggestion,    for   example,    that    the      defendants   to    this   suit\n\ninvaded plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights or conspired to deny\n\nhim his equal protection rights within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1985(3), as plaintiff has alleged in his amended complaint.\n\n          Moreover,     in   this     lawsuit,       plaintiff      seeks   from\n\ndefendant Municipality, presumably under a theory of respondeat\n\nsuperior (as no unlawful municipal custom or policy is alleged),\n\n\"compensatory    damages,    damages        for   pain   and   suffering     and\n\nliquidated damages, which are estimated at $1,000,000,\" as well\n\nas   \"costs,    interests       and     attorney's       fees.\"        In    the\n\nadministrative appeal, however, plaintiff focused on equitable\n\nrelief, asking that his transfer be set aside and that an\n\nunspecified \"defendant\" be directed \"to cease and desist from\n\npersecuting and harassing him.\"               To be sure, plaintiff did\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\ffollow up this prayer for an injunction with a request for\n\ncompensation in the amount of $1,000,000 \"for suffering and\n\nmental anguish\" – a request that the JASAP clearly lacked the\n\nauthority    to    grant.      See    P.R.    Laws   Ann.     tit.   3,   §    1397\n\n(authorizing the JASAP only to issue orders of reinstatement and\n\nawarding    back     pay);     Cintron,       No.    CE-88-761,      slip      op.,\n\ntranslation, at 10.         But it is not at all clear that plaintiff\n\nexpected the Municipality to pay the compensatory damages, as\n\nthe text of the appeal complains almost exclusively about the\n\nconduct of Rivero-Albino.           In any event, the lack of precise and\n\nspecific    identity    between        the     claims   put     forth     in     the\n\nadministrative appeal and the relief sought in this lawsuit\n\nprecludes    recognition       of    the     administrative     appeal      as    an\n\nextrajudicial claim.         See, e.g., Benitez-Pons, 136 F.3d at 59-\n\n61.\n\n            In their brief, defendants invite us to hold that an\n\nappeal to the JASAP with a request for an ultra vires damages\n\naward will never constitute an extrajudicial claim sufficient to\n\ntoll the running of a limitations period in a civil rights\n\ndamages action.      But there is no need for us to rule so broadly,\n\nand we decline to do so.\n\n            Affirmed.       No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f",

In the lawsuit, plaintiff has alleged that defendant Municipality, through the official acts of its agents, violated rights secured him under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Article II, &#167;&#167; 1, 6, and 7 of the Puerto Rico Constitution; 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981, 1983, and 1985; and 31 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167;&#167; 5141 and 5142. In his appeal before the JASAP, however, plaintiff asserted only that he suffered a discriminatory transfer and sundry other work related persecution \"in violation of the Merit Principle and... current Personnel Regulations.\" There is not even an indirect suggestion, for example, that the defendants to this suit invaded plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights or conspired to deny him his equal protection rights within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985(3), as plaintiff has alleged in his amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in this lawsuit, plaintiff seeks from defendant Municipality, presumably under a theory of respondeat superior (as no unlawful municipal custom or policy is alleged), \"compensatory damages, damages for pain and suffering and liquidated damages, which are estimated at $1,000,000,\" as well as \"costs, interests and attorney's fees.\" In the administrative appeal, however, plaintiff focused on equitable relief, asking that his transfer be set aside and that an unspecified \"defendant\" be directed \"to cease and desist from persecuting and harassing him.\" To be sure, plaintiff did follow up this prayer for an injunction with a request for compensation in the amount of $1,000,000 \"for suffering and mental anguish\" - a request that the JASAP clearly lacked the authority to grant. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1397 (authorizing the JASAP only to issue orders of reinstatement and awarding back pay); Cintron, No. CE-88-761, slip op., translation, at 10. But it is not at all clear that plaintiff expected the Municipality to pay the compensatory damages, as the text of the appeal complains almost exclusively about the conduct of Rivero-Albino. In any event, the lack of precise and specific identity between the claims put forth in the administrative appeal and the relief sought in this lawsuit precludes recognition of the administrative appeal as an extra-judicial claim. See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197798\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Benitez-Pons,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197798/benitez-pons-v-the-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">59-61</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their brief, defendants invite us to hold that an appeal to the JASAP with a request for an ultra vires damages award will never constitute an extra-judicial claim sufficient to toll the running of a limitations period in a civil rights damages action. But there is no need for us to rule so broadly, and we decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
