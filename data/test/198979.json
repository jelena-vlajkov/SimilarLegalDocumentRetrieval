He urges\n\n that his claims are entirely different from those raised and\n\n rejected in prior cases.         The \"fundamental\" basis of his\n\n challenge, he explains, is that his due process right to\n\n obtain private counsel of his choice is violated by the\n\n suspension of these benefit payments.            He wishes to hire\n\n counsel to assist him in postconviction proceedings and in\n\n\n\n    1Effective April 7, 2000, an amendment enlarges the\ndisqualified class to include those who are confined on or after\nthe effective date pursuant to a conviction for \"a criminal\noffense.\" 42 U.S.C. § 402(x) (2000).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fcivil suits connected to his former business.      However,\n\nthere is no due process right to    government expenditures\n\nfor such a purpose.\n\n          We also apprehend no merit to plaintiff's other\n\nclaims, which he characterizes as raising similarly unique\n\ntheories under a myriad of other constitutional provisions,\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct.   There also was no prejudicial error in the district\n\ncourt's failure to rule on plaintiff's motion to amend the\n\ncomplaint by   adding claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 407(a), (b).\n\nThe proposed amendment did not state a claim upon which\n\nrelief could be granted.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -3-\n\f",
