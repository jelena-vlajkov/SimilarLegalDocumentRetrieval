Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n                   ORDER DENYING PANEL REHEARING\n                       Entered: July 28, 2000\n\n\n\n\n          In this order, we address the appellant's argument that\nour decision in Feliciano v. El Conquistador, 2000 WL 709928,\nNo. 99-1810 (1st Cir. June 6, 2000) (evaluating employment\ndiscrimination claim under Title VII), is contrary to the recent\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing\nProducts, Inc., 120 S. Ct. 2097 (2000) (evaluating claim under\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act).        In Reeves, the\n\fSupreme Court said it was resolving the conflict between the\nCourts of Appeals \"as to whether a plaintiff's prima facie case\nof discrimination . . ., combined with sufficient evidence for\na   reasonable    factfinder    to   reject    the   employer's\nnondiscriminatory explanation for its decision, is adequate to\nsustain liability for intentional discrimination.\" Id. at 2104.\nIn some circuits a plaintiff's evidence of a prima facie case\nand pretext, without more, was adequate to get to the jury on a\ndiscrimination claim; in others, there was a requirement that\nthe plaintiff produce additional evidence that the employer\nacted with discriminatory animus.     See id. at 2104-05.   The\nCourt placed the First Circuit in the latter group, see id.\n(citing   Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255 (1st\nCir. 1994)).\n\n          Although our prior use of the label, \"pretext plus,\"\nmay have resulted in a misunderstanding about the proof required\nto state a discrimination claim in this circuit, we have been\ncareful to explain that the phrase did not mean that the\nplaintiff always must present evidence beyond the proof of\npretext in order to establish discrimination. In both Woods and\nThomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., we emphatically said that this is\nnot the case. See Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 57\n(1st Cir. 1999) cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 1174 (2000) (\"Although\nit uses the label 'plus,' the First Circuit's 'pretext plus'\nstandard does not necessarily require the introduction of\nadditional    evidence    beyond   that    required   to    show\npretext.\")(internal quotation marks omitted); Woods, 30 F.3d\n255, at 260 n.3 (\"[S]ome cases exist where a prima facie case\nand the disbelief of a pretext could provide a strong enough\ninference of actual discrimination to permit the fact-finder to\nfind for the plaintiff.\").\n\n          Our precedents are consistent with Reeves, and our\napplication of those precedents in the case at hand was\nconsistent with Reeves.    We explained that Feliciano was not\nrequired to show any evidence in addition to her evidence of\npretext in order to get to the jury. Although we concluded that\nFeliciano's explanations of her job performance problems\ngenerated a triable issue of pretext, we found her evidence of\npretext “thin” (consisting primarily of her own explanations of\nwhy she was unable to perform her job adequately).         That\nevidence did not \"shed any light on what El Conquistador's true\nreason for firing her was, let alone show that the reason was\ndiscrimination based on Feliciano's Puerto Rican origin.\"\n\n\n                               2\n\f          Our approach was therefore consistent with Reeves,\nwhich makes clear that \"[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the\ntrier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated\nagainst the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\"\n120 S. Ct. at 2106. Although the Court emphasized that \"[p]roof\nthat the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is\nsimply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of\nintentional discrimination, . . . [and that] [i]n appropriate\ncircumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the\nfalsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to\ncover up a discriminatory purpose,\" it did not announce a rule\nthat a showing of pretext alone always precludes summary\njudgment in a case alleging intentional discrimination. To the\ncontrary, the Court emphasized that, \"Whether judgment as a\nmatter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend\non a number of factors.     Those include the strength of the\nplaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof\nthat the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence\nthat supports the employer's case and that properly may be\nconsidered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\" Id. at\n2109. Our conclusion that Feliciano failed to adduce sufficient\nevidence to survive summary judgment based on the particular\nweakness of her case, therefore, is entirely consistent with the\nSupreme Court's conclusion that the plaintiff in Reeves was\nentitled to have his claim heard by a jury.\n     The petition for panel rehearing is denied.\n\n                                   By the Court:\n                                   Phoebe Morse, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                    By: Janice M.
