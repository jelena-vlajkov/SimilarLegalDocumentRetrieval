This First Amendment case addresses\n\npolitical discrimination within a political party -- specifically,\n\nwhether direct support for members of a rival faction within a\n\npolitical party is sufficiently political to serve as the basis for a\n\npolitical discrimination claim. The appellant, Santa Padilla-García,\n\nworked for the municipality of Mayaguez until she was informed by the\n\nnew mayor and members of his administration (collectively \"the\n\nappellees\") that her contract would not be renewed. She alleges that\n\nthe decision not to renew her contract came about because she supported\n\nthe former mayor and his preferred successor and because she spoke out\n\nagainst the new administration. As a result, she claims that her First\n\nAmendment rights were violated because (1) the appellees discriminated\n\nagainst her on the basis of her political beliefs, and (2) they\n\ninfringed on her freedom of speech.\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment for the appellees\n\non both claims. The court concluded that the appellant failed to make\n\na prima facie case of political discrimination because her association\n\nwith the former mayor was personal, rather than political, in nature.\n\nSee Padilla-García v. Rodríguez, No. 94-1659, at 15 (D.P.R. Oct. 15,\n\n1998) (opinion and order granting summary judgment) [hereinafter\n\n\"Opinion\"]. Although the constitutionality of political patronage is\n\na complicated and controversial area of jurisprudence in which we\n\nnormally refrain from taking an expansive view, in this case, we\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fconstrue the Supreme Court's decisions that address political patronage\n\nto require a different result than that reached by the district court.\n\nBy establishing that she was a well-known supporter of the new mayor's\n\nrivals within the party and had actively campaigned against him in a\n\nhotly contested primary election, the appellant created a dispute of\n\nfact as to whether her relationship with the new mayor's factional\n\nopponents was a \"political\" association protected by the First\n\nAmendment.\n\n          Additionally, the district court erred when it dismissed the\n\nappellant's free speech claim because she could not show that her\n\nprotected expression was \"the 'substantial or motivating factor'\" in\n\nthe decision not to renew her contract. Opinion at 21. The proper\n\nstandard under Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977), is whether the protected conduct\n\nconstitutes a factor in the adverse employment decision.\n\n          Based on the facts of this case, viewed in a light most\n\nfavorable to the appellant, we must reverse the district court's\n\njudgment for the reasons discussed below.1\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n1 Because we reverse the district court's outright dismissal of\nPadilla-García's claims, we need not reach the issue of municipal\nliability under Monell v. Department of Social Services of New York,\n436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          The relevant facts are briefly summarized below in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff-appellant.        Padilla-García was\n\nappointed \"Chief of Planning\" for the Office of Economic and Community\n\nDevelopment (\"O.D.E.C.O.\") in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on June 25, 1991\n\nby then-Mayor Benjamín Cole. She signed a contract specifying that her\n\nemployment was effective from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992 and\n\nindicating that her contract was of fixed duration and would only be\n\nrenewed at the prerogative of the municipality. On July 3, 1992, her\n\nappointment was extended to June 30, 1993, subject to the availability\n\nof funds for the O.D.E.C.O. program.\n\n          In November 1992, José Guillermo Rodríguez was elected mayor.\n\nAlthough Cole and Rodríguez are both members of the Popular Democratic\n\nParty (\"PDP\"), Cole represents a different faction than that of\n\nRodríguez. Padilla-García was commonly associated with Mayor Cole and\n\nhis administration and well known for participating in the primary\n\ncampaign against Mayor Rodríguez. Nevertheless, Padilla-García was\n\nappointed to be a member of the transition committee, during which time\n\nshe experienced several incidents of humiliation and harassment which\n\nshe attributes to her role in the previous administration. She also\n\nhad a running conflict with the new administration regarding compliance\n\nwith rules and regulations.\n\n          On May 27, 1993, Padilla-García was informed that her\n\nemployment with the city would not be renewed because her duties would\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbe subsumed by the new Municipal Planning Office. She brought this\n\nsuit on May 13, 1994 against the Municipality of Mayaguez and José\n\nGuillermo Rodríguez, Reinaldo Torres, Edgardo Lugo, and Luis Rodríguez-\n\nFernández, in their individual and official capacities, under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.   She alleged a violation of the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, unconstitutional discrimination based on her\n\npolitical beliefs, and an impermissible infringement on her freedom of\n\nspeech. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the\n\ndefendants on October 15, 1998. Padilla-García appeals from summary\n\njudgment on her First Amendment claims only.\n\nII.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           Summary judgment is only appropriate if there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We review the\n\ndistrict court's summary judgment de novo, \"viewing 'the entire record\n\nin the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment,\n\nindulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.'\"\n\nEuromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (quoting Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)); see also Morris v. Government Dev. Bank, 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\nIII.    POLITICAL DISCRIMINATION\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          It is now well established that political patronage restrains\n\nfreedom of belief and association, core activities protected by the\n\nFirst Amendment. See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 354 (1976). In a\n\ntrilogy of cases, Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. at 354; Branti v. Finkel,\n\n445 U.S. 507, 516 (1980); and Rutan v. Republican Party, 497 U.S. 62,\n\n75 (1990), the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of\n\npolitical patronage and collectively held that non-policymaking2 public\n\nemployees are protected from adverse employment decisions based on\n\ntheir political affiliation.     Justice Brennan's opinion in Elrod\n\nemphasized the right to associate with the political party of one's\n\nchoice as a basic constitutional freedom. See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 356.\n\nThis right flows naturally from the principle that \"'debate on public\n\nissues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.'\" Id. at 357\n\n(quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964)).\n\n          In Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v.\n\nDoyle, the Court established a two-part burden-shifting analysis for\n\nevaluating free speech claims, which has also been applied in the\n\n\n\n2 The Court acknowledged that policymaking and confidential employees\nmight justifiably be dismissed on the basis of their political views if\nthe government employer can show that it is \"'an appropriate\nrequirement for the effective performance of the public office\ninvolved.'\" Rutan, 497 U.S. at 70 n.5 (quoting Branti, 445 U.S. at\n518). The appellees in this case do not allege that Padilla-García was\nin a policymaking position or one that would require confidentiality.\nInstead they argue that her non-renewal was not based on her political\nviews.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fpolitical discrimination context. See Rodríguez-Ríos v. Cordero, 138\n\nF.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1998); Acevedo-Díaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).     First, the plaintiff must show that she engaged in\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct, and that this conduct was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment decision.\n\nIf she does so, then the defendant is given the opportunity to\n\nestablish that it would have taken the same action regardless of the\n\nplaintiff's political beliefs – commonly referred to as the Mt. Healthy\n\ndefense.   See 429 U.S. at 287.\n\n           A.   Appellant's Prima Facie Case\n\n           The plaintiff's burden under Mt. Healthy goes directly to\n\ncausation. To prevail she must point to evidence in the record that\n\nwould \"permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the challenged\n\npersonnel action occurred and stemmed from a politically based\n\ndiscriminatory animus.\" Rivera-Cotto v. Rivera, 38 F.3d 611, 614 (1st\n\nCir. 1994); see also Rodríguez-Ríos, 138 F.3d at 24; Vázquez v. López-\n\nRosario, 134 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 1998). This showing requires more\n\nthan merely \"juxtaposing a protected characteristic – someone else's\n\npolitics – with the fact that plaintiff was treated unfairly.\" Correa-\n\nMartínez v. Arrillaga-Beléndez, 903 F.2d 49, 58 (1st Cir. 1990); see,\n\ne.g., Rodríguez-Ríos, 138 F.3d at 24 (evidence demonstrating that\n\ndefendants were politically active and were aware of plaintiff's\n\nopposing views).\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          Thus, there are two components to Padilla-García's prima\n\nfacie case:   1) that an affiliation with Mayor Cole and the rival\n\nprimary candidate was a motivating factor for her non-renewal, and 2)\n\nthat the affiliation was political. The district court granted summary\n\njudgment for the appellees on the political discrimination claim\n\nbecause it determined that the appellant's affiliation was not\n\npolitical. The court concluded that \"[w]hile it is probable that\n\nPadilla has made a showing that she suffered discrimination in the form\n\nof the municipality's failure to rehire her,\" Opinion at 15, she had\n\nnot shown that the decision \"was premised on politics and not simply\n\nher      personal          associations,\"            id.         at    17.\n\n          The appellant argues that the district court construed the\n\nterm   \"political\"   too   narrowly    in   the   context   of    political\n\ndiscrimination. For the reasons discussed more fully below, we agree.\n\n              1.   Substantial or Motivating Factor\n\n          First, we must address appellees' challenge to the\n\nsufficiency of the appellant's evidence establishing a causal link\n\nbetween her non-renewal3 and her affiliations with Mayor Cole and the\n\nother primary candidate. After reviewing the record, we agree with the\n\n\n3  It is settled law that the Elrod-Branti doctrine extends to a\npolitically motivated non-renewal of a term of employment, regardless\nof the transitory nature of the position. See Nieves-Villanueva v.\nSoto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 94 n.3, 98 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing Cheveras\nPacheco v. Rivera-González, 809 F.2d 125 (1st Cir. 1987)); Figueroa v.\nAponte-Roque, 864 F.2d 947, 951 (1st Cir. 1989) (citing same).\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdistrict court that a factfinder could reasonably infer from the\n\nevidence that Padilla-García's affiliation with another faction within\n\nPDP was a \"significant\" or \"motivating\" factor in her non-renewal.\n\n          It was well known that Padilla-García was tied to the Cole\n\nadministration and that she had campaigned in the primary election\n\nagainst Mayor Rodríguez. Moreover, the record shows that \"the primary\n\nelection left serious conflict between the two defined groups within\n\nthe same political party.\" Opinion at 4. This circumstantial evidence\n\nthat the appellant was a \"conspicuous target[]\" could alone create an\n\nissue of fact on discriminatory animus. See Acevedo-Díaz, 1 F.3d at 69\n\n(recognizing that highly charged political atmosphere \"coupled with\n\nfact that plaintiffs and defendants are of competing political\n\npersuasions\" may be probative of discriminatory animus). However, it\n\nis further supported by the testimony of the appellant and witnesses\n\nNorma I. Soler-Echandy, Pedro Bisbal-Ramos, and Sixto Negrón-Hernández,\n\nwhich reveal that from the beginning Padilla-García was targeted for\n\nhumiliation and harassment by the appellees because Mayor Rodríguez\n\nperceived her as a political threat.4\n\n\n\n4 Because we limit our review to the record as it stood before the\ndistrict court at the time of its ruling, see J. Geils Band Employee\nBenefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1250 (1st\nCir. 1996) (citing Voutour v. Vitale, 761 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir.\n1985)), we will not consider the declaration of Padilla-García\nsubmitted to the district court as part of the Motion for\nReconsideration.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f             2.   Political Nature\n\n          The appellant proffers two constitutionally protected\n\nassociations that served as sources for the alleged political\n\ndiscrimination: (1) Padilla-García's affiliation with former Mayor\n\nCole and his administration, and (2) her support for Mayor Rodríguez's\n\nopponent in the primary election.       The appellees argue that the\n\nevidence clearly establishes that her affiliations had nothing to do\n\nwith politics, and the appellant concedes that there is no direct\n\nevidence in the record that differing political philosophies was her\n\nmotivation for supporting members of the rival PDP faction. However,\n\nas the appellant suggests, Padilla-García's relationships with Mayor\n\nCole and his preferred successor are so suggestive of political\n\nconnotations that they inherently create an issue of fact as to whether\n\nthey are protected by the First Amendment.5 In a different context,\n\nmerely producing evidence of affiliation with a political faction might\n\nnot be sufficient to withstand summary judgment; however, the record\n\nhere shows that Padilla-García was not just affiliated with the rival\n\nfaction -- she was clearly identified as a close ally of the former\n\n\n\n5 We recognize that Padilla-García's relationship with the Cole\nadministration may be more susceptible to attack as a personal\naffiliation than her role in the primary election. However, because\nboth activities are intimately related to the factions within the PDP,\nwhich implicate the same core concern of expression of political\nbeliefs, we do not find it necessary to separate the analysis into two\ndistinct questions for summary judgment.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fmayor and actively campaigned against the new mayor. Support for a\n\npolitical candidate -- whether as an official in his administration or\n\na behind-the-scenes member of his campaign -- is an example of an\n\nassociation that inevitably implicates the \"right 'to engage in\n\nassociation for the advancement of beliefs and ideas.'\"        Correa-\n\nMartínez, 903 F.2d at 57 (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 429-30\n\n(1963)). Padilla-García's reason for the association – her motivation\n\nfor supporting Mayor Cole and the primary candidate – is purely a\n\nquestion of fact for the jury.\n\n          Nor is the association's constitutionally protected status\n\naltered by the fact that Mayor Rodríguez is a member of the same party\n\nas the candidates that Padilla-García chose to support.        Clearly\n\nfactions within one party can represent different political\n\nphilosophies. Thus, the underlying principle, freedom to express\n\npolitical beliefs, is very much still at stake. In a case such as this\n\none, where there is a heated battle during the primary, the risk of\n\nretaliation against an employee who supported the opposition is just as\n\nhigh as in any other election.6\n\n\n6  This is not an entirely new understanding of the Elrod-Branti\ndoctrine.    See Vázquez, 134 F.3d at 32 (applying political\ndiscrimination analysis to facts arising from primary election); LaRou\nv. Ridlon, 98 F.3d 659, 661-62 (1st Cir. 1996) (same); Rodríguez-\nRodríguez v. Muñoz Muñoz, 808 F.2d 138, 140-43 (1st Cir. 1986)\n(considering applicability to intra-party conflicts). And this view is\nshared by other courts that have considered the patronage doctrine in\nthe context of primary elections. See Robertson v. Fiore, 62 F.3d 596,\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          Finally, we see no discrepancy between our conclusion today\n\nand our decisions that place the burden of proof on the plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate that her association was political and not personal. See\n\n903 F.2d at 56-58. In Correa-Martínez, there was nothing inherently\n\npolitical about the plaintiff's relationship with the former\n\nadministrative judge, and the complaint\n\n          contained no facts regarding the political\n          contours, if any, of Correa's relationship with\n          Judge Padilla. It contained no facts capable of\n          supporting an inference that the relationship\n          came within the constitutional orbit. It did not\n          maintain that defendants knew anything about\n          plaintiff's politics or that their motivation\n          related in the slightest to plaintiff's exercise\n          of any first amendment or other constitutionally\n          protected right.\n\n\n600 (3d Cir. 1995) (\"The danger that employees will abandon the\nexpression or exercise of their political beliefs to appease their\nsupervisors is not diminished because a supervisor supports a different\nidentifiable faction within a party as compared to a different party\naltogether.\"); Tomczak v. City of Chicago, 765 F.2d 633, 640 (7th Cir.\n1985) (\"[Branti's] reasoning applies with equal force to patronage\ndismissals when one faction of a party replaces another faction of the\nsame party, especially in election districts where a primary victory\nwithin the dominant party virtually assures victory in the subsequent\ngeneral election.\" (citation omitted)); Barnes v. Bosley, 745 F.2d 501,\n506 & n.2 (8th Cir. 1984) (agreeing with district court that political\nmotives prompted dismissal even though members of same party); McBee v.\nJim Hogg County, 703 F.2d 834, 838 n.1 (5th Cir. 1983) (concluding that\nElrod-Branti rationale applies when employment decisions are based upon\nsupport and loyalty to individual politician as well as a political\nparty because Supreme Court's disapproval of political patronage\nextends beyond \"opposing political party situations\"); see also Joyner\nv. Lancaster, 553 F. Supp. 809, 817-18 (M.D.N.C. 1982) (applying\npolitical discrimination analysis to case involving fallout from\nprimary election); Ecker v. Cohalan, 542 F. Supp. 896, 898-901\n(E.D.N.Y. 1982) (same).\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fId. at 57-58 (footnote omitted). Likewise, in LaRou v. Ridlon, the\n\nevidence was indisputable that the plaintiff's relationship with\n\nSergeant Muse was not political at the point of his termination – LaRou\n\nadmitted that he was not even aware that Muse intended to run against\n\nSheriff Ridlon for the Democratic nomination for sheriff. See LaRou,\n\n98 F.3d at 660, 662.      In contrast, Padilla-García's targeted\n\nassociation – with another faction within the same political party,\n\nwith a former administration, and with a political opponent's campaign\n\n– has on its face everything to do with politics.7\n\n          Vázquez v. López-Rosario raises a related yet significantly\n\ndifferent issue. See 134 F.3d at 36. The question before us there was\n\nnot whether Vázquez's affiliation with the rival primary candidate was\n\npolitical, but rather whether he had introduced sufficient evidence\n\nthat the affiliation was a motivating factor in his termination -- the\n\nother element of the plaintiff's prima facie case.        See id.   We\n\ndetermined that he was missing the causal link between his political\n\naffiliation and the adverse employment action; his \"'unsupported and\n\nspeculative assertions regarding political discrimination'\" were\n\n\n\n\n7  We note that the complaint states that she \"was not related to\npartisan politics,\" Complaint ¶ 6, but drawing all inferences in favor\nof the nonmovant, she may have been referring to her work history as a\nnon-elected administrative employee, her recent introduction to Puerto\nRico politics, and her lack of party membership.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\finsufficient to survive summary judgment. Id. (quoting LaRou, 98 F.3d\n\nat 661).\n\n            As we discussed above, we agree with the district court that\n\nPadilla-García has met this threshold by establishing a direct causal\n\nlink between her association with, and campaign for, a rival faction of\n\nthe PDP and her non-renewal.     See Rodríguez-Ríos, 138 F.3d at 24\n\n(citing Acevedo-Díaz, 1 F.3d at 69). While it is possible that her\n\nrelationships may not ultimately prove to have been based on political\n\nideas and beliefs, the appellant has made a prima facie case, and the\n\nappellees are free to dispute her allegations at trial.\n\n            B.   Appellees' Mt. Healthy Defense\n\n            The appellees argue that we can still affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment on the alternative ground that they\n\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence that they would have\n\ntaken the same action regardless of the appellant's political\n\naffiliation because they were reorganizing her department.          See\n\nRodríguez-Ríos, 138 F.3d at 24; Acevedo-Díaz, 1 F.3d at 66.         The\n\nreorganization included the creation of a new Municipal Planning Office\n\n– one of Mayor Rodríguez's campaign goals – that incorporated the\n\nduties performed by Padilla-García as Chief of Planning in the Housing\n\nDepartment.\n\n            In a political discrimination case, the plaintiff may\n\ndiscredit     the   proffered   nondiscriminatory     reason,   either\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fcircumstantially or directly, by adducing evidence that discrimination\n\nwas more likely than not a motivating factor. See Rodríguez-Ríos, 138\n\nF.3d at 26; Acevedo-Díaz, 122 F.3d at 69; see also Stephens v.\n\nKerrigan, 122 F.3d 171, 181 (3d Cir. 1997). In this way, the burden-\n\nshifting mechanism is significantly different from the device used in\n\nother employment discrimination contexts, such as Title VII cases,\n\nwhere a plaintiff is required to come forward with affirmative evidence\n\nthat the defendant's nondiscriminatory reason is pretextual.8 See\n\nAcevedo-Díaz, 1 F.3d at 67; see also Stephens, 122 F.3d at 176\n\n(explaining the distinction between political discrimination and Title\n\nVII employment discrimination). In a political discrimination case,\n\nthe defendant bears the burden of persuading the factfinder that its\n\nreason is credible. The evidence by which the plaintiff established\n\nher prima facie case may suffice for a factfinder to infer that the\n\ndefendant's reason is pretextual and to effectively check summary\n\n\n8 Under Title VII, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\nof discrimination, only a limited burden of production passes to the\nemployer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its\nactions. See Acevedo-Díaz, 1 F.3d at 67. The employer under Title VII\nneed not submit sufficient evidence to persuade the factfinder because\nthe plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion at all times. See id.\n(citing Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254\n(1981)). In contrast, under the Mt. Healthy analysis for political\ndiscrimination, the burden of persuasion passes to the defendant-\nemployer once the plaintiff produces sufficient evidence of her prima\nfacie case. See id. In other words, \"the plaintiff-employee will\nprevail unless the fact finder concludes that the defendant has\nproduced enough evidence to establish that the plaintiff's dismissal\nwould have occurred in any event for nondiscriminatory reasons.\"          Id.\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fjudgment. See Rodríguez-Ríos, 138 F.3d at 26 (\"Where the elements of\n\na sufficient prima facie case combine with the factfinder's belief that\n\nthe ostensible basis for [demoting an] employee was pretextual, . . .\n\nthe factfinder is permitted to infer . . . intentional [political]\n\ndiscrimination . . . .\" (quoting Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d\n\n1087, 1092 (1st Cir. 1995))); Acevedo-Díaz, 1 F.3d at 69-70\n\n(considering circumstantial evidence that some plaintiffs were\n\n\"conspicuous targets\" for political discrimination as sufficient\n\nevidence of pretext).\n\n          Although it is clear that the municipal restructuring was a\n\ncampaign promise, and thus was not entirely concocted to explain\n\nPadilla-García's employment non-renewal, there is not enough\n\ninformation in the record about the restructuring to foreclose the\n\npossibility that it was in fact used as a discriminatory tool for the\n\nnon-renewal. For instance, the record to which appellees point does\n\nnot show that others in municipal government were also terminated as a\n\nresult of the restructuring. With nothing more from the appellees than\n\nthe mere averment that the appellant's position was eliminated due to\n\nthe reorganization, we remain unconvinced that they are entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the Mt. Healthy defense. Although\n\nwe are not bound by the district court's determination, we are in\n\nagreement that the appellees' argument is not \"particularly\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fpersuasive,\" especially in light of the counter-evidence suggesting\n\nthat politics played a role in the non-renewal.\n\nIV.   FREEDOM OF SPEECH\n\n           We now turn to Padilla-García's allegation that the non-\n\nrenewal of her position was based on her outspoken criticism of the\n\nRodríguez administration for the unlawful activity of its officers.\n\nOne confrontation related to appellee Torres' use of a government\n\nvehicle for personal needs. On another occasion the appellant spoke\n\nout against the appellees' practice of violating regulations by not\n\npublicly announcing new projects developed by the municipality and\n\ntheir respective budget allotments. She expressed her belief that this\n\nwas a deliberate effort on the part of Mayor Rodríguez to avoid public\n\ncomment.   For purposes of summary judgment, the appellees do not\n\ndispute that the appellant often expressed her belief that the\n\nadministration was not acting in accordance with the law.\n\n           The district court properly employed a three-part test to\n\nevaluate the appellant's First Amendment free speech claim: 1) whether\n\nshe was speaking on matters of public concern; 2) whether her and the\n\npublic's interest in free discourse on those matters outweighed the\n\ncountervailing governmental interest in promoting efficient performance\n\nof public service; and 3) whether her protected expression was a\n\nmotivating or substantial factor in the mayor's decision not to renew\n\nher contract. See Tang v. Rhode Island Dep't of Elderly Affairs, 163\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fF.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391\n\nU.S. 563, 568 (1968)); O'Connor v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 912 (1st Cir.\n\n1993). Again, the appellees have the opportunity to make a Mt. Healthy\n\ndefense. See O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 912 (citing Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S.\n\nat 287).\n\n           The court concluded that the plaintiff could satisfy the\n\nfirst two prongs, but granted summary judgment because she could not\n\nestablish a causal link between her protected speech and her non-\n\nrenewal. As the court was adequately convinced that her non-renewal\n\nwas based on her close association with Mayor Rodríguez's political\n\nopponents, it reasoned that \"Padilla's protected speech was not the\n\nmotivating factor behind her non-renewal.\" Opinion at 21 (emphasis\n\nadded). Because the district court erred in applying the third prong,\n\nwe reverse.\n\n           The plaintiff is only required to show that her \"protected\n\nexpression was a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse\n\nemployment action.\" Tang, 163 F.3d at 12. The fact that her political\n\naffiliations may also have been a factor does not preclude the\n\npossibility that her repeated criticism of the administration also\n\ncontributed to her non-renewal. The appellant has submitted sufficient\n\nevidence to create a dispute of fact as to whether her interactions\n\nwith the appellees over personal use of government vehicles and\n\npublication of project proposals resulted in discriminatory treatment\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fand eventually the elimination of her position. And as we discussed\n\nabove, we are not persuaded by the appellees' claim that Padilla-\n\nGarcía's non-renewal was the inevitable result of governmental\n\nreorganization.\n\n           Relying on Flynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 403 (1998), the appellees additionally argue\n\nthat we should affirm on the alternate ground that Padilla-García's\n\nexpression was not a matter of public concern but consisted merely of\n\nstatements made \"as part of the duties of her position as a policy\n\nlevel official who disagreed with her superiors on a number of issues.\"\n\nBrief for Appellees José Guillermo Rodríguez, Reinaldo Torres, and\n\nEdgardo Lugo, at 15 (citing Flynn, 140 F.3d at 46).      However, the\n\nappellees misread Flynn.\n\n           In Flynn, we assumed that the plaintiff's statements were\n\nmatters of public concern. See Flynn, 140 F.3d at 46-47. Accordingly,\n\nour decision turned on the second prong of the test. We held that\n\nFlynn's interest in free speech, and the public's, were outweighed by\n\nthe government's interest in promoting efficiency of its services,\n\nspecifically \"the effect of the statements on those 'close working\n\nrelationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary.\n\n. . .'\"   Id. at 47 (quoting Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 388\n\n(1987)). Our holding was explicitly limited to policymakers – which in\n\nFlynn's case were highly placed members of the mayor's administration\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f– who were also \"subject to discharge for political reasons under the\n\nElrod and Branti cases.\"     Id.\n\n          Here, it is fatal to the appellees' position that they did\n\nnot argue before the district court that Padilla-García's political\n\ndiscrimination claim should fail because she was a policymaking or\n\nconfidential official subject to termination for her political views\n\nunder the Elrod/Branti exception. See supra note 1. Consequently,\n\nthey cannot now claim that a conflict with her in the policymaking\n\narena impairs their administration. See Flynn, 140 F.3d at 47 (\"[T]he\n\nsituation would be different if a clerical worker, in a non-disruptive\n\nand otherwise proper manner, disagreed about how the agency was doing\n\nits job. If the employee were not at a policy level, it might be hard\n\nto see why such criticism would be pertinent to retention.\").\n\n          From our independent examination of the content, form, and\n\ncontext of Padilla-García's speech, see Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48;\n\nTang, 163 F.3d at 12; O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 914, we infer for purposes\n\nof summary judgment that she spoke on a matter of public concern, as\n\nopposed to a matter of personal interest.      As the district court\n\nrecognized, \"Padilla's revelations seem to implicate a topic of\n\ninherent concern to the community and her comments appear to have had\n\na direct bearing on the legality of the municipality's administration\n\nof federally funded programs.\" Opinion at 19; see O'Connor, 994 F.2d\n\nat 915 (viewing official misconduct as topic of inherent concern to the\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fcommunity).    Padilla-García's comments relating to regulatory\n\ncompliance are easily distinguishable from self-serving statements that\n\npromote a personal interest. See Connick, 461 U.S. at 141, 147-48;\n\nTang, 163 F.3d at 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           Our opinion today does not expand upon the First Amendment\n\nprotection afforded to government employees that are targeted by a new\n\npolitical administration.     Supporting a political party is an\n\ninherently political activity. It is only a logical application of Mt.\n\nHealthy that once Padilla-García adduced sufficient facts from which\n\none could infer that her close ties to a faction within the PDP was a\n\nfactor in the non-renewal of her contract, she created a trialworthy\n\nissue of whether she engaged in constitutionally protected conduct.\n\nBecause we cannot conclude that her position would nevertheless have\n\nbeen eliminated based on the reorganization of the municipal\n\ngovernment, we have no choice but to reverse summary judgment. For\n\nsimilar reasons, we are unable to determine that the appellant's\n\npolitical speech was not a motivating factor in her non-renewal.\n\n           Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f",

This First Amendment case addresses\n\npolitical discrimination within a political party -- specifically,\n\nwhether direct support for members of a rival faction within a\n\npolitical party is sufficiently political to serve as the basis for a\n\npolitical discrimination claim. The appellant, Santa Padilla-García,\n\nworked for the municipality of Mayaguez until she was informed by the\n\nnew mayor and members of his administration (collectively \"the\n\nappellees\") that her contract would not be renewed. She alleges that\n\nthe decision not to renew her contract came about because she supported\n\nthe former mayor and his preferred successor and because she spoke out\n\nagainst the new administration. As a result, she claims that her First\n\nAmendment rights were violated because (1) the appellees discriminated\n\nagainst her on the basis of her political beliefs, and (2) they\n\ninfringed on her freedom of speech.\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment for the appellees\n\non both claims. The court concluded that the appellant failed to make\n\na prima facie case of political discrimination because her association\n\nwith the former mayor was personal, rather than political, in nature.\n\nSee Padilla-García v. Rodríguez, No. 94-1659, at 15 (D.P.R. Oct. 15,\n\n1998) (opinion and order granting summary judgment) [hereinafter\n\n\"Opinion\"]. Although the constitutionality of political patronage is\n\na complicated and controversial area of jurisprudence in which we\n\nnormally refrain from taking an expansive view, in this case, we\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fconstrue the Supreme Court's decisions that address political patronage\n\nto require a different result than that reached by the district court.\n\nBy establishing that she was a well-known supporter of the new mayor's\n\nrivals within the party and had actively campaigned against him in a\n\nhotly contested primary election, the appellant created a dispute of\n\nfact as to whether her relationship with the new mayor's factional\n\nopponents was a \"political\" association protected by the First\n\nAmendment.\n\n          Additionally, the district court erred when it dismissed the\n\nappellant's free speech claim because she could not show that her\n\nprotected expression was \"the 'substantial or motivating factor'\" in\n\nthe decision not to renew her contract.

BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n1 Because we reverse the district court's outright dismissal of\nPadilla-García's claims, we need not reach the issue of municipal\nliability under Monell v. Department of Social Services of New York,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (1978).\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          The relevant facts are briefly summarized below in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff-appellant.        Padilla-García was\n\nappointed \"Chief of Planning\" for the Office of Economic and Community\n\nDevelopment (\"O.D.E.C.O.\") in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on June 25, 1991\n\nby then-Mayor Benjamín Cole. She signed a contract specifying that her\n\nemployment was effective from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992 and\n\nindicating that her contract was of fixed duration and would only be\n\nrenewed at the prerogative of the municipality. On July 3, 1992, her\n\nappointment was extended to June 30, 1993, subject to the availability\n\nof funds for the O.D.E.C.O. program.\n\n          In November 1992, José Guillermo Rodríguez was elected mayor.\n\nAlthough Cole and Rodríguez are both members of the Popular Democratic\n\nParty (\"PDP\"), Cole represents a different faction than that of\n\nRodríguez. Padilla-García was commonly associated with Mayor Cole and\n\nhis administration and well known for participating in the primary\n\ncampaign against Mayor Rodríguez. Nevertheless, Padilla-García was\n\nappointed to be a member of the transition committee, during which time\n\nshe experienced several incidents of humiliation and harassment which\n\nshe attributes to her role in the previous administration. She also\n\nhad a running conflict with the new administration regarding compliance\n\nwith rules and regulations.\n\n          On May 27, 1993, Padilla-García was informed that her\n\nemployment with the city would not be renewed because her duties would\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbe subsumed by the new Municipal Planning Office. She brought this\n\nsuit on May 13, 1994 against the Municipality of Mayaguez and José\n\nGuillermo Rodríguez, Reinaldo Torres, Edgardo Lugo, and Luis Rodríguez-\n\nFernández, in their individual and official capacities, under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.   She alleged a violation of the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, unconstitutional discrimination based on her\n\npolitical beliefs, and an impermissible infringement on her freedom of\n\nspeech. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the\n\ndefendants on October 15, 1998. Padilla-García appeals from summary\n\njudgment on her First Amendment claims only.\n\nII.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           Summary judgment is only appropriate if there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We review the\n\ndistrict court's summary judgment de novo, \"viewing 'the entire record\n\nin the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment,\n\nindulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.'\"\n\nEuromotion, Inc. v.

Political Nature\n\n          The appellant proffers two constitutionally protected\n\nassociations that served as sources for the alleged political\n\ndiscrimination: (1) Padilla-García's affiliation with former Mayor\n\nCole and his administration, and (2) her support for Mayor Rodríguez's\n\nopponent in the primary election.       The appellees argue that the\n\nevidence clearly establishes that her affiliations had nothing to do\n\nwith politics, and the appellant concedes that there is no direct\n\nevidence in the record that differing political philosophies was her\n\nmotivation for supporting members of the rival PDP faction. However,\n\nas the appellant suggests, Padilla-García's relationships with Mayor\n\nCole and his preferred successor are so suggestive of political\n\nconnotations that they inherently create an issue of fact as to whether\n\nthey are protected by the First Amendment.5 In a different context,\n\nmerely producing evidence of affiliation with a political faction might\n\nnot be sufficient to withstand summary judgment; however, the record\n\nhere shows that Padilla-García was not just affiliated with the rival\n\nfaction -- she was clearly identified as a close ally of the former\n\n\n\n5 We recognize that Padilla-García's relationship with the Cole\nadministration may be more susceptible to attack as a personal\naffiliation than her role in the primary election. However, because\nboth activities are intimately related to the factions within the PDP,\nwhich implicate the same core concern of expression of political\nbeliefs, we do not find it necessary to separate the analysis into two\ndistinct questions for summary judgment.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fmayor and actively campaigned against the new mayor. Support for a\n\npolitical candidate -- whether as an official in his administration or\n\na behind-the-scenes member of his campaign -- is an example of an\n\nassociation that inevitably implicates the \"right 'to engage in\n\nassociation for the advancement of beliefs and ideas.'\"        Correa-\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Martínez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">57</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(quoting NAACP v.

For instance, the record to which appellees point does\n\nnot show that others in municipal government were also terminated as a\n\nresult of the restructuring. With nothing more from the appellees than\n\nthe mere averment that the appellant's position was eliminated due to\n\nthe reorganization, we remain unconvinced that they are entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the Mt.

FREEDOM OF SPEECH\n\n           We now turn to Padilla-García's allegation that the non-\n\nrenewal of her position was based on her outspoken criticism of the\n\nRodríguez administration for the unlawful activity of its officers.\n\nOne confrontation related to appellee Torres' use of a government\n\nvehicle for personal needs. On another occasion the appellant spoke\n\nout against the appellees' practice of violating regulations by not\n\npublicly announcing new projects developed by the municipality and\n\ntheir respective budget allotments. She expressed her belief that this\n\nwas a deliberate effort on the part of Mayor Rodríguez to avoid public\n\ncomment.   For purposes of summary judgment, the appellees do not\n\ndispute that the appellant often expressed her belief that the\n\nadministration was not acting in accordance with the law.\n\n           The district court properly employed a three-part test to\n\nevaluate the appellant's First Amendment free speech claim: 1) whether\n\nshe was speaking on matters of public concern; 2) whether her and the\n\npublic's interest in free discourse on those matters outweighed the\n\ncountervailing governmental interest in promoting efficient performance\n\nof public service; and 3) whether her protected expression was a\n\nmotivating or substantial factor in the mayor's decision not to renew\n\nher contract.
