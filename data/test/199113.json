Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n                  Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas E. Clinton, with whom Clinton & Muzyka, P.C. were on brief\nfor appellant.\n\n     Michael B. Latti, with whom Carolyn M. Latti and Latti Associates\nLLP, were on brief for appellee.\n\fOctober 6, 2000\n\f          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge. The plaintiff-appellee, George\n\nDiefenbach, brought this action pursuant to the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.\n\napp. § 688 (1994) against his employer, defendant-appellant Sheridan\n\nTransportation, seeking damages for personal injuries sustained in the\n\ncourse of employment as a boatswain onboard the ITB JACKSONVILLE. The\n\nfirst trial ended in a mistrial. The second trial resulted in a jury\n\nverdict of $900,000.00 in favor of the plaintiff. The district court\n\ndenied the defendant's motions for a new trial and remittitur, and this\n\nappeal followed. Finding that the district court correctly decided the\n\nmotions, we affirm.\n\nI.   Facts.\n\n          We briefly describe the facts here, but discuss them in\n\ngreater detail where applicable and necessary for our discussion. The\n\nplaintiff worked as a boatswain on the ITB1 JACKSONVILLE, a vessel\n\noperated by the defendant. On July 8, 1997, the plaintiff injured his\n\nback while hauling in the spring line and pennant during the undocking\n\nof the vessel. He brought suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Massachusetts pursuant to the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. §\n\n688, for damages resulting from the alleged negligence of the\n\ndefendant. The plaintiff alleged negligence, unseaworthiness, and\n\nmaintenance and cure in his complaint. During the first trial, which\n\n\n\n1    An ITB is an integrated tug and barge. It is over 700 feet long\nand has a tugboat attached to the back of the barge.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fended    in   a   mistrial,   the   plaintiff   waived   the   counts   for\n\nunseaworthiness and maintenance and cure. The second trial concluded\n\nwith a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of\n\n$900,000.00.\n\n              The defendant moved for a new trial on the grounds that the\n\ndistrict court improperly instructed the jury, improperly admitted the\n\nplaintiff's maritime expert's opinion and allowed a verdict which was\n\n“excessive and not supported by the evidence as presented at trial.”\n\nThe defendant also moved for remittitur. Both of defendant's motions\n\nwere denied by the district court and the defendant appeals to this\n\ncourt.\n\nII.     Motion for a new trial.\n\n              We review the district court's denial of a motion for a new\n\ntrial only for manifest abuse of discretion. See United States v.\n\nDumas, 207 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2000). The same standard of review is\n\napplied to the admissibility of expert testimony. See Palmacci v.\n\nUmpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 792 (1st Cir. 1997). The defendant submits\n\nthat the opinions of the plaintiff's expert, Captain George Albert\n\nSadler, should not have been allowed because “[h]e lacked the specific\n\nknowledge, training and experience to assist the trier of fact in\n\ndetermining the validity of the [plaintiff's] claims.”\n\n              The defendant concedes that expert testimony was necessary\n\nto assist the trier of fact because this case involved docking and\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fundocking procedures for, and equipment used on, a complex vessel –\n\nsubjects beyond the scope of common knowledge. The defendant submits,\n\nhowever, that “Captain Sadler's qualifications and opinions lacked\n\nDaubert [v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)] reliability\n\nand that the [t]rial [j]udge committed meaningful error in judgment\n\nallowing Captain Sadler to proffer his opinions.”\n\n            We need not address whether Captain Sadler's qualifications\n\nand opinions lacked Daubert reliability because this specific objection\n\nhas been waived. A timely objection must be made “stating the specific\n\nground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the\n\ncontext.”     Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1) (emphasis added).       We have\n\npreviously held that a Daubert objection must be made at trial and\n\ncannot be made for the first time on appeal. See United States v.\n\nGilbert, 181 F.3d 152, 162-63 (1st Cir. 1999); Cortes-Irizarry v.\n\nCorporacion Insular de Seguros, 111 F.3d 184, 188-89 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            As in Gilbert, “[n]o suggestion was made by [the defendant\n\nhere] that the Daubert principles should be applied to [Sadler's]\n\ntestimony. Our rule is that an objection not made in the trial court\n\nwill not be considered in the first instance on appeal.” Gilbert, 181\n\nF.3d 162-63.    Furthermore, it should be noted that the defendant\n\nexplicitly waived any possible Daubert objection in its reply brief to\n\nthis court:\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                  The objection of Sheridan to the testimony\n          of Captain Sadler is based on the complete lack\n          of expert qualifications possessed by the witness\n          in relation to the issues on which his opinions\n          were offered. Sheridan has not raised the\n          “scientific validity[]” objection as improperly\n          claimed by Diefenbach.\n                               * * * *\n\n                 While Mr. Diefenbach attempts to couch the\n          objection of Sheridan as something other than\n          what was intended by Sheridan's attorney, the\n          basis for the objection could not have been made\n          more clear. It is an objection to the lack of\n          proper qualifications to provide opinion\n          testimony on the part of Mr. Sadler. . . .\n\n                  Clearly, then, while Diefenbach attempts\n          to argue that the defendant did not specifically\n          put the trial judge on notice as to the\n          “scientific validity” underlying the testimony,\n          this was not the objection. This was made clear\n          at the trial. . . . It was also made clear in\n          the Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of\n          its Motion for a New Trial when Sheridan stated:\n          “Permitting plaintiff's expert, Sadler, to opine\n          in areas which he was not qualified precluded the\n          jury from returning a fair and impartial verdict\n          in this matter.” . . . Finally, it was made clear\n          in Sheridan's Brief previously filed in this\n          appeal, which stated as to Captain Sadler: “He\n          lacked the specific knowledge, training and\n          experience to assist the trier of fact in\n          determining the validity of the appellee's\n          claims.”\n\nDef.'s Reply Br., pp. 1-3 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis\n\nadded). Therefore, we determine that any Daubert objection was waived\n\nby the defendant and we need not address it for the first time on\n\nappeal. We turn, instead, to the defendant's objection that Captain\n\nSadler “lacked the specific knowledge, training and experience to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fassist the trier of fact in determining the validity of the appellee's\n\nclaims.”\n\n           It   is   well-settled   that   “trial   judges   have   broad\n\ndiscretionary powers in determining the qualification, and thus,\n\nadmissibility, of expert witnesses. It is settled law in this circuit\n\nthat [w]hether a witness is qualified to express an expert opinion is\n\na matter left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.           In the\n\nabsence of clear error, as a matter of law, the trial judge's decision\n\nwill not be reversed.” Richmond Steel Inc. v. Puerto Rican Am. Ins.\n\nCo., 954 F.2d 19, 20 (1st Cir. 1992) (alterations in original)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Corey,\n\n207 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2000) (reviewing rulings relating to the\n\nadmissibility of expert testimony for clear abuses of discretion).\n\n           The admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Federal\n\nRules of Evidence 702 and 703. Three requirements are imposed by Rule\n\n702: “(1) the expert must be qualified to testify, by knowledge,\n\nskill, experience, training, or education; (2) the testimony must\n\nconcern scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge; and (3)\n\nthe testimony must be such as to assist the trier of fact to understand\n\nthe evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Corey, 207 F.3d at 88\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).        Rule 702 provides:\n\n           If scientific, technical, or other specialized\n           knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\n           understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n          knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n          education, may testify thereto in the form of an\n          opinion or otherwise.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702. After careful review of the entire record, we find\n\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed\n\nCaptain Sadler to present expert testimony.       We find, as did the\n\ndistrict court, that Captain Sadler had the knowledge, skill,\n\nexperience, training and education to qualify him as an expert and that\n\nhis testimony would assist the trier of fact to better understand the\n\ncase.\n\n          Captain Sadler was well-qualified based on his skill,\n\ntraining, education and knowledge. He was a 1973 graduate of the Maine\n\nMarine Academy, where he took courses in seamanship, rigging, booming,\n\ncargo-handling, mooring and engineering, and received a Bachelors of\n\nScience in Nautical Science. Captain Sadler holds various licenses and\n\nhas worked his way through the ranks to that of captain.\n\n          Captain Sadler has spent years on the water, primarily aboard\n\ntugs and barges, including employment with the second largest towing\n\ncompany in the country. He often evaluated and trained crews and was\n\nresponsible for the safety of the crews and the ships. He trained\n\ncrews to better handle lines, gear and other equipment on vessels.\n\nCaptain Sadler was responsible for supervising the lifting and pulling\n\nof different objects, including numerous types of chains, chock lines\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fon pennants and nylon lines of different weights and force. In fact,\n\nhis vessel was used as a school ship and he taught others how to handle\n\nand lift such lines and equipment. He established procedures and\n\nauthored the Responsible Carrier Program, which describes the\n\nresponsibilities of each member of a vessel's crew. Captain Sadler was\n\nfurther responsible for the introduction of new equipment on vessels\n\nand retrofitting and replacing equipment on others.\n\n          Captain Sadler was well-qualified to give opinions regarding\n\ndocking and undocking. He was qualified to be a docking master and\n\n“rode in excess of a hundred vessels,” observing or participating in\n\nthe docking and undocking procedure. Because trips on tugs and barges\n\nwere relatively short, Captain Sadler was involved in docking and\n\nundocking       more     than      the      average      seaman.\n\n          The defendant argues that Captain Sadler was not qualified\n\nto give expert testimony in this case because this case concerns an\n\naccident which occurred aboard an ITB vessel and because Captain Sadler\n\nnever served as a member of a crew aboard an ITB. While it is true\n\nthat Captain Sadler was never a crew member on an ITB, it does not\n\nfollow that he was unqualified to give an opinion regarding the\n\nequipment, the machinery and the docking and undocking procedures. He\n\ntestified that he was familiar with ITB vessels and that they use the\n\nsame winches, machinery, chocks and blocks as his barges and tugs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            Moreover, it should be noted that the defendant had ample\n\nopportunity to cross examine Captain Salder and to use its own expert\n\n– witness which it did. We find that Captain Sadler was qualified to\n\ngive expert testimony regarding, inter alia, the lifting of heavy lines\n\n(the cause of the plaintiff's injury). The district judge, utilizing\n\nthe broad discretion afforded him, did not commit clear error by\n\nallowing Captain Sadler to proffer his opinion and we will not disturb\n\nthat determination. Therefore, the district court's denial of the\n\ndefendant's motion for a new trial is affirmed.\n\nIII.     Motion for remittitur.\n\n            The defendant moved for remittitur on the grounds that the\n\namount of damages awarded to the plaintiff was excessive and not\n\nsupported by the evidence presented at trial. The defendant also\n\nargued that the district court failed to instruct the jury on reducing\n\nlost wages to present value or that any award is not subject to income\n\ntaxes.     We review the district court's denial of a motion for\n\nremittitur for an abuse of discretion. See Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177\n\nF.3d 19, 29 (1st Cir. 1999). “We will not disturb an award of damages\n\nbecause it is extremely generous or because we think the damages are\n\nconsiderably less. . . . We will only reverse an award if it is so\n\ngrossly disproportionate to any injury established by the evidence as\n\nto be unconscionable as a matter of law.”      Koster v. Trans World\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fAirlines, Inc., 181 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,        U.S.\n\n, 120 S. Ct. 532 (1999).\n\n          When determining whether the damages awarded are excessive\n\nor unsupported by the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict. See Smith, 177 F.3d at 30. In light of the\n\ndeference owed to the verdict, we find that the jury's award of\n\n$900,000.00 does not warrant remittitur. Ample evidence was introduced\n\nat trial regarding the plaintiff's injury, his inability to earn a\n\nliving and the pain and suffering he experienced, is experiencing and\n\nwill experience in the future. Therefore, we find that the award of\n\n$900,000.00 was supported by the evidence and will not disturb the\n\njury's award.\n\n          The defendant also argues that the award for past and future\n\nlost wages was improperly inflated because the district court failed to\n\ninstruct the jury on reducing lost wages to present value and that any\n\naward is not subject to taxes. An instruction regarding the tax was\n\nnot requested by the defendant and was only mentioned after the\n\ninstructions were given to the jury. The defense attorney simply\n\nstated, “I don't think that you mentioned anything there that any award\n\nthey make is not subject to taxes.”      App. 848.    The plaintiff's\n\nattorney noted that the defendant never asked for such an instruction,\n\nand the court refused to give it. We have previously held, and do so\n\nagain here, that, absent a party's objection, a judge's failure to give\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fan instruction that an award is not subject to income tax, is not\n\nerror. See Kennett v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 560 F.2d 456, 461-62 (1st\n\nCir. 1977) (finding no error in failure to give an instruction that the\n\naward is not subject to income tax).\n\n          The district court did not instruct the jury that it could\n\nreduce the award to present value because the defendant failed to\n\nrequest such an instruction and then failed to object to its absence.\n\nThe defendant, however, argues for the first time on appeal that the\n\nlack of said instruction improperly inflated the award. Rule 51 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure states, in pertinent part, that: “No\n\nparty may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an\n\ninstruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires\n\nto consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and\n\nthe grounds of the objection.”\n\n          If a party fails to object to a jury instruction pursuant to\n\nRule 51, then it cannot be raised successfully on appeal. See Scarfo\n\nv. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 940 (1st Cir. 1995). In Scarfo,\n\nwe held that: “[t]he rule has been rigorously enforced in this circuit,\n\nand its clear language will be overlooked only in exceptional cases or\n\nunder peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice\n\n. . . or where the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id. (internal citations\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fand quotation marks omitted); see also Beatty v. Michael Bus. Machs.\n\nCorp., 172 F.3d 117, 121 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Plain    error   “is   reserved   for   the   most   egregious\n\ncircumstances.” Negron v. Caleb Brett U.S.A., Inc., 212 F.3d 666, 672\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court\n\nhas held that plain error applies only where the error “seriously\n\naffect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.”     United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993)2\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Scarfo, 54 F.3d at 940)\n\n(holding that we will only reverse if the charge “has caused a\n\nmiscarriage of justice or has undermined the integrity of the judicial\n\nprocess.”); Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1196 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(holding that the plain error standard, which is “high in any event, .\n\n. . is near its zenith in the Rule 51 milieu”) (omission in original)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          We find that the district court did not commit plain error\n\nwhen it failed to give an instruction that any future damage award\n\nshould be discounted to present value. The defendant neither requested\n\nsuch an instruction, nor objected to its omission, and cannot meet the\n\nhigh standard of “plain error” to warrant reversal. There is nothing\n\nto suggest that this omission “seriously affect[ed] the fairness,\n\n2    Defendant's citation to Colburn v. Bunge Towing, Inc., 883 F.2d\n372, 377 (5th Cir. 1989), a pre-Olano case which arguably applies a\ndifferent plain error standard, is thus beside the point.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Negron, 212\n\nF.3d at 672. Therefore, we decline the defendant's invitation to\n\nremand with instructions to grant a remittitur.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f",

The second trial concluded\n\nwith a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of\n\n$900,000.00.\n\n              The defendant moved for a new trial on the grounds that the\n\ndistrict court improperly instructed the jury, improperly admitted the\n\nplaintiff's maritime expert's opinion and allowed a verdict which was\n\n“excessive and not supported by the evidence as presented at trial.”\n\nThe defendant also moved for remittitur. Both of defendant's motions\n\nwere denied by the district court and the defendant appeals to this\n\ncourt.\n\nII.     Motion for a new trial.\n\n              We review the district court's denial of a motion for a new\n\ntrial only for manifest abuse of discretion.

Our rule is that an objection not made in the trial court\n\nwill not be considered in the first instance on appeal.” Gilbert, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162-63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.    Furthermore, it should be noted that the defendant\n\nexplicitly waived any possible Daubert objection in its reply brief to\n\nthis court:\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                  The objection of Sheridan to the testimony\n          of Captain Sadler is based on the complete lack\n          of expert qualifications possessed by the witness\n          in relation to the issues on which his opinions\n          were offered. Sheridan has not raised the\n          “scientific validity[]” objection as improperly\n          claimed by Diefenbach.\n                               * * * *\n\n                 While Mr. Diefenbach attempts to couch the\n          objection of Sheridan as something other than\n          what was intended by Sheridan's attorney, the\n          basis for the objection could not have been made\n          more clear. It is an objection to the lack of\n          proper qualifications to provide opinion\n          testimony on the part of Mr. Sadler. . . .\n\n                  Clearly, then, while Diefenbach attempts\n          to argue that the defendant did not specifically\n          put the trial judge on notice as to the\n          “scientific validity” underlying the testimony,\n          this was not the objection. This was made clear\n          at the trial. . . . It was also made clear in\n          the Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of\n          its Motion for a New Trial when Sheridan stated:\n          “Permitting plaintiff's expert, Sadler, to opine\n          in areas which he was not qualified precluded the\n          jury from returning a fair and impartial verdict\n          in this matter.” . . . Finally, it was made clear\n          in Sheridan's Brief previously filed in this\n          appeal, which stated as to Captain Sadler: “He\n          lacked the specific knowledge, training and\n          experience to assist the trier of fact in\n          determining the validity of the appellee's\n          claims.”\n\nDef.'s Reply Br., pp. 1-3 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis\n\nadded). Therefore, we determine that any Daubert objection was waived\n\nby the defendant and we need not address it for the first time on\n\nappeal. We turn, instead, to the defendant's objection that Captain\n\nSadler “lacked the specific knowledge, training and experience to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fassist the trier of fact in determining the validity of the appellee's\n\nclaims.”\n\n           It   is   well-settled   that   “trial   judges   have   broad\n\ndiscretionary powers in determining the qualification, and thus,\n\nadmissibility, of expert witnesses. It is settled law in this circuit\n\nthat [w]hether a witness is qualified to express an expert opinion is\n\na matter left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.           In the\n\nabsence of clear error, as a matter of law, the trial judge's decision\n\nwill not be reversed.” Richmond Steel Inc. v. Puerto Rican Am.

Three requirements are imposed by Rule\n\n702: “(1) the expert must be qualified to testify, by knowledge,\n\nskill, experience, training, or education; (2) the testimony must\n\nconcern scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge; and (3)\n\nthe testimony must be such as to assist the trier of fact to understand\n\nthe evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768064\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/768064/united-states-v-alvin-scott-corey/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">88</span>\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(internal quotation marks omitted).        Rule 702 provides:\n\n           If scientific, technical, or other specialized\n           knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\n           understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n          knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n          education, may testify thereto in the form of an\n          opinion or otherwise.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702. After careful review of the entire record, we find\n\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed\n\nCaptain Sadler to present expert testimony.       We find, as did the\n\ndistrict court, that Captain Sadler had the knowledge, skill,\n\nexperience, training and education to qualify him as an expert and that\n\nhis testimony would assist the trier of fact to better understand the\n\ncase.\n\n          Captain Sadler was well-qualified based on his skill,\n\ntraining, education and knowledge. He was a 1973 graduate of the Maine\n\nMarine Academy, where he took courses in seamanship, rigging, booming,\n\ncargo-handling, mooring and engineering, and received a Bachelors of\n\nScience in Nautical Science. Captain Sadler holds various licenses and\n\nhas worked his way through the ranks to that of captain.\n\n          Captain Sadler has spent years on the water, primarily aboard\n\ntugs and barges, including employment with the second largest towing\n\ncompany in the country. He often evaluated and trained crews and was\n\nresponsible for the safety of the crews and the ships. He trained\n\ncrews to better handle lines, gear and other equipment on vessels.\n\nCaptain Sadler was responsible for supervising the lifting and pulling\n\nof different objects, including numerous types of chains, chock lines\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fon pennants and nylon lines of different weights and force. In fact,\n\nhis vessel was used as a school ship and he taught others how to handle\n\nand lift such lines and equipment. He established procedures and\n\nauthored the Responsible Carrier Program, which describes the\n\nresponsibilities of each member of a vessel's crew. Captain Sadler was\n\nfurther responsible for the introduction of new equipment on vessels\n\nand retrofitting and replacing equipment on others.\n\n          Captain Sadler was well-qualified to give opinions regarding\n\ndocking and undocking. He was qualified to be a docking master and\n\n“rode in excess of a hundred vessels,” observing or participating in\n\nthe docking and undocking procedure. Because trips on tugs and barges\n\nwere relatively short, Captain Sadler was involved in docking and\n\nundocking       more     than      the      average      seaman.\n\n          The defendant argues that Captain Sadler was not qualified\n\nto give expert testimony in this case because this case concerns an\n\naccident which occurred aboard an ITB vessel and because Captain Sadler\n\nnever served as a member of a crew aboard an ITB. While it is true\n\nthat Captain Sadler was never a crew member on an ITB, it does not\n\nfollow that he was unqualified to give an opinion regarding the\n\nequipment, the machinery and the docking and undocking procedures. He\n\ntestified that he was familiar with ITB vessels and that they use the\n\nsame winches, machinery, chocks and blocks as his barges and tugs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            Moreover, it should be noted that the defendant had ample\n\nopportunity to cross examine Captain Salder and to use its own expert\n\n– witness which it did. We find that Captain Sadler was qualified to\n\ngive expert testimony regarding, inter alia, the lifting of heavy lines\n\n(the cause of the plaintiff's injury). The district judge, utilizing\n\nthe broad discretion afforded him, did not commit clear error by\n\nallowing Captain Sadler to proffer his opinion and we will not disturb\n\nthat determination. Therefore, the district court's denial of the\n\ndefendant's motion for a new trial is affirmed.\n\nIII.     Motion for remittitur.\n\n            The defendant moved for remittitur on the grounds that the\n\namount of damages awarded to the plaintiff was excessive and not\n\nsupported by the evidence presented at trial. The defendant also\n\nargued that the district court failed to instruct the jury on reducing\n\nlost wages to present value or that any award is not subject to income\n\ntaxes.     We review the district court's denial of a motion for\n\nremittitur for an abuse of discretion. See Smith v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1999).\n\n          When determining whether the damages awarded are excessive\n\nor unsupported by the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict.

In light of the\n\ndeference owed to the verdict, we find that the jury's award of\n\n$900,000.00 does not warrant remittitur. Ample evidence was introduced\n\nat trial regarding the plaintiff's injury, his inability to earn a\n\nliving and the pain and suffering he experienced, is experiencing and\n\nwill experience in the future. Therefore, we find that the award of\n\n$900,000.00 was supported by the evidence and will not disturb the\n\njury's award.\n\n          The defendant also argues that the award for past and future\n\nlost wages was improperly inflated because the district court failed to\n\ninstruct the jury on reducing lost wages to present value and that any\n\naward is not subject to taxes. An instruction regarding the tax was\n\nnot requested by the defendant and was only mentioned after the\n\ninstructions were given to the jury. The defense attorney simply\n\nstated, “I don't think that you mentioned anything there that any award\n\nthey make is not subject to taxes.”      App. 848.    The plaintiff's\n\nattorney noted that the defendant never asked for such an instruction,\n\nand the court refused to give it. We have previously held, and do so\n\nagain here, that, absent a party's objection, a judge's failure to give\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fan instruction that an award is not subject to income tax, is not\n\nerror.

Rule 51 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure states, in pertinent part, that: “No\n\nparty may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an\n\ninstruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires\n\nto consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and\n\nthe grounds of the objection.”\n\n          If a party fails to object to a jury instruction pursuant to\n\nRule 51, then it cannot be raised successfully on appeal.
