Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Teodoro Mendez Lebron on brief for petitioner.\r\n   Gustavo A. Gelpi, Acting Solicitor General, Edda Serrano\r\nBlasini, Deputy Solicitor General, and Leticia Casalduc Rabell,\r\nAssistant Solicitor General, on brief for respondent.\r\n\nDecember 8, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Edgardo Mulero Santana (\"Mulero\") appeals\r\nfrom a dismissal of his habeas petition for failure to exhaust\r\nstate remedies.  We affirm the dismissal on an alternative\r\nbasis.\r\n          Mulero was convicted of unlawful appropriation before\r\na Puerto Rico superior court.  He contends that the\r\nCommonwealth court lacked jurisdiction to try him because,\r\ninter alia, the crime occurred in a federal post office. \r\nMulero raised the jurisdictional issue before the trial court,\r\nwhich rejected it.  He raised the issue, again, before the\r\nintermediate appellate court, which also rejected it.  Finally,\r\nhe raised the issue in a petition for certiorari filed with the\r\nCommonwealth's highest court.  That court denied the petition\r\non the procedural ground that Mulero failed to attach certain\r\ncopies of certain portions of the record, as required by local\r\nrule.  Mulero sought reconsideration indicating that the\r\nfailure to comply with the local rule was due to attorney\r\nerror.  The motion for reconsideration was denied.  \r\n          Mulero argues that he has exhausted his state\r\nremedies.  Specifically, he contends that although a collateral\r\nattack is technically available, further proceedings would be\r\nfutile since the state courts have already resolved his claim\r\nagainst him.  See Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 447 (1953)\r\n(holding that a prisoner does not have \"to ask the state for\r\ncollateral relief, based on the same evidence and issues\r\nalready decided by direct review\").  Although it argued non-\r\nexhaustion below, the Commonwealth now switches gears.  It\r\nargues that Mulero has exhausted state remedies but that his\r\nclaim is procedurally defaulted.\r\n          We are persuaded that Mulero has exhausted his claim. \r\nHowever, this conclusion gains him little since the\r\n\"independent and adequate state ground doctrine\" applies \"to\r\nbar federal habeas when a state court declined to address a\r\nprisoner's federal claims because the prisoner had failed to\r\nmeet a state procedural requirement.\"  Coleman v. Thompson, 501\r\nU.S. 722, 729-30 (1991).  The bar obtains unless there is\r\n\"cause for the default and actual prejudice\" or \"failure to\r\nconsider the claim[] will result in a fundamental miscarriage\r\nof justice.\"  Id. at 750.  \"[A] 'fundamental miscarriage of\r\njustice' is defined as an 'extraordinary instance[] when a\r\nconstitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of\r\none innocent of the crime.\"  United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d\r\n34, 48 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467,\r\n494 (1991)).\r\n          In the instant case, we conclude that the independent\r\nand adequate state ground doctrine applies, and that Mulero is\r\nprocedurally barred from raising his claim in federal habeas. \r\nThe Puerto Rico Supreme Court unambiguously rested its denial\r\nof Mulero's certiorari petition on a procedural ground.  Mulero\r\nconceded in the Commonwealth court that the Puerto Rico Supreme\r\nCourt has been consistent in requiring strict compliance with\r\nits rules.  Attorney error cannot be \"cause\" for excusing the\r\nprocedural default, since there is no federal constitutional\r\nright to counsel on a discretionary appeal to a state supreme\r\ncourt.  See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 753-57; Ross v. Moffit, 417\r\nU.S. 600 (1974).  Finally, there is no fundamental miscarriage\r\nof justice in holding Mulero to the procedural default since\r\nthe claimed error does not relate to guilt or innocence.\r\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal. \r\nSee Loc. R. 27(c).  In light of our reasoning, the judgment\r\nshould be modified to reflect that the dismissal is with\r\nprejudice.  \r\n          Affirmed as modified.\n",
