McKee, with whom Lipman &amp; Katz, P.A. was on brief,\r\nfor appellant.\r\nF. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Jay P.\r\nMcCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                       \r\n\n                   November 15, 1999\r\n                                        \r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  Kenneth Leon Meader appeals his\r\nsentence for conspiracy to commit escape in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n371 and 751.  Meader pled nolo contendere to conspiracy to\r\nescape from the Kennebec County, Maine, jail where he was confined\r\nwhile awaiting transfer to a federal facility to serve a sentence\r\nfor drug offenses.  At sentencing, Meader first stated he wanted to\r\nplead guilty, but upon questioning by the court he repeatedly\r\ndenied that he had intended to escape, and so a nolo plea was\r\ntaken.  He raises two basic issues on appeal.\r\nIn calculating Meader's criminal history category, the\r\ndistrict court added two points under U.S.S.G.  4A1.1(d) because\r\nMeader was imprisoned at the time he committed the offense, and the\r\ncourt added one point under  4A1.1(e) because Meader committed the\r\noffense while serving a sentence that had produced more than one\r\ncriminal history point.  The district court did not grant Meader a\r\nthree point reduction in the base offense level under U.S.S.G.\r\n2X1.1(b)(2) for an incomplete conspiracy.  \r\nMeader argues that increasing his criminal history\r\ncategory under  4A1.1(d) and (e) constituted impermissible \"double\r\ncounting\" because his being imprisoned when he committed conspiracy\r\nto escape is an element of that substantive offense contemplated in\r\nthe base offense level.  Secondly, Meader argues that the district\r\ncourt erred in failing to grant him a three point reduction for an\r\nincomplete conspiracy.  We affirm the district court's rulings\r\nunder  4A1.1(d) and (e) in calculating Meader's criminal history\r\ncategory, and we remand the case for further proceedings on the\r\nquestion of Meader's eligibility under  2X1.1(b)(2) for a three\r\npoint reduction in the base offense level.\r\n\"Double Counting\"\r\nMeader's claim that the district court erred in\r\nincreasing his criminal history category under  4A1.1(d) and (e)\r\nis foreclosed by the logic of our decision in United States v.\r\nSanders, 982 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1992).  Sanders held that augmenting\r\nboth the defendant's base offense level and criminal history\r\ncategory based upon his possessing a weapon did not constitute\r\nimpermissible double counting.  See id. at 6-8.  As in Sanders,\r\nthis case does not involve impermissible or unintentional results,\r\nbut rather an intent by the Guidelines to consider one factor in\r\ntwo ways.  That Meader's claim involves the factor of imprisonment\r\nrather than possession of a firearm is of no consequence, nor does\r\nit matter that this case arises under  4A1.1 rather than  4B1.4\r\nas in Sanders.  \r\nMeader relies on United States v. Bell, 716 F. Supp. 1207\r\n(D. Minn. 1989), which held that considering imprisonment under\r\n4A1.1(d) and (e) in an escape case results in impermissible\r\ndouble counting.  Sanders, however, expressly disagreed with Bell,\r\nas have other courts of appeals.  See Sanders, 982 F.2d at 8\r\n(citing United States v. Thomas, 930 F.2d 12, 13-14 (8th Cir. 1991)\r\n(collecting cases)).  We reject Bell's reasoning as well.  \"Because\r\nthe guidelines are explicit when double counting is forbidden . .\r\n. [a]n adjustment that clearly applies to the conduct of an offense\r\nmust be imposed unless the Guidelines expressly exclude its\r\napplicability.\"  United States v. Ellen, 961 F.2d 462, 468 (4th\r\nCir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  As we\r\nstated in Sanders, \"[i]t is not our place to rewrite the\r\nGuidelines.\"  Sanders, 982 F.2d at 8.\r\nReduction for Incomplete Conspiracy\r\nThe second issue is more problematic.  Under\r\n2X1.1(b)(2), Meader may receive a three point reduction in base\r\noffense level unless he \"completed all the acts . . . necessary .\r\n. . for the successful completion of the substantive offense or .\r\n. . [was] about to complete all such acts . . . .\"  See United\r\nStates v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 35-36 (1st Cir. 1993).  The\r\nreduction should not be granted if the substantive offense was\r\n\"substantially completed.\"  See U.S.S.G.  2X1.1 commentary\r\n(backg'd).  The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended that Meader\r\nbe granted this three point reduction.  The district court declined\r\nto follow this recommendation, but the record lacks an express\r\nfinding on whether the conspiracy to escape had been completed. \r\nConsequently, Meader claims that the district court erred in\r\nfailing to award him the reduction.\r\nAt his sentencing hearing, Meader denied that the\r\nconspiracy to escape had been completed.  Moreover, Meader had\r\nrepeatedly claimed that he never intended to escape and that,\r\ninstead, his goal was to defraud other inmates (in order to pay\r\nphone bills) by pretending he was going to escape and asking them\r\nfor money to assist him.  In response, the government argued that\r\nif Meader wished to continue to claim that he was only involved in\r\na scheme to defraud, such a scheme to defraud had been completed,\r\nas Meader had succeeded in getting $300 from another inmate.  The\r\ngovernment may also have been led to discuss the issue in terms of\r\na conspiracy to defraud by the fact that 18 U.S.C.  371, one of\r\nthe sections under which Meader was convicted, is titled\r\n\"Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States\"\r\n(emphasis added).  Most likely, it is this assertion by the\r\ngovernment that caused the confusion as to the basis for the\r\ndistrict court's ruling.  The district court declined to award\r\nMeader a reduction for an incomplete conspiracy, stating, \"Since\r\nthe conspiracy to defraud was completed, no decrease is warranted\r\npursuant to Guideline [] 2X1, et al.\" (emphasis added).  This\r\nstatement is the problem, as the relevant inquiry is whether the\r\nconspiracy to escape -- the \"substantive offense\" charged -- had\r\nbeen completed.  See U.S.S.G.  2X1.1(b)(2). \r\nThe government counters with two points: that there is\r\nample evidence to support a finding that the conspiracy to escape\r\nhad been completed and that the district court inadvertently said\r\n\"defraud\" when it meant to say \"escape.\"  In any event, the\r\ngovernment asserts, any error is harmless because Meader stays\r\nwithin the original sentencing range, with or without the three\r\npoint reduction.  Because we cannot say that the trial judge would\r\nhave reached the same sentence within the range, we put aside the\r\nharmless error argument.  Further, if we were confident that the\r\ncourt's statement was a mere slip of the tongue, it would certainly\r\nnot have been clear error for the court to have concluded the\r\nconspiracy to escape was substantially completed.  But we lack such\r\nconfidence here where the government erroneously invited the court\r\nto look at this as a conspiracy to defraud and where the PSR\r\nrecommended that the three point reduction be given on the basis\r\nthat the conspiracy to escape was not substantially completed.  \r\nThere should be greater clarity that the proper question\r\nwas answered.  The government's suggestion that we resolve this\r\nfactual question gives insufficient weight to the predominant role\r\nof the trial judge in making the factual determinations that drive\r\nsentencing decisions.  See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d\r\n105, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's decisions\r\nunder  4A1.1(d) and (e), and remand the case for proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion as to Meader's eligibility for a three\r\npoint reduction in base offense level under  2X1.1(b)(2).  So\r\nordered.\r\n",

As we stated in Sanders, \"it is not our place to rewrite the Guidelines.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597131\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sanders,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/597131/united-states-v-steven-h-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Reduction for Incomplete Conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue is more problematic. Under  2X1.1(b)(2), Meader may receive a three point reduction in base offense level unless he \"completed all the acts . . . necessary . . . for the successful completion of the substantive offense or . . . [was] about to complete all such acts . . . .\" See United States v. Chapdelaine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602833\"><a href=\"/opinion/602833/united-states-v-george-chapdelaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 35-36 (1st Cir. 1993). The reduction should not be granted if the substantive offense was \"substantially completed.\" See U.S.S.G.  2X1.1 commentary (backg'd). The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended that Meader be granted this three point reduction. The district court declined to follow this recommendation, but the    record lacks an express finding on whether the conspiracy to escape had been completed. Consequently, Meader claims that the district court erred in failing to award him the reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his sentencing hearing, Meader denied that the conspiracy to escape had been completed. Moreover, Meader had repeatedly claimed that he never intended to escape and that, instead, his goal was to defraud other inmates (in order to pay phone bills) by pretending he was going to escape and asking them for money to assist him. In response, the government argued that if Meader wished to continue to claim that he was only involved in a scheme to defraud, such a scheme to defraud had been completed, as Meader had succeeded in getting $ 300 from another inmate. The government may also have been led to discuss the issue in terms of a conspiracy to defraud by the fact that 18 U.S.C.  371, one of the sections under which Meader was convicted, is titled \"Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States\" (emphasis added). Most likely, it is this assertion by the government that caused the confusion as to the basis for the district court's ruling. The district court declined    to award Meader a reduction for an incomplete conspiracy, stating, \"Since the conspiracy to defraud was completed, no decrease is warranted pursuant to Guideline [ ] 2X1, et al.\" (emphasis added). This statement is the problem, as the relevant inquiry is whether the conspiracy to escape -- the \"substantive offense\" charged -- had been completed. See U.S.S.G.  2X1.1(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government counters with two points: that there is ample evidence to support a finding that the conspiracy to escape had been completed and that the district court inadvertently said \"defraud\" when it meant to say \"escape.\" In any event, the government asserts, any error is harmless because Meader stays within the original sentencing range, with or without the three point reduction. Because we cannot say that the trial judge would have reached the same sentence within the range, we put aside the harmless error argument. Further, if we were confident that the court's statement was a mere slip of the tongue, it would certainly not have been clear error for the court to have concluded the conspiracy to escape was substantially completed. But we lack such confidence here where the government    erroneously invited the court to look at this as a conspiracy to defraud and where the PSR recommended that the three point reduction be given on the basis that the conspiracy to escape was not substantially completed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There should be greater clarity that the proper question was answered. The government's suggestion that we resolve this factual question gives insufficient weight to the predominant role of the trial judge in making the factual determinations that drive sentencing decisions. See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decisions under  4A1.1(d) and (e), and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion as to Meader's eligibility for a three point reduction in base offense level under  2X1.1(b)(2). So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
