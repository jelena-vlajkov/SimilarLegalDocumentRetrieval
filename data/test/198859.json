This case involves a claim by the\n\nplaintiff - the appellant in this court - that his status as a\n\ncommissioned officer in the Rhode Island Army National Guard was\n\nwrongfully terminated. Plaintiff challenged that termination by suit\n\nbrought, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in a Rhode Island state court\n\nagainst two defendants - appellees in this court - the Adjutant General\n\nof the Rhode Island Army National Guard and the State of Rhode Island.\n\nThe suit was removed to the United States District Court for Rhode\n\nIsland. Following brief discovery, the District Court granted the\n\nAdjutant General's motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in\n\nfavor of both defendants.     This appeal followed.\n\n                                  I.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          The facts giving rise to the plaintiff-appellant's claim are\n\nstraightforward and may be quickly stated:\n\n          Eugene E. Wigginton served in the United States Marine Corps\n\nfrom April of 1967 to September of 1970, when he was honorably\n\ndischarged.   Nine years later - in July of 1979 - the plaintiff\n\nreceived a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army\n\nReserve. As concomitants of his status as a commissioned reserve\n\nofficer, Lieutenant Wigginton was appointed an officer of the United\n\nStates Army National Guard (\"USANG\") and of the Rhode Island Army\n\nNational Guard (\"RIANG\"), with assignment to a RIANG Military Police\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\funit. As the years went by, Lieutenant Wigginton received periodic\n\npromotions, reaching the rank of major in 1989. In January of 1996,\n\nMajor Wigginton (by then assigned as a Public Affairs Officer and\n\nserving as a RIANG Education Officer) was nearing completion of twenty\n\nyears of military service (more than three years in the Marines, and\n\nalmost seventeen years in USANG and RIANG). In that month he received\n\nfrom Brigadier General Reginald A. Centracchio, Adjutant General of\n\nRhode Island, a memorandum captioned \"Consideration for Selective\n\nRetention.\" The memorandum advised Major Wigginton that his status\n\nwould be considered in May of 1996 by a Selective Retention Board,\n\nconvened pursuant to National Guard Regulation [\"NGR\"] 635-102 - a\n\nregulation, promulgated in 1988, titled \"Personnel Separations OFFICERS\n\nAND WARRANT OFFICERS SELECTIVE RETENTION.\" The Selective Retention\n\nBoard, according to General Centracchio's memorandum, would \"consider\n\ncommissioned and warrant officers in the grade of colonel and below who\n\nhave completed 20 years of qualifying service for retired pay.\" A\n\nprincipal goal of the selective retention process is \"[e]nsuring that\n\nonly the most capable officers are retained beyond 20 years of\n\nqualifying service for assignment to the comparatively few higher level\n\ncommand and staff positions.\" NGR 635-102 § 3(a).1 Meeting on May 13,\n\n1 As the District Court explained: \"'Selective retention' is a policy\ninstituted by the United States Army through which officers in the\nUSANG who have completed 20 years of commissioned service are\nreevaluated at regular intervals to determine whether they should be\nretained for further service. The program is designed to ensure combat\n\n                                 -4-\n\f1996, the Board convened by General Centracchio considered the records\n\nof ten officers.   Major Wigginton (and presumably the other nine\n\nofficers) did not appear before the Board; NGR 635-102 states that\n\n\"[i]ndividuals are not authorized to appear.\" Via a memorandum to\n\nGeneral Centracchio dated May 13, the Board recommended that six\n\nofficers be retained and that four officers, of whom Major Wigginton\n\nwas one, not be retained.    On the following day - May 14, 1996 -\n\nGeneral Centracchio sent Major Wigginton a memorandum stating, inter\n\nalia, that \"[y]ou have been considered for retention in accordance with\n\n[NGR 635-102] and have not been selected. Accordingly, you will be\n\nseparated from the Army National Guard by 13 July 1996.\" On July 18,\n\n1996, Colonel Anthony J. Zoglio, director of personnel for RIANG, sent\n\nMajor Wigginton a memorandum advising him that, effective July 13, he\n\nhad been separated from the Army National Guard by honorable discharge.\n\nAt the time of his discharge, Major Wigginton was a Public Affairs\n\nOfficer, serving as Education Officer of RIANG; he was forty-six years\n\nold.\n\n                                  B.\n\n          In September of 1996, Major Wigginton brought suit in the\n\nRhode Island Superior Court against General Centracchio and the State\n\n\n\n\nreadiness throughout the entire National Guard and to inhibit\nstagnation in the senior grades.\"\n\n                                 -5-\n\fof Rhode Island. The suit, in two counts, was brought pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n\n          The first count alleged that plaintiff's separation from the\n\nservice, and his consequent ineligibility for promotion to lieutenant\n\ncolonel, contravened Section 30-3-13 (1994 Reenactment) of Rhode Island\n\nGeneral Laws.    Section 30-3-13 provides as follows:\n\n          All commissioned officers of the staff corps and\n          departments, hereafter appointed, shall have had\n          previous military experience, except chaplains,\n          officers of the judge advocate general's corps,\n          and medical corps officers. They shall hold\n          their positions until they shall have reached the\n          age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to\n          that time by reason of resignation or disability,\n          or for cause to be determined by an efficiency\n          board or a court-martial legally convened for\n          that purpose. Vacancies among these officers\n          shall be filled by appointment from the\n          commissioned officers of the national guard or\n          from such other civilians as may be specifically\n          qualified for duty therein.\n\nMajor Wigginton's contention was that - absent resignation, disability,\n\nor separation \"for cause,\" none of which has occurred - the quoted\n\nstatute had conferred upon him tenure as a commissioned officer of\n\nRIANG (albeit, not of USANG) until he should attain the age of sixty.\n\nIt follows - so Major Wigginton contended - that termination of his\n\ntenure as a RIANG officer was abridgement, without due process of law,\n\nof a vested property right.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          The second count, also predicated on § 1983, alleged a denial\n\nof due process of law in that \"[a]t no time has the plaintiff ever been\n\ninformed of the reasons why he was not selected for retention . . . .\"2\n\n          By way of relief, Major Wigginton sought \"a preliminary and\n\npermanent injunction ordering the defendant3 to reinstate the plaintiff\n\nin the Army National Guard, restore to him all his rights and\n\nprivileges to which he is entitled by reason of his commission,\n\nincluding any back pay, and submit the plaintiff's name to the\n\npromotion board for Lieutenant Colonel.\" (Although the language of\n\nMajor Wigginton's prayer for relief appears broad enough to encompass\n\nreinstatement, and associated entitlements, in USANG as well as in\n\nRIANG, Major Wigginton's brief on appeal expressly acknowledges that\n\n\"[t]he relief this Plaintiff seeks is limited to the Rhode Island\n\nNational Guard.\") The complaint also sought attorney's fees and costs.\n\nBased on plaintiff's federal claims, defendants removed the case to the\n\nUnited States District Court for Rhode Island. General Centracchio\n\n\n\n\n2  The second count also alleged that \"the criteria set forth in\nNational Guard Regulation 635-102 [to be considered in determining\nwhether or not a person should be retained in the National Guard] were\nnot followed with respect to plaintiff's case.\" However, plaintiff has\nnot pursued this claim on appeal.\n3 Here and elsewhere in his pleadings plaintiff employs the singular\n\"defendant,\" notwithstanding that there are two named defendants -\nGeneral Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthen moved to dismiss.4        The District Court referred the case to a\n\nMagistrate Judge, who recommended dismissal for lack of justiciability.\n\n    The Magistrate Judge was of the view that the case at bar, a § 1983\n\naction brought by a subordinate military officer against a military\n\nsuperior and arising out of military service, was barred by this\n\ncourt's decision in Wright v. Park, 5 F.3d 586 (1st Cir. 1993). Wright\n\nv. Park, building on Supreme Court precedent that had barred so-called\n\n\"Bivens actions\"5 against federal officials for constitutional\n\nviolations when such actions arise in a military setting, held that §\n\n1983 actions of the same character against state officials were\n\nlikewise barred. The Magistrate Judge concluded that \"the Wright court\n\nadopted the following bright-line rule: actions against military\n\nofficers for injuries that are 'incident to service' are not\n\njusticiable, whether these actions are filed pursuant to § 1983 or\n\nBivens.\" Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of\n\nthe complaint. Disagreeing with the Magistrate Judge, the District\n\nCourt concluded that plaintiff's claims were justiciable. The District\n\nCourt held that Wright v. Park is a bar to damage actions but not to\n\n\n\n\n4 The State of Rhode Island did not join in - or file a separate -\nmotion to dismiss. See infra note 6.\n5 The term \" Bivens actions\" derives from Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal\nAgents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), authorizing damage actions against federal\nofficials who allegedly engaged in unconstitutional conduct to a\nplaintiff's detriment.\n\n                                   -8-\n\factions - of which Major Wigginton's reinstatement suit is an example -\n\nin which the relief sought is equitable in nature.\n\n          Following the District Court's ruling that Major Wigginton's\n\nsuit was justiciable, the parties and the District Court turned their\n\nattention to the substance of Major Wigginton's claims.\n\n          The claim presented by Major Wigginton's first count was that\n\ntermination of his status as a RIANG officer deprived him, without due\n\nprocess of law, of a property right created by the mandate of Rhode\n\nIsland state law. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 (\"[A]ll commissioned\n\nofficers of the staff corps and departments . . . shall hold their\n\npositions until they have reached the age of sixty years.\")        The\n\nparties were in flat disagreement as to the proper construction of the\n\nRhode Island statute. The defense contended that the statute was\n\ninapplicable because Major Wigginton was not an officer \"of the staff\n\ncorps and departments.\"     Major Wigginton contended that he was.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court authorized discovery for the limited\n\npurpose of providing the parties with an enhanced opportunity to\n\nelucidate the meaning of that statutory phrase.       At the close of\n\ndiscovery, both General Centracchio and Major Wigginton moved for\n\nsummary judgment.6\n\n\n\n\n6 Notwithstanding that the State of Rhode Island is a named defendant\nin this litigation, the State did not join General Centracchio's motion\nfor summary judgment. See infra note 7.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          The District Court filed an opinion which reaffirmed its\n\nprior ruling on justiciability but found against Major Wigginton on\n\nboth counts of his complaint - the first count's due process claim\n\nbased on R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 and the second count's claim that the\n\nSelective Retention Board and General Centracchio had denied Major\n\nWigginton due process by not explaining to him the reasons for his non-\n\nretention.   Accordingly, the District Court granted the summary\n\njudgment motion of General Centracchio, denied that of Major Wigginton,\n\nand entered judgment against Major Wigginton and in favor of General\n\nCentracchio and the State of Rhode Island.7\n\n          With respect to Major Wigginton's claim under the first count\n\n– i.e., the claim that he had a protected property right arising under\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 of which he could not be deprived without due\n\nprocess of law - the District Court stated:\n\n          Plaintiff presents the affidavit of Brigadier\n          General Thomas M. Frazer, RIANG (Ret.), an\n          authority on Rhode Island military history. At\n          plaintiff's request, General Frazer reviewed the\n          Military Code of Rhode Island and found it to be\n          \"archaic and woefully outdated.\"        Although\n          General Frazer educated the court as to the\n          historical distinctions between line, staff, and\n          general officers, he was unfamiliar with any\n          \"staff corps\" in the Rhode Island National Guard,\n\n7 The docket sheet establishes that, concurrently with the grant of\nGeneral Centracchio's motion for summary judgment, judgment was entered\nin favor of both defendants. On this appeal, a single brief has been\nfiled for General Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island. (The\ndocket sheet does not reflect any challenge to the inclusion of the\nState of Rhode Island as a named defendant).\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          and he could only speculate as to what was meant\n          by \"and departments.\" Speaking specifically\n          about the text of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13,\n          Frazer stated quite candidly, \"I have no thought\n          or idea what the writer was trying to convey to\n          the reader . . . .\" The defendant's attempt to\n          discover the meaning of \"staff corps\" was no more\n          fruitful. Colonel Rick Baccus, director of\n          personnel and speaking on behalf of the RIANG,\n          was himself hard-pressed to explain to what the\n          expression \"staff corps and departments\" refers.\n\n          Of course, in this case, it is incumbent on Major\n          Wigginton to establish that he was a member of\n          the \"staff corps and departments.\" Even he\n          cannot say with any conviction that he held any\n          such commission.      In fact, although Major\n          Wigginton at one time \"believed\" he was a member\n          of the staff corps, he now admits that he was\n          \"never an officer of a corps identified as staff\n          corps officer.\" On this basis, Major Wigginton's\n          substantive due process claim must fail.\n\n          In addressing Major Wigginton's argument under the second\n\ncount that due process required a statement of reasons for his non-\n\nretention, the District Court noted Major Wigginton's reliance on State\n\nv. Ouimette, 367 A.2d 704 (R.I. 1976), a Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\ndecision holding that an applicant for parole has a due process\n\nentitlement to a statement in writing of the reasons for denial of\n\nparole. \"In so holding,\" said the District Court, \"the [Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court] balanced the burden of requiring a parole board to give\n\nits explanation for its decision against the seriousness of the right\n\nto have those reasons revealed. . . . Recognizing that Rhode Island\n\nregards due process as a 'flexible concept,' [ Ouimette, 367 A.2d] at\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f709, accord Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976), [this]\n\ncourt does not find the balance tips in Wigginton's favor.\"\n\n          From the District Court's judgment dismissing his suit Major\n\nWigginton has appealed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We have authority to address the issues tendered by Major\n\nWigginton on this appeal if - but only if - the District Court was\n\ncorrect in ruling that appellant's suit is justiciable. In their brief\n\nin this court, appellees invoke \"well-settled case law that . . .\n\nclaims against superior officers by subordinates are not justicible\n\n[sic].\" However, appellees' invocation of \"well-settled case law\"\n\nmandating a finding of non-justiciability appears to be directed only\n\nat   appellant's   second   count,   and   not   at   the   first   count,\n\nnotwithstanding that in the District Court the non-justiciability\n\naspect of General Centracchio's motion to dismiss was addressed to\n\nMajor Wigginton's entire complaint, and was so treated by the\n\nMagistrate Judge in recommending to the District Court that Major\n\nWigginton's complaint be dismissed as presenting claims that were non-\n\njusticiable. Appellees' brief does not undertake to explain why the\n\nissue of justiciability has become narrower in focus between the\n\nDistrict Court and this court.8\n\n8 Possibly, the explanation is traceable to the fact that the District\nCourt, while disposing of the first count adversely to Major Wigginton\non the merits, did characterize its rejection of both prongs of the\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          If appellees, in their brief on appeal, had made no mention\n\nof justiciability, we might have regarded that issue as not before us.\n\nThat was the course taken by this court in Charles v. Rice, 28 F.3d\n\n1312, 1316 n.2 (1st Cir. 1994): we there pointed out that certain\n\nissues with respect to which \"[t]he district court issued interlocutory\n\n\n\nsecond count as stemming from the conclusion that \"[t]hese claims are\nnot justiciable.\"\n\n  As pointed out in footnote 2, supra, the second count, in addition\nto claiming a lack of due process in the failure of the Selective\nRetention Board and General Centracchio to recite the reasons\nunderlying Major Wigginton's non-retention, alleged a failure to follow\n\"the criteria set forth in [NGR 635-102].\" The District Court held, in\nreliance on this court's decision in Navas v. González Vales, 752 F.2d\n765, 769-70 (1st Cir. 1985), that, because Major Wigginton had not\nsought review by the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records\nof the challenged selective retention procedures, his claim of non-\ncompliance with NGR 635-102 \"was nonreviewable as a matter of\nadministrative law.\" When translated into this court's language in\nNavas, the District Court's holding may be taken as signifying that\nMajor Wigginton's \"regulatory claim [was] a nonjusticiable military\nmatter as he failed to exhaust his intraservice administrative\nremedies.\" 752 F.2d at 771. (Given our ruling in Navas, it is\nunsurprising that appellant has not pressed the NGR 635-102 issue on\nthis appeal).\n\n  As noted in the text, supra, the District Court's analysis of Major\nWigginton's claim of due process entitlement to be told the reasons for\nnon-retention gave some attention to the Rhode Island Supreme Court's\nopinion in Ouimette, supra and it also mentioned the United States\nSupreme Court's opinion in Mathews v. Eldridge, supra. That aspect of\nthe analysis could be read as rejecting Major Wigginton's due process\nclaim as being unpersuasive as a matter of constitutional law.\nHowever, a later portion of the analysis culminated in emphasizing \"the\ntremendous deference owed to military decision making.\" In view of\nthis latter observation, it seems fair to conclude that the District\nCourt, in stating that \"[t]hese [second count] claims are not\njusticiable,\" did indeed mean that no part of the second count was\nlitigable.\n\n                                 -13-\n\forders . . . . have not been briefed by the parties on appeal, and we\n\ndo not address them in this case\"; among those unaddressed issues was\n\na district court ruling \"that plaintiff's case was justiciable.\" But\n\nsince, in the case at bar, justiciability has been preserved as an\n\nissue, we are obligated to address it. Moreover, we are persuaded that\n\nwe should address the issue as it relates to both counts of Major\n\nWigginton's complaint. Since justiciability is an issue which, as\n\npresented to the District Court, posed a question as to the authority\n\nof that court to proceed with any aspect of Major Wigginton's case, we\n\ndo not think that appellees' decision to present the issue to this\n\ncourt in truncated form     -   directed at the second count of the\n\ncomplaint but, as we read appellees' brief, not the first count -\n\nshould operate to confine our inquiry. We are reinforced in this\n\nconclusion by the fact that we have not identified any readily arguable\n\ndoctrinal basis for supposing that appellant's second count may be less\n\n- or more - justiciable than his first count. Accordingly, we turn to\n\na consideration of the comprehensive submission advanced by General\n\nCentracchio in his motion to dismiss in the District Court: \"internal\n\nmilitary personnel decisions concerning a member's fitness for duty\n\nhave long been held to be non-reviewable by civilian courts.\"\n\n          The District Court, in its opinion granting summary judgment,\n\nrecapitulated its prior ruling in which it had reviewed the\n\nrecommendation of the Magistrate Judge:\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          that this case should be dismissed as a\n          nonjusticiable controversy. See Report and\n          Recommendation at 10 (February 5, 1997) (citing\n          United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 683-84\n          (1987) and Chappell v.

By order dated March 31, 1998, this\n          court declined to accept this recommendation in\n          toto, finding     that only claims for damages\n                            are categorically barred by\n                            the doctrine of intramilitary\n                            immunity and that injunctive\n                            remedies may be available to\n                            state guardsmen.       Compare\n                            Wright v. Park, 5 F.3d 586,\n                            589-90    (1st   Cir.    1993)\n                            (holding claims for damages on\n                            account of injuries incident\n                            to military service are\n                            barred) with Charles v. Rice,\n                            28 F.3d 1312, 1321 (1st Cir.\n                            1994) (affirming exercise of\n                            federal question jurisdiction\n                            over national guardsman's\n                            claim for reinstatement).\n                            Accordingly, the court ruled\n                            that    this    matter      was\n                            justiciable.\n\n          The District Court correctly parsed our decision in Wright\n\nv. Park. That decision built upon the Supreme Court's 1983 decision in\n\nChappell v. Wallace, supra, and the Court's 1987 decision in United\n\nStates v. Stanley, supra. In Chappell, the Supreme Court held that,\n\n\"[t]aken together, the unique disciplinary structure of the Military\n\nEstablishment and Congress' activity in the field constitute special\n\nfactors which dictate that it would be inappropriate to provide\n\nenlisted military personnel with a Bivens-type remedy against their\n\nsuperior officers.\" 462 U.S. at 304. (We explained, in Wright v.\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fPark, that \" Bivens is the case establishing, as a general proposition,\n\nthat victims of a constitutional violation perpetrated by a federal\n\nactor may sue the offender for damages in federal court despite the\n\nabsence of explicit statutory authorization for such suits.\" 5 F.3d at\n\n589 n.4). Stanley substantially widened Chappell. Stanley - as we\n\nnoted in Wright v. Park - \"concluded that the Chappell approach should\n\napply to all activities performed 'incident to service' rather than\n\nmerely to activities performed within the officer/subordinate sphere.\n\nStanley, 483 U.S. at 680-81.\" 5 F.3d at 590.9 Our recognition that,\n\npursuant to Stanley, \"no Bivens remedy is available for injuries that\n\n'arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service,'\"\n\n483 U.S. at 146, led us to state in Wright v. Park that \"we now join\n\nseveral of our sister circuits in accepting this bright-line rule as\n\nthe definitive statement on the justiciability of civil rights claims\n\nin the military context, including the National Guard.\" 5 F.3d at 590.\n\n We then went on to point out that \"Wright's suit\" - the suit at issue\n\nin Wright v. Park - \"invoked the Civil Rights Act rather than following\n\nthe Bivens route. But, absent a specific statutory provision to the\n\ncontrary, there is no principled basis for according state actors sued\n\n\n9 As we observed in Wright v. Park, 5 F.3d at 590, the Stanley Court\nfound, see 483 U.S. at 684, that its broadening of Chappell was\nrequired in order to maintain doctrinal symmetry with Feres v. United\nStates, 340 U.S. 135 (1950), which foreclosed damage actions against\nthe United States \"under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to\nservicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of\nactivity incident to service.\" Id. at 146.\n\n                                 -16-\n\funder 42 U.S.C. §1983 a different degree of immunity than would be\n\naccorded federal actors sued for an identical abridgement of rights\n\nunder Bivens.\" Wright v. Park, 5 F.3d at 591. Thus, Wright v. Park\n\nprecludes § 1983 damage actions that \"arise out of or are in the course\n\nof activity incident to service,\" including National Guard service.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court in the case at bar was correct in its\n\nunderstanding that all intramilitary damage actions are foreclosed by\n\nWright v. Park.\n\n          Was the District Court also correct in concluding that \"only\n\nclaims for damages are categorically barred\" (emphasis added)? The\n\nDistrict Court gleaned this from Charles v. Rice. That case, as the\n\nDistrict Court pointed out, was an instance of \"exercise of federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction over [a] national guardsman's claim for\n\nreinstatement.\" However, Charles v. Rice is not binding authority for\n\nthe propriety of that exercise of federal question jurisdiction. As we\n\nhave already had occasion to point out, in Charles v. Rice the issue of\n\nthe justiciability of the reinstatement suit brought by the plaintiff\n\nnational guardsman was addressed by the district court in an\n\ninterlocutory ruling but was not preserved as an issue on appeal, with\n\nthe result that this court expressly refrained from passing on the\n\nissue. 28 F.3d at 1316 n.2. We are satisfied, nonetheless, that in\n\nruling - contrary to the Magistrate Judge's assessment - that Major\n\nWigginton's suit was justiciable, the District Court was correct in\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fconcluding that Wright v. Park is not a bar to a guardsman's\n\nreinstatement suit, whether brought against federal actors or, as in\n\nthe case at bar, against state actors pursuant to § 1983. This is so\n\nfor two reasons:\n\n          The first reason is that, as the foregoing reprise of Wright\n\nv. Park establishes, our opinion in that case was solely concerned with\n\nintramilitary suits for damages, whether brought against federal actors\n\nor, under § 1983, against state actors.\n\n          The second, and controlling, reason is that, taken together,\n\nChappell and Stanley - the Supreme Court decisions Wright v. Park built\n\nupon - make it clear that intramilitary suits alleging constitutional\n\nviolations but not seeking damages are justiciable.\n\n          In Chappell, the unanimous Court, in an opinion by Chief\n\nJustice Burger, held that a federal district court could not entertain\n\na Bivens-type damage action in which Navy enlisted personnel complained\n\nof racial discrimination at the hands of the officers in command of the\n\nnaval vessel on which the plaintiffs served. In the concluding section\n\nof the opinion, Chief Justice Burger wrote:\n\n\n              Chief Justice Warren had occasion to note\n          that \"our citizens in u n i f o r m m a y n o t b e\n          stripped of basic rights simply because they have\n          doffed their civilian clothes.\" Warren, The Bill\n          of Rights and the Military, 37 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n          181, 188 (1962). This Court has never held, nor\n          do we now hold, that military personnel are\n          barred from all redress in civilian courts for\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f          constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of\n          military service. See, e.g., Brown v. Glines,\n          444 U.S. 348 (1980); Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733\n          (1974); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677\n          (1973). But the special relationships that\n          define military life have \"supported the military\n          establishment's broad power to deal with its own\n          personnel. The most obvious reason is that\n          courts are ill-equipped to determine the impact\n          upon discipline that any particular intrusion\n          upon military authority might have.\" Warren,\n          supra, at 187.\n\n             We hold that enlisted military personnel may\n          not maintain a suit to recover damages from a\n          superior officer for alleged constitutional\n          violations.\n\n462 U.S. at 304-05.\n\n          Four years later, in Stanley, the Court addressed the\n\nquestion whether a plaintiff could bring a Bivens-type damage action,\n\nyears after having been discharged from the Army, against Army\n\npersonnel not all of whom had been his military superiors; the gravamen\n\nof plaintiff's complaint was that, while in service, he had volunteered\n\nto participate in what was represented as being a test of protective\n\nmilitary equipment but was in fact a test of the effects of LSD, and\n\nthat as part of the test he had been given doses of what - unbeknownst\n\nto him until years after his discharge - was LSD, with deleterious\n\nconsequences.   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in\n\ndistinguishing Chappell and ruling that Stanley's suit was viable,\n\nStanley v. United States, 786 F.2d 1490, 1495 (11th Cir. 1986), had\n\nquoted Chief Justice Burger's statement in Chappell that \"[t]his Court\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fhas never held, nor do we now hold, that military personnel are barred\n\nfrom all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs suffered\n\nin the course of military service.\" Chappell, 462 U.S. at 304. But\n\nthe Supreme Court in Stanley, in reversing the Eleventh Circuit, ruled\n\nthat Chief Justice Burger's statement was inapposite to Bivens-type\n\nactions such as the one brought by Stanley.         \"As the citations\n\nimmediately following that statement suggest, it referred to redress\n\ndesigned to halt or prevent the constitutional violation rather than\n\nthe award of money damages.\" 483 U.S. at 683. Justice Brennan, joined\n\nby Justice Marshall, filed an extended opinion, concurring in part and\n\ndissenting in part; but that opinion clearly recognized that the\n\nCourt's opinion left undisturbed a military plaintiff's entitlement to\n\npursue an equitable action to bring constitutional violations to an\n\nend.   Justice Brennan's expressed concern was that, for one in\n\nStanley's circumstances, equitable relief would be unavailing. \"Of\n\ncourse experimentation with unconsenting soldiers, like any\n\nconstitutional violation, may be enjoined if and when discovered. An\n\ninjunction, however, comes too late for those already injured; for\n\nthese victims, 'it is damages or nothing.' Bivens, 403 U.S. at 410\n\n(Harlan, J., concurring).\"     483 U.S. at 690.10\n\n\n\n\n10Justice Stevens joined a portion of Justice Brennan's opinion, but\nnot the portion from which the quotation is taken.\n\n                                -20-\n\f           In short, the lesson implicit in Wright v. Park is express\n\nin Stanley: Major Wigginton's suit alleging federal constitutional\n\nviolations and seeking reinstatement in Rhode Island's national guard\n\nis cognizable in a federal district court.\n\n           We turn, now, to a consideration of the merits of appellant's\n\nclaims.\n\n                                 III.\n\n           Appellant, as we have previously explained, makes two claims.\n\nThe first claim is that the joint action of the Selective Retention\n\nBoard and General Centracchio in terminating his status as a RIANG\n\nofficer has deprived him, without due process, of a property right,\n\nconferred by R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, to continue to \"hold [his]\n\nposition\" as an officer of the Rhode Island guard \"until [he] shall\n\nhave reached the age of sixty (60) years.\" The second claim is that\n\nthe non-disclosure to Major Wigginton of the reasons for the Selective\n\nRetention Board's recommendation of non-retention - a recommendation\n\nwhich General Centracchio promptly accepted and acted upon - was, from\n\na due process perspective, a constitutionally fatal flaw in the non-\n\nretention process.\n\n           We will first address appellant's narrowly focused second\n\nclaim.11\n\n11In conformity with our ruling that appellant's suit is justiciable\nbecause it is a suit in equity rather than a damage action, we assume,\narguendo, that if (1) we determine that appellant is correct as a\n\n                                 -21-\n\f                                  A.\n\n          As noted earlier in this opinion, appellant's second claim -\n\nthat he had a due process right to be told the reasons for his non-\n\nretention - invokes the Rhode Island Supreme Court's determination in\n\nOuimette, supra, that Rhode Island's parole board must, as a matter of\n\ndue process, state its reasons when it denies parole. See also Pine v.\n\nClark, 636 A.2d 1319, 1324 (R.I. 1994); State v. Tillinghast, 609 A.2d\n\n217, 218 (R.I. 1992). Ouimette, decided in 1976, anticipated the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court's pronouncement three years later in\n\nGreenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 16 (1979), that\n\n\"[t]he Nebraska procedure affords an opportunity to be heard, and when\n\nparole is denied it informs the inmate in what respects he falls short\n\nof qualifying for parole; this affords the process that is due under\n\nthese circumstances.\" Cf. id. at 20-21 (Powell, J., concurring in part\n\nand dissenting in part); id. at 38-41 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan\n\nand Stevens, JJ., dissenting in part). See generally 59 Am. Jur. 2d\n\nPardon and Parole § 90 (1987) (\"Right to Statement of Reasons for\n\nDenial of Parole\" (collecting cases)).\n\n\n\nmatter of legal theory with respect to at least one of his alternative\nconstitutional claims, and (2) appellant is then found by the District\nCourt to have established the predicate facts supporting such claim,\nthe District Court would conclude that appellant would be entitled to\nsome form of equitable relief. Whether such hypothesized relief might\nproperly encompass any of the several particularized types of relief\nsought in appellant's complaint need not be considered at this stage of\nthis litigation.\n\n                                 -22-\n\f           In his brief on appeal, appellant finds it \"ironic\" that\n\nappellees should take \"the position that a convicted felon is entitled\n\nto greater due process protection from the parole board than a\n\ndecorated veteran is from the Rhode Island National Guard.\" We think,\n\nhowever, that appellant's submission, while perhaps having some\n\nrhetorical appeal, does not adequately assess the relative interests at\n\nstake of, on the one hand, a person who seeks continuity in employment\n\nand, on the other hand, one who seeks release from confinement. By\n\nconflating, rather than distinguishing between, these two scenarios,\n\nappellant's analysis appears to overlook the fundamental precept that\n\n\"[t]he applicability of the guarantee of procedural due process depends\n\nin the first instance on the presence of a legitimate 'property' or\n\n'liberty' interest within the meaning of the Fifth or Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.\" Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 164 (1974) (Powell, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and concurring in the result in part).\n\n           Reasons for denying parole are required to be stated because\n\ndenial of parole is denial of the most basic \"'liberty' interest.\" As\n\nJustice Powell observed in Greenholtz, 442 U.S. at 18, \"[l]iberty from\n\nbodily restraint always has been recognized as the core of the liberty\n\nprotected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental\n\naction.\"\n\n           Appellant's interest is of a different sort. On the verge\n\nof completing twenty years of military service - the great bulk of it\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fas a commissioned RIANG officer - Major Wigginton wished to be one of\n\nthe twenty-year guard officers selected to continue in service (with,\n\nindeed, some possibility of further promotion) pursuant to a program\n\nunder which - since there are \"comparatively few higher level command\n\nand staff positions\"12 - only a portion of the twenty-year officers can\n\nbe selected for retention. Manifestly, what was at stake for Major\n\nWigginton was not a \"'liberty' interest.\" In order to qualify for\n\nprocedural due process protection, Major Wigginton's hope for retention\n\nwould, therefore, have to be a \"'property' interest.\" But in the\n\nabsence of an employment contract for a stated time period, or some\n\nanalogous hiring engagement contemplating a form of job tenure,13 Major\n\nWigginton had no cognizable property interest in continued employment\n\nin RIANG - unless R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, the statute which underpins\n\nappellant's first count, applies to appellant and vested in appellant\n\n\n\n12   See supra note 1 and accompanying text.\n13  Academic tenure is, of course, a widespread phenomenon, and\nabridgement of tenured employment not infrequently gives rise to\nlitigation. See, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589,\n592 (1967); Keefe v. Geanakos, 418 F.2d 359, 363 (1st Cir. 1969)\n(speaking for this court, then-Chief Judge Aldrich observed: \"Academic\nfreedom is not preserved by compulsory retirement, even at full pay.\").\nTenure for a period of years is a standard concomitant of elective\noffice, see Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486 (1969); Bond v. Floyd,\n385 U.S. 116 (1966), and it is also a usual concomitant of those\nappointive offices that are intended not to be subject to direction by\nthe executive branch. See Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295\nU.S. 602 (1935); Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 167-68 (\"It\nis, then, the opinion of the Court . . . that the appointment conferred\non him a legal right to the office for the space of five years.\").\n\n                                 -24-\n\fa property right to hold his RIANG commission until age sixty. In\n\nshort, whether appellant has a viable due process claim under the\n\nsecond count of his complaint depends, in the first instance, on the\n\nanswer to the questions of Rhode Island law with respect to the proper\n\nconstruction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 that are central to\n\nappellant's claim under the first count of his complaint - the\n\nquestions to which we now turn.14\n\n                                   B.\n\n          It is Major Wigginton's basic submission - key to the first\n\ncount of his complaint, and for the reasons we have just discussed, to\n\nthe second count as well - that R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 gave him a\n\nproperty right, of which he could not be deprived without due process,\n\nto   retain   his   RIANG   commission   until   age   sixty.   Such   a\n\nconstitutionally protected property right to retain a public position\n\nfor a stated term arises when state law has conferred upon a public\n\nposition elements of continuity sufficient to support the conclusion\n\n\n\n14 In saying that \"whether appellant has a viable due process claim\nunder the second count\" depends on a determination of the proper\nconstruction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, we do not mean to suggest\nthat if appellant's construction of the statute is correct, he\nnecessarily will prevail on his second count claim. To prevail,\nappellant would have to establish that (1) his state law entitlement is\nstrong enough to constitute a federally protected right, see text infra\nat note 15, and (2) by not being informed of the reasons for non-\nretention he was denied due process. Whether appellant's due process\nargument has merit need not be addressed unless appellant's contention\nthat R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 conferred upon him a federally protected\nright is sustained.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fthat, as a matter of federal law, the person asserting the due process\n\nclaim has \"an enforceable expectation of continued public employment.\"\n\nBishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 345 (1976).15 In order to address Major\n\nWigginton's contention that the statute establishes such a property\n\nright, it may be helpful to set forth once again the full text of the\n\nstatute:\n\n           All commissioned officers of the staff corps and\n           departments, hereafter appointed, shall have had\n           previous military experience, except chaplains,\n           officers of the judge advocate general's corps,\n           and medical corps officers. They shall hold\n           their positions until they shall have reached the\n           age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to\n           that time by reason of resignation or disability,\n           or for cause to be determined by an efficiency\n           board or a court-martial legally convened for\n           that purpose. Vacancies among these officers\n           shall be filled by appointment from the\n           commissioned officers of the national guard or\n           from such other civilians as may be specifically\n           qualified for duty therein.\n\n\n\n\n15 Cf. cases cited supra note 13. \"The pretermination process due a\ngovernment employee is a matter of federal law, see Rivera-Flores v.\nPuerto Rico Tel. Co., 64 F.3d 742, (1st Cir. 1995), whereas the\npreliminary question whether a government employee possessed a\nprotectable 'property right,' or a legitimate expectation of continued\nemployment, is controlled by the employment contract or state law. See\nid.\" Ortiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 17 (1st Cir. 1996);\naccord Fireside Nissan v.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the\n\nDistrict Court denied summary judgment in favor of appellant and\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of appellees.\n\n           We will now consider the grounds for the summary judgment\n\nrulings.\n\n                                  i.\n\n           With a view to elucidating the phrase \"staff corps and\n\ndepartments\" - a phrase that appears to have had its genesis in Rhode\n\nIsland law in 1956, when a statutory code governing RIANG was enacted16\n\n16 The phrase \"staff corps and departments\" appears in two other\nsections of the statutory code governing RIANG.

Frazer, former\n\nAssistant Adjutant General for Rhode Island and former Deputy\n\nCommanding General of RIANG, furnished an affidavit on Major\n\nWigginton's behalf. General Frazer stated that \"[i]n my opinion the HQ\n\nSTARC position of Education Officer is a Staff position.\"           With\n\nrespect to the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, General Frazer\n\nsaid:\n\n          This document and booklet called the Military\n          Code of Rhode Island is an archaic writing and\n          woefully outdated. However it is still utilized\n          in current day fashion within the National Guard.\n          I have no thought or idea what the writer was\n          trying to convey to the reader and that thought\n          can be argued into the future. It is my thought\n          and opinion that the term \"All commissioned\n          officers of the staff corps and departments\" was\n\n\n\n     the laws of the United States or the rules or regulations\n     prescribed thereunder for the organization and training of\n     the national guard.\n\n     (b) For that purpose, the number of commissioned officers,\n     warrant officers and enlisted men in any unit, organization,\n     staff corps, and department may be increased or diminished\n     and the grades of these commissioned officers, warrant\n     officers, and enlisted men may be altered to the extent\n     necessary to conform thereto.\n\n     (c) No organization of the national guard shall be disbanded\n     nor its minimum strength reduced except in conformity with\n     the laws of the United States.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-2-9.\n\n                                -29-\n\f          and is referring to the various Staff Officers of\n          the National Guard.\n\n          General Centracchio's expert was Colonel Rick Baccus, who\n\ngave extensive deposition testimony. At the time of his deposition,\n\nColonel Baccus was a supervisory logistics management specialist in\n\nRIANG; prior to that assignment he had served as RIANG's personnel\n\ndirector. When asked \"what is your definition of the term commissioned\n\nofficers of the states [sic] corps and departments in Rhode Island\n\nGeneral Law 30-3-13?,\" Colonel Baccus replied:\n\n          A. Since I wasn't involved in writing the law, it\n          would be difficult for me to give you a specific\n          definition, I can only surmise what I think the\n          definition is, and, again, it's referring to some\n          kind of specialty, a special staff position and\n          that's where I only drew the analogy.\n\n          Q. But you really don't know, do you?\n\n          A. No, sir, because I was not involved with the\n          law.\n\n\nA subsequent colloquy was to the same effect:\n\n\n          Q. We have focused a lot on the meaning of the\n          words staff corps, there's also the phrase in\n          there Rhode Island General Law?\n\n          A.   And departments.\n\n          Q.   Do you attach any meaning to that phrase?\n\n          A. No, not at all. Again, sir, I do not know\n          what the law, what the, you know, the authors of\n          the law or what they were basing the previous law\n\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f           under. They may have carried that forward from\n           previous law.\n\nWhen asked about the meaning of \"staff corps and departments\" in R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 30-3-1 (another provision of the statutory code governing\n\nRIANG in which the phrase appears)17 Colonel Baccus responded:\n\n           To be honest, sir, because I was not involved\n           with writing law, I'm not sure, there is no\n           equivalent to today's terminology.\n\n           After noting that neither General Frazer nor Colonel Baccus\n\npurported to be able to offer a coherent construction of \"staff corps\n\nand departments,\" the District Court ruled as follows:\n\n           Of course, in this case, it is incumbent on Major\n           Wigginton to establish that he was a member of\n           the \"staff corps and departments.\" Even he\n           cannot say with any conviction that he held such\n           commission. In fact, although Major Wigginton at\n           one time \"believed\" he was a member of the staff\n           corps, he now admits that he was \"never an\n           officer of a corps identified as staff corps\n           officer.\"    On this basis Major Wigginton's\n           substantive due process claim must fail.\n\n           Here we part company with the District Court. On cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment, a plaintiff loses if he cannot produce\n\nevidence tending to establish a fact that, under the governing law, the\n\nplaintiff is required to prove in order to make out his cause of\n\naction. But that was not the situation at the point that the District\n\nCourt granted summary judgment against appellant and in favor of\n\nappellees. When the District Court granted summary judgment, no\n\n17   For the text of § 30-3-1, see supra note 16.\n\n                                 -31-\n\fdetermination had been arrived at as to what the governing law was.\n\nThat is to say, neither the meaning of the phrase \"staff corps and\n\ndepartments\" as used in R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-13-3, nor the extent of the\n\nrights created by that statute if applicable, had been judicially\n\nresolved. And under those circumstances, there was no way to tell\n\nwhether the evidence adduced by Major Wigginton would, if credited by\n\na fact-finder, suffice as a matter of Rhode Island law to present the\n\nfederal constitutional question whether state law rights had been\n\nabridged without due process.18 Accordingly, it was error to grant\n\nsummary judgment on the first count in favor of General Centracchio and\n\nthe State of Rhode Island. And it would, a fortiori, have been error\n\nto grant summary judgment in favor of Major Wigginton. To prevail on\n\nhis motion for summary judgment, it would have been necessary for Major\n\nWigginton to have established (1) that, as a matter of Rhode Island\n\nlaw, at the time of his discharge from RIANG, he (a) came within the\n\nembrace of the phrase \"staff corps and departments,\" as used in R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 30-3-13, and (b) was, therefore, entitled (in the absence\n\n\n18 The District Court found it significant that, \"although Major\nWigginton at one time 'believed' he was a member of the staff corps, he\nnow admits that he was 'never an officer of a corps identified as staff\ncorps officer.'\" But neither the fact that Major Wigginton \"at one\ntime 'believed' he was a member of the staff corps\" nor the fact that\nhe subsequently acknowledged \"that he was 'never an officer of a corps\nidentified as staff corps'\" could be a datum of any ascertainable legal\nsignificance prior to a time at which the term \"staff corps,\" as used\nin the statutory phrase \"staff corps and departments,\" would acquire,\nthrough judicial construction, some concrete legal meaning. Such a\ntime has not yet arrived.\n\n                                 -32-\n\fof resignation, disability, or dismissal for cause) to continue as a\n\nRIANG officer until age sixty;19 and (2) that, as a matter of federal\n\nlaw, (a) his state law entitlement to retain his RIANG position until\n\nage sixty constituted \"an enforceable expectation of continued public\n\nemployment,\" Bishop v. Wood, supra, 426 U.S. at 345, and (b) he had\n\nbeen deprived of that constitutionally protected state law entitlement\n\nwithout due process of law.\n\n          Prior to a construction by the District Court of R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws § 30-13-3, neither of the cross-motions for summary judgment was\n\nripe for disposition.\n\n                                 ii.\n\n          As we have just observed, the District Court did not arrive\n\nat a dispositive construction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13. We can do no\n\nbetter.\n\n          The general thrust of the first two sentences of the statute\n\nis apparent. Those persons who are \"commissioned officers of the staff\n\ncorps and departments . . . shall hold their positions until they have\n\nreached the age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to that time\n\nby reason of resignation or disability, or for cause to be determined\n\nby an efficiency board or a court martial.\" Major Wigginton - a\n\n\n\n19Such entitlement would appear substantial enough to support what the\nSupreme Court has characterized as \"an enforceable expectation of\ncontinued public employment.\" Bishop v. Wood, supra, 462 U.S. at 345.\nSee supra note 15.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fcommissioned officer of RIANG who had not reached age sixty, and who\n\nhad not been retired by reason of resignation or disability, or for\n\ncause - would appear (absent any other contingencies attached to Major\n\nWigginton's continued employment by R.I. law) to be within the\n\nprotective embrace of the statute if he was an officer of the \"staff\n\ncorps and departments.\" But what that latter phrase means remains\n\nunclear.   The first sentence of the statute - \"All commissioned\n\nofficers of the staff corps and departments, hereafter appointed, shall\n\nhave had previous military experience, except chaplains, officers of\n\nthe judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers.\" -\n\nmakes it plain that the phrase \"staff corps and departments\" connotes\n\na cohort inclusive of, but broader than, \"chaplains, officers of the\n\njudge advocate general's corps, and medical officers.\"        How much\n\nbroader?    Broad enough to include Major Wigginton, an officer\n\noriginally commissioned in the Military Police, later assigned as a\n\nPublic Affairs Officer, and ultimately acting as an Education Officer?\n\nWe derive no useful textual guidance from the two other provisions of\n\nthe statutory code governing RIANG that employ the phrase \"staff corps\n\nand departments.\"20 Appellant and appellees, in their submissions to\n\n\n20   See supra note 16.\n\n   It may be noted that the laws of Massachusetts governing the\nMassachusetts guard provide that an officer of the \"state staff\" is\nentitled to \"hold his position until he reaches the age of sixty-five\nyears unless separated prior to that time by resignation, disability,\nor for cause by a court-martial legally convened for that purpose.\"\n\n                                 -34-\n\fthis court, have been unable to adduce any useful legislative history\n\nof R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 and we have found none.      Further, the\n\nparties have not cited any pertinent decisions construing R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws § 30-3-13; and our research confirms that no court (whether a\n\nRhode Island court, a federal court, or a court of another state) has,\n\nin a reported opinion, construed \"staff corps and departments\" as\n\nutilized in R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 (or, indeed, as utilized in either\n\nof the two other provisions of the statutory code governing RIANG that\n\nemploy the phrase).\n\n          Thus, what we have before us is a Rhode Island statute which\n\nis a tabula rasa.   Moreover, the state military code of which the\n\nstatute is a part is a very special kind of state legislative\n\nenactment, for the code governs the Rhode Island aspects of a joint\n\nstate-federal enterprise of great importance - the Rhode Island Army\n\nNational Guard. Under these circumstances, in order to achieve a\n\nresponsible resolution of the issues presented by this pending appeal,\n\nit plainly would be better to have a current and authoritative\n\nconstruction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 by the Rhode Island judiciary\n\nthan to have a conjectured prophecy by this court of what Rhode\n\nIsland's courts might be expected to rule at some future time.\n\nHappily, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has in place a procedure\n\n\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 33, § 15(a). However, § 15 goes on to identify,\nby specific military designation, the several officers who compose the\n\"state staff.\"\n\n                                 -35-\n\fpursuant to which it \"may answer questions of law certified to it by .\n\n. . a Court of Appeals of the United States   . . . when requested by\n\nthe certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before it\n\nquestions of law which may be determinative of the cause then pending\n\nin the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying\n\ncourt there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this\n\ncourt.\" Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules, Art. I, Rule 6, § 1. The\n\nquoted rule precisely describes the circumstance in which this court\n\nfinds itself. In the pending appeal, what may prove determinative of\n\nthe cause are answers by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island to two\n\nquestions of Rhode Island law framed by the facts previously set forth\n\nin this opinion:\n\n          1. At the time Major Wigginton was discharged\n          from RIANG, was he an officer of the \"staff corps\n          and departments\" within the meaning of R.I. Gen.\n          Laws § 30-3-13?\n\n          2. If the answer to Question 1 is \"Yes,\" does\n          that signify that, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws §\n          30-3-13, Major Wigginton was (in the absence of\n          resignation, disability, or dismissal for cause)\n          therefore entitled to continue as a RIANG officer\n          until age sixty, or would Rhode Island's\n          statutory and/or decisional law attach any other\n          contingency to Major Wigginton's continued status\n          as a RIANG officer?\n\n          Accordingly, by an appropriate Certification Order\n\naccompanying this opinion, we are certifying these questions of Rhode\n\nIsland law to the Supreme Court of Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n                                -36-\n\f\f",

This case involves a claim by the\n\nplaintiff - the appellant in this court - that his status as a\n\ncommissioned officer in the Rhode Island Army National Guard was\n\nwrongfully terminated. Plaintiff challenged that termination by suit\n\nbrought, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in a Rhode Island state court\n\nagainst two defendants - appellees in this court - the Adjutant General\n\nof the Rhode Island Army National Guard and the State of Rhode Island.\n\nThe suit was removed to the United States District Court for Rhode\n\nIsland. Following brief discovery, the District Court granted the\n\nAdjutant General's motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in\n\nfavor of both defendants.     This appeal followed.\n\n                                  I.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          The facts giving rise to the plaintiff-appellant's claim are\n\nstraightforward and may be quickly stated:\n\n          Eugene E. Wigginton served in the United States Marine Corps\n\nfrom April of 1967 to September of 1970, when he was honorably\n\ndischarged.   Nine years later - in July of 1979 - the plaintiff\n\nreceived a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army\n\nReserve. As concomitants of his status as a commissioned reserve\n\nofficer, Lieutenant Wigginton was appointed an officer of the United\n\nStates Army National Guard (\"USANG\") and of the Rhode Island Army\n\nNational Guard (\"RIANG\"), with assignment to a RIANG Military Police\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\funit. As the years went by, Lieutenant Wigginton received periodic\n\npromotions, reaching the rank of major in 1989. In January of 1996,\n\nMajor Wigginton (by then assigned as a Public Affairs Officer and\n\nserving as a RIANG Education Officer) was nearing completion of twenty\n\nyears of military service (more than three years in the Marines, and\n\nalmost seventeen years in USANG and RIANG). In that month he received\n\nfrom Brigadier General Reginald A. Centracchio, Adjutant General of\n\nRhode Island, a memorandum captioned \"Consideration for Selective\n\nRetention.\" The memorandum advised Major Wigginton that his status\n\nwould be considered in May of 1996 by a Selective Retention Board,\n\nconvened pursuant to National Guard Regulation [\"NGR\"] 635-102 - a\n\nregulation, promulgated in 1988, titled \"Personnel Separations OFFICERS\n\nAND WARRANT OFFICERS SELECTIVE RETENTION.\" The Selective Retention\n\nBoard, according to General Centracchio's memorandum, would \"consider\n\ncommissioned and warrant officers in the grade of colonel and below who\n\nhave completed 20 years of qualifying service for retired pay.\" A\n\nprincipal goal of the selective retention process is \"[e]nsuring that\n\nonly the most capable officers are retained beyond 20 years of\n\nqualifying service for assignment to the comparatively few higher level\n\ncommand and staff positions.\" NGR 635-102 § 3(a).1 Meeting on May 13,\n\n1 As the District Court explained: \"'Selective retention' is a policy\ninstituted by the United States Army through which officers in the\nUSANG who have completed 20 years of commissioned service are\nreevaluated at regular intervals to determine whether they should be\nretained for further service. The program is designed to ensure combat\n\n                                 -4-\n\f1996, the Board convened by General Centracchio considered the records\n\nof ten officers.   Major Wigginton (and presumably the other nine\n\nofficers) did not appear before the Board; NGR 635-102 states that\n\n\"[i]ndividuals are not authorized to appear.\" Via a memorandum to\n\nGeneral Centracchio dated May 13, the Board recommended that six\n\nofficers be retained and that four officers, of whom Major Wigginton\n\nwas one, not be retained.    On the following day - May 14, 1996 -\n\nGeneral Centracchio sent Major Wigginton a memorandum stating, inter\n\nalia, that \"[y]ou have been considered for retention in accordance with\n\n[NGR 635-102] and have not been selected. Accordingly, you will be\n\nseparated from the Army National Guard by 13 July 1996.\" On July 18,\n\n1996, Colonel Anthony J. Zoglio, director of personnel for RIANG, sent\n\nMajor Wigginton a memorandum advising him that, effective July 13, he\n\nhad been separated from the Army National Guard by honorable discharge.\n\nAt the time of his discharge, Major Wigginton was a Public Affairs\n\nOfficer, serving as Education Officer of RIANG; he was forty-six years\n\nold.\n\n                                  B.\n\n          In September of 1996, Major Wigginton brought suit in the\n\nRhode Island Superior Court against General Centracchio and the State\n\n\n\n\nreadiness throughout the entire National Guard and to inhibit\nstagnation in the senior grades.\"\n\n                                 -5-\n\fof Rhode Island. The suit, in two counts, was brought pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n\n          The first count alleged that plaintiff's separation from the\n\nservice, and his consequent ineligibility for promotion to lieutenant\n\ncolonel, contravened Section 30-3-13 (1994 Reenactment) of Rhode Island\n\nGeneral Laws.

General Centracchio\n\n\n\n\n2  The second count also alleged that \"the criteria set forth in\nNational Guard Regulation 635-102 [to be considered in determining\nwhether or not a person should be retained in the National Guard] were\nnot followed with respect to plaintiff's case.\" However, plaintiff has\nnot pursued this claim on appeal.\n3 Here and elsewhere in his pleadings plaintiff employs the singular\n\"defendant,\" notwithstanding that there are two named defendants -\nGeneral Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthen moved to dismiss.4        The District Court referred the case to a\n\nMagistrate Judge, who recommended dismissal for lack of justiciability.\n\n    The Magistrate Judge was of the view that the case at bar, a § 1983\n\naction brought by a subordinate military officer against a military\n\nsuperior and arising out of military service, was barred by this\n\ncourt's decision in Wright v.

Wright\n\nv.

The Magistrate Judge concluded that \"the Wright court\n\nadopted the following bright-line rule: actions against military\n\nofficers for injuries that are 'incident to service' are not\n\njusticiable, whether these actions are filed pursuant to § 1983 or\n\nBivens.\" Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of\n\nthe complaint.

See R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 (\"[A]ll commissioned\n\nofficers of the staff corps and departments . . . shall hold their\n\npositions until they have reached the age of sixty years.\")        The\n\nparties were in flat disagreement as to the proper construction of the\n\nRhode Island statute. The defense contended that the statute was\n\ninapplicable because Major Wigginton was not an officer \"of the staff\n\ncorps and departments.\"     Major Wigginton contended that he was.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court authorized discovery for the limited\n\npurpose of providing the parties with an enhanced opportunity to\n\nelucidate the meaning of that statutory phrase.       At the close of\n\ndiscovery, both General Centracchio and Major Wigginton moved for\n\nsummary judgment.6\n\n\n\n\n6 Notwithstanding that the State of Rhode Island is a named defendant\nin this litigation, the State did not join General Centracchio's motion\nfor summary judgment. See infra note 7.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          The District Court filed an opinion which reaffirmed its\n\nprior ruling on justiciability but found against Major Wigginton on\n\nboth counts of his complaint - the first count's due process claim\n\nbased on R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 and the second count's claim that the\n\nSelective Retention Board and General Centracchio had denied Major\n\nWigginton due process by not explaining to him the reasons for his non-\n\nretention.   Accordingly, the District Court granted the summary\n\njudgment motion of General Centracchio, denied that of Major Wigginton,\n\nand entered judgment against Major Wigginton and in favor of General\n\nCentracchio and the State of Rhode Island.7\n\n          With respect to Major Wigginton's claim under the first count\n\n– i.e., the claim that he had a protected property right arising under\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 of which he could not be deprived without due\n\nprocess of law - the District Court stated:\n\n          Plaintiff presents the affidavit of Brigadier\n          General Thomas M. Frazer, RIANG (Ret.), an\n          authority on Rhode Island military history. At\n          plaintiff's request, General Frazer reviewed the\n          Military Code of Rhode Island and found it to be\n          \"archaic and woefully outdated.\"        Although\n          General Frazer educated the court as to the\n          historical distinctions between line, staff, and\n          general officers, he was unfamiliar with any\n          \"staff corps\" in the Rhode Island National Guard,\n\n7 The docket sheet establishes that, concurrently with the grant of\nGeneral Centracchio's motion for summary judgment, judgment was entered\nin favor of both defendants. On this appeal, a single brief has been\nfiled for General Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island. (The\ndocket sheet does not reflect any challenge to the inclusion of the\nState of Rhode Island as a named defendant).\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          and he could only speculate as to what was meant\n          by \"and departments.\" Speaking specifically\n          about the text of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13,\n          Frazer stated quite candidly, \"I have no thought\n          or idea what the writer was trying to convey to\n          the reader . . . .\" The defendant's attempt to\n          discover the meaning of \"staff corps\" was no more\n          fruitful. Colonel Rick Baccus, director of\n          personnel and speaking on behalf of the RIANG,\n          was himself hard-pressed to explain to what the\n          expression \"staff corps and departments\" refers.\n\n          Of course, in this case, it is incumbent on Major\n          Wigginton to establish that he was a member of\n          the \"staff corps and departments.\" Even he\n          cannot say with any conviction that he held any\n          such commission.      In fact, although Major\n          Wigginton at one time \"believed\" he was a member\n          of the staff corps, he now admits that he was\n          \"never an officer of a corps identified as staff\n          corps officer.\" On this basis, Major Wigginton's\n          substantive due process claim must fail.\n\n          In addressing Major Wigginton's argument under the second\n\ncount that due process required a statement of reasons for his non-\n\nretention, the District Court noted Major Wigginton's reliance on State\n\nv.

In their brief\n\nin this court, appellees invoke \"well-settled case law that . . .\n\nclaims against superior officers by subordinates are not justicible\n\n[sic].\" However, appellees' invocation of \"well-settled case law\"\n\nmandating a finding of non-justiciability appears to be directed only\n\nat   appellant's   second   count,   and   not   at   the   first   count,\n\nnotwithstanding that in the District Court the non-justiciability\n\naspect of General Centracchio's motion to dismiss was addressed to\n\nMajor Wigginton's entire complaint, and was so treated by the\n\nMagistrate Judge in recommending to the District Court that Major\n\nWigginton's complaint be dismissed as presenting claims that were non-\n\njusticiable. Appellees' brief does not undertake to explain why the\n\nissue of justiciability has become narrower in focus between the\n\nDistrict Court and this court.8\n\n8 Possibly, the explanation is traceable to the fact that the District\nCourt, while disposing of the first count adversely to Major Wigginton\non the merits, did characterize its rejection of both prongs of the\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          If appellees, in their brief on appeal, had made no mention\n\nof justiciability, we might have regarded that issue as not before us.\n\nThat was the course taken by this court in Charles v.

(Given our ruling in Navas, it is\nunsurprising that appellant has not pressed the NGR 635-102 issue on\nthis appeal).\n\n  As noted in the </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">text,</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, the District Court's analysis of Major\nWigginton's claim of due process entitlement to be told the reasons for\nnon-retention gave some attention to the Rhode Island Supreme Court's\nopinion in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ouimette,</span> supra </span><pre class=\"inline\">and it also mentioned the United States\nSupreme Court's opinion in Mathews v. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Eldridge,</span> supra</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. That aspect of\nthe analysis could be read as rejecting Major Wigginton's due process\nclaim as being unpersuasive as a matter of constitutional law.\nHowever, a later portion of the analysis culminated in emphasizing \"the\ntremendous deference owed to military decision making.\" In view of\nthis latter observation, it seems fair to conclude that the District\nCourt, in stating that \"[t]hese [second count] claims are not\njusticiable,\" did indeed mean that no part of the second count was\nlitigable.\n\n                                 -13-\n\forders . . . . have not been briefed by the parties on appeal, and we\n\ndo not address them in this case\"; among those unaddressed issues was\n\na district court ruling \"that plaintiff's case was justiciable.\" But\n\nsince, in the case at bar, justiciability has been preserved as an\n\nissue, we are obligated to address it. Moreover, we are persuaded that\n\nwe should address the issue as it relates to both counts of Major\n\nWigginton's complaint. Since justiciability is an issue which, as\n\npresented to the District Court, posed a question as to the authority\n\nof that court to proceed with any aspect of Major Wigginton's case, we\n\ndo not think that appellees' decision to present the issue to this\n\ncourt in truncated form     -   directed at the second count of the\n\ncomplaint but, as we read appellees' brief, not the first count -\n\nshould operate to confine our inquiry. We are reinforced in this\n\nconclusion by the fact that we have not identified any readily arguable\n\ndoctrinal basis for supposing that appellant's second count may be less\n\n- or more - justiciable than his first count. Accordingly, we turn to\n\na consideration of the comprehensive submission advanced by General\n\nCentracchio in his motion to dismiss in the District Court: \"internal\n\nmilitary personnel decisions concerning a member's fitness for duty\n\nhave long been held to be non-reviewable by civilian courts.\"\n\n          The District Court, in its opinion granting summary judgment,\n\nrecapitulated its prior ruling in which it had reviewed the\n\nrecommendation of the Magistrate Judge:\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          that this case should be dismissed as a\n          nonjusticiable controversy.

Park is not a bar to a guardsman's\n\nreinstatement suit, whether brought against federal actors or, as in\n\nthe case at bar, against state actors pursuant to § 1983. This is so\n\nfor two reasons:\n\n          The first reason is that, as the foregoing reprise of Wright\n\nv. Park establishes, our opinion in that case was solely concerned with\n\nintramilitary suits for damages, whether brought against federal actors\n\nor, under § 1983, against state actors.\n\n          The second, and controlling, reason is that, taken together,\n\nChappell and Stanley - the Supreme Court decisions Wright v. Park built\n\nupon - make it clear that intramilitary suits alleging constitutional\n\nviolations but not seeking damages are justiciable.\n\n          In Chappell, the unanimous Court, in an opinion by Chief\n\nJustice Burger, held that a federal district court could not entertain\n\na Bivens-type damage action in which Navy enlisted personnel complained\n\nof racial discrimination at the hands of the officers in command of the\n\nnaval vessel on which the plaintiffs served. In the concluding section\n\nof the opinion, Chief Justice Burger wrote:\n\n\n              Chief Justice Warren had occasion to note\n          that \"our citizens in u n i f o r m m a y n o t b e\n          stripped of basic rights simply because they have\n          doffed their civilian clothes.\" Warren, The Bill\n          of Rights and the Military, 37 N.

By\n\nconflating, rather than distinguishing between, these two scenarios,\n\nappellant's analysis appears to overlook the fundamental precept that\n\n\"[t]he applicability of the guarantee of procedural due process depends\n\nin the first instance on the presence of a legitimate 'property' or\n\n'liberty' interest within the meaning of the Fifth or Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.\" Arnett v.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the\n\nDistrict Court denied summary judgment in favor of appellant and\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of appellees.\n\n           We will now consider the grounds for the summary judgment\n\nrulings.\n\n                                  i.\n\n           With a view to elucidating the phrase \"staff corps and\n\ndepartments\" - a phrase that appears to have had its genesis in Rhode\n\nIsland law in 1956, when a statutory code governing RIANG was enacted16\n\n16 The phrase \"staff corps and departments\" appears in two other\nsections of the statutory code governing RIANG. (For the reader's\nconvenience the phrase is printed in bold type):\n\n     The national guard shall consist of such number of federally\n     recognized general officers, officers, warrant officers, and\n     enlisted persons, duly commissioned, warranted, or enlisted\n     therein, including officers and enlisted persons of the\n     staff corps and departments, and organized as to branch or\n     arm of service into such federally recognized units,\n     organizations, corps, departments, or otherwise as shall be\n     authorized by the laws of the United States and the\n     regulations issued thereunder.\n\n                                 -27-\n\fR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-1.\n\n     Persons hereafter commissioned as officers of the national\n     guard shall be selected from the following classes:\n\n     (1) Officers or enlisted persons of the national guard;\n\n     (2) Officers, active or retired, reserve officers, and\n     former officers of the United States army, air force, navy,\n     marine corps, or coast guard, enlisted men and former\n     enlisted persons of the United States army, air force, navy,\n     marine corps, or coast guard who have received an honorable\n     discharge therefrom;\n\n     (3) Graduates of any of the United States military and naval\n     academies;\n\n     (4) Graduates of schools, colleges, universities, and\n     officers' training camps, where they have received military\n     instruction under the supervision of an officer of the armed\n     forces on active duty who certified their fitness for\n     appointment as commissioned officers;\n\n     (5) For the technical branches or staff corps and\n     departments, such other civilians as may be specially\n     qualified for duty therein; and\n\n     (6) Or otherwise, as the above classes shall be changed or\n     altered by the laws of the United States and the regulations\n     issued thereunder.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-11.\n\n Similar, but not identical, wording is to be found in the first sub-\nsection (here, in bold type) of a statute dealing with the governor's\nauthority to organize, and reorganize, units of the Rhode Island\nmilitia:\n\n     (a) The governor may organize, alter, increase, divide,\n     annex, consolidate, reorganize, disband, or decrease any\n     unit, organization, staff corps, and department whenever in\n     his or her judgment the efficiency of the state militia will\n     be thereby increased or to make the state conform to any\n     table of organization or system of training prescribed by\n\n                                -28-\n\f- the parties summoned experts:\n\n\n\n          Brigadier General (Retired) Thomas M. Frazer, former\n\nAssistant Adjutant General for Rhode Island and former Deputy\n\nCommanding General of RIANG, furnished an affidavit on Major\n\nWigginton's behalf. General Frazer stated that \"[i]n my opinion the HQ\n\nSTARC position of Education Officer is a Staff position.\"           With\n\nrespect to the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, General Frazer\n\nsaid:\n\n          This document and booklet called the Military\n          Code of Rhode Island is an archaic writing and\n          woefully outdated. However it is still utilized\n          in current day fashion within the National Guard.\n          I have no thought or idea what the writer was\n          trying to convey to the reader and that thought\n          can be argued into the future. It is my thought\n          and opinion that the term \"All commissioned\n          officers of the staff corps and departments\" was\n\n\n\n     the laws of the United States or the rules or regulations\n     prescribed thereunder for the organization and training of\n     the national guard.\n\n     (b) For that purpose, the number of commissioned officers,\n     warrant officers and enlisted men in any unit, organization,\n     staff corps, and department may be increased or diminished\n     and the grades of these commissioned officers, warrant\n     officers, and enlisted men may be altered to the extent\n     necessary to conform thereto.\n\n     (c) No organization of the national guard shall be disbanded\n     nor its minimum strength reduced except in conformity with\n     the laws of the United States.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-2-9.\n\n                                -29-\n\f          and is referring to the various Staff Officers of\n          the National Guard.\n\n          General Centracchio's expert was Colonel Rick Baccus, who\n\ngave extensive deposition testimony. At the time of his deposition,\n\nColonel Baccus was a supervisory logistics management specialist in\n\nRIANG; prior to that assignment he had served as RIANG's personnel\n\ndirector. When asked \"what is your definition of the term commissioned\n\nofficers of the states [sic] corps and departments in Rhode Island\n\nGeneral Law 30-3-13?,\" Colonel Baccus replied:\n\n          A. Since I wasn't involved in writing the law, it\n          would be difficult for me to give you a specific\n          definition, I can only surmise what I think the\n          definition is, and, again, it's referring to some\n          kind of specialty, a special staff position and\n          that's where I only drew the analogy.\n\n          Q. But you really don't know, do you?\n\n          A. No, sir, because I was not involved with the\n          law.\n\n\nA subsequent colloquy was to the same effect:\n\n\n          Q. We have focused a lot on the meaning of the\n          words staff corps, there's also the phrase in\n          there Rhode Island General Law?\n\n          A.   And departments.\n\n          Q.   Do you attach any meaning to that phrase?\n\n          A. No, not at all. Again, sir, I do not know\n          what the law, what the, you know, the authors of\n          the law or what they were basing the previous law\n\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f           under. They may have carried that forward from\n           previous law.\n\nWhen asked about the meaning of \"staff corps and departments\" in R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 30-3-1 (another provision of the statutory code governing\n\nRIANG in which the phrase appears)17 Colonel Baccus responded:\n\n           To be honest, sir, because I was not involved\n           with writing law, I'm not sure, there is no\n           equivalent to today's terminology.\n\n           After noting that neither General Frazer nor Colonel Baccus\n\npurported to be able to offer a coherent construction of \"staff corps\n\nand departments,\" the District Court ruled as follows:\n\n           Of course, in this case, it is incumbent on Major\n           Wigginton to establish that he was a member of\n           the \"staff corps and departments.\" Even he\n           cannot say with any conviction that he held such\n           commission. In fact, although Major Wigginton at\n           one time \"believed\" he was a member of the staff\n           corps, he now admits that he was \"never an\n           officer of a corps identified as staff corps\n           officer.\"    On this basis Major Wigginton's\n           substantive due process claim must fail.\n\n           Here we part company with the District Court. On cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment, a plaintiff loses if he cannot produce\n\nevidence tending to establish a fact that, under the governing law, the\n\nplaintiff is required to prove in order to make out his cause of\n\naction. But that was not the situation at the point that the District\n\nCourt granted summary judgment against appellant and in favor of\n\nappellees. When the District Court granted summary judgment, no\n\n17   For the text of § 30-3-1, see supra note 16.\n\n                                 -31-\n\fdetermination had been arrived at as to what the governing law was.\n\nThat is to say, neither the meaning of the phrase \"staff corps and\n\ndepartments\" as used in R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-13-3, nor the extent of the\n\nrights created by that statute if applicable, had been judicially\n\nresolved. And under those circumstances, there was no way to tell\n\nwhether the evidence adduced by Major Wigginton would, if credited by\n\na fact-finder, suffice as a matter of Rhode Island law to present the\n\nfederal constitutional question whether state law rights had been\n\nabridged without due process.18 Accordingly, it was error to grant\n\nsummary judgment on the first count in favor of General Centracchio and\n\nthe State of Rhode Island. And it would, a fortiori, have been error\n\nto grant summary judgment in favor of Major Wigginton. To prevail on\n\nhis motion for summary judgment, it would have been necessary for Major\n\nWigginton to have established (1) that, as a matter of Rhode Island\n\nlaw, at the time of his discharge from RIANG, he (a) came within the\n\nembrace of the phrase \"staff corps and departments,\" as used in R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 30-3-13, and (b) was, therefore, entitled (in the absence\n\n\n18 The District Court found it significant that, \"although Major\nWigginton at one time 'believed' he was a member of the staff corps, he\nnow admits that he was 'never an officer of a corps identified as staff\ncorps officer.'\" But neither the fact that Major Wigginton \"at one\ntime 'believed' he was a member of the staff corps\" nor the fact that\nhe subsequently acknowledged \"that he was 'never an officer of a corps\nidentified as staff corps'\" could be a datum of any ascertainable legal\nsignificance prior to a time at which the term \"staff corps,\" as used\nin the statutory phrase \"staff corps and departments,\" would acquire,\nthrough judicial construction, some concrete legal meaning.

Gen.\n\nLaws § 30-13-3, neither of the cross-motions for summary judgment was\n\nripe for disposition.\n\n                                 ii.\n\n          As we have just observed, the District Court did not arrive\n\nat a dispositive construction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13. We can do no\n\nbetter.\n\n          The general thrust of the first two sentences of the statute\n\nis apparent. Those persons who are \"commissioned officers of the staff\n\ncorps and departments . . . shall hold their positions until they have\n\nreached the age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to that time\n\nby reason of resignation or disability, or for cause to be determined\n\nby an efficiency board or a court martial.\" Major Wigginton - a\n\n\n\n19Such entitlement would appear substantial enough to support what the\nSupreme Court has characterized as \"an enforceable expectation of\ncontinued public employment.\" Bishop v. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109476\"><a href=\"/opinion/109476/bishop-v-wood/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wood,</span> supra</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462 U.S. at 345.\nSee supra note 15.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fcommissioned officer of RIANG who had not reached age sixty, and who\n\nhad not been retired by reason of resignation or disability, or for\n\ncause - would appear (absent any other contingencies attached to Major\n\nWigginton's continued employment by R.I. law) to be within the\n\nprotective embrace of the statute if he was an officer of the \"staff\n\ncorps and departments.\" But what that latter phrase means remains\n\nunclear.   The first sentence of the statute - \"All commissioned\n\nofficers of the staff corps and departments, hereafter appointed, shall\n\nhave had previous military experience, except chaplains, officers of\n\nthe judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers.\" -\n\nmakes it plain that the phrase \"staff corps and departments\" connotes\n\na cohort inclusive of, but broader than, \"chaplains, officers of the\n\njudge advocate general's corps, and medical officers.\"        How much\n\nbroader?    Broad enough to include Major Wigginton, an officer\n\noriginally commissioned in the Military Police, later assigned as a\n\nPublic Affairs Officer, and ultimately acting as an Education Officer?\n\nWe derive no useful textual guidance from the two other provisions of\n\nthe statutory code governing RIANG that employ the phrase \"staff corps\n\nand departments.\"20 Appellant and appellees, in their submissions to\n\n\n20   See supra note 16.\n\n   It may be noted that the laws of Massachusetts governing the\nMassachusetts guard provide that an officer of the \"state staff\" is\nentitled to \"hold his position until he reaches the age of sixty-five\nyears unless separated prior to that time by resignation, disability,\nor for cause by a court-martial legally convened for that purpose.\"\n\n                                 -34-\n\fthis court, have been unable to adduce any useful legislative history\n\nof R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 and we have found none.      Further, the\n\nparties have not cited any pertinent decisions construing R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws § 30-3-13; and our research confirms that no court (whether a\n\nRhode Island court, a federal court, or a court of another state) has,\n\nin a reported opinion, construed \"staff corps and departments\" as\n\nutilized in R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 (or, indeed, as utilized in either\n\nof the two other provisions of the statutory code governing RIANG that\n\nemploy the phrase).\n\n          Thus, what we have before us is a Rhode Island statute which\n\nis a tabula rasa.   Moreover, the state military code of which the\n\nstatute is a part is a very special kind of state legislative\n\nenactment, for the code governs the Rhode Island aspects of a joint\n\nstate-federal enterprise of great importance - the Rhode Island Army\n\nNational Guard. Under these circumstances, in order to achieve a\n\nresponsible resolution of the issues presented by this pending appeal,\n\nit plainly would be better to have a current and authoritative\n\nconstruction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 by the Rhode Island judiciary\n\nthan to have a conjectured prophecy by this court of what Rhode\n\nIsland's courts might be expected to rule at some future time.\n\nHappily, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has in place a procedure\n\n\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 33, § 15(a). However, § 15 goes on to identify,\nby specific military designation, the several officers who compose the\n\"state staff.\"\n\n                                 -35-\n\fpursuant to which it \"may answer questions of law certified to it by .\n\n. . a Court of Appeals of the United States   . . . when requested by\n\nthe certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before it\n\nquestions of law which may be determinative of the cause then pending\n\nin the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying\n\ncourt there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this\n\ncourt.\" Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules, Art. I, Rule 6, § 1. The\n\nquoted rule precisely describes the circumstance in which this court\n\nfinds itself. In the pending appeal, what may prove determinative of\n\nthe cause are answers by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island to two\n\nquestions of Rhode Island law framed by the facts previously set forth\n\nin this opinion:\n\n          1. At the time Major Wigginton was discharged\n          from RIANG, was he an officer of the \"staff corps\n          and departments\" within the meaning of R.I. Gen.\n          Laws § 30-3-13?\n\n          2. If the answer to Question 1 is \"Yes,\" does\n          that signify that, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws §\n          30-3-13, Major Wigginton was (in the absence of\n          resignation, disability, or dismissal for cause)\n          therefore entitled to continue as a RIANG officer\n          until age sixty, or would Rhode Island's\n          statutory and/or decisional law attach any other\n          contingency to Major Wigginton's continued status\n          as a RIANG officer?\n\n          Accordingly, by an appropriate Certification Order\n\naccompanying this opinion, we are certifying these questions of Rhode\n\nIsland law to the Supreme Court of Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n                                -36-\n\f\f</pre>",
