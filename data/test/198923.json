Joost on brief pro se.\n     Michael C. Donahue, M. Christine Breslin and Gelerman,\nCashman & Donahue on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 9, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam.       In 1996, in order to attend his new\n\ntrial on a criminal count that had been vacated on appeal,\n\nplaintiff Robert Joost was transferred from a federal prison\n\nin Pennsylvania to the Wyatt Detention Facility (Wyatt) in\n\nRhode Island.    He was at that time already serving a lengthy\n\nsentence on a related count of conviction.                    Less than five\n\nmonths later, after again being convicted and sentenced on\n\nthe vacated count, he was returned to Pennsylvania.                     In this\n\nBivens action for damages, plaintiff alleges that various\n\nconditions at Wyatt violated his constitutional rights and\n\ncontravened     Bureau      of    Prison     (BOP)   regulations.          The\n\ndistrict    court,     adopting,       as    amended,      the   report    and\n\nrecommendation of a magistrate judge, dismissed for failure\n\nto state a claim.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).               We affirm\n\nsubstantially for the reasons enumerated below, adding only\n\nthe following comments.\n\n           1.     Wyatt      is    a   municipally        owned,   privately\n\noperated    facility     that     houses     federal      prisoners,     among\n\nothers,    pursuant    to    a    contract    with     the    United    States\n\nMarshals Service.      Whether the BOP regulations apply to such\n\na facility--an issue over which the magistrate judge and\n\ndistrict    judge      divided--need         not     be      resolved    here.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fPlaintiff's claims prove to be deficient even if we assume,\n\nwithout deciding, that the regulations do apply.\n\n            2.    We endorse the determination made below that,\n\nfor purposes of the instant case, plaintiff should be deemed\n\na   convicted     prisoner    rather     than    a   pretrial     detainee.\n\nIndeed, the very regulations relied on by plaintiff so\n\nspecify.    See 28 C.F.R. § 551.101(a)(3).\n\n            3.     In his Eighth Amendment claims, plaintiff\n\nalleges that four separate conditions at Wyatt constituted\n\ncruel and unusual punishment: his inability to properly\n\nexercise; his confinement in an overcrowded two-person cell;\n\nhis   occasional     confinement    in    a     holding   area;    and    his\n\nexposure to loud noise.          In each instance, we agree that\n\nplaintiff has failed to satisfy the objective component of\n\nthe   Eighth     Amendment    test--i.e.,       to   \"show   that    he    is\n\nincarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm.\"      Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994);\n\nsee, e.g., Giroux v. Somerset County, 178 F.3d 28, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n            The latter three claims require little comment.\n\nPlaintiff has admitted that the noise quieted down by 11:00\n\nat night.        His confinement in the holding cell entailed\n\nnothing    more     than     \"routine    discomfort.\"           Hudson     v.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fMcMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9 (1992).       And he has not contended\n\nthat the double celling or other incidents of overcrowding\n\nled to \"deprivations of essential food, medical care, or\n\nsanitation,\" increased \"violence among inmates,\" or created\n\n\"other    conditions   intolerable    for    prison   confinement.\"\n\nRhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 348 (1981).\n\n            His complaint about lack of exercise comes closest\n\nto stating a claim.       See, e.g., Antonelli v. Sheahan, 81\n\nF.3d 1422, 1432 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"Lack of exercise may rise\n\nto   a   constitutional   violation   in    extreme   and   prolonged\n\nsituations where movement is denied to the point that the\n\ninmate's health is threatened.\").           Yet that complaint is\n\nvague and qualified; he alleges only that he was \"denied any\n\nopportunity    to   properly   exercise\"    and   that   he   thereby\n\nincurred an unspecified shoulder injury.           Moreover, it is\n\nundisputed that plaintiff could leave his cell for six hours\n\nper day.     He acknowledges that a \"recreation place\" and a\n\n(cramped) weight room were available.         And the docket sheet\n\nfrom his retrial reveals that he attended court sessions on\n\nat least nine occasions.       Considering the relative brevity\n\nof plaintiff's 140-day stay at Wyatt, we agree as a matter\n\nof law that this claim is not \"sufficiently serious\" to make\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fout an Eighth Amendment violation.                Wilson v. Seiter, 501\n\nU.S. 294, 298 (1991).\n\n             4.     Plaintiff's       due    process    claims          involve    a\n\nseparate trio of conditions: the denial of contact visits;\n\nan 18-hour lockdown policy; and a telephone system that\n\npermitted only collect calls to be made at exorbitant rates.\n\nPlaintiff contends that each of these conditions contravened\n\nBOP regulations.           In the latter two cases, he is clearly\n\nmistaken.         And in the case of contact visits, such an\n\nargument draws a modicum of support only from a provision to\n\nwhich   he   has    not    referred    (28    C.F.R.        §    540.51(g)(2)).\n\nRegardless, where all Wyatt inmates have been denied contact\n\nvisits, that deprivation cannot be deemed an \"atypical and\n\nsignificant       hardship    ...     in    relation        to    the    ordinary\n\nincidents     of     prison       life\"     so    as        to     implicate       a\n\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest.                            Sandin    v.\n\nConner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995).                     The same conclusion\n\napplies to the lockdown, to which at least half of Wyatt's\n\ninmates      were         subjected;        plaintiff's            analogy        to\n\nadministrative segregation is unpersuasive.\n\n             In    turn,    the   contention     that       plaintiff       had    a\n\nproperty interest in reasonable phone rates is unsupported.\n\nThe   settlement     agreement      reached      in    an       unrelated    case,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\finvolving a type of phone system not in place at Wyatt,\n\navails him little.             And to the extent plaintiff's complaint\n\ncan be construed as a demand for injunctive relief in this\n\nregard, that request is now moot.\n\n             5.      Plaintiff's final series of claims, alleging\n\nviolations of equal protection, involve this same trio of\n\nconditions.        The magistrate judge accurately described \"the\n\ngravamen\" of these claims as alleging \"that [plaintiff] and\n\nother prisoners housed at Wyatt enjoy[ed] fewer privileges\n\nthan those enjoyed by prisoners incarcerated in most prisons\n\noperated by the Bureau of Prisons.\"                         That argument was\n\nproperly dismissed.             See, e.g., Biliski v. Harborth, 55 F.3d\n\n160,   162   (5 th      Cir.    1995)   (per    curiam)       (rejecting     equal\n\nprotection        claim        where    plaintiff          sought   to    compare\n\nconditions at different prisons).\n\n             Before the district judge, and again on appeal,\n\nplaintiff         has     insisted      that         the     magistrate     judge\n\n\"misinterpreted\"           his     claims      and    that     he   was    mainly\n\ncomplaining        about       differential     treatment       among     separate\n\ngroups of Wyatt inmates.                 To the contrary, his earlier\n\npleadings contained no such argument; instead, they demanded\n\nthat plaintiff be treated the same as the other \"100,000-\n\nplus federal prisoners.\"                This complaint about different\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fconditions     within    Wyatt   itself     thus    constitutes     a   new\n\nargument that, not having been presented to the magistrate\n\njudge, has been waived.          See, e.g., Maine Green Party v.\n\nMaine Secretary Of State, 173 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1 st Cir. 1999);\n\nPaterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec.\n\nCo.,   840    F.2d   985,   990-91   (1st    Cir.    1988)   (\"We       hold\n\ncategorically that an unsuccessful party is not entitled as\n\nof right to de novo review by the judge of an argument never\n\nseasonably raised before the magistrate.\").              At least from\n\nthe record before us, we add that the argument appears of\n\ndubious merit in any event.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

Plaintiff's final series of claims, alleging\n\nviolations of equal protection, involve this same trio of\n\nconditions.        The magistrate judge accurately described \"the\n\ngravamen\" of these claims as alleging \"that [plaintiff] and\n\nother prisoners housed at Wyatt enjoy[ed] fewer privileges\n\nthan those enjoyed by prisoners incarcerated in most prisons\n\noperated by the Bureau of Prisons.\"                         That argument was\n\nproperly dismissed.

To the contrary, his earlier\n\npleadings contained no such argument; instead, they demanded\n\nthat plaintiff be treated the same as the other \"100,000-\n\nplus federal prisoners.\"                This complaint about different\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fconditions     within    Wyatt   itself     thus    constitutes     a   new\n\nargument that, not having been presented to the magistrate\n\njudge, has been waived.
