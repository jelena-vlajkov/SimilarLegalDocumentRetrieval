GUINTO, MOTHER OF MICHAEL     J. GUINTO,\n             DANIEL T. GUINTO AND JULIE A.    GUINTO;\n         RAYMOND GUINTO, FATHER OF MICHAEL     J. GUINTO,\n             DANIEL T. GUINTO AND JULIE A.    GUINTO,\n\n                    Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                               v.\n\n                      PHILIP MORRIS, INC.,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mary C. Guinto and Raymond Guinto on brief pro se.\n     Brenda R. Sharton, Robert N. Driscoll, Douglas S. Brooks and\nGoodwin, Procter & Hoar on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       September 13, 2000\n\f          Per Curiam.     We have reviewed the parties' briefs\n\nand the record on appeal.        There was neither error of law\n\nnor   abuse   of   discretion   in   the   district   court's   order\n\ndenying the appellants' motion, filed pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b), and motion to amend.\n\n          We deny the appellee's motion for sanctions seeking\n\nan order preventing appellants from further court action\n\nbased upon the same underlying facts.           Such a request is\n\nmore properly addressed to the district court in the event\n\nof any future filing.\n\n          Construing appellants' \"motion for argumentative\n\nstatement\" as a request for oral argument, it is denied.\n\n          The order of the district court, dated February 3,\n\n2000, is affirmed.\n\f",
