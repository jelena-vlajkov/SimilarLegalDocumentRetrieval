Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n            Lipez, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nCoffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nAnthony R. Bott for appellant.\r\nTory A Weigand, with whom Gary W. Harvey and Morrison, Mahoney \r\n&amp; Miller were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJanuary 6, 2000\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Gregory Langadinos appeals from\r\nthe district court's order dismissing his amended complaint against\r\nAmerican Airlines, Inc. (\"American\").  The amended complaint\r\nalleges that American violated the Warsaw Convention by continuing\r\nto serve alcohol to an intoxicated passenger who then assaulted\r\nLangadinos.  American filed a motion to dismiss for failure to\r\nstate a cause of action, arguing, inter alia,  that the Warsaw\r\nConvention count was based on unsubstantiated, conclusory\r\nallegations.  The district court granted the motion to dismiss,\r\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  We vacate and remand.\r\n                      I.\r\n\"In the Rule 12(b)(6) milieu, an appellate court operates\r\nunder the same constraints that bind the district court, that is,\r\nwe may affirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim only if it\r\nclearly appears, according to the facts alleged, that the plaintiff\r\ncannot recover on any viable theory.\"  Correa-Martinez v.\r\nArrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990); see also\r\nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-48 (1957).  In making this\r\ndetermination, we must accept the well-pled facts of Langadinos's\r\namended complaint as true and indulge every reasonable inference in\r\nhis favor. See Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999). \r\nWe state the facts, therefore, as Langadinos alleges them.  \r\nOn June 13, 1996, Langadinos boarded an American Airlines\r\nflight in Boston, bound for Paris.  A few hours after take-off,\r\nLangadinos approached a flight attendant for aspirin. The flight\r\nattendant ignored Langadinos, and continued with her current chore:\r\nspoon-feeding ice cream into the mouth of passenger Christopher\r\nDebord.  As Langadinos waited, Debord \"stared in a conspicuous and\r\nstrange fashion\" at him and whispered something into the flight\r\nattendant's ear. \r\nLater in the flight, Langadinos went to the lavatory. \r\nWhile he waited in line, Debord forcefully grabbed Langadinos's\r\ntesticles, causing \"excruciating pain.\"  Then, Debord grabbed\r\nLangadinos's hand and pulled it to his own groin.  Although\r\nLangadinos reported the assault to the flight crew, he was\r\nunsatisfied with their response.  The flight attendant who had fed\r\nDebord ice cream commented, \"Chris is my friend; he is harmless.\" \r\nDespite the promise of a second crew member to have Debord arrested\r\nupon arrival in Paris, the alleged assailant was not detained.  \r\nLangadinos filed a two-count complaint against American\r\nin the district court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging\r\na common law tort and a breach of the Warsaw Convention.  Before\r\nAmerican responded, Langadinos filed an amended complaint,\r\nidentical to the original in every respect but one: it included the\r\nadditional allegation, made on information and belief, that\r\nAmerican served alcohol to Debord just prior to the assault,\r\nknowing that he was intoxicated and that his behavior was \"erratic\"\r\nand \"aggressive.\"  \r\nRather than answer the amended complaint, American filed\r\na motion to dismiss for \"failure of the pleading to state a claim\r\nupon which  relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6).  The\r\ndistrict court dismissed the complaint in a margin order, \"based on\r\nthe arguments in defendant's motion and memorandum.\"  On appeal,\r\nLangadinos argues that the district court erred in dismissing count\r\ntwo of the amended complaint, which alleges a violation of the\r\nWarsaw Convention.  We agree.  \r\n                     II.\r\nA. Requisites of a Warsaw Convention Claim\r\nArticle 17 of the Warsaw Convention sets forth the\r\ncircumstances under which an international air carrier may be\r\nliable for injuries to passengers.  It provides:\r\n  The carrier shall be liable for damage\r\nsustained in the event of death or wounding of\r\na passenger or any other bodily injury\r\nsuffered by a passenger, if the accident which\r\ncaused the damage so sustained took place on\r\nboard the aircraft or in the course of any of\r\nthe operations of embarking or disembarking. \r\n(emphasis added). Although the Warsaw Convention does not define\r\nthe term \"accident,\" the Supreme Court shed light on its meaning in\r\nAir France v. Saks, 470 U.S. 392 (1985).  The Court ruled that an\r\ninjury to the plaintiff's ear caused by the normal operation of the\r\ncabin pressurization system was not an \"accident\" within the\r\nmeaning of the Warsaw Convention.  See id.  The Court held that\r\n\"liability under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention arises only if\r\na passenger's injury is caused by an unexpected or unusual event or\r\nhappening that is external to the passenger.\" Id. at 405.  When the\r\naircraft operates in a \"usual, normal, and expected\" manner, a\r\npassenger is unable to recover.  Id. at 406.  \r\nThe Supreme Court's definition of \"accident\" is broad\r\nenough to permit recovery for torts committed by fellow passengers. \r\nIndeed, the Saks Court cited lower court decisions recognizing\r\npassenger-on-passenger torts as \"accidents\" for the proposition\r\nthat the accident requirement must be \"flexibly applied.\" Id.  Of\r\ncourse, not every tort committed by a fellow passenger is a Warsaw\r\nConvention accident.  Where the airline personnel play no causal\r\nrole in the commission of the tort, courts have found no Warsaw\r\naccident.  See, e.g., Potter v. Delta Airlines, 98 F.3d 881, 883-84\r\n(5th Cir. 1996) (finding no \"accident\" where injury in passenger\r\ndispute over seat position took place without involvement of\r\nairline personnel), abrogated on other grounds by El Al Israel\r\nAirlines, Ltd. v. Tseng, 525 U.S. 155 (1999); Stone v. Continental\r\nAirlines, 905 F. Supp. 823, 827 (D. Haw. 1995) (finding no\r\n\"accident\" where one passenger punched second passenger).  On the\r\nflip side, courts have found Warsaw accidents where airline\r\npersonnel play a causal role in a passenger-on-passenger tort. \r\nSee, e.g, Schneider v. Swiss Air Transp. Co., 686 F. Supp. 15, 17\r\n(D. Me. 1988)(\"accident\" when plaintiff injured by fellow\r\npassenger's refusal to put seat upright because plaintiff was\r\ndenied assistance by flight attendant).\r\nLangadinos's claim survives under these standards.  He\r\nhas alleged that (1) Debord appeared intoxicated, aggressive and\r\nerratic, (2) American was aware of this behavior and (3) despite\r\nthis awareness, American continued to serve him alcohol.  Serving\r\nalcohol to an intoxicated passenger may, in some instances, create\r\na foreseeable risk that the passenger will cause injury to others. \r\nIndeed, the Supreme Court cited a case of this type as an example\r\nof the flexible operation of the accident requirement.  See Saks\r\n470 U.S. at 405 (citing Oliver v. Scandinavian Airline Sys., 17 CCH\r\nAv. Cas. 18,283 (Md. 1983) (Warsaw accident liability where airline\r\nserved alcohol to drunken passenger, who then fell and injured\r\nfellow passenger)).\r\nOf course, Langadinos cannot prevail simply by proving\r\nthat American served Debord excessive alcohol.  He will also have\r\nto establish that he suffered a compensable injury and that\r\nAmerican's service of alcohol to the assailant was a proximate\r\ncause of his injury. See Saks, 470 U.S. at 406 (\"Any injury is the\r\nproduct of a chain of causes, and we require only that the\r\npassenger be able to prove that some link in the chain was an\r\nunusual or unexpected event external to the passenger.\"). \r\nRecognizing that we can affirm the dismissal of the complaint only\r\n\"if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of\r\nfacts that could be proved consistent with the allegations,\" Hishon\r\nv. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984), we are not able to say,\r\nat this stage in the proceedings, whether American bears causal\r\nresponsibility for the alleged assault. Moreover, the Warsaw\r\naccident determination should be \"flexibly applied after assessment\r\nof all the circumstances surrounding a passenger's injuries.\" Saks,\r\n470 U.S. at 405 (emphasis added). In this case, discovery will be\r\nrequired before such an assessment can be made.\r\nB. Defects in the Pleading\r\nAmerican argues that even if serving excessive alcohol to\r\na passenger can create a Warsaw accident, Langadinos pled this\r\nallegation with such generality that we should not credit it in\r\nreviewing the decision to dismiss his complaint.  The allegation of\r\nover-serving is crucial, American contends, because Langadinos is\r\nunable to state a Warsaw Convention \"accident\" claim without it.\r\nWe agree with American that Langadinos's complaint could\r\nnot survive without a properly pled allegation of over-serving.\r\nOther than the service of alcohol to Debord, Langadinos has not\r\nalleged any action by American that even arguably led to his sexual\r\nassault.  Langadinos's claim that American flight attendants were\r\nrude to him and that they \"spoon-fed\" ice cream to Debord does not\r\naffix American with causal responsibility for an assault. \r\nLikewise, Langadinos's claim that the American crew treated him\r\npoorly after the incident does not demonstrate that they played any\r\nrole in its cause.  Without the allegation of over-serving,\r\ntherefore, American could not bear any causal responsibility for\r\nLangadinos's injuries and there would be no Warsaw Convention\r\naccident.  \r\nWe disagree with American, however, that the charge of\r\nover-serving was pled defectively.  Langadinos alleged the\r\nfollowing in paragraph 17 of the amended complaint:\r\n  On information and belief, just prior to\r\nthe aforesaid Mr. Debord's above-described\r\nassault and battery upon Mr. Langadinos\r\n[American] served intoxicating liquors/\r\nintoxicants to said Mr. Debord and  not\r\nwithstanding his aggressive and erratic\r\nbehavior and his evident state of diminished\r\ncognitive and physical capacity  continued to\r\nserve Mr. Debord intoxicants, thereby\r\nforeseeably generating otherwise unnecessary\r\nrisk of harm to all other passengers of Flight\r\nNo. 146 . . . .  Upon information and belief, \r\n[American] continued to serve Mr. Debord\r\nalcohol, knowing that he was\r\nintoxicated . . . .\r\nAmerican asks us to disregard this allegation because it relies on\r\nwords and phrases like \"erratic,\" \"aggressive,\" and \"diminished\r\ncognitive and physical capacity,\" which American argues are\r\nconclusory. In particular, American says that Langadinos failed to\r\ndescribe precisely the conduct of Debord that was \"erratic\" or\r\n\"aggressive\" or that demonstrated his \"diminished capacity.\"\r\nAmerican demands from Langadinos more detail in his\r\ncomplaint than the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require.  The\r\npleading rules\r\ndo not require a claimant to set out in detail\r\nthe facts upon which he bases his claim.  To\r\nthe contrary, all the Rules require is 'a short\r\nand plain statement of the claim' that will\r\ngive the defendant fair notice of what the\r\nplaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which\r\nit rests.  The illustrative forms appended to\r\nthe Rules plainly demonstrate this.\r\n\nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47-48 (1957).  While defendants may\r\nprefer highly detailed factual allegations, a generalized statement\r\nof facts is adequate so long as it gives the defendant sufficient\r\nnotice to file a responsive pleading.  See id.; see also Garita\r\nHotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.\r\n1992).  \r\nWe have demanded greater factual detail in a complaint in\r\na few specific categories of cases.  For example, we have followed\r\nRule 9(b)'s requirement that \"[i]n all averments of fraud or\r\nmistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be\r\nstated with particularity.\"  See Powers v. Boston Cooper Corp, 926\r\nF.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir. 1991). Recognizing that charges of\r\ndiscriminatory intent are difficult to disprove and can greatly harm\r\na defendant's reputation, we have required civil rights plaintiffs\r\nto \"outline facts sufficient to convey specific instances of\r\nunlawful discrimination.\"  Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College,\r\n889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).  We have also demanded greater\r\nfactual specificity for allegations of RICO violations, see Miranda\r\nv. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1991), and allegations\r\nof standing, see United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 115 (1st\r\nCir. 1992). Apart from these \"specialized areas not implicated here,\r\nit is enough for a plaintiff to sketch an actionable claim by means\r\nof 'a generalized statement of facts from which the defendant will\r\nbe able to frame a responsive pleading.'\" Garita Hotel Ltd.\r\nPartnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(footnote omitted) (quoting 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal\r\nPractice &amp; Procedure  1357 (1990)). Langadinos has met this\r\nstandard, putting American on notice that it is accused of serving\r\nalcohol to an aggressive, erratic, and incapacitated passenger, even\r\nthough it knew he was intoxicated. \r\nAmerican repeatedly reminds us that Langadinos only\r\nalleged the over-serving of alcohol in his amended complaint on the\r\nbasis of information and belief.  A plaintiff may rely, however, on\r\nan amended complaint, see, e.g., Chongris v. Board of Appeals, 811\r\nF.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1987), and, as American concedes, a plaintiff\r\ncan make allegations either on the basis of personal knowledge or\r\non \"information and belief.\"  Langadinos's attorney is entitled to\r\ninclude such \"information and belief\" allegations in the complaint\r\nas long as he had a good faith basis for doing so, based on the\r\nreasonable inquiry that Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) requires. \r\n           III.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we conclude that Langadinos\r\nhas stated a valid claim under the Warsaw Convention.  We therefore\r\nVACATE the district court order dismissing the claim and REMAND for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n",

Of course, not every tort committed by a fellow passenger is a Warsaw Convention accident. Where the airline personnel play no causal role in the commission of the tort, courts have found no Warsaw accident. See, e.g., Potter v.

On the flip side, courts have found Warsaw accidents where airline personnel play a causal role in a passenger-on-passenger tort. See, e.g, Schneider v. Swiss Air Transp. Co., 686 F. Supp. 15, 17 (D.

Langadinos's claim that American flight attendants were rude to him and that they \"spoon-fed\" ice cream to Debord does not affix American with causal responsibility for an assault. Likewise, Langadinos's claim that the American crew treated him poorly after the incident does not demonstrate that they played any role in its cause. Without the allegation of over-serving, therefore, American could not bear any causal responsibility for Langadinos's injuries and there would be no Warsaw Convention accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with American, however, that the charge of over-serving was pled defectively. Langadinos alleged the following in paragraph 17 of the amended complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On information and belief, just prior to the aforesaid Mr. Debord's above-described assault and battery upon Mr. Langadinos [American] served intoxicating liquors/ intoxicants to said Mr. Debord and- not withstanding his aggressive and erratic behavior and his evident state of diminished cognitive and physical capacity- continued to serve Mr. Debord intoxicants, thereby foreseeably generating otherwise unnecessary risk of harm to all other passengers of Flight No. 146 . . . . Upon information and belief, [American] continued to serve Mr. Debord alcohol, knowing that he was intoxicated . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American asks us to disregard this allegation because it relies on words and phrases like \"erratic,\" \"aggressive,\" and \"diminished cognitive and physical capacity,\" which American argues are conclusory. In particular, American says that Langadinos failed to describe precisely the conduct of Debord that was \"erratic\" or \"aggressive\" or that demonstrated his \"diminished capacity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American demands from Langadinos more detail in his complaint than the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require. The pleading rules</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. To the contrary, all the Rules require is 'a short and plain statement of the claim' that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. The illustrative forms appended to the Rules plainly demonstrate this.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conley v.

While defendants may prefer highly detailed factual allegations, a generalized statement of facts is adequate so long as it gives the defendant sufficient notice to file a responsive pleading. See id.; see also Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have demanded greater factual detail in a complaint in a few specific categories of cases.

Boston Cooper Corp, 926 F.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir. 1991). Recognizing that charges of discriminatory intent are difficult to disprove and can greatly harm a defendant's reputation, we have required civil rights plaintiffs to \"outline facts sufficient to convey specific instances of unlawful discrimination.\" Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We have also demanded greater factual specificity for allegations of RICO violations, see Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1991), and allegations of standing, see United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 115 (1st Cir. 1992). Apart from these \"specialized areas not implicated here, it is enough for a plaintiff to sketch an actionable claim by means of 'a generalized statement of facts from which the defendant will be able to frame a responsive pleading.'\" Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1992) (footnote omitted) (quoting 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 1357 (1990)). Langadinos has met this standard, putting American on notice that it is accused of serving alcohol to an aggressive, erratic, and incapacitated passenger, even though it knew he was intoxicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American repeatedly reminds us that Langadinos only alleged the over-serving of alcohol in his amended complaint on the basis of information and belief. A plaintiff may rely, however, on an amended complaint, see, e.g., Chongris v. Board of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1987), and, as American concedes, a plaintiff can make allegations either on the basis of personal knowledge or on \"information and belief.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Langadinos's attorney is entitled to include such \"information and belief\" allegations in the complaint as long as he had a good faith basis for doing so, based on the reasonable inquiry that Fed.

Although it is unclear whether he can claim damages for concurrent emotional injuries, see id. (\"[W]e express no view as to whether passengers can recover for mental injuries that are accompanied by physical injuries.\"), we need not explore this issue as Langadinos's allegation of a physical injury takes him beyond a motion to dismiss.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> American also argues that the complaint should be dismissed inasmuch as it alleges \"willful\" misconduct on the part of American. This objection is misplaced. The distinction between mere Warsaw accidents and \"willful\" misconduct goes only to damages: if the plaintiff can prove willful misconduct, the $75,000 damage limit applicable to accidents taking place during this time period does not apply. See Warsaw Convention, Art. 25. Given that the complaint states facts sufficient to allege a Warsaw accident, Langadinos is entitled to seek damages above the cap by attempting to prove that the accident was caused by American's willful misconduct.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Indeed, a perusal of these forms nicely illustrates just how little factual detail is required.

A few hours after take-off, Langadinos approached a flight attendant for aspirin. The flight attendant ignored Langadinos, and continued with her current chore: spoon-feeding ice cream into the mouth of passenger Christopher Debord. As Langadinos waited, Debord \"stared in a conspicuous and strange fashion\" at him and whispered something into the flight attendant's ear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the flight, Langadinos went to the lavatory. While he waited in line, Debord forcefully grabbed Langadinos's testicles, causing \"excruciating pain.\" Then, Debord grabbed Langadinos's hand and pulled it to his own groin. Although Langadinos reported the assault to the flight crew, he was unsatisfied with their response. The flight attendant who had fed Debord ice cream commented, \"Chris is my friend; he is harmless.\" Despite the promise of a second crew member to have Debord arrested upon arrival in Paris, the alleged assailant was not detained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Langadinos filed a two-count complaint against American in the district court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging a common law tort and a breach of the Warsaw Convention. Before American responded, Langadinos filed an amended complaint, identical to the original in every respect but one: it included the additional allegation, made on information and belief, that American served alcohol to Debord just prior to the assault, knowing that he was intoxicated and that his behavior was \"erratic\" and \"aggressive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than answer the amended complaint, American filed a motion to dismiss for \"failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

The district court dismissed the complaint in a margin order, \"based on the arguments in defendant's motion and memorandum.\" On appeal, Langadinos argues that the district court erred in dismissing count two of the amended complaint, which alleges a violation of the Warsaw Convention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

He has alleged that (1) Debord appeared intoxicated, aggressive and erratic, (2) American was aware of this behavior and (3) despite this awareness, American continued to serve him alcohol. Serving alcohol to an intoxicated passenger may, in some instances, create a foreseeable risk that the passenger will cause injury to others.

Defects in the Pleading</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American argues that even if serving excessive alcohol to a passenger can create a Warsaw accident, Langadinos pled this allegation with such generality that we should not credit it in reviewing the decision to dismiss his complaint. The allegation of over-serving is crucial, American contends, because Langadinos is unable to state a Warsaw Convention \"accident\" claim without it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with American that Langadinos's complaint could not survive without a properly pled allegation of over-serving. Other than the service of alcohol to Debord, Langadinos has not alleged any action by American that even arguably led to his sexual assault. Langadinos's claim that American flight attendants were rude to him and that they \"spoon-fed\" ice cream to Debord does not affix American with causal responsibility for an assault. Likewise, Langadinos's claim that the American crew treated him poorly after the incident does not demonstrate that they played any role in its cause. Without the allegation of over-serving, therefore, American could not bear any causal responsibility for Langadinos's injuries and there would be no Warsaw Convention accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with American, however, that the charge of over-serving was pled defectively. Langadinos alleged the following in paragraph 17 of the amended complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On information and belief, just prior to the aforesaid Mr. Debord's above-described assault and battery upon Mr. Langadinos [American] served intoxicating liquors/ intoxicants to said Mr. Debord and- not withstanding his aggressive and erratic behavior and his evident state of diminished cognitive and physical capacity- continued to serve Mr. Debord intoxicants, thereby foreseeably generating otherwise unnecessary risk of harm to all other passengers of Flight No. 146 . . . . Upon information and belief, [American] continued to serve Mr. Debord alcohol, knowing that he was intoxicated . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American asks us to disregard this allegation because it relies on words and phrases like \"erratic,\" \"aggressive,\" and \"diminished cognitive and physical capacity,\" which American argues are conclusory. In particular, American says that Langadinos failed to describe precisely the conduct of Debord that was \"erratic\" or \"aggressive\" or that demonstrated his \"diminished capacity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American demands from Langadinos more detail in his complaint than the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require. The pleading rules</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim. To the contrary, all the Rules require is 'a short and plain statement of the claim' that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. The illustrative forms appended to the Rules plainly demonstrate this.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conley v.

This objection is misplaced. The distinction between mere Warsaw accidents and \"willful\" misconduct goes only to damages: if the plaintiff can prove willful misconduct, the $75,000 damage limit applicable to accidents taking place during this time period does not apply. See Warsaw Convention, Art. 25. Given that the complaint states facts sufficient to allege a Warsaw accident, Langadinos is entitled to seek damages above the cap by attempting to prove that the accident was caused by American's willful misconduct.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Indeed, a perusal of these forms nicely illustrates just how little factual detail is required.
