Berman, by appointment of the Court, with whom\r\nBerman &amp; Dowell was on brief, for appellant.\r\nMargaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n              September 15, 1999\r\n                                           HILL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Appellant David Hollis\r\n\"Luckie\" LaFortune is an admitted bank robber.  In calculating\r\nLaFortune's sentence, the district court added a six-level weapons\r\nenhancement, finding that LaFortune had \"otherwise used,\" U.S.S.G.\r\n2B3.1(b)(2)(B), rather than \"brandished, displayed, or\r\npossessed,\" U.S.S.G.  2B3.1(b)(2)(C), a firearm during the robbery\r\nwhich would have warranted only a five-level enhancement.  We\r\naffirm.\r\n                       I.\r\nOn February 4, 1998, LaFortune and co-defendant Michael\r\nKenneth Morganstern stole a teal-colored minivan parked outside a\r\nconvenience store.  The next morning, LaFortune and Morganstern\r\ndrove to the residence of a woman and her eleven-year-old son. \r\nThey asked the woman to stitch closed the mouth openings of two\r\nblack ski masks.  Obtaining needle and thread from a neighbor, the\r\nwoman complied.  Morganstern then told the boy that \"he was going\r\nto do something really stupid, [so] if he got shot, don't cry; he\r\nwas going to rob a bank, [but] don't tell [anybody].\"  The two men\r\nthen left the woman's house.\r\nThat same morning, February 5, two young white males\r\nentered a branch of the Bangor Savings Bank wearing black ski\r\nmasks, ski-type gloves and dark parkas.  According to a teller, one\r\nrobber announced the robbery, carried a silver-colored revolver\r\nwith a thin barrel, and stayed on the customer side of the counter. \r\nThe other robber climbed or jumped over the teller counter, and\r\nbegan removing money from the cash drawers, filling a brown duffle\r\nbag with bank currency stacks.\r\nPointing the silver gun at tellers and customers, the\r\narmed robber then shoved or pushed one customer to the floor,\r\ntelling her to \"get down\" and \"don't talk.\"  The customer saw the\r\nsilver flash of (what she perceived as) a gun in his hand.  A bank\r\nemployee heard the armed robber yell for everyone to get down and\r\n\"saw him wave the small handgun at people in the bank.\"  Another\r\nbank employee reported that the armed robber pointed the handgun\r\ndirectly at her and told her to get down.  After the armed robber\r\nyelled at the robber behind the teller counter to hurry up, the two\r\nran from the bank, removing their ski masks as they fled.  Running\r\ndown the street to the teal-colored minivan, they sped away, but\r\nnot before a citizen recorded its Maine license plate number.\r\nLaFortune and Morganstern returned to the woman's house\r\nlater that same morning, February 5.  This time they were carrying\r\na plain brown duffle bag.  The bag contained money, ski-type\r\ngloves, the ski masks and the mini-revolver.  The two men asked the\r\nwoman's child to dispose of the ski masks and gloves, and also\r\ntheir sneakers, pants and shirts.  The child obeyed by placing the\r\nitems in a dumpster outside.  They also asked the boy to get rid of\r\nthe keys to the teal-colored minivan.  He threw them into a nearby\r\nyard.  At their direction, the child also bought the men two pair\r\nof new sneakers at the Bangor Mall.\r\nAs the boy watched, Morganstern spread the cash out on a\r\nsibling's bed in denominated piles and split the proceeds equally. \r\nThe boy learned that LaFortune was the armed robber that had \"held\r\nthe gun, cocked, at the head of a female at the bank.\"  It was\r\nMorganstern who had jumped over the teller counter and gathered\r\ncash.\r\nThe two men left the woman's house, taking the revolver\r\nand duffle bag with them.  Within the next five days, LaFortune and\r\nMorganstern would both be arrested and a two-count indictment\r\nreturned against them by a federal grand jury.\r\n                      II.\r\nLaFortune pleaded guilty to bank robbery by force in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  2113(a) and (d), and conspiracy to commit\r\narmed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  On the record,\r\nat sentencing, the parties stipulated as to the factual statement\r\nset forth in the PSR.\r\nAt the sentencing hearing, the district court heard\r\ntestimony from the bank's human resources director as to the trauma\r\ninflicted upon bank employees, customers and their families by\r\nLaFortune's conduct.  According to the bank representative,\r\nLaFortune's use of the silver revolver \"gave the victims no reason\r\nto expect that they would emerge from this robbery without becoming\r\nanother statistic on the nightly news.\"\r\nThe PSR recommended a six-level weapons enhancement of\r\nLaFortune's sentence, U.S.S.G.  2B3.1(b)(2), warranted as he had\r\n\"otherwise used\" a firearm during the bank robbery, rather than a\r\nfive-level weapons enhancement, U.S.S.G.  2B3.1(b)(3), for\r\n\"brandishing\" it.  The district court agreed with the\r\nrecommendation, finding itself particularly struck by the statement\r\nof the one victim that \"all she remembered of the robbery was\r\nstaring down the barrel of a gun and wondering when she would be\r\nshot.\"  Based upon a total offense level of twenty-eight, and a\r\nCriminal History Category I, with a Sentencing Guideline range of\r\n78 to 97 months' imprisonment, the district court sentenced\r\nLaFortune to the maximum 97 months.  He now appeals.\r\n                      III.\r\n                       A.\r\nLaFortune's appeal presents an issue of first impression\r\nto this circuit.  Here we must draw the line as to whether a weapon\r\nwas \"otherwise used\" or \"brandished, displayed, or possessed\"\r\nduring a robbery in the context of the Sentencing Guidelines.  We\r\nreview de novo the interpretation by the district court of the\r\nlanguage and meaning of words used in the Sentencing Guidelines. \r\nSee United States v. Nez-Rodrguez, 92 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  Its findings of fact are reviewable for clear error.  Id.\r\n                       B.\r\nThe crime of robbery garners a base offense of 20 under\r\nU.S.S.G.  2B3.1(a).  Subsection (b)(2) of U.S.S.G.  2B3.1\r\noutlines varying enhancements to the base offense of 20 depending\r\non the type of weapon used in the robbery and the degree of its\r\ninvolvement:\r\n         (A) if a firearm was discharged, increase by 7\r\nlevels; (B) if a firearm was otherwise used,\r\nincrease by 6 levels; (C) if a firearm was\r\nbrandished, displayed, or possessed, increase\r\nby 5 levels; (D) if a dangerous weapon was\r\notherwise used, increase by 4 levels; (E) if a\r\ndangerous weapon was brandished, displayed, or\r\npossessed, increase by 3 levels; or (F) if a\r\nthreat of death was made, increase by 2\r\nlevels.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  2B3.1(b)(2)(A)-(F).\r\nThe terms \"otherwise used\" and \"brandished\" are defined\r\nin the Commentary to U.S.S.G.  1B1.1.  See U.S.S.G.  2B3.1,\r\ncomment.  (n.1).  The application notes provide that\r\n\"'[b]randished' with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a\r\nfirearm) means that the weapon was pointed or waved about, or\r\ndisplayed in a threatening manner.\"  U.S.S.G.  1B1.1, comment.\r\n(n.1(c)).  They further explain that \"'[o]therwise used' with\r\nreference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that\r\nthe conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was\r\nmore than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other\r\ndangerous weapon.\"  U.S.S.G.  1B1.1, comment. (n.1(g)).\r\n                       C.\r\nWhile the circuits are split on this issue, they are not\r\nevenly divided.  Our decision falls in line with the weight of the\r\nmajority.\r\nIn United States v. Wooden, 169 F.3d 674 (11th Cir.\r\n1999), the Eleventh Circuit held that, during the course of a\r\nrobbery at a Miami automatic teller machine, when the defendant\r\npointed a .9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun approximately one-\r\nhalf inch from the victim's forehead, this constituted \"otherwise\r\nused\" and not \"brandishing.\"  The Eleventh Circuit held that\r\nalthough the case did not involve an explicit threat, Wooden's\r\nconduct was equally coercive and threatening.  Id. at 676.\r\nIn United States v. Gilkey, 118 F.3d 702 (10th Cir.\r\n1997), the defendant robbed a diner at gunpoint.  The Tenth Circuit\r\nheld that, although the district court's findings did not\r\nspecifically reveal whether there was any physical contact between\r\nthe gun and the victims, or that the defendant explicitly\r\nverbalized a threat to kill, his use of the gun to directly\r\nthreaten the victims and to force them to move according to his\r\ndirections was more culpable than brandishing.  Id. at 705.  They\r\nfound that it was the specific rather than the general pointing of\r\nthe gun that elevated its use from mere \"brandishment\" to\r\n\"otherwise used.\"  Id. at 706; see also United States v. Roberts,\r\n898 F.2d 1465 (10th Cir. 1990) (where \"otherwise used\" obtained\r\nwhen the defendant walked up behind the victim, put his arm around\r\nher, held a knife next to her face and neck, and demanded money);\r\nUnited States v. Elkins, 16 F.3d 952 (8th Cir. 1994) (where\r\n\"otherwise used\" obtained when defendant, after receiving money\r\nfrom a bank teller, forced a bank customer at knife-point out of\r\nthe bank and into the parking lot where he demanded keys to the\r\ncustomer's car).\r\nBy contrast, the Second Circuit in United States v.\r\nMatthews, 20 F.3d 538 (2d Cir. 1994), held that bank robbers who\r\nordered employees and customers to lie on the floor, pointed their\r\nweapons at these victims, and threatened to kill anyone who\r\ndisobeyed (\"Get down or I will blow your head off.\"; \"Move and you\r\nare dead.\"; \"If you don't keep your head down, you are going to get\r\nshot.\"), id. at 554, were merely brandishing their firearms.  We\r\ndecline to follow this rationale.\r\n                       D.\r\nIn this case, LaFortune contends that his waving and\r\npointing of the silver revolver at bank tellers and customers,\r\ntogether with his instruction that persons in the bank \"get down,\"\r\nwithout an explicit threat to any person, constitute brandishing,\r\nand that therefore the district court holding must be reversed. \r\nMatthews, 20 F.3d at 553; United States v. Gonzlez, 40 F.3d 735,\r\n740 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1716 (1995).  He\r\nclaims that to hold otherwise would render the definition of\r\nbrandishing superfluous.  See U.S.S.G.  1B1.1, comment. (n.1(c)),\r\nsupra.\r\nThe government contends, and the district court held,\r\nthat when LaFortune pointed a cocked gun at the head of female\r\nteller, held the gun in his hand while shoving a customer to the\r\nfloor, ordering (by yelling at) her to get down, don't talk, and\r\naimed the weapon directly at another bank employee while giving\r\norders, it constituted \"otherwise used.\"  Wooden, 169 F.3d at 676;\r\nGilkey, 118 F.3d at 705.\r\nWe agree.  LaFortune's conduct amounted to more than\r\nbrandishing, the general pointing or waving the weapon about in a\r\nthreatening manner.  As we view it, a person may \"brandish\" a\r\nweapon to \"advise\" those concerned that he possesses the general\r\nability to do violence, and that violence is imminently and\r\nimmediately available.  A general, or even pompous, showing of\r\nweapons, involving what one would consider an arrogant\r\ndemonstration of their presence, constitutes the generalized\r\nwarning that these weapons may be, in the future, used and not\r\nmerely brandished.  Altering this general display of weaponry by\r\nspecifically leveling a cocked firearm at the head or body of a\r\nbank teller or customer, ordering them to move or be quiet\r\naccording to one's direction, is a cessation of \"brandishing\" and\r\nthe commencement of \"otherwise used.\"  Gilkey, 118 F.3d at 706.\r\n                      IV.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\r\n",

Id. at 705. They found that it was the specific rather than the general pointing of the gun that elevated its use from mere \"brandishment\" to \"otherwise used.\" Id. at 706; see also United States v. Roberts, 898 F.2d 1465 (10th Cir. 1990) (where \"otherwise used\" obtained when the defendant walked up behind the victim, put his arm around her, held a knife next to her face and neck, and demanded money); United States v. Elkins, 16 F.3d 952 (8th Cir. 1994) (where \"otherwise used\" obtained when defendant, after receiving money from a bank teller, forced a bank customer at knife-point out of the bank and into the parking lot where he demanded keys to the customer's car).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Second Circuit in United States v.

Matthews, 20 F.3d at 553; United States v. Gonzalez, 40 F.3d 735, 740 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1716 (1995).

A general, or even pompous, showing of weapons, involving what one would consider an arrogant demonstration of their presence, constitutes the generalized warning that these weapons may be, in the future, used and not merely brandished. Altering this general display of weaponry by specifically leveling a cocked firearm at the head or body of a bank teller or customer, ordering them to move or be quiet according to one's direction, is a cessation of \"brandishing\" and the commencement of \"otherwise used.\" Gilkey, 118 F.3d at 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  We affirm without discussion the district court's two-level enhancement of LaFortune's sentence for obstruction of justice.

He tries to limit or qualify that stipulation to cover only PSR paragraphs 4 through 7 [the offense conduct], not PSR paragraph 16 (I) [the boy's statement to the probation officer that it was LaFortune who had held a cocked gun at the head of a female at the bank].

The two men asked the woman's child to dispose of the ski masks and gloves, and also their sneakers, pants and shirts. The child obeyed by placing the items in a dumpster outside.

A general, or even pompous, showing of weapons, involving what one would consider an arrogant demonstration of their presence, constitutes the generalized warning that these weapons may be, in the future, used and not merely brandished. Altering this general display of weaponry by specifically leveling a cocked firearm at the head or body of a bank teller or customer, ordering them to move or be quiet according to one's direction, is a cessation of \"brandishing\" and the commencement of \"otherwise used.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155018\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gilkey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/155018/united-states-v-gilkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  We affirm without discussion the district court's two-level enhancement of LaFortune's sentence for obstruction of justice.

In his brief, LaFortune, however, concedes that the parties stipulated to the PSR's recitation of facts concerning the firearm. He tries to limit or qualify that stipulation to cover only PSR paragraphs 4 through 7 [the offense conduct], not PSR paragraph 16 (I) [the boy's statement to the probation officer that it was LaFortune who had held a cocked gun at the head of a female at the bank]. He claims that such a qualification would be \"a fair interpretation\" as \"the attorneys below most likely intended their stipulation to include only eyewitness accounts.\"</p>\n        <p>We have thoroughly reviewed the original record in this case. The transcript of the sentencing hearing reflects that LaFortune did not dispute any facts as set forth in the PSR. In addition, he chose not to present evidence on either of the two sentencing enhancement issues raised. He cannot now attempt to qualify or limit his concessions or stipulations; any previous objections are thereby forfeited. See United States v.
