David M. Cohen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   David J. Van Dyke, with whom Berman &amp; Simmons, P.A. were on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n   John J. Aromando, with whom Byrne J. Decker and Pierce Atwood\r\nwere on brief for appellees.\r\n\nOCTOBER 21, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  This appeal concerns the question whether,\r\nunder Maine law, the doctrine of res judicata bars a town from\r\nsuing a private party for environmental damage affecting the town's\r\nwater supply insofar as the state has previously litigated and\r\nsettled claims of environmental damage against the same private\r\nparty for the same environmental harm.  A detailed description of\r\nbackground facts and issues is set forth in the magistrate judge's\r\nthorough opinion below, see Town of Boothbay v. Getty Oil Co., Civ.\r\nNo. 98-125-P-DMC, Mem. Dec. at 2-8 (D. Me. Dec. 7, 1998), to which\r\nwe add only a few brief comments addressed to the specific issues\r\nraised on this appeal.\r\nIn this case, the defendants are allegedly responsible\r\nfor the discharge between 1939 and 1976 of gasoline from\r\nunderground storage equipment at their service station in the Town\r\nof Boothbay, Maine (\"the Town\") into the surrounding groundwater. \r\nThe Maine Department of Environmental Protection (\"the State\")\r\nsubsequently discovered the contamination and began cleanup\r\nefforts.  In 1990, the State discovered that the contamination had\r\nspread to surrounding wells, and brought suit against the\r\ndefendants in Maine Superior Court pursuant to several state\r\nenvironmental statutes, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38,  347-A,\r\n541-60, 561-70-G (West 1989 &amp; Supp. 1998), seeking reimbursement\r\nfor the costs of cleanup and remediation of the affected area.\r\nA central demand by the State was that the defendants\r\nfinance an extension of the water line from the Town's water supply\r\nto the contaminated properties.  Partway into the litigation,\r\nhowever, the State determined that other remediation schemes would\r\nobviate the need for a water line extension; it thus dropped its\r\ndemand for a water line extension and settled with the defendants\r\nfor a lump-sum payment calculated to cover the alternative\r\nremediation costs.  The lawsuit was subsequently dismissed with\r\nprejudice.  The Town evidently did not learn of the settlement\r\nuntil after it occurred, but it was aware of the State's lawsuit\r\nand opted not to intervene.\r\nIn 1998, subsequent to the dismissal of the state court\r\naction, the Town brought a diversity action against the defendants\r\nin the federal district court in Maine grounded not in the state\r\nenvironmental statutes but instead in state common law claims of\r\ntrespass, negligence, nuisance, and strict liability.  The most\r\nsignificant component of relief sought by the Town was for the same\r\nwater line extension previously sought by the State.  The\r\nmagistrate judge granted summary judgment on this claim in favor of\r\nthe defendants, reasoning that the same claim for environmental\r\ndamage was previously brought and settled by the state, and that\r\nthe Town was bound by this resolution because the issue was res\r\njudicata and the Town was in privity with the State.\r\nThe Town also claimed economic damages to itself due to\r\nan alleged reduction in the property tax base.  As to that claim,\r\nthe magistrate judge held that it was not barred by res judicata\r\nbut that the amount was insufficient to meet the jurisdictional\r\nminimum so the claim should be dismissed without prejudice. \r\nNeither party has pursued this latter claim on appeal, but the Town\r\nhas appealed from the dismissal of its claim for environmental harm\r\nto its citizens because of the inadequate remediation,\r\nspecifically, the failure to extend the water line.\r\nOn this appeal, the Town mounts two attacks on the\r\nmagistrate's finding that the claim for environmental damage was\r\nbarred by res judicata.  The Town's first argument is that there\r\nwas a divergence of interests between the State and the Town such\r\nthat the former did not adequately represent the latter's interest\r\nin restoring a clean water supply to the contaminated area because\r\nthe State was only interested in recouping expenses that it had\r\nincurred.  This, says the Town, precludes a finding of privity. \r\nSee Restatement (Second) Judgments  42(e) &amp; cmt. f (1982). \r\nHowever, it appears from the record that the State vigorously\r\npursued the demand that the defendants finance a water line\r\nextension until it determined that alternative measures would\r\nadequately solve the contamination problem.  The Town fails to\r\npoint to any facts in support of its contention that the State\r\nacted in bad faith or unreasonably, and its say-so is insufficient\r\nto make out a showing of misaligned interests or inadequate\r\nrepresentation.\r\nThe Town's second argument is that because the state\r\nenvironmental statutes under which the State brought the earlier\r\naction reserve to municipalities and others a right against the\r\nstate environmental funds as well as a right to bring their own\r\nlawsuits, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38,  551(2), 569-A(2)\r\n(West 1989 &amp; Supp. 1998), the defense of res judicata is\r\ninapplicable in this context.  It is true that the determination\r\nwhether a party is deemed in privity with the state and thus barred\r\nfrom bringing supplemental claims against a defendant subsequent to\r\na suit brought by the state is affected by the legislature's\r\nimplicit or explicit reservation of their right to bring such\r\nclaims.  See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments  41, cmt.\r\nd.  Yet in this case, the Town asserts a claim for relief which is\r\nnot supplemental to but rather the same as that previously brought\r\nby the State.  The legislature has empowered the Department of\r\nEnvironmental Protection to enforce its environmental laws, see Me.\r\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38,  541, 561 (West 1989 &amp; Supp. 1998), and\r\nnothing suggests that the legislature wanted to give others the\r\nopportunity to bring the same environmental enforcement claim where\r\nthe state has already done so.  See Department of Human Servs. v.\r\nRichardson, 621 A.2d 855 (Me. 1993).\r\nAffirmed.\n",
