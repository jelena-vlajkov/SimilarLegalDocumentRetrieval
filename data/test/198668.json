Frank H. Freedman, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Sheikh Bashir Ahmed on brief pro se.\r\n   John F. Rogers, Kevin M. Kinne and Cain, Hibbard, Myers &amp; Cook\r\non Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Disposition for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nOctober 5, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Plaintiff Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, M.D. was\r\nhired in 1991 by defendant Berkshire Medical Center (BMC), a\r\nteaching hospital affiliated with the University of\r\nMassachusetts medical school, for a one-year position as a\r\nsecond-year medical resident.  He was discharged some eight\r\nmonths later, allegedly because of unsatisfactory performance. \r\nClaiming wrongful termination, plaintiff brought this pro se\r\naction seeking relief on various federal and state law grounds. \r\nHe now appeals from an award of summary judgment for defendant. \r\nAlthough a number of issues have been raised, the appeal\r\neffectively hinges on a pair of procedural rulings made by the\r\ndistrict court.  We find no error in those respects and\r\notherwise affirm substantially for the reasons recited by the\r\ndistrict court.  \r\n          Plaintiff first contends that the district court\r\nerred in denying his request to extend the discovery deadline. \r\n\"We will overturn a court's denial of a motion to extend\r\ndiscovery only for abuse of discretion.\"  Pilgrim v. Trustees\r\nof Tufts College, 118 F.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir. 1997).  No such\r\nabuse is apparent here.  Plaintiff's principal complaint in\r\nthis regard was that defendant refused to produce requested\r\ndocuments.  Yet that accusation was never substantiated and,\r\neven if true, would not have precluded plaintiff from engaging\r\nin discovery.  His related complaint about defendant's\r\nallegedly \"evasive\" answers to interrogatories is similarly\r\nunavailing.  And plaintiff's final objection--that defendant\r\nand others had subjected him to \"oppressive\" lawsuits in\r\nvarious forums--overlooks the fact that it was he who initiated\r\nthose actions.\r\n          Plaintiff also challenges the court's allowance of\r\ndefendant's motion to strike portions of his summary judgment\r\naffidavit.  The provisions in question, the court ruled,\r\nconsisted variously of hearsay statements or legal conclusions\r\nor speculative assertions--and thus did not satisfy the\r\nstandards of personal knowledge, admissibility and competence\r\nrequired by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  See, e.g., Vazquez v.\r\nLopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Evidence that\r\nis inadmissible at trial, such as inadmissible hearsay, may not\r\nbe considered on summary judgment.\").  We perceive no error. \r\n\"The object of [Rule 56(e)] is not to replace conclusory\r\nallegations of the complaint ... with conclusory allegations of\r\nan affidavit.\"  Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 6\r\n(1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Jones v. Merchants Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust\r\nCo. of Indianapolis, 42 F.3d 1054, 1059 (7th Cir. 1994)).  Yet\r\nthat is essentially what plaintiff has done.  His insistence\r\nthat he had \"personal and sensory knowledge\" of all the recited\r\nfacts does not overcome their conclusory or hearsay nature. \r\nNor has any foundation been established for invoking Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(D).  \r\n          Plaintiff's substantive claims consist of allegations\r\nthat defendant: discriminated against him on the basis of\r\nnational origin, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights\r\nAct of 1964 and 42 U.S.C.  1981, 1983 &amp; 1985(3); deprived him\r\nof property without due process of law; breached his employment\r\ncontract; and harmed his professional reputation.  Based on the\r\nlopsided factual record presented, these claims all prove\r\nclearly meritless.  We affirm the dismissal thereof\r\nsubstantially for the reasons enumerated by the district court. \r\nWith respect to the due process claim, we add that no need\r\narises to determine whether BMC was a \"state actor,\" inasmuch\r\nas the four-step review procedure provided plaintiff with all\r\nprocess that was due.  See, e.g., Hankins v. Temple University,\r\n829 F.2d 437, 444-45 (3d Cir. 1987).  For the reasons cited\r\nbelow, we also find no error in the court's denial of\r\nplaintiff's motion to amend his complaint.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  The motion to\r\nsupplement evidence on appeal is denied, and the motion to\r\n\"discard affidavit\" is denied as moot.\n",
