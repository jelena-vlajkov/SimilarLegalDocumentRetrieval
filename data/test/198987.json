Vega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Guillermo\nGil, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         June 29, 2000\n\f           STAHL, Circuit Judge.       On January 12, 1999, defendant-\n\nappellant Carlos J. Zaragoza-Fernandez pleaded guilty to a two-\n\ncount indictment charging him with assault within the maritime\n\nand territorial jurisdiction of the United States, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 7, 113 (Count I); and assaulting, resisting, or impeding a\n\nUnited States military police officer, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 7,\n\n111(a), 1114 (Count II).         This appeal challenges the sentence\n\nthe district court imposed with respect to Count II.          We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           On   November   1,     1998,   defendant   appeared   at    the\n\ncommunity club of the U.S. Army Garrison, Fort Buchanan, Puerto\n\nRico,   where   his   ex-wife,    Rosaura   Rivera,   was   dancing   with\n\nanother person.       Defendant appears to have had a history of\n\nstalking Rivera, as she had obtained a number of restraining\n\norders against him.      In any event, defendant approached Rivera\n\nafter she left the dance floor, spoke with her briefly about\n\ntheir children, and then punched her in the face.\n\n           Defendant immediately exited the club and fled in his\n\ncar.    The military police were notified and given a description\n\nof defendant and the car.        A military police vehicle gave chase.\n\nMeanwhile, military policeman Brian W. Roate, who was assigned\n\nto the front gate area of the base, was radioed and advised of\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe assault and attempted escape.          The outbound lane of Fort\n\nBuchanan then was blocked by a military police vehicle.                    As\n\ndefendant approached the gate in the outbound lane, he veered to\n\nthe right around the roadblock and drove onto the adjacent\n\ngrassy median.      At this point, Roate stepped in front of the\n\npassenger side of the car, waved his baton, and yelled for\n\ndefendant to stop.      Defendant did not stop; instead, he drove\n\ndirectly at Roate.     Roate attempted to get out of the way, but\n\nreceived a glancing blow on the right knee as defendant drove\n\npast him.    Roate then chambered a round in his 9mm sidearm, but\n\ndid not shoot at defendant because another officer was in his\n\nline   of   fire.    Roate    was   not   injured   in    the     collision.\n\nDefendant successfully escaped the confines of the base but was\n\napprehended later.\n\n            In   sentencing   defendant    on   Count    II   –   the   Count\n\npertaining to the incident with Officer Roate – the district\n\ncourt set defendant's base offense level at fifteen because it\n\nconcluded that the assault on the military police officer was\n\n\"aggravated\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2.                In doing\n\nso, the court determined that defendant's assault on Roate\n\n\"involved    . . . a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily\n\nhar m (i.e., not merely to frighten).\"           Id. cmt., application\n\nnote 1.     The court then enhanced the offense level by three\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbecause defendant brandished or threatened to use a dangerous\n\nweapon    (i.e.,   the   car)   in   connection   with   the   aggravated\n\nassault, see id. § 2A2.2(b)(2); and by three additional levels\n\nbecause the aggravated assault created the risk of serious\n\nbodily injury and because defendant had reasonable cause to know\n\nthat the victim of the aggravated assault was a law enforcement\n\nofficer, see id. § 3A1.2(b).          Finally, the court adjusted the\n\noffense level downward by three to account for defendant's\n\nacceptance of responsibility.        See id. § 3E1.1.    This yielded a\n\ntotal offense level of eighteen and, because defendant was in\n\nCriminal History Category II, a guideline sentencing range of\n\n30-37 months.      The court then sentenced defendant to 37 months\n\non Count II.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           On appeal, defendant presses two arguments.          First, he\n\ncontends that the district court clearly erred in applying the\n\naggravated assault guideline, U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2, instead of a\n\nmilder guideline applicable to one who merely obstructs or\n\nimpedes a government officer, id. § 2A2.4, because there was no\n\nshowing that defendant intended to cause Roate serious bodily\n\ninjury.    See United States v. Garcia, 34 F.3d 6, 10-11 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (reviewing deferentially a fact-based determination to\n\napply U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2 on grounds that the defendant intended to\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcause the victim serious bodily injury).                          Second, he asserts\n\nthat the court clearly erred in applying the official victim\n\nenhancement in U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2 because there was insufficient\n\nevidence that the assault was motivated by Roate's status as a\n\nlaw     enforcement        officer         or     that    the     assault    created     a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious bodily injury.1                       See Garcia, 34 F.3d\n\nat 13 (reviewing deferentially a fact-based decision to enhance\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2).                 Two subsidiary factual arguments drive\n\nthese contentions: (1) the evidence showed \"only that defendant\n\nintended to escape or, at worst, to frighten\" Roate (Defendant's\n\nBrief     at        12);     and     (2)        defendant's       Attention        Deficit\n\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) prevented defendant from forming\n\nthe requisite intent to injure Roate.\n\n               We    reject        the     two    factual        arguments    on    which\n\ndefendant's         appeal    necessarily             depends.     Taking    the   latter\n\nargument first, we think it suffices simply to say that the\n\nrecord as to defendant's psychological profile in no way compels\n\n\n      1\n      Because we must sustain the official victim enhancement\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2 if the court did not clearly err in\nfinding that defendant had reasonable cause to know that Roate\nwas a law enforcement officer and assaulted Roate in a manner\ncreating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, see id. §\n3A1.2(b), and because we think it obvious that the same evidence\nsupporting the court's decision to apply U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2 also\nsupports such a finding, see infra, we do not separately address\nwhether there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion\nthat the assault on Roate was motivated by Roate's status as a\nlaw enforcement officer, see U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2(a).\n\n                                                -5-\n\fthe conclusion that defendant's ADHD prevented him from forming\n\nthe mens rea necessary to commit an aggravated assault at the\n\nrelevant point in time.       As to the former argument, we think it\n\nconclusive    that,   in   Garcia,    as   here,   the   sentencing   judge\n\napplied   U.S.S.G.    §    2A2.2     to    circumstances   in   which   the\n\ndefendant, in order to facilitate a vehicular escape, \"merely\"\n\ndrove his car at the official victims in order to facilitate an\n\nescape.   See id. at 9.     We held that the application of U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2A2.2 was within the court's authority in such a circumstance,\n\neven if the court believed that Garcia did not actually want to\n\nstrike and injure the officers, but simply was prepared to do so\n\nif need be.     See id. at 11 (reproducing a quotation from the\n\njudge which tends to suggest that this was the court's belief\n\nand then affirming the finding);            see also     United States v.\n\nValdez-Torres, 108 F.3d 385, 388 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (affirming\n\napplication of U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2 where defendant accelerated his\n\ncar toward a law enforcement officer and ignored a shouted\n\nwarning that he stop, and rejecting the argument that this\n\nevidence only showed an intent to escape or, at most, frighten);\n\ncf. United States v. Morris, 131 F.3d 1136, 1138 (5th Cir. 1997)\n\n(affirming application of U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2 where the defendant\n\nswerved his car into a pursuing law enforcement officer's car,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fand rejecting argument that such evidence was insufficient to\n\nshow an intent to injure).\n\n           Here, there was abundant evidence that defendant saw\n\nRoate in front of his car, had reason to appreciate that he was\n\na law enforcement officer, continued to drive at him, and was\n\nprepared to strike him with his car if necessary to effectuate\n\nhis escape.       Indeed, the evidence suggested that defendant\n\nactually struck Roate with his car, and that Roate might well\n\nhave   sustained   serious     injuries    had   he   not   managed   to   get\n\neverything but his right knee out of the way.                    Under the\n\ncircumstances, and in light of precedent, the district court did\n\nnot    clearly   err   in   concluding    that   defendant    committed    an\n\naggravated assault upon Roate.           And given these same facts, the\n\ncourt did not clearly err in finding that defendant assaulted\n\nRoate with reasonable cause to believe that Roate was a law\n\nenforcement officer and in a manner creating a substantial risk\n\nof serious bodily injury.        Defendant's sentence on Count II is\n\nthus beyond reproach.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

See United States v. Garcia, 34 F.3d 6, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1994) (reviewing deferentially a fact-based determination to apply U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 on grounds that the defendant intended to cause the victim serious bodily injury). Second, he asserts that the court clearly erred in applying the official victim enhancement in U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2 because there was insufficient evidence that the assault was motivated by Roate's status as a law enforcement officer or that the assault created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See Garcia, 34 F.3d at 13 (reviewing deferentially a fact-based decision to enhance under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2). Two subsidiary factual arguments drive these contentions: (1) the evidence showed \"only that defendant intended to escape or, at worst, to frighten\" Roate (Defendant's Brief at 12); and (2) defendant's Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) prevented defendant from forming the requisite intent to injure Roate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the two factual arguments on which defendant's appeal necessarily depends. Taking the latter argument first, we think it suffices simply to say that the record as to defendant's psychological profile in no way compels the conclusion that defendant's ADHD prevented him from forming the mens rea necessary to commit an aggravated assault at the relevant point in time. As to the former argument, we think it conclusive that, in Garcia, as here, the sentencing judge applied U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 to circumstances in which the defendant, in order to facilitate a vehicular escape, \"merely\" drove his car at the official victims in order to facilitate an escape. See id. at 9. We held that the application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 was within the court's authority in such a circumstance, even if the court believed that Garcia did not actually want to strike and injure the officers, but simply was prepared to do so if need be. See id. at 11 (reproducing a quotation from the judge which tends to suggest that this was the court's belief and then affirming the finding); see also United States v. Valdez-Torres, 108 F.3d 385, 388 (D.C.

The military police were notified and given a description of defendant and the car. A military police vehicle gave chase. Meanwhile, military policeman Brian W. Roate, who was assigned to the front gate area of the base, was radioed and advised of the assault and attempted escape. The outbound lane of Fort Buchanan then was blocked by a military police vehicle. As defendant approached the gate in the outbound lane, he veered to the right around the roadblock and drove onto the adjacent grassy median. At this point, Roate stepped in front of the passenger side of the car, waved his baton, and yelled for defendant to stop. Defendant did not stop; instead, he drove directly at Roate. Roate attempted to get out of the way, but received a glancing blow on the right knee as defendant drove past him. Roate then chambered a round in his 9mm sidearm, but did not shoot at defendant because another officer was in his line of fire. Roate was not injured in the collision. Defendant successfully escaped the confines of the base but was apprehended later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing defendant on Count II - the Count pertaining to the incident with Officer Roate - the district court set defendant's base offense level at fifteen because it concluded that the assault on the military police officer was \"aggravated\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2. In doing so, the court determined that defendant's assault on Roate \"involved... a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten).\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> cmt., application </span>note 1. The court then enhanced the offense level by three because defendant brandished or threatened to use a dangerous weapon (i.e., the car) in connection with the aggravated assault, see id. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(2); and by three additional levels because the aggravated assault created the risk of serious bodily injury and because defendant had reasonable cause to know that the victim of the aggravated assault was a law enforcement officer, see id. &#167; 3A1.2(b). Finally, the court adjusted the offense level downward by three to account for defendant's acceptance of responsibility. See id. &#167; 3E1.1. This yielded a total offense level of eighteen and, because defendant was in Criminal History Category II, a guideline sentencing range of 30-37 months. The court then sentenced defendant to 37 months on Count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendant presses two arguments. First, he contends that the district court clearly erred in applying the aggravated assault guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, instead of a milder guideline applicable to one who merely obstructs or impedes a government officer, id. &#167; 2A2.4, because there was no showing that defendant intended to cause Roate serious bodily injury. See United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195579\"><a href=\"/opinion/195579/united-states-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1994) (reviewing deferentially a fact-based determination to apply U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 on grounds that the defendant intended to cause the victim serious bodily injury). Second, he asserts that the court clearly erred in applying the official victim enhancement in U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2 because there was insufficient evidence that the assault was motivated by Roate's status as a law enforcement officer or that the assault created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195579\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Garcia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195579/united-states-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">13</span> </a></span>(reviewing deferentially a fact-based decision to enhance under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2). Two subsidiary factual arguments drive these contentions: (1) the evidence showed \"only that defendant intended to escape or, at worst, to frighten\" Roate (Defendant's Brief at 12); and (2) defendant's Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) prevented defendant from forming the requisite intent to injure Roate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the two factual arguments on which defendant's appeal necessarily depends. Taking the latter argument first, we think it suffices simply to say that the record as to defendant's psychological profile in no way compels the conclusion that defendant's ADHD prevented him from forming the mens rea necessary to commit an aggravated assault at the relevant point in time. As to the former argument, we think it conclusive that, in Garcia, as here, the sentencing judge applied U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 to circumstances in which the defendant, in order to facilitate a vehicular escape, \"merely\" drove his car at the official victims in order to facilitate an escape. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 9. </span>We held that the application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 was within the court's authority in such a circumstance, even if the court believed that Garcia did not actually want to strike and injure the officers, but simply was prepared to do so if need be. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 11 </span>(reproducing a quotation from the judge which tends to suggest that this was the court's belief and then affirming the finding); see also United States v. Valdez-Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737393\"><a href=\"/opinion/737393/united-states-v-damian-valdez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 388 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (affirming application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 where defendant accelerated his car toward a law enforcement officer and ignored a shouted warning that he stop, and rejecting the argument that this evidence only showed an intent to escape or, at most, frighten); cf. United States v. Morris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"13557\"><a href=\"/opinion/13557/united-states-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>, 1138 (5th Cir. 1997) (affirming application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 where the defendant swerved his car into a pursuing law enforcement officer's car, and rejecting argument that such evidence was insufficient to show an intent to injure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was abundant evidence that defendant saw Roate in front of his car, had reason to appreciate that he was a law enforcement officer, continued to drive at him, and was prepared to strike him with his car if necessary to effectuate his escape. Indeed, the evidence suggested that defendant actually struck Roate with his car, and that Roate might well have sustained serious injuries had he not managed to get everything but his right knee out of the way. Under the circumstances, and in light of precedent, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that defendant committed an aggravated assault upon Roate. And given these same facts, the court did not clearly err in finding that defendant assaulted Roate with reasonable cause to believe that Roate was a law enforcement officer and in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. Defendant's sentence on Count II is thus beyond reproach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTE:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Because we must sustain the official victim enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2 if the court did not clearly err in finding that defendant had reasonable cause to know that Roate was a law enforcement officer and assaulted Roate in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, see id. &#167; 3A1.2(b), and because we think it obvious that the same evidence supporting the court's decision to apply U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 also supports such a finding, see infra, we do not separately address whether there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the assault on Roate was motivated by Roate's status as a law enforcement officer, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2(a).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
