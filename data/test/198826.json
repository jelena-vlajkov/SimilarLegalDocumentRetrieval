William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Peter A. Crawford on brief pro se.\r\n   James S. Timmins on brief for appellee, City of Quincy.\r\n   Richard J. Conner on brief for appellees, One Stop Gas, Inc.,\r\nPetar's Automotive, Inc., Michael Elder and Albert Galano.\r\n\nFebruary 17, 2000\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  At a gas station in Quincy,\r\nMassachusetts, appellant Crawford quarreled with the station\r\nattendants over what he perceived to be a misleading pricing\r\npractice.  An attendant called the police.  Within minutes, the\r\npolice arrested Crawford on a misdemeanor disorderly conduct\r\ncharge.  Money was taken from him at the scene to pay the price\r\nshown on the pump, and his automobile was towed to an adjacent\r\nlot.  When he sought to retrieve his vehicle the next day, he\r\nwas charged a towing fee in excess of any allowed by state\r\nregulation.\r\n          A jury acquitted Crawford on the misdemeanor charge. \r\nHe then mounted this federal suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983,\r\nagainst the police officer and the City of Quincy (the public\r\ndefendants), the two gas station attendants and their employer,\r\nOne Stop Gas, Inc., and the towing company, Petar's Automotive,\r\nInc. (the private defendants).  Both corporate defendants are\r\nwholly owned by one Peter Palmer.\r\n          Crawford alleged, inter alia, that the police officer\r\nhad deprived him of his liberty and property without probable\r\ncause in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments,\r\nthat the private defendants had conspired with the officer to\r\neffect the deprivations, that both sets of defendants had\r\nviolated state civil rights and tort laws, and that the private\r\ndefendants had engaged in deceptive practices in violation of\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. \r\n          A trial ensued.  After both sides had rested, the\r\ndistrict court granted in part the defendants' motions for\r\njudgment as a matter of law.  The court then submitted the\r\nremaining claims to the jury which exonerated the private\r\ndefendants, but found the public defendants liable for\r\ndeprivation of Crawford's civil rights, wrongful arrest, and an\r\ninvasion of privacy.  The jury awarded damages in the amount of\r\n$4,116.  In addition, the court granted equitable relief in the\r\nform of an order expunging the record of the arrest (including\r\nfingerprints and a photograph taken at the time of booking in\r\nviolation of a state law). \r\n          At a later hearing, the court granted the private\r\ndefendants' motion for attorneys' fees, awarding them \"the\r\namount that [Crawford] recovers of the City of Quincy and no\r\nmore,\" and decreeing that \"the City of Quincy may discharge the\r\njudgment entered in Mr. Crawford's favor by either paying off\r\nOne Stop and these other [private] defendants or reaching an\r\naccommodation with them.\"   Judge Young added: \r\n                    The result is that Mr. Crawford gets no\r\n          monetary benefits, he gets the\r\n          satisfaction of having litigated and won\r\n          against able and ethical counsel, having\r\n          vindicated his rights as against a police\r\n          officer who arrested him without probable\r\n          cause, and he gets the expungement of that\r\n          arrest and all collateral documents in the\r\n          . . . City of Quincy.\r\n          Crawford -- and only Crawford -- appeals.  He assigns\r\nas error (1) the district court's entry of judgment as a matter\r\nof law on various claims; (2) certain aspects of the jury\r\ninstructions; (3) the court's rejection of his motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law on his Chapter 93A claims; and (4)\r\nthe fee award.   \r\n                              I.\r\n          Upon de novo review, we affirm the judgment as a\r\nmatter of law.  We briefly recount our reasons.  In all\r\ninstances, we have taken the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to Crawford.  See CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook\r\nExcess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co., 46 F.3d 1211, 1214 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n                              A.\r\n          As to the section 1983 claims against the private\r\ndefendants, Crawford alleged several conspiracy theories. \r\nThere was insufficient proof at trial, however, to sustain a\r\nreasonable inference that a mutual understanding arose between\r\nthe station attendants and the police officer prior to\r\nCrawford's arrest.  The attendants and the officer testified\r\nwithout contradiction that they were utter strangers to one\r\nanother before this incident.  Although different witnesses\r\noffered different versions of the relevant events, all the\r\ntestimony pointed to a sudden, unilateral decision by the\r\nofficer to effect the arrest.  We have held before, and today\r\nreaffirm, that \"merely initiating a good-faith request for\r\npolice protection [will] not attach liability for the\r\nsubsequent unconstitutional conduct of arresting officers.\" \r\nWagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 209 (1st Cir. 1987). \r\n          To be sure, there was proof that after the arrest the\r\nattendants conversed with the officer and cooperated in the\r\ntaking of Crawford's money and in arranging for towing of\r\nCrawford's automobile.  But this evidence, without more, was\r\ninsufficient to permit a jury reasonably to infer that the\r\nprivate defendants thereby knowingly \"collogued [with the\r\nofficer] to deprive the plaintiff of his civil rights.\"  Id.  \r\n          Crawford was similarly unsuccessful in making out a\r\nsection 1983 claim against the towing company.  The defense\r\nadduced undisputed testimony that the attendants did not work\r\nfor the towing company and there was no proof that any agent of\r\nthe towing company knew of the events preceding the police\r\nauthorization to tow.  Thus, even if the towing company might\r\nbe considered a public actor subject to individual liability\r\nunder section 1983 (due to its municipal towing contract and \r\nother facts), there is nothing in the record that serves to\r\ncontradict its assertion of good faith in accepting (and acting\r\nupon) the facially valid police authorization.  This same\r\nreasoning likewise supports the district court's entry of\r\njudgment for the towing company on Crawford's conversion claim.\r\n                              B.\r\n          The district court did not err in entering judgment\r\nas a matter of law on two damages claims against the public\r\ndefendants.  First, the court decided not to submit to the jury\r\na separate claim for compensatory damages for mental distress\r\nstemming from the \"invasion of privacy\" that allegedly occurred\r\nduring the booking process.  Given that Crawford did not\r\ntestify to any emotional distress traceable separately to the\r\nbooking process, but, rather, described only an\r\nundifferentiated emotional upset following the entire incident,\r\nthe decision was proper. \r\n          Second, the court declined to submit to the jury a\r\nclaim for punitive damages arising from the unlawful arrest. \r\nWe discern no error.  \"Where . . . the evidence shows no more\r\nthan that an exasperated police officer, acting in the heat of\r\nthe moment, made an objectively unreasonable mistake, punitive\r\ndamages will not lie.\"  Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 26\r\n(1st Cir. 1999).  There was no proof that the officer harbored\r\nany evil motive nor that he possessed a \"conscious awareness\"\r\nthat the arrest might violate Crawford's civil rights.  Id.  \r\n                             II.\r\n          Neither the jury instructions nor the Chapter 93A\r\nclaims need detain us.  As to the instructions, it suffices to\r\nsay that they sufficiently conveyed the relevant substance of\r\nmost of the matters that Crawford had wanted explained in\r\ngreater detail to the jury.\r\n          Crawford's Chapter 93A argument, as explicated on\r\nappeal, seems to be that two of One Stop's  pump signs\r\nallegedly violated Mass. Regs. Code tit. 202,  2.06(2), and\r\nthat, therefore, regardless of whether he relied on those\r\nsigns, the court should have found a \"per se\" violation of\r\nChapter 93A.  This argument is unpreserved, and we reject it on\r\nthat basis.  For one thing, it was not squarely presented below\r\nin Crawford's omnibus motion for judgment as a matter of law. \r\nFor another thing, he compounded the waiver by acquiescing in\r\na defense request for a supplementary instruction directing the\r\njury to find liability only if it found that he had relied on\r\na deceptive practice. \r\n                             III.\r\n          We are unable to sustain the district court's\r\ndecision to award attorneys' fees to the prevailing private\r\ndefendants under 42 U.S.C.  1988.    \r\n          A prevailing defendant in a civil rights case is\r\nentitled to fees and costs only if the defendant can establish\r\nthat the suit was \"totally unfounded, frivolous, or otherwise\r\nunreasonable\" when brought, or that the plaintiff continued the\r\nlitigation after it clearly became so.  Bercovitch v. Baldwin\r\nSch., Inc., 191 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Casa Marie\r\nHogar Geriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera-Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st\r\nCir. 1994)).  This is a necessary precondition to any fee award\r\nin favor of a defendant under section 1988 (although other\r\nfacts may persuade the court that fees should be denied or\r\nreduced).  See  Tang v. Rhode Island Dep't of Elderly Affairs,\r\n163 F.3d 7, 13-15 (1st Cir. 1998); Foster v. Mydas Assocs.,\r\nInc., 943 F.2d 139, 145 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n          We review fee awards deferentially, and reverse only\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See Casa Marie, 38 F.3d at 618.  We\r\nmay find such an abuse if the lower court ignores a material\r\nfactor, relies upon an improper factor, or makes a serious\r\nmistake in weighing the relevant factors.  See Coutin v. Young\r\n&amp; Rubicam P. R., Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1997).  In\r\nall events, an appellate court \"must engage the district\r\ncourt's [fee] decision critically.\"  Id.  \r\n          We have instructed trial judges who make (or decline\r\nto make) fee awards to explain their actions so that \"at a bare\r\nminimum, the order awarding fees, read against the backdrop of\r\nthe record as a whole ...expose[s] the district court's thought\r\nprocess and show[s] the method and manner underlying its\r\ndecisional calculus.\"  Id.  In this instance, the judge gave\r\nthree reasons for the fee award: (1) that the \"federal claim of\r\nconspiracy was brought without any basis to support it,\"\r\nalthough, \"the rest . . . was a triable case;\" (2) that the\r\nsuit had grown out of a  $1.86 dispute but had consumed three\r\ndays of trial time and thus judicial resources valued (by the\r\njudge) at more than $60,000; and (3) that Crawford previously\r\nhad brought \"successful lawsuits about minor matters.\"\r\n          The second and third reasons are troubling; even if\r\ntaken at face value, neither seems sufficient to justify a\r\ndecision to award fees against a civil rights plaintiff.  Even\r\nmore troubling, however, is that the court's basic precondition\r\nfor the award -- the finding that the federal conspiracy claim\r\nwas baseless when brought -- does not withstand scrutiny.\r\n          We have reviewed the record in detail.  While the\r\nevidence supports the decision to dismiss the section 1983\r\nclaims against the private defendants at the close of the\r\ntrial, that is not the proper coign of vantage.  To the precise\r\ncontrary, in awarding fees to a prevailing defendant, a \"court\r\nmust resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc\r\nreasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not\r\nultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or\r\nwithout foundation.\"  Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434\r\nU.S. 412, 421-22 (1978).  When Crawford brought suit, there was\r\na plausible (if circumstantial) foundation for his conspiracy\r\nclaims.  Crawford had been arrested without apparent cause or\r\npolice investigation within a few moments of the officer's\r\narrival on the scene in response to an attendant's telephoned\r\ncomplaint.  The officer and the two attendants then conversed\r\namongst themselves and all three participated in an improper\r\nconfiscation of money and in the unauthorized towing of\r\nCrawford's automobile.  To make appearances worse, the towing\r\nwas accomplished by a municipal contractor, and the company's\r\nowner (who also owned the service station) was familiar with\r\nvarious police officials.  The towing firm then conditioned\r\nCrawford's retrieval of his vehicle on the payment of a towing\r\nfee.  This is the sort of circumstantial sequence that  has\r\ntroubled even seasoned jurists, see, e.g.,Alexis v. McDonald's\r\nRestaurants of Massachusetts, Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 354 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (Bownes, J. dissenting in part); Moore v. The Marketplace\r\nRestaurant, Inc., 754 F.2d 1336, 1362 (7th Cir. 1985) (Gibson,\r\nJ. dissenting in part), and we think it is unreasonable to hold\r\nthe plaintiff to a higher standard.     \r\n          In sum, we hold that the district court erred in\r\nfinding that the federal conspiracy claims were utterly without\r\nfoundation when suit was brought.  Once that finding falls from\r\nthe case, we cannot affirm a fee award to the prevailing\r\nprivate defendants under 42 U.S.C.  1988.\r\n          Affirmed in part and reversed in part.  No costs.\r\n",

As to the instructions, it suffices to\r\nsay that they sufficiently conveyed the relevant substance of\r\nmost of the matters that Crawford had wanted explained in\r\ngreater detail to the jury.\r\n          Crawford's Chapter 93A argument, as explicated on\r\nappeal, seems to be that two of One Stop's  pump signs\r\nallegedly violated Mass. Regs. Code tit. 202,  2.06(2), and\r\nthat, therefore, regardless of whether he relied on those\r\nsigns, the court should have found a \"per se\" violation of\r\nChapter 93A.  This argument is unpreserved, and we reject it on\r\nthat basis.  For one thing, it was not squarely presented below\r\nin Crawford's omnibus motion for judgment as a matter of law. \r\nFor another thing, he compounded the waiver by acquiescing in\r\na defense request for a supplementary instruction directing the\r\njury to find liability only if it found that he had relied on\r\na deceptive practice. \r\n                             III.\r\n          We are unable to sustain the district court's\r\ndecision to award attorneys' fees to the prevailing private\r\ndefendants under 42 U.S.C.  1988.    \r\n          A prevailing defendant in a civil rights case is\r\nentitled to fees and costs only if the defendant can establish\r\nthat the suit was \"totally unfounded, frivolous, or otherwise\r\nunreasonable\" when brought, or that the plaintiff continued the\r\nlitigation after it clearly became so.

Even\r\nmore troubling, however, is that the court's basic precondition\r\nfor the award -- the finding that the federal conspiracy claim\r\nwas baseless when brought -- does not withstand scrutiny.\r\n          We have reviewed the record in detail.  While the\r\nevidence supports the decision to dismiss the section 1983\r\nclaims against the private defendants at the close of the\r\ntrial, that is not the proper coign of vantage.  To the precise\r\ncontrary, in awarding fees to a prevailing defendant, a \"court\r\nmust resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc\r\nreasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not\r\nultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or\r\nwithout foundation.\"  Christiansburg Garment Co. v.

When Crawford brought suit, there was\r\na plausible (if circumstantial) foundation for his conspiracy\r\nclaims.  Crawford had been arrested without apparent cause or\r\npolice investigation within a few moments of the officer's\r\narrival on the scene in response to an attendant's telephoned\r\ncomplaint.  The officer and the two attendants then conversed\r\namongst themselves and all three participated in an improper\r\nconfiscation of money and in the unauthorized towing of\r\nCrawford's automobile.  To make appearances worse, the towing\r\nwas accomplished by a municipal contractor, and the company's\r\nowner (who also owned the service station) was familiar with\r\nvarious police officials.  The towing firm then conditioned\r\nCrawford's retrieval of his vehicle on the payment of a towing\r\nfee.  This is the sort of circumstantial sequence that  has\r\ntroubled even seasoned jurists, see, e.g.,Alexis v. McDonald's\r\nRestaurants of Massachusetts, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196337\"><a href=\"/opinion/196337/alexis-v-mcdonalds-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (Bownes, J. dissenting in part); Moore v.

Once that finding falls from\r\nthe case, we cannot affirm a fee award to the prevailing\r\nprivate defendants under 42 U.S.C.  1988.\r\n          Affirmed in part and reversed in part.
