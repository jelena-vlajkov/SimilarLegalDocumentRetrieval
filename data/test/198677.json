On November 20, 1997, James\r\nHowe  filed a petition in the federal bankruptcy court in Rhode\r\nIsland under chapter 7, 11 U.S.C.  701 et seq.  In amended\r\nschedules, he claimed as exempt three legal claims then pending\r\nor to be asserted by him in different courts, assigning them\r\nvalues as follows: a claim for personal injuries sustained by\r\nHowe in a motor vehicle accident ($15,000); a claim for breach of\r\ncontract and related wrongs ($600,000); and a claim to recover on\r\na dishonored check ($10).  Like all of Howe's property as of the\r\ndate he filed for bankruptcy, his legal claims became part of the\r\nbankruptcy \"estate\" under the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.\r\n541(a)(1), and are available to his creditors, unless they are\r\nexempt property.\r\nThe Bankruptcy Code permitted Howe to retain \"any\r\nproperty that is exempt under . . . [Rhode Island] or local law,\"\r\n11 U.S.C. 522(b)(2)(A), but the Code does not say \"exempt\" from\r\nwhat.  Obviously, the general notion is exempt from creditors,\r\nnot (say) exempt from local property taxes.  Some states have\r\nstatutes listing property that is exempt \"for purposes of\r\nbankruptcy,\" e.g., Ga. Code Ann.  44-13-100, but Rhode Island\r\nlaw is less explicit.  Nevertheless, one provision listing\r\nproperty \"exempt from attachment\" includes a series of items akin\r\nto those commonly exempted in bankruptcy (e.g., wearing apparel,\r\nworking tools up to $500, furniture up to $1,000, homestead up to\r\n$100,000), R.I. Gen. Laws  9-26-4, 4.1, and the parties accept\r\nthat the listing sets forth bankruptcy exemptions.\r\nThe three legal claims sought to be exempted by Howe do\r\nnot fit within any specific category in sections 9-26-4 and 9-26-\r\n4.1; but Howe argued that they do fit within a catch-all\r\ncategory, comprising \"[s]uch other property, real, personal, or\r\nmixed, in possession or actions as is or shall be exempted from\r\nattachment and execution, either permanently or temporarily, by\r\ngeneral or specific acts, charters of incorporation, or by the\r\npolicy of the law.\"  R.I. Gen. Laws  9-26-4(10).  Howe argued in\r\nthe bankruptcy court that under Rhode Island common law, his\r\nunliquidated legal claims against others could not be seized and\r\nthat they therefore fell within the statute's provision for\r\nproperty \"exempted from attachment and execution . . . by the\r\npolicy of the law.\"\r\nThe trustee and an unsecured creditor objected, and the\r\nbankruptcy court rejected Howe's position, as well as other\r\narguments not pressed on this appeal.  The Bankruptcy Appellate\r\nPanel sustained the bankruptcy court.  Howe has now appealed to\r\nthis court.  He contends, and we assume this to be true, that\r\n\"the policy of the law\" phrase includes exemptions that would\r\notherwise qualify even if they exist in common rather than\r\nstatutory law.  Cf. Arch Lumber Co. v. Dohm, 98 A.2d 840 (R.I.\r\n1953) (exempting children's toys).  The critical question is what\r\nRhode Island law provides as to unliquidated legal claims and\r\nwhether what it provides amounts to a bankruptcy exemption.\r\nIn previous centuries, it was very hard in a law action\r\nfor a creditor to lay hands on potential legal claims that the\r\ndebtor might have against a third party or even an unliquidated\r\ndebt where the  obligation was admitted but the amount in\r\ndispute.  Pre-judgment \"attachment,\" to establish jurisdiction or\r\nsecure an anticipated judgment, was not generally available as to\r\nany property at common law, Martin v. Lincoln Bar, Inc., 622 A.2d\r\n464, 469 (R.I. 1993); see generally Crandall, Hagedorn &amp; Smith,\r\nThe Law of Debtors and Creditors  6.04[1][b], at 6-33 (rev. ed.\r\n1991).  As for post-judgment \"execution\" against the debtor's\r\nassets, this was achieved through specific writs (e.g., fieri\r\nfacias authorizing seizure and sale of personal property) that\r\nfailed to reach equitable interests of the debtor and certain\r\nintangibles.  Crandall, supra,  6.05[5][a], at 6-115.   \r\nThereafter, pre-judgment attachment was developed as a\r\nremedy by statute.  E.g., R.I. Gen. Laws  10-5-1 et seq.  Post-\r\njudgment remedies were expanded initially by the equity courts,\r\nwhich allowed a \"creditor's bill,\" one of whose functions was to\r\nreach equitable interests of the debtor that fell outside the\r\ncommon law writs.  Crandall, supra,  6.05[5][a], at 6-115 to 6-\r\n116.  Statutes, in turn, have expanded and in some measure\r\nsupplanted the non-statutory common law and equitable remedies of\r\njudgment creditors.  E.g., R.I. Gen. Laws  9-26-1 et seq., 9-\r\n28-1 et seq.\r\nThere is a false neatness to this picture.  The Rhode\r\nIsland statutes pertaining to such remedies are a tangle of\r\nprovisions cobbled together over time; they use words like\r\n\"attachment\" with somewhat different meanings in different\r\ncontexts; and they include other important remedies, such as\r\ngarnishment--which may be pre- or post-judgment--to reach debtor\r\nassets in the hands of third parties, R.I. Gen. Laws  10-17-1\r\net seq..  Statutory statements that such and such may or may not\r\nbe \"attached\" appear, variously phrased, in various locations. \r\nE.g., id.  9-26-4, 9-26-4.1, 9-26-5, 36-10-34.\r\nStill, nothing in the Rhode Island statutes to which we\r\nhave been directed expresses any affirmative policy against the\r\nattachment, either pre- or post-judgment, of a debtor's legal\r\nclaims as a class.  Certainly specific kinds of legal claims\r\n(e.g., to receive pensions or back wages) are affirmatively\r\nprotected to one degree or another from attachment, e.g., R.I.\r\nGen. Laws  9-26-4(8), (12), and we will return to Rhode Island's\r\nspecial treatment of attempts to assign personal injury claims. \r\nBut there is no general statutory bar to seizure of intangibles. \r\nIndeed, as we shall see, Rhode Island law facilitates such\r\nseizures.  Against this background, we return to the question of\r\nwhat meaning should be given to section 9-26-4(10).\r\nIn Howe's view, that his legal claims could not (we\r\nwill assume) be attached at common law pre-judgment, or executed\r\nagainst post-judgment, means that Rhode Island does have a\r\n\"policy of the [common] law\" that \"exempt[s] from attachment and\r\nexecution\" such legal claims.  But an alternative view is that\r\nthe failure of common law remedies to reach such claims should be\r\nregarded merely as a gap in the law, reflecting the writ-based\r\ncharacter of the common law (no writ, no right) and not as an\r\n\"exemption\" reflecting a policy or purpose to safeguard such\r\ninterests from seizure by creditors in general or bankruptcy\r\ncreditors in particular.\r\nEither reading of section 9-26-4(10) accords with its\r\nlanguage, and fortunately we have an answer from the Rhode Island\r\ncourts as to how they construe the section.  In Rhode Island Nat.\r\nBank v. Chase, 12 A. 233 (R.I. 1887), the state supreme court\r\nfaced a claim that the predecessor to this section prevented\r\nattachment of someone's interest in life insurance policies that\r\nhad no cash surrender value, the objection being made that the\r\nproperty interest was not attachable because it was \"equitable,\r\nuncertain and contingent.\"  Id. at 234.  In language that\r\neffectively rejects Howe's present position, the court said that\r\n\"property which is meant to be protected by the  exemption\r\nreferred to is not property which is, from its nature, beyond the\r\nreach of attachment, but property which it is a matter of public\r\npolicy to protect from attachment.\"  Id..\r\nHowe counters by saying that the insurance policies had\r\nan ascertainable value and refers us to McKendall v. Patullo, 160\r\nA. 202 (R.I. 1932), in which the Rhode Island Supreme Court\r\nreferred to \"[t]he general rule . . . that an unliquidated claim\r\ncannot be garnished.\"  Id. at 203.  There are obvious policy\r\nobjections to a garnishment of an unliquidated debt to the extent\r\nthat it calls on the garnishee to pay over moneys before they are\r\nfound to be owed.  But here the trustee does not seek garnishment\r\nor any immediate payment at all from those against whom Howe has\r\nwhat we will assume are disputed claims; rather, the trustee\r\nseeks only to take over Howe's claims against those third\r\nparties, a step that does not implicate the concerns of the\r\nMcKendall court.\r\nThere is further evidence that Rhode Island has no\r\ngeneral policy against attachment of claims against third\r\nparties.  In the course of codifying execution remedies for\r\njudgment creditors, Rhode Island enacted a statutory provision\r\ncodifying and arguably expanding the old creditor's bill devised\r\nby the equity courts.  R.I. Gen. Laws 9-28-1.  This provision\r\npermits an unsatisfied judgment creditor to  reach \"any equitable\r\nestate, any equitable assets, or any choses in action of the\r\njudgment debtor, except such as shall be exempt from attachment\r\nby virtue of statutory provision.\"  On its face, this language\r\nrefutes any claim that Rhode Island is hostile to creditors\r\ntaking over debtors legal claims against third parties.\r\nHowe responds by pointing to the just quoted\r\nqualification (\"except such . . .\"), arguing that this\r\nincorporates section 9-26-4(10)'s reference to \"policy\"\r\nexemptions.  But we have already explained why, under Chase, the\r\ngap left at common law as to intangibles is not properly viewed\r\nas an exemption at all.  Further, Howe's contrary view would\r\nvirtually moot the inclusion in section 9-28-1 of \"any choses in\r\naction of the judgment debtor\" since in general these were not\r\nsubject to attachment at common law and, on Howe's reading, would\r\nhave been added by the statute as a remedy only to be immediately\r\nsubtracted by the \"except such\" proviso.\r\nHowe's approach to section 9-26-4(10) was rejected by\r\nthe Supreme Court, in an analogous context, almost a century ago. \r\nPage v. Edmunds, 187 U.S. 596 (1903).  Still, one can find more\r\nrecent decisions looking in both directions.  Compare In re\r\nGeise, 992 F.2d 651, 658-59 (7th Cir. 1993) (holding that\r\nproperty not subject to sequestration is not therefore exempt),\r\nwith In re Mitchell, 73 B.R. 93 (Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1987) (holding\r\nproperty exempt where, inter alia, claim not subject to\r\ngarnishment, aff'd 855 F.2d 859 (8th Cir. 1988).  In the end\r\nalmost everything turns on how an individual state construes its\r\nown mix of statutes and common law rules pertaining to\r\nexemptions.  Happily, Chase provides us such guidance, even\r\nthough Howe can find scraps of language in his favor in other\r\nRhode Island cases.  But who would expect otherwise after more\r\nthan a century of decisions?\r\nThis brings us to a different, narrower issue, namely,\r\nwhether Rhode Island law \"exempts\" personal injury claims from\r\nbeing reached by creditors even though it does not exempt claims\r\nagainst third parties in general from attachment or execution. \r\nInterestingly, the \"federal\" list of exemptions does provide an\r\nexemption of up to $16,150 for a debtor's right to receive actual\r\ncompensation for \"personal bodily injury\" (not including pain and\r\nsuffering or compensation for actual pecuniary loss).  11 U.S.C.\r\n522(d)(11)(D).  But Howe chose the alternative list of\r\nexemptions available under Rhode Island law, and while one can\r\nimagine that Rhode Island might have a policy reflecting the same\r\nprotective concerns toward bodily injury, neither Rhode Island's\r\nstatutes nor its case law adopts such a position.\r\nWhat Rhode Island cases do express is a policy of\r\nrefusing to enforce the \"assignment\" of personal injury claims\r\nbefore they are reduced to judgment.  Tyler v. Superior Court, 73\r\nA.  467 (R.I. 1909).  But this rule, although apparently still in\r\nforce, is based on concerns--reflected in the now hoary rules\r\nagainst champerty and maintenance--about promoting litigation by\r\n\"intermeddling volunteers\" who purchase personal injury claims\r\n\"for their own profit.\"  Etheridge v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., 480\r\nA.2d 1341, 1344-46 (R.I. 1984).  Those concerns are pretty faint\r\nin the case of a bankruptcy trustee who is simply trying to\r\nmuster the bankrupt's property for the benefit of creditors, none\r\nof whom likely wanted to be in the business of pursuing the\r\ndebtor's claims against anyone.\r\nWhile we have found no Rhode Island case directly in\r\npoint, its courts have sensibly relaxed the ban against\r\nassignment of personal injury claims where the concerns just\r\nnoted are not implicated.  E.g., id. at 1345; see also DeSenne v.\r\nJamestown Boat Yard, Inc., 968 F.2d 1388, 1390 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(applying Rhode Island law).  Thus, it strikes us as doubtful\r\nthat Rhode Island's anti-assignment policy would bar an\r\nassignment in favor of creditors.  However this may be, we think\r\nit clear in light of Chase that the Rhode Island policy limiting\r\nassignability of personal injury claims would never be described\r\nas an \"exemption\" within the meaning of section 9-26-4(10).\r\nAffirmed.\n",

In amended schedules, he claimed as exempt three legal claims then pending or to be asserted by him in different courts, assigning them values as follows: a claim for personal injuries sustained by Howe in a motor vehicle accident ($15,000); a claim for breach of contract and related wrongs ($600,000); and a claim to recover on a dishonored check ($10). Like all of Howe's property as of the date he filed for bankruptcy, his legal claims became part of the bankruptcy \"estate\" under the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 541(a)(1), and are available to his creditors, unless they are exempt property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Code permitted Howe to retain \"any property that is exempt under . . .

In language that effectively rejects Howe's present position, the court said that \"property which is meant to be protected by the exemption referred to is not property which is, from its nature, beyond the reach of attachment, but property which it is a matter of public policy to protect from attachment.\" Id..<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Howe counters by saying that the insurance policies had an ascertainable value and refers us to McKendall v. Patullo, 160 A. 202 (R.I. 1932), in which the Rhode Island Supreme Court referred to \"[t]he general rule . . . that an unliquidated claim cannot be garnished.\" Id. at 203. There are obvious policy objections to a garnishment of an unliquidated debt to the extent that it calls on the garnishee to pay over moneys before they are found to be owed. But here the trustee does not seek garnishment or any immediate payment at all from those against whom Howe has what we will assume are disputed claims; rather, the trustee seeks only to take over Howe's claims against those third parties, a step that does not implicate the concerns of the McKendall court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is further evidence that Rhode Island has no general policy against attachment of claims against third parties.

Further, Howe's contrary view would virtually moot the inclusion in section 9-28-1 of \"any choses in action of the judgment debtor\" since in general these were not subject to attachment at common law and, on Howe's reading, would have been added by the statute as a remedy only to be immediately subtracted by the \"except such\" proviso.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Howe's approach to section 9-26-4(10) was rejected by the Supreme Court, in an analogous context, almost a century ago.

In amended schedules, he claimed as exempt three legal claims then pending or to be asserted by him in different courts, assigning them values as follows: a claim for personal injuries sustained by Howe in a motor vehicle accident ($15,000); a claim for breach of contract and related wrongs ($600,000); and a claim to recover on a dishonored check ($10). Like all of Howe's property as of the date he filed for bankruptcy, his legal claims became part of the bankruptcy \"estate\" under the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 541(a)(1), and are available to his creditors, unless they are exempt property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Code permitted Howe to retain \"any property that is exempt under . . . [Rhode Island] or local law,\" 11 U.S.C. 522(b)(2)(A), but the Code does not say \"exempt\" from what. Obviously, the general notion is exempt from creditors, not (say) exempt from local property taxes. Some states have statutes listing property that is exempt \"for purposes of bankruptcy,\" e.g., Ga. Code Ann. &#167; 44-13-100, but Rhode Island law is less explicit. Nevertheless, one provision listing property \"exempt from attachment\" includes a series of items akin to those commonly exempted in bankruptcy (e.g., wearing apparel, working tools up to $500, furniture up to $1,000, homestead up to $100,000), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 9-26-4, 4.1, and the parties accept that the listing sets forth bankruptcy exemptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three legal claims sought to be exempted by Howe do not fit within any specific category in sections 9-26-4 and 9-26-4.1; but Howe argued that they do fit within a catch-all category, comprising \"[s]uch other property, real, personal, or mixed, in possession or actions as is or shall be exempted from attachment and execution, either permanently or temporarily, by general or specific acts, charters of incorporation, or by the policy of the law.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-26-4(10). Howe argued in the bankruptcy court that under Rhode Island common law, his unliquidated legal claims against others could not be seized and that they therefore fell within the statute's provision for property \"exempted from attachment and execution . . . by the policy of the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee and an unsecured creditor objected, and the bankruptcy court rejected Howe's position, as well as other arguments not pressed on this appeal. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel sustained the bankruptcy court. Howe has now appealed to this court. He contends, and we assume this to be true, that \"the policy of the law\" phrase includes exemptions that would otherwise qualify even if they exist in common rather than statutory law. Cf. Arch Lumber Co. v. Dohm, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2315684\"><a href=\"/opinion/2315684/arch-lumber-co-v-dohm/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span> </a></span>(R.I. 1953) (exempting children's toys). The critical question is what Rhode Island law provides as to unliquidated legal claims and whether what it provides amounts to a bankruptcy exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In previous centuries, it was very hard in a law action for a creditor to lay hands on potential legal claims that the debtor might have against a third party or even an unliquidated debt where the obligation was admitted but the amount in dispute. Pre-judgment \"attachment,\" to establish jurisdiction or secure an anticipated judgment, was not generally available as to any property at common law, Martin v. Lincoln Bar, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2001954\"><a href=\"/opinion/2001954/martin-v-lincoln-bar-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 469 (R.I. 1993); see generally Crandall, Hagedorn &amp; Smith, The Law of Debtors and Creditors &#167; 6.04[1][b], at 6-33 (rev. ed. 1991). As for post-judgment \"execution\" against the debtor's assets, this was achieved through specific writs (e.g., fieri facias authorizing seizure and sale of personal property) that failed to reach equitable interests of the debtor and certain intangibles. Crandall, supra, &#167; 6.05[5][a], at 6-115.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, pre-judgment attachment was developed as a remedy by statute. E.g., R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-5-1 et seq. Post-judgment remedies were expanded initially by the equity courts, which allowed a \"creditor's bill,\" one of whose functions was to reach equitable interests of the debtor that fell outside the common law writs. Crandall, supra, &#167; 6.05[5][a], at 6-115 to 6-116. Statutes, in turn, have expanded and in some measure supplanted the non-statutory common law and equitable remedies of judgment creditors. E.g., R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 9-26-1 et seq., 9-28-1 et seq.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a false neatness to this picture. The Rhode Island statutes pertaining to such remedies are a tangle of provisions cobbled together over time; they use words like \"attachment\" with somewhat different meanings in different contexts; and they include other important remedies, such as garnishment--which may be pre- or post-judgment--to reach debtor assets in the hands of third parties, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 10-17-1 et seq.. Statutory statements that such and such may or may not be \"attached\" appear, variously phrased, in various locations. E.g., id. &#167;&#167; 9-26-4, 9-26-4.1, 9-26-5, 36-10-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, nothing in the Rhode Island statutes to which we have been directed expresses any affirmative policy against the attachment, either pre- or post-judgment, of a debtor's legal claims as a class. Certainly specific kinds of legal claims (e.g., to receive pensions or back wages) are affirmatively protected to one degree or another from attachment, e.g., R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-26-4(8), (12), and we will return to Rhode Island's special treatment of attempts to assign personal injury claims. But there is no general statutory bar to seizure of intangibles. Indeed, as we shall see, Rhode Island law facilitates such seizures. Against this background, we return to the question of what meaning should be given to section 9-26-4(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Howe's view, that his legal claims could not (we will assume) be attached at common law pre-judgment, or executed against post-judgment, means that Rhode Island does have a \"policy of the [common] law\" that \"exempt[s] from attachment and execution\" such legal claims. But an alternative view is that the failure of common law remedies to reach such claims should be regarded merely as a gap in the law, reflecting the writ-based character of the common law (no writ, no right) and not as an \"exemption\" reflecting a policy or purpose to safeguard such interests from seizure by creditors in general or bankruptcy creditors in particular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Either reading of section 9-26-4(10) accords with its language, and fortunately we have an answer from the Rhode Island courts as to how they construe the section. In Rhode Island Nat. Bank v. Chase, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3869503\"><a href=\"/opinion/4109584/rhode-island-nat-bank-v-chase/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span> </a></span>(R.I. 1887), the state supreme court faced a claim that the predecessor to this section prevented attachment of someone's interest in life insurance policies that had no cash surrender value, the objection being made that the property interest was not attachable because it was \"equitable, uncertain and contingent.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3869503\"><a href=\"/opinion/4109584/rhode-island-nat-bank-v-chase/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 234. </a></span>In language that effectively rejects Howe's present position, the court said that \"property which is meant to be protected by the exemption referred to is not property which is, from its nature, beyond the reach of attachment, but property which it is a matter of public policy to protect from attachment.\" Id..<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Howe counters by saying that the insurance policies had an ascertainable value and refers us to McKendall v.

However this may be, we think it clear in light of Chase that the Rhode Island policy limiting assignability of personal injury claims would never be described as an \"exemption\" within the meaning of section 9-26-4(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prior to 1978, whether property passed to the estate depended on what property was transferable and subject to seizure under state law; but the new Code adopted a general rule that the estate includes all of the debtor's property interests, including intangibles.

The statutory issue arose because the policy holder had assigned such of his property as was not \"exempt from attachment\"; one party said that this assignment did not include the insurance policies with no cash surrender value because they would be so exempt under section 9-26-4(10)'s predecessor. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469162\"><a href=\"/opinion/469162/sierra-switchboard-co-and-ella-fehl-cross-appellees-v-westinghouse/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 233-34.</a></span></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This statute has been deemed unconstitutional by this court for lack of procedural safeguards, Dionne v.
