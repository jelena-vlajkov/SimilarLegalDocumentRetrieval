After a thorough review of the\n\nparties submissions and of the record, we affirm.                     In order\n\nto establish that an exception to abstention under                     Younger\n\nv.    Harris,    401    U.S.     37    (1971),   would      be   appropriate,\n\nappellant must show that the “extraordinary circumstances”\n\nin question “render the state court incapable of fairly and\n\nfully adjudicating the federal issues before it.”                            Id.\n\n(quoting Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 124-25 (1975)).\n\nThis is a “narrow exception” to the Younger abstention\n\ndoctrine.       See Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 611\n\n(1975); see also United Books, Inc. v. Conte, 739 F.2d 30,\n\n34    (1st   Cir.   1984).        The     irreparable       injury    that    is\n\nthreatened must be one “‘other than that incidental to every\n\n[]    proceeding       brought        lawfully   and   in    good     faith.’”\n\nYounger,     401    U.S.   at     47     (quoting   Douglas      v.   City    of\n\nJeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 164 (1943)).\n\n             Appellant has not alleged facts showing that the\n\nstate court is somehow incapable of adjudicating this matter\n\nincluding the federal issues, nor has she alleged an injury\n\nthat is different “than that incidental to every [child\n\nprotection] proceeding brought lawfully and in good faith.’”\n\nId.    Appellant’s argument that her federal action would not\n\finterfere with the state action is unsupported by detailed\n\nargument and is inherently unpersuasive; the conduct of\n\nparts of the same controversy in federal court, after a\n\nstate proceeding has begun, is an interference with the\n\nstate proceeding.      Further, it appears that if the federal\n\ncourt were to grant the relief she requests, its judgment\n\nwould conflict with the previous order of the state court to\n\n“cease reunification.”       Abstention is most appropriate in\n\nsuch circumstances.\n\n           Thus, the lower court correctly abstained from this\n\nmatter.    See Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 434-35 (1979)\n\n(since state courts traditionally have addressed important\n\nmatters of family relations, allegation that those relations\n\nare threatened by ongoing state proceedings is insufficient,\n\nstanding     alone,    to   justify   exception   to   abstention\n\ndoctrine).\n\n           Affirmed.    1st Cir.
