APFEL,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                  Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Lisa Tsarelka on brief pro se.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Anita Johnson,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          October 3, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam. Appellant Lisa Tsarelka appeals from\n\nthe   dismissal        of    her   complaint.       The    district     court\n\ndismissed       the   complaint,     by     endorsement,     based    on   the\n\nreasons set out in the motion to dismiss filed by appellee,\n\nKenneth    S.    Apfel,      the   Commissioner     of    Social    Security.\n\nThere was no error in the action of the district court and\n\nthe court's judgment is affirmed for essentially the reasons\n\nset out in the motion to dismiss.\n\n            We add only that despite appellant's arguments to\n\nthe contrary, she has submitted no evidence that she ever\n\nhad presented her claim regarding the termination of her\n\nSupplemental          Security     Income     (SSI)      benefits     to    an\n\nadministrative         law   judge   (ALJ)    or   the    Appeals    Council.\n\nNeither the ALJ nor the Council ever addressed such a claim.\n\nFurther, the Appeals Council's reference to the amount of\n\nappellant's resources was made in a particular, limited\n\ncontext.    That is, this reference was made to explain the\n\nCouncil's opinion that, given the little money appellant had\n\nat her disposal in May 1997, repayment of $3,378 would not\n\nfurther the purpose of the SSI program.                  Significantly, the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fAppeals Council did not make the comment in relation to the\n\nquestion whether appellant qualified for SSI benefits.\n\n         Affirmed.   See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                            -3-\n\f",
