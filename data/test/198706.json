Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Olga M. Shepard on brief for appellant.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Camille Velez-Rive, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nNovember 4, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Rafael Hernandez-Rosario appeals from his\r\nsentence.  He pled guilty to one count of possession with\r\nintent to distribute cocaine and received the statutory\r\nmandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  Hernandez' argument\r\non appeal is that the district court erred in refusing to grant\r\nhim the benefit of the \"safety valve\" provision of 18 U.S.C. \r\n3553(f) and U.S.S.G.  5C1.2.\r\n          On the third day of sentencing hearings in this case,\r\nafter hearing testimony from and questioning Hernandez and the\r\nPolice Agent who had arrested him, the district court found\r\nthat Hernandez had failed to meet the fifth requirement of the\r\n\"safety valve\" provision: to truthfully provide the government\r\nwith all information and evidence that defendant has concerning\r\nthe offense and related offenses. See 18 U.S.C.  3553(f)(5). \r\nSpecifically, the sentencing judge found that \"the testimony of\r\ndefendant Hernandez Rosario concerning the events surrounding\r\nthe commission of the [offense], was not credible.\"\r\n          This court \"reviews for clear error the factual\r\nfindings relating to whether a defendant has qualified for the\r\n'safety valve' provisions.\"  United States v. White, 199 F.3d\r\n70, 73 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997).  The burden is on the defendant to\r\nprove entitlement to the benefit of the \"safety valve\"\r\nprovision.  See United States v. Montanez, 82 F.3d 520, 521 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  The district court did not clearly err in\r\ndetermining that Hernandez did not meet that burden.  \r\n          The judge's finding that Hernandez did not truthfully\r\nrecount the events surrounding the offense is amply supported\r\nby the record.  The testimony of Police Agent Juan Carreras,\r\nwho arrested Hernandez at the airport, was directly\r\ncontradictory to the testimony of Hernandez with respect to two\r\nimportant facts: whether Hernandez was alone when he crossed\r\nthrough the checkpoint and whether he had luggage with him at\r\nthat time.  The investigation report prepared by another police\r\nagent on the day of arrest and testimony by a third police\r\nagent who was present at the airport during the arrest are\r\nconsistent with Agent Carreras' version of the facts.\r\n          Hernandez' reliance upon United States v. Miranda-\r\nSantiago, 96 F.3d 517 (1st Cir. 1996), is misplaced.  There, we\r\nremanded for the district court to revisit the issue of\r\napplication of the \"safety valve\" provision where the court had\r\nrested its decision on a \"bare conclusion\" that defendant had\r\nfailed to cooperate fully, \"absent either specific factual\r\nfindings or easily recognizable support in the record.\"Id. at\r\n529-30.  Here, by contrast, the district court heard testimony\r\nfrom and closely questioned Hernandez and Agent Carreras before\r\nmaking a specific factual finding that Hernandez had not told\r\nthe truth about the events surrounding his offense.  There was\r\nno clear error. See White, 119 F.3d at 74 (affirming sentence\r\nand refusal to grant benefit of \"safety valve\" provision where\r\n\"district court, based on extensive evidence and after vigorous\r\nargumentation by counsel, made the carefully considered\r\ndetermination that White lacked credibility\").  \r\n          Hernandez argues that his rights under the Jencks\r\nAct, 18 U.S.C.  3500 et seq., were violated because the\r\ndistrict court refused his request to cross-examine Agent\r\nCarreras a second time for the purpose of using the arrest\r\nreport to impeach his testimony at the sentencing hearing.  The\r\nimpeachment argument is that because important details included\r\nin Agent Carreras' testimony were omitted from the perfunctory\r\narrest report prepared by him, the details must have been\r\nfabricated.  On the basis of that impeachment evidence,\r\nHernandez asks this court to vacate his sentence and remand for\r\nresentencing without regard to the statutory mandatory minimum\r\nsentence.  \r\n          In light of the record as a whole, which includes an\r\ninvestigation report prepared on the day of the arrest and\r\ntestimony of another police agent present at the airport at the\r\ntime of the arrest, we conclude that the impeachment value of\r\nthe arrest report is minimal.  We need not decide whether the\r\ndistrict court erred in denying Hernandez' request to cross-\r\nexamine Agent Carreras for a second time because any such error\r\nwas harmless. \r\n          The sentence is affirmed. See Loc. R. 27(c) (formerly\r\nLoc. R. 27.1).\r\n",
