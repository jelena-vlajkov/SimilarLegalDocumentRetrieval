On February 3, 1998, the Pacific\r\nSwan, a British-flag freighter carrying a cargo of vitrified high-\r\nlevel nuclear waste, passed through the Mona Passage, a stretch of\r\nseas between the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. It was\r\nbound for Japan, by way of the Panama Canal, from France. A day\r\nearlier, a group of fishermen and environmental organizations from\r\nwestern Puerto Rico, fearing an accident or maritime disaster,\r\nbrought this action for an injunction to stop the shipment until\r\nthe United States filed an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in\r\naccordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42\r\nU.S.C.  4321 et seq. After the parties filed cross-motions for\r\nsummary judgment, the district court denied the claim for\r\ninjunctive relief and dismissed the action. See Mayagezanos por la\r\nSalud y el Ambiente v. United States, 38 F. Supp. 2d 168, 178\r\n(D.P.R. 1999). We affirm on different reasoning.\r\n\n                             I\r\nThe voyage of the Pacific Swan is part of a modern\r\ncircumferential trade. Uranium from the United States is sent to\r\nJapan to fuel nuclear energy reactors. Japan ships the reactors'\r\nspent fuel to COGEMA, a French nuclear power company, for recycling\r\nat its La Hague plant. This process recovers a substantial portion\r\nof reusable fissionable material, which is turned into nuclear fuel\r\n(either RepU fuel, comprising uranium, or MOX fuel, comprising\r\nplutonium and uranium). It also generates high-level nuclear waste,\r\nwhich includes trace amounts of uranium and plutonium. The waste is\r\nvitrified according to specifications that have been approved by\r\nFrench and Japanese governments and placed in casks that meet\r\ncriteria set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency in its\r\nRegulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material. Both\r\nthe waste and the fuel are returned to Japan on board specially\r\ndesigned ships that meet the standards of the International\r\nMaritime Organization's Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated\r\nNuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks\r\non Board Ships, IMO Resolution A 18/Res. 748, Annex (1993). The\r\nprivate shippers choose the return route to Japan from three\r\noptions: the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, or the Panama Canal.\r\nThe U.S. connection to this trade occurs in two ways.\r\nFirst, the United States supplies the uranium to Japan under a 1988\r\nagreement between the two countries. See Agreement for Cooperation\r\nBetween the Government of the United States and the Government of\r\nJapan Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, Nov. 4, 1987,\r\nH.R. Doc. No. 100-128 (1987) (entered into force July 17, 1988),\r\navailable at 1988 WL 582501 at *3 (\"U.S.-Japan Agreement\"). Second,\r\nthe transport of the nuclear waste shipments through the Mona\r\nPassage means that the ship traverses waters in which the United\r\nStates has some interest, even if they are not territorial waters.\r\n\n                              II\r\nBecause these waste-laden voyages through the Mona\r\nPassage continue, the case is not moot, which the United States\r\nappropriately concedes. See Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494\r\nU.S. 472, 481 (1990). Review of entry of summary judgment is de\r\nnovo; further, the issues presented are ones of law and our review\r\nis plenary. See National Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d\r\n38, 49 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. granted, 68 U.S.L.W. 3178 (U.S. Nov.\r\n29, 1999) (No. 99-474).\r\nOn appeal, Mayagezanos has refined its argument to a\r\nsingle attack: the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider\r\nthis action under NEPA and the United States's failure to regulate\r\nthe passage of such nuclear waste through its Exclusive Economic\r\nZone (EEZ) waters is a \"major federal action\" within the meaning of\r\nNEPA. Mayagezanos argues that there is a major federal action\r\nbecause the United States is required to play some role in the\r\ntransport of this waste under various international agreements and\r\ncustomary international law. This complex of interests and\r\nresponsibilities, they contend, suffices to establish \"major\r\nfederal action\" under NEPA. The United States rejoins that the\r\nshipment of waste is the \"action,\" it is not being carried out by\r\na federal agency but by private parties, and the facts do not meet\r\nthe tests to determine if there is federal action where the primary\r\naction is carried out by private players. \r\nUnder NEPA, all U.S. agencies are required to \"include in\r\nevery recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and\r\nother major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of\r\nthe human environment\" a \"detailed statement.\" 42 U.S.C.  4332(2).\r\nThis detailed statement, known as an EIS, must address the\r\nenvironmental impact of proposed actions and alternatives. NEPA\r\n102(2)(C) provides, in pertinent part, that\r\n  all agencies of the Federal Government shall -- . . . (C)\r\ninclude in every recommendation or report on proposals\r\nfor legislation and other major Federal actions\r\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human\r\nenvironment, a detailed statement by the responsible\r\nofficial on (i) the environmental impact of the proposed\r\naction, (ii) any adverse environmental effects which\r\ncannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,\r\n(iii) alternatives to the proposed action . . . .\r\n\n42 U.S.C.  4332(2)(C). NEPA's aims are two-fold: to \"place[] upon\r\nan agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of\r\nthe environmental impact of a proposed action\" and to \"ensure[]\r\nthat the agency will inform the public that it has indeed\r\nconsidered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.\"\r\nBaltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\r\nInc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983) (internal quotation marks and\r\ncitations omitted); see also Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens\r\nCouncil, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).\r\nMayagezanos has described the significance of a maritime\r\naccident or incident involving this waste and the government has\r\nresponded that all safety precautions have been taken. Arguments\r\nabout the safety of such shipments may be made to a variety of\r\nbodies, both in the United States and internationally. Before,\r\nhowever, U.S. courts may speak to the safety matter, they must\r\nfirst decide whether they have any authority to address such\r\nissues, a question that turns on whether NEPA applies at all.\r\nThe arguments seem to contain two implicit assumptions:\r\nthat NEPA applies to actions outside territorial U.S. lands and\r\nwaters and that NEPA's \"major federal action\" requirement would\r\nwork in the same fashion in the domestic and the international\r\ncontexts. We are skeptical. See, e.g., United States v. Nippon\r\nPaper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1, 12 n.10 (1st Cir. 1997) (Lynch, J.,\r\nconcurring). These are difficult problems, but because\r\nMayagezanos's claims fail even under the \"major federal action\"\r\ntests used in domestic cases, we need not inquire into the validity\r\nof these assumptions. Consequently, we turn to the domestic case\r\nlaw.\r\nThis circuit has not recently addressed the criteria to\r\nbe used in domestic cases to determine when private activities may\r\nbe deemed to be major federal actions under NEPA. In Citizens for\r\nResponsible Area Growth v. Adams, 680 F.2d 835 (1st Cir. 1982),\r\nthis court held that construction of an airport hangar by private\r\nparties with private monies was not federal action for NEPA\r\npurposes and that the mere appearance of the proposed construction\r\non a federally approved Airport Layout Plan did not create\r\nsufficient federal involvement to require an EIS. See id. at 839-\r\n40. The court acknowledged that the need for a federal license or\r\napproval could sometimes trigger NEPA, but not where the approval\r\ndid not involve close scrutiny of the action or anything more than\r\nnotice for safety purposes. See id. at 840.\r\nAdditional guidance comes from the definition articulated\r\nby the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). The regulations of\r\nthe CEQ suggest that actions by non-federal actors \"with effects\r\nthat may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal\r\ncontrol and responsibility\" can be major federal actions. 40 C.F.R.\r\n1508.18. Under CEQ regulations, \"actions\" include \"projects and\r\nprograms entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted,\r\nregulated, or approved by federal agencies.\" 40 C.F.R.\r\n1508.18(a). The \"CEQ's interpretation of NEPA is entitled to\r\nsubstantial deference.\" Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 358\r\n(1979).\r\nThere are two situations that generally will not\r\nconstitute major federal actions under NEPA. The first situation is\r\ngovernmental inaction, where that failure to act is not otherwise\r\nsubject to review by the courts or administrative agencies under\r\nthe Administrative Procedure Act or other laws. See 40 C.F.R.\r\n1508.18. The second situation is mere approval by the federal\r\ngovernment of action by a private party where that approval is not\r\nrequired for the private party to go forward. See New Jersey Dep't\r\nof Envtl. Protection &amp; Energy v. Long Island Power Auth., 30 F.3d\r\n403, 415-16 (3d Cir. 1994); Sierra Club v. Penfold, 857 F.2d 1307,\r\n1314 (9th Cir. 1988); Named Individual Members of San Antonio\r\nConservation Soc'y v. Texas Highway Dep't, 496 F.2d 1017, 1023-24\r\n(5th Cir. 1974). This latter category encompasses, and disposes of,\r\nthe portion of Mayagezanos's argument that is based on the\r\nshippers having voluntarily notified the Coast Guard of the Pacific\r\nSwan's transit through the Mona Passage.\r\nThere are various situations that may constitute major\r\nfederal action under NEPA. In cases, such as this one, where there\r\nis no claim that the non-federal project is being federally funded,\r\nthe circuits have articulated different formulations of \"major\r\nfederal action,\" but the focus has been on the indicia of control\r\nover the private actors by the federal agency. For example, this\r\ncircuit found \"major federal action\" where a federal agency\r\napproved the release of funds from a trust held by the agency that\r\nwere necessary for a project to go forward. See Citizens Awareness\r\nNetwork, Inc. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 59 F.3d\r\n284, 292-93 (1st Cir. 1995). The effect of this action was\r\nexplicitly to permit the private actor to decommission a nuclear\r\nfacility. See id. at 292. \r\nThe Fourth Circuit has held that \"a non-federal project\r\nis considered a 'federal action' if it cannot begin or continue\r\nwithout prior approval by a federal agency and the agency possesses\r\nauthority to exercise discretion over the outcome.\" Sugarloaf\r\nCitizens Ass'n v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 959 F.2d 508,\r\n513-14 (4th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citations\r\nomitted). The Tenth Circuit found that there is a major federal\r\naction when \"the federal government has actual power to control the\r\nproject.\" Ross v. Federal Highway Admin., 162 F.3d 1046, 1051 (10th\r\nCir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The\r\nEighth Circuit held in Ringsred v. City of Duluth, 828 F.2d 1305,\r\n1308 (8th Cir. 1987) that \"federal action [must be] a legal\r\ncondition precedent to the [private event].\" The Third Circuit has\r\nsaid that the federal agency's action must be a legal pre-condition\r\nthat authorizes the other party to proceed with action. See NAACP\r\nv. Medical Ctr., Inc., 584 F.2d 619, 628 n.15 (3d Cir. 1978). See\r\ngenerally Rodgers, Jr., Environmental Law  9.5(C)(1) (2d ed. 1994\r\n&amp; Supp. 1998).\r\nLike the Fourth Circuit, we look to whether federal\r\napproval is the prerequisite to the action taken by the private\r\nactors and whether the federal agency possesses some form of\r\nauthority over the outcome. Mayagezanos make two arguments that\r\nthe United States has effectively authorized the shipments. First,\r\nthe United States has implicitly consented to such shipments, they\r\nsay, under the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement and generally has acted under\r\nthe Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act.\r\nSecondly, they contend that the United States has the power to stop\r\nsuch shipments through its EEZ waters, has chosen not to do so, and\r\nso has implicitly authorized the shipments. We evaluate each\r\nargument in turn.\r\n\n                            III\r\nThe Treaties\r\nMayagezanos's core argument is that the United States\r\ngranted or was required to grant specific authorization for the\r\nshipments of this nuclear waste from France to Japan under the\r\nprovisions of the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement.\r\nUnder  123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), 42\r\nU.S.C.  2153, certain foreign commerce in nuclear materials must\r\nbe governed by \"agreement[s] for cooperation\" that contain\r\nparticular safeguards. See id.  2153(a)(1). This framework was\r\nenhanced with the 1978 enactment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\r\nAct (NNPA), 22 U.S.C.  3201 et seq., which intended to ensure\r\n\"effective controls by the United States over its exports of\r\nnuclear materials and equipment and of nuclear technology.\" 22\r\nU.S.C.  3202(d). Acting under this authority, the United States in\r\n1988 entered the U.S.-Japan Agreement. Pursuant to this agreement,\r\nthe United States has sold uranium to Japan; the nuclear waste at\r\nissue in this case derived from one of these sales.\r\nOnce the irradiated material leaves Japan for\r\nreprocessing it is governed by another  123 agreement, commonly\r\ncalled the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement. See Agreement for Cooperation in\r\nthe Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy Between the United States of\r\nAmerica and the European Atomic Energy Community, H.R. Doc. No.\r\n104-138, at 5 (1995) (entered into force Apr. 12, 1996), available\r\nat 1996 WL 361511. The EURATOM signatories are fifteen European\r\ncountries, including France and the United Kingdom. That agreement\r\nincludes certain \"safeguards,\" a term of art for systems to verify\r\nthat the nuclear material will not be diverted to weaponry or\r\nillicit uses. See International Atomic Energy Agency, The Structure\r\nand Content of Agreements Between the Agency and States Required in\r\nConnection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons,  28, IAEA Doc. No. INFCIRC/153 (corr.) (1972), available\r\nat www.iaea.org/worldatom/infcircs/inf153.html.\r\nArticle 5.2 of the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement provides that\r\ncertain nuclear materials may be removed from the governance of the\r\nAgreement through procedures set out in an Administrative\r\nArrangement. Once the material in question has been determined,\r\nunder agreed-upon procedures, to be \"no longer usable for any\r\nnuclear activity relevant from the point of view of international\r\nsafeguards or [has] become practically irrecoverable,\" then the\r\nmaterial is no longer governed by the Agreement. U.S.-EURATOM\r\nAgreement art. 5.2.\r\nHere, the appropriate authority, which was not the United\r\nStates, made the determination that the waste at issue was\r\n\"practically irrecoverable,\" and, as a result, no longer governed\r\nby the Agreement. In addition, the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency terminated its safeguards because the reprocessed waste was\r\n\"practically irrecoverable.\" As such, the Agreement does not cover\r\nsuch waste materials and so there is no U.S. federal action\r\ninvolved.\r\nMayagezanos makes three assertions in response. First,\r\nit relies on a provision of the Agreement that provides that\r\ncertain material subject thereto may be transferred only on a case-\r\nby-case consent basis. See U.S.-EURATOM Agreement, Agreed Minute,\r\nB.4 (\"Retransfers to third countries not included on the lists\r\nmay be considered on a case by case basis.\"). That is no response\r\nas to materials not covered by the Agreement, such as those\r\ninvolved here.\r\nThe second argument suffers from the same flaw. The\r\nprovisions of Article 8.1(C)(ii) or (iii), concerning the transfer\r\nof irradiated nuclear material, simply do not apply to material\r\nremoved from the Agreement, such as the nuclear waste at issue\r\nhere.\r\nMayagezanos's third argument is that article 5.2 of the\r\nAgreement should not be honored because it is inconsistent with\r\n123 of the Atomic Energy Act, the enabling legislation under\r\nwhich the United States entered the EURATOM Agreement. There are at\r\nleast three responses. First, there is no conflict. Article 5.2\r\nserves the purpose of the AEA/NNPA to \"ensure that the worldwide\r\ndevelopment of peaceful nuclear activities . . . does not\r\ncontribute to proliferation.\" S. Rep. No. 95-467, at 3 (1977),\r\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 326, 328. Second, even if there were\r\nambiguity, we would be guided by the interpretation of the\r\nExecutive Branch that removing materials that are practically\r\nirrecoverable from the operation of the Agreement is consistent\r\nwith the AEA/NNPA. See El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan\r\nTseng, 119 S. Ct. 662, 671 (1999) (\"Respect is ordinarily due the\r\nreasonable views of the Executive Branch concerning the meaning of\r\nan international treaty.\"); Sumitomo Shoji Am., Inc. v. Avagliano,\r\n457 U.S. 176, 184-85 (1982); Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U.S. 187, 194\r\n(1961); United States v. Lui Kin-Hong, 110 F.3d 103, 110 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (\"[T]he executive branch's construction of a treaty, although\r\nnot binding upon the courts, is entitled to great weight.\").\r\nFinally, even if Article 5.2 of the Agreement did conflict with the\r\nAEA, this leaves us far from establishing the degree of U.S.\r\ncontrol over these shipments necessary to constitute a \"major\r\nfederal action.\" Neither the treaties nor the AEA/NNPA assign the\r\nUnited States a role, much less control, over this shipment of\r\nnuclear waste, and thus there is no \"major federal action\" under\r\nNEPA.\r\n\nThe Waters\r\nMayagezanos maintains as well that the Pacific Swan's\r\npassage through U.S. EEZ waters in the Mona Passage activates\r\nNEPA's major federal action requirement. The boundaries of the\r\nUnited States extend, by a 1989 Presidential Proclamation, to\r\ntwelve nautical miles offshore, an area called the territorial sea.\r\nSee United States v. Ramirez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d 1131, 1133 (1st Cir.\r\n1996) (en banc). Since the distance between Mona Island and the\r\nisland of Puerto Rico is about thirty-nine miles, there are at\r\nleast fifteen miles of international waters and twenty-four miles\r\nof territorial sea in that part of the Mona Passage that runs\r\nbetween the two islands. See id. Under customary international law,\r\nthe United States has sovereignty and jurisdiction over its\r\nterritorial seas, subject to the right of innocent passage. See\r\nUnited States v. Louisiana, 363 U.S. 1, 34 (1960).\r\nIn addition to the territorial seas, the United States\r\nhas an interest in the two-hundred-mile EEZ. See 1 Schoenbaum,\r\nAdmiralty and Maritime Law  2-16, at 33-36 (2d ed. 1994). This\r\ncase concerns the EEZ, as it is undisputed that the Pacific Swan\r\ndid not enter U.S. territorial waters. The interests of a coastal\r\nstate in its EEZ largely have to do with development of natural\r\nresources and the availability of scientific research. A coastal\r\nstate has limited powers in the EEZ under customary international\r\nlaw. As set forth in the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign\r\nRelations Law of the United States:\r\n  If the coastal state has clear grounds for believing that\r\na foreign ship has violated applicable international\r\nrules, or the supplementary laws or regulations of the\r\ncoastal state, in the exclusive economic zone, and the\r\nship is not in port but is navigating in the exclusive\r\neconomic zone or territorial sea of the coastal state,\r\nthat state may require the ship to give information\r\nregarding its identity and its port of registry, its last\r\nand next port of call, and other relevant information\r\nrequired to establish whether a violation has occurred.\r\nIf a violation has resulted in a substantial discharge\r\ncausing significant pollution of the marine environment,\r\nand the ship has refused to give information or the\r\ninformation supplied is manifestly at variance with the\r\nevident factual situation, the coastal state may\r\nundertake physical inspection of the ship for matters\r\nrelating to the violation. If the discharge causes or\r\nthreatens to cause major damage to the coastline or\r\nrelated interests of the coastal state, or to any\r\nresources of its territorial sea or exclusive economic\r\nzone, the coastal state may, if the evidence warrants it,\r\ninstitute proceedings including detention of the ship in\r\naccordance with its laws.\r\n\nRestatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law  514, cmt. i.\r\nNone of the circumstances described in the Restatement is present\r\nhere, so there is no platform from which to begin to construct an\r\nargument that such circumstances could give rise to federal action.\r\nForeign ships do not require the permission of the United States to\r\npass through its EEZ.\r\nWhatever the scope of the United States's potential\r\npowers, either multilaterally or unilaterally, over the EEZ, it is\r\nclear that the United States has not exercised any such powers with\r\nrespect to the transport of nuclear waste. Simply stated, the\r\nUnited States has chosen not to regulate shipments of nuclear waste\r\nthrough its EEZ -- there is no requirement that it do so, nor is it\r\nimmediately evident that it would have that authority if it so\r\nchose. Under these circumstances, there is no major federal\r\naction.\r\n\n                              IV\r\nWhere this country's multilateral relationships are\r\ninvolved there is a particularly heavy burden on Mayagezanos to\r\ndemonstrate a \"major federal action\" for NEPA purposes, and thus to\r\ninvolve the courts.

It was bound for Japan, by way of the Panama Canal, from France. A day earlier, a group of fishermen and environmental organizations from western Puerto Rico, fearing an accident or maritime disaster, brought this action for an injunction to stop the shipment until the United States filed an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4321 et seq. After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court denied the claim for injunctive relief and dismissed the action. See Mayaguezanos por la Salud y el Ambiente v. United States, 38 F. Supp. 2d 168, 178 (D.P.R. 1999). We affirm on different reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The voyage of the Pacific Swan is part of a modern circumferential trade. Uranium from the United States is sent to Japan to fuel nuclear energy reactors. Japan ships the reactors' spent fuel to COGEMA, a French nuclear power company, for recycling at its La Hague plant. This process recovers a substantial portion of reusable fissionable material, which is turned into nuclear fuel (either RepU fuel, comprising uranium, or MOX fuel, comprising plutonium and uranium). It also generates high-level nuclear waste, which includes trace amounts of uranium and plutonium. The waste is vitrified<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> according to specifications that have been approved by French and Japanese governments and placed in casks that meet criteria set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency in its Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material. Both the waste and the fuel are returned to Japan on board specially designed ships that meet the standards of the International Maritime Organization's Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships, IMO Resolution A 18/Res. 748, Annex (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The private shippers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> choose the return route to Japan from three options: the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, or the Panama Canal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. connection to this trade occurs in two ways. First, the United States supplies the uranium to Japan under a 1988 agreement between the two countries. See Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Japan Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, Nov. 4, 1987, H.R. Doc. No. 100-128 (1987) (entered into force July 17, 1988), available at 1988 WL 582501 at *3 (\"U.S.-Japan Agreement\"). Second, the transport of the nuclear waste shipments through the Mona Passage means that the ship traverses waters in which the United States has some interest, even if they are not territorial waters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because these waste-laden voyages through the Mona Passage continue, the case is not moot, which the United States appropriately concedes. See Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 481 (1990). Review of entry of summary judgment is de novo; further, the issues presented are ones of law and our review is plenary. See National Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38, 49 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. granted, 68 U.S.L.W. 3178 (U.S. Nov. 29, 1999) (No. 99-474).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mayaguezanos<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> has refined its argument to a single attack: the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider this action under NEPA and the United States's<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> failure to regulate the passage of such nuclear waste through its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters is a \"major federal action\" within the meaning of NEPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Mayaguezanos argues that there is a major federal action because the United States is required to play some role in the transport of this waste under various international agreements and customary international law. This complex of interests and responsibilities, they contend, suffices to establish \"major federal action\" under NEPA. The United States rejoins that the shipment of waste is the \"action,\" it is not being carried out by a federal agency but by private parties, and the facts do not meet the tests to determine if there is federal action where the primary action is carried out by private players.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under NEPA, all U.S. agencies are required to \"include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" a \"detailed statement.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2). This detailed statement, known as an EIS, must address the environmental impact of proposed actions and alternatives. NEPA &#167; 102(2)(C) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">all agencies of the Federal Government shall -- . . . (C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, (ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, (iii) alternatives to the proposed action . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2)(C). NEPA's aims are two-fold: to \"place[] upon an agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action\" and to \"ensure[] that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.\" Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayaguezanos has described the significance of a maritime accident or incident involving this waste and the government has responded that all safety precautions have been taken.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Arguments about the safety of such shipments may be made to a variety of bodies, both in the United States and internationally. Before, however, U.S. courts may speak to the safety matter, they must first decide whether they have any authority to address such issues, a question that turns on whether NEPA applies at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arguments seem to contain two implicit assumptions: that NEPA applies to actions outside territorial U.S. lands and waters<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and that NEPA's \"major federal action\" requirement would work in the same fashion in the domestic and the international contexts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We are skeptical. See, e.g., United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1, 12 n.10 (1st Cir. 1997) (Lynch, J., concurring). These are difficult problems, but because Mayaguezanos's claims fail even under the \"major federal action\" tests used in domestic cases, we need not inquire into the validity of these assumptions. Consequently, we turn to the domestic case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has not recently addressed the criteria to be used in domestic cases to determine when private activities may be deemed to be major federal actions under NEPA. In Citizens for Responsible Area Growth v. Adams, 680 F.2d 835 (1st Cir. 1982), this court held that construction of an airport hangar by private parties with private monies was not federal action for NEPA purposes and that the mere appearance of the proposed construction on a federally approved Airport Layout Plan did not create sufficient federal involvement to require an EIS. See id. at 839-40. The court acknowledged that the need for a federal license or approval could sometimes trigger NEPA, but not where the approval did not involve close scrutiny of the action or anything more than notice for safety purposes. See id. at 840.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additional guidance comes from the definition articulated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). The regulations of the CEQ suggest that actions by non-federal actors \"with effects that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility\" can be major federal actions. 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1508.18. Under CEQ regulations, \"actions\" include \"projects and programs entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies.\" 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1508.18(a). The \"CEQ's interpretation of NEPA is entitled to substantial deference.\" Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 358 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two situations that generally will not constitute major federal actions under NEPA. The first situation is governmental inaction, where that failure to act is not otherwise subject to review by the courts or administrative agencies under the Administrative Procedure Act or other laws. See 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1508.18. The second situation is mere approval by the federal government of action by a privateparty where that approval is not required for the private party to go forward. See New Jersey Dep't of Envtl. Protection &amp; Energy v. Long Island Power Auth., 30 F.3d 403, 415-16 (3d Cir. 1994); Sierra Club v. Penfold, 857 F.2d 1307, 1314 (9th Cir. 1988); Named Individual Members of San Antonio Conservation Soc'y v. Texas Highway Dep't, 496 F.2d 1017, 1023-24 (5th Cir. 1974). This latter category encompasses, and disposes of, the portion of Mayaguezanos's argument that is based on the shippers having voluntarily notified the Coast Guard of the Pacific Swan's transit through the Mona Passage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are various situations that may constitute major federal action under NEPA. In cases, such as this one, where there is no claim that the non-federal project is being federally funded, the circuits have articulated different formulations of \"major federal action,\" but the focus has been on the indicia of control over the private actors by the federal agency. For example, this circuit found \"major federal action\" where a federal agency approved the release of funds from a trust held by the agency that were necessary for a project to go forward. See Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 59 F.3d 284, 292-93 (1st Cir. 1995). The effect of this action was explicitly to permit the private actor to decommission a nuclear facility. See id. at 292.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Circuit has held that \"a non-federal project is considered a 'federal action' if it cannot begin or continue without prior approval by a federal agency and the agency possesses authority to exercise discretion over the outcome.\" Sugarloaf Citizens Ass'n v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 959 F.2d 508, 513-14 (4th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Tenth Circuit found that there is a major federal action when \"the federal government has actual power to control the project.\" Ross v. Federal Highway Admin., 162 F.3d 1046, 1051 (10th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Eighth Circuit held in Ringsred v. City of Duluth, 828 F.2d 1305, 1308 (8th Cir. 1987) that \"federal action [must be] a legal condition precedent to the [private event].\" The Third Circuit has said that the federal agency's action must be a legal pre-condition that authorizes the other party to proceed with action. See NAACP v. Medical Ctr., Inc., 584 F.2d 619, 628 n.15 (3d Cir. 1978). See generally Rodgers, Jr., Environmental Law &#167; 9.5(C)(1) (2d ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the Fourth Circuit, we look to whether federal approval is the prerequisite to the action taken by the private actors and whether the federal agency possesses some form of authority over the outcome.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Mayaguezanos make two arguments that the United States has effectively authorized the shipments. First, the United States has implicitly consented to such shipments, they say, under the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement and generally has acted under the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act. Secondly, they contend that the United States has the power to stop such shipments through its EEZ waters, has chosen not to do so, and so has implicitly authorized the shipments. We evaluate each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Treaties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayaguezanos's core argument is that the United States granted or was required to grant specific authorization for the shipments of this nuclear waste from France to Japan under the provisions of the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2153, certain foreign commerce in nuclear materials must be governed by \"agreement[s] for cooperation\" that contain particular safeguards. See id. &#167; 2153(a)(1). This framework was enhanced with the 1978 enactment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act (NNPA), 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3201 et seq., which intended to ensure \"effective controls by the United States over its exports of nuclear materials and equipment and of nuclear technology.\" 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3202(d). Acting under this authority, the United States in 1988 entered the U.S.-Japan Agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the United States has sold uranium to Japan; the nuclear waste at issue in this case derived from one of these sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the irradiated material leaves Japan for reprocessing it is governed by another &#167; 123 agreement, commonly called the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement. See Agreement for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy Between the United States of America and the European Atomic Energy Community, H.R. Doc. No. 104-138, at 5 (1995) (entered into force Apr. 12, 1996), available at 1996 WL 361511. The EURATOM signatories are fifteen European countries, including France and the United Kingdom. That agreement includes certain \"safeguards,\" a term of art for systems to verify that the nuclear material will not be diverted to weaponry or illicit uses. See International Atomic Energy Agency, The Structure and Content of Agreements Between the Agency and States Required in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, &#182; 28, IAEA Doc. No. INFCIRC/153 (corr.) (1972), available at www.iaea.org/worldatom/infcircs/inf153.html.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article 5.2 of the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement provides that certain nuclear materials may be removed from the governance of the Agreement through procedures set out in an Administrative Arrangement. Once the material in question has been determined, under agreed-upon procedures, to be \"no longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of international safeguards or [has] become practically irrecoverable,\" then the material is no longer governed by the Agreement. U.S.-EURATOM Agreement art. 5.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appropriate authority, which was not the United States, made the determination that the waste at issue was \"practically irrecoverable,\" and, as a result, no longer governed by the Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> In addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency terminated its safeguards because the reprocessed waste was \"practically irrecoverable.\" As such, the Agreement does not cover such waste materials and so there is no U.S. federal action involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayaguezanos makes three assertions in response. First, it relies on a provision of the Agreement that provides that certain material subject thereto may be transferred only on a case-by-case consent basis. See U.S.-EURATOM Agreement, Agreed Minute, &#182; B.4 (\"Retransfers to third countries not included on the lists may be considered on a case by case basis.\"). That is no response as to materials not covered by the Agreement, such as those involved here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument suffers from the same flaw. The provisions of Article 8.1(C)(ii) or (iii), concerning the transfer of irradiated nuclear material, simply do not apply to material removed from the Agreement, such as the nuclear waste at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayaguezanos's third argument is that article 5.2 of the Agreement should not be honored because it is inconsistent with &#167; 123 of the Atomic Energy Act, the enabling legislation under which the United States entered the EURATOM Agreement. There are at least three responses. First, there is no conflict. Article 5.2 serves the purpose of the AEA/NNPA to \"ensure that the worldwide development of peaceful nuclear activities . . . does not contribute to proliferation.\" S. Rep. No. 95-467, at 3 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 326, 328. Second, even if there were ambiguity, we would be guided by the interpretation of the Executive Branch that removing materials that are practically irrecoverable from the operation of the Agreement is consistent with the AEA/NNPA. See El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 119 S. Ct. 662, 671 (1999) (\"Respect is ordinarily due the reasonable views of the Executive Branch concerning the meaning of an international treaty.\"); Sumitomo Shoji Am., Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U.S. 176, 184-85 (1982); Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U.S. 187, 194 (1961); United States v. Lui Kin-Hong, 110 F.3d 103, 110 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he executive branch's construction of a treaty, although not binding upon the courts, is entitled to great weight.\"). Finally, even if Article 5.2 of the Agreement did conflict with the AEA, this leaves us far from establishing the degree of U.S. control over these shipments necessary to constitute a \"major federal action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Neither the treaties nor the AEA/NNPA assign the United States a role, much less control, over this shipment of nuclear waste, and thus there is no \"major federal action\" under NEPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Waters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayaguezanos maintains as well that the Pacific Swan's passage through U.S. EEZ waters in the Mona Passage activates NEPA's major federal action requirement. The boundaries of the United States extend, by a 1989 Presidential Proclamation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> to twelve nautical miles offshore, an area called the territorial sea. See United States v. Ramirez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d 1131, 1133 (1st Cir. 1996) (en banc). Since the distance between Mona Island and the island of Puerto Rico is about thirty-nine miles, there are at least fifteen miles of international waters and twenty-four miles of territorial sea in that part of the Mona Passage that runs between the two islands. See id. Under customary international law, the United States has sovereignty and jurisdiction over its territorial seas, subject to the right of innocent passage. See United States v. Louisiana, 363 U.S. 1, 34 (1960).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the territorial seas, the United States has an interest in the two-hundred-mile EEZ. See 1 Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law &#167; 2-16, at 33-36 (2d ed. 1994). This case concerns the EEZ, as it is undisputed that the Pacific Swan did not enter U.S. territorial waters. The interests of a coastal state in its EEZ largely have to do with development of natural resources and the availability of scientific research. A coastal state has limited powers in the EEZ under customary international law. As set forth in the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the coastal state has clear grounds for believing that a foreign ship has violated applicable international rules, or the supplementary laws or regulations of the coastal state, in the exclusive economic zone, and the ship is not in port but is navigating in the exclusive economic zone or territorial sea of the coastal state, that state may require the ship to give information regarding its identity and its port of registry, its last and next port of call, and other relevant information required to establish whether a violation has occurred. If a violation has resulted in a substantial discharge causing significant pollution of the marine environment, and the ship has refused to give information or the information supplied is manifestly at variance with the evident factual situation, the coastal state may undertake physical inspection of the ship for matters relating to the violation. If the discharge causes or threatens to cause major damage to the coastline or related interests of the coastal state, or to any resources of its territorial sea or exclusive economic zone, the coastal state may, if the evidence warrants it, institute proceedings including detention of the ship in accordance with its laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law &#167; 514, cmt. i. None of the circumstances described in the Restatement is present here, so there is no platform from which to begin to construct an argument that such circumstances could give rise to federal action. Foreign ships do not require the permission of the United States to pass through its EEZ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the scope of the United States's potential powers, either multilaterally or unilaterally, over the EEZ, it is clear that the United States has not exercised any such powers with respect to the transport of nuclear waste.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Simply stated, the United States has chosen not to regulate shipments of nuclear waste through its EEZ -- there is no requirement that it do so, nor is it immediately evident that it would have that authority if it so chose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Under these circumstances, there is no major federal action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where this country's multilateral relationships are involved there is a particularly heavy burden on Mayaguezanos to demonstrate a \"major federal action\" for NEPA purposes, and thus to involve the courts.

It was bound for Japan, by way of the Panama Canal, from France. A day earlier, a group of fishermen and environmental organizations from western Puerto Rico, fearing an accident or maritime disaster, brought this action for an injunction to stop the shipment until the United States filed an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4321 et seq.

Uranium from the United States is sent to Japan to fuel nuclear energy reactors. Japan ships the reactors' spent fuel to COGEMA, a French nuclear power company, for recycling at its La Hague plant. This process recovers a substantial portion of reusable fissionable material, which is turned into nuclear fuel (either RepU fuel, comprising uranium, or MOX fuel, comprising plutonium and uranium). It also generates high-level nuclear waste, which includes trace amounts of uranium and plutonium. The waste is vitrified<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> according to specifications that have been approved by French and Japanese governments and placed in casks that meet criteria set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency in its Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material. Both the waste and the fuel are returned to Japan on board specially designed ships that meet the standards of the International Maritime Organization's Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships, IMO Resolution A 18/Res. 748, Annex (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The private shippers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> choose the return route to Japan from three options: the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, or the Panama Canal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. connection to this trade occurs in two ways. First, the United States supplies the uranium to Japan under a 1988 agreement between the two countries. See Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Japan Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, Nov. 4, 1987, H.R. Doc. No. 100-128 (1987) (entered into force July 17, 1988), available at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">582501</span> </span>at *3 (\"U.S.-Japan Agreement\").

In cases, such as this one, where there is no claim that the non-federal project is being federally funded, the circuits have articulated different formulations of \"major federal action,\" but the focus has been on the indicia of control over the private actors by the federal agency. For example, this circuit found \"major federal action\" where a federal agency approved the release of funds from a trust held by the agency that were necessary for a project to go forward.

First, the United States has implicitly consented to such shipments, they say, under the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement and generally has acted under the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act. Secondly, they contend that the United States has the power to stop such shipments through its EEZ waters, has chosen not to do so, and so has implicitly authorized the shipments.

See id. &#167; 2153(a)(1). This framework was enhanced with the 1978 enactment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act (NNPA), 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3201 et seq., which intended to ensure \"effective controls by the United States over its exports of nuclear materials and equipment and of nuclear technology.\" 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3202(d). Acting under this authority, the United States in 1988 entered the U.S.-Japan Agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the United States has sold uranium to Japan; the nuclear waste at issue in this case derived from one of these sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the irradiated material leaves Japan for reprocessing it is governed by another &#167; 123 agreement, commonly called the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement.

The EURATOM signatories are fifteen European countries, including France and the United Kingdom. That agreement includes certain \"safeguards,\" a term of art for systems to verify that the nuclear material will not be diverted to weaponry or illicit uses. See International Atomic Energy Agency, The Structure and Content of Agreements Between the Agency and States Required in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, &#182; 28, IAEA Doc.

Once the material in question has been determined, under agreed-upon procedures, to be \"no longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of international safeguards or [has] become practically irrecoverable,\" then the material is no longer governed by the Agreement. U.S.-EURATOM Agreement art. 5.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appropriate authority, which was not the United States, made the determination that the waste at issue was \"practically irrecoverable,\" and, as a result, no longer governed by the Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> In addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency terminated its safeguards because the reprocessed waste was \"practically irrecoverable.\" As such, the Agreement does not cover such waste materials and so there is no U.S. federal action involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayaguezanos makes three assertions in response. First, it relies on a provision of the Agreement that provides that certain material subject thereto may be transferred only on a case-by-case consent basis. See U.S.-EURATOM Agreement, Agreed Minute, &#182; B.4 (\"Retransfers to third countries not included on the lists may be considered on a case by case basis.\"). That is no response as to materials not covered by the Agreement, such as those involved here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument suffers from the same flaw. The provisions of Article 8.1(C)(ii) or (iii), concerning the transfer of irradiated nuclear material, simply do not apply to material removed from the Agreement, such as the nuclear waste at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayaguezanos's third argument is that article 5.2 of the Agreement should not be honored because it is inconsistent with &#167; 123 of the Atomic Energy Act, the enabling legislation under which the United States entered the EURATOM Agreement. There are at least three responses. First, there is no conflict. Article 5.2 serves the purpose of the AEA/NNPA to \"ensure that the worldwide development of peaceful nuclear activities . . . does not contribute to proliferation.\" S. Rep. No. 95-467, at 3 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 326, 328. Second, even if there were ambiguity, we would be guided by the interpretation of the Executive Branch that removing materials that are practically irrecoverable from the operation of the Agreement is consistent with the AEA/NNPA.

See 1 Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law &#167; 2-16, at 33-36 (2d ed. 1994). This case concerns the EEZ, as it is undisputed that the Pacific Swan did not enter U.S. territorial waters. The interests of a coastal state in its EEZ largely have to do with development of natural resources and the availability of scientific research. A coastal state has limited powers in the EEZ under customary international law.

If a violation has resulted in a substantial discharge causing significant pollution of the marine environment, and the ship has refused to give information or the information supplied is manifestly at variance with the evident factual situation, the coastal state may undertake physical inspection of the ship for matters relating to the violation. If the discharge causes or threatens to cause major damage to the coastline or related interests of the coastal state, or to any resources of its territorial sea or exclusive economic zone, the coastal state may, if the evidence warrants it, institute proceedings including detention of the ship in accordance with its laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law &#167; 514, cmt. i.

We reject any such reasoning and doubt that this was what the district court intended.</p>\n        <p>We also note that the CEQ definition of major federal action refers to activities that are \"potentially subject to Federal control\" and that a similar, but also not necessary, inference could be drawn from this. We also reject this inference. We understand the phrase to refer to situations in which the government inaction is subject to review under the APA or other laws, as set forth in 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1508.18.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  According to Frederick F. McGoldrick, the Principal Deputy Director of the State Department's Office of Nuclear Energy Affairs, paragraph 4.3 of the Administrative Arrangement provides that determinations under article 5.2 \"shall be made by the appropriate authority of the party holding the item subject to the Agreement before the removal[.]\" The appropriate authority here was the EURATOM Safeguards Directorate, which made the determination that the waste at issue was practically irrecoverable and not subject to the Agreement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p>  The materials are not unregulated, however. The ship's flag nation has responsibility to take measures necessary to control pollution of the marine environment and to ensure the safety of the ships at sea. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States &#167; 502(1)(b). The United Kingdom is the flag nation here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p>  The Eighth Circuit has said the \"major federal action\" inquiry involves the separate components of legal control and factual control. See Goos v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546949\"><a href=\"/opinion/546949/todd-goos-v-interstate-commerce-commission-and-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1294 (8th Cir. 1990).

The Convention has been signed by the President, but it has not yet been ratified by the Senate. Consequently, we refer to UNCLOS only to the extent that it incorporates customary international law, though we also note that the United States \"is obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the agreement.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law &#167; 312(3); see also Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 18 (1969) (reflecting customary international law). Since the United States is not a party to the Vienna Convention, it is not appropriate to rely directly on it, as suggested by the district court, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2311104\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mayaguezanos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2311104/mayaguezanos-por-la-salud-y-el-ambiente-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

III, introductory note, at 145.</p>\n        <p>The United States has taken the position that the twelve-mile territorial sea and the two-hundred-mile EEZ are declarative of customary international law. See Proclamation No. 5928, 54 Fed. Reg. 777 (1988); Proclamation No. 5030, 48 Fed. Reg. 10,605 (1983); Statement on United States Oceans Policy, 1983 Pub.

Such a broad analysis is unnecessary to decide this case and we disavow it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p>  In 1992, a number of states prohibited the entry into their territorial and EEZ seas of a Japanese-flag ship carrying COGEMA-reprocessed plutonium for use at a Japanese nuclear energy plant. See Rothwell, Navigational Rights and Freedoms in the Asia Pacific Following Entry into Force of the Law of the Sea Convention, 35 Va. J. Int'l L. 587, 614-15 (1995). The same was true for another shipment in 1995. Other states have requested that the freighters stay out of their territorial and EEZ waters. This case requires no analysis of whether international law is consonant with such actions.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
