This case concerns the procedures for\n\ninvoluntarily committing a federal prisoner, Michael Frierson, to a\n\nmedical center for in-patient care for a mental disease. Because of\n\nthe resulting infringement on the liberty interests that even an\n\nimprisoned person retains, such commitments are girded by statutory\n\nprocedural requirements set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 4245. Those statutory\n\nprocedures were Congress's response to Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480,\n\n491-94 (1980), which held that the involuntary transfer of a prisoner\n\nto a mental hospital implicated liberty interests protected by\n\nconstitutional due process.1 While other circuits, which have within\n\ntheir geographic territory federal penal institutions, have reviewed\n\nproceedings under § 4245 before, this circuit has not.       With the\n\nopening of the new Federal Medical Center-Devens in Massachusetts (FMC-\n\nDevens) on the site of the former Ft. Devens, cases under the statute\n\nmay now arise in this circuit, as this one has. Because the district\n\ncourt departed from statutory procedures by holding the commitment\n\nhearing in the absence of the inmate, we vacate the order of\n\ncommitment.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          We describe what is at stake and thus the reasons for the\n\nprocedural protections required.\n\n\n\n     1    See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 247-49 (1983), reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3429-31.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          Involuntary commitment to a federal medical center removes\n\na prisoner from the general prison population and attaches to him or\n\nher a certain stigma. See Vitek, 445 U.S. at 492. Once hospitalized,\n\nthe prisoner can be involuntarily medicated (following other due\n\nprocess procedures). See 28 C.F.R. § 549.43; cf. Vitek, 445 U.S. at\n\n492. And once there, the inmate's commitment lasts until one of three\n\nthings happens. Commitment lasts until the director of the facility\n\ndetermines that the prisoner is no longer in need of care. See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 4245(e). But during a prisoner's commitment, the director of\n\nthe medical facility need only make an annual report on the person's\n\nmental condition and his or her continued need for hospitalization.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 4247(e)(1)(B). Or commitment lasts until counsel for\n\nthe person files a motion for a hearing and a judge determines, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that the person should be discharged.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 4245(d). But such a motion cannot be filed within 180\n\ndays of \"a court determination that the person should continue to be\n\nhospitalized.\" 28 U.S.C. § 4247(h). Or commitment can last until the\n\nperson's sentence of imprisonment has expired.2       See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4245(d). But under a separate section a person due for release can\n\ncontinue to be hospitalized if a judge determines, by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, that \"the person is presently suffering from a\n\n\n\n     2    Frierson's sentence expires on October 9, 2000. He could be\nreleased as early as June 20, 2000, because of good conduct.\n\n                                -3-\n\fmental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create\n\na substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage\n\nto property of another.\" 28 U.S.C. § 4246(d); see also 28 U.S.C. §\n\n4246(a), (c).\n\n          Given these consequences, it is no surprise that the statute\n\nthat authorizes involuntary commitment is sensitive to constitutional\n\ndue process concerns. The provisions at issue in this case, 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 4245 and 4247(d), are illustrative. A person whose mental condition\n\nis at issue may not be committed until there is a hearing at which the\n\nprisoner \"shall be represented by counsel [or counsel shall be\n\nappointed for him if he or she is financially unable to obtain adequate\n\ncounsel and] shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present\n\nevidence, to subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.\" 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4247(d); see also 28 U.S.C. § 4245(c).\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Michael Frierson is serving a 48-month federal sentence for\n\nimportation of methamphetamine.3 Until 1999, Frierson was imprisoned\n\nat the Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg, Virginia, and\n\nthe Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky (FMC-Lexington),\n\n\n\n     3    Frierson was originally found incompetent to stand trial\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241 and was committed for treatment to the\nUnited States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield,\nMissouri. He was tried after being restored to competency.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fwhere he had been committed, but then discharged, under an earlier\n\npetition pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4245.4      Since his stay at FMC-\n\nLexington, Frierson had been taking lithium voluntarily as treatment\n\nfor Bipolar I Disorder, Severe with Psychotic Features. Frierson was\n\ntransferred from FMC-Lexington to FMC-Devens on May 11, 1999.5 On\n\nSeptember 3, 1999, Frierson stopped taking the lithium, and his\n\ncondition deteriorated. As a result, he was placed in the Diagnosis\n\nand Observation area of FMC-Devens's Mental Health Unit.\n\n          On November 10, 1999, the government filed a motion6 with the\n\ndistrict court to commit Frierson pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 4245. The\n\npurpose of obtaining the commitment order, it appears, was to allow\n\ndoctors to treat him involuntarily. Involuntary treatment is permitted\n\nonly after commitment and, then, only after an opportunity for an\n\nadministrative hearing and appeal.      See 28 C.F.R. § 549.43; cf.\n\nWashington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 214-17 (1990). Compare United\n\nStates v. Morgan, 193 F.3d 252, 262-64 (4th Cir. 1999), with United\n\nStates v. Brandon, 158 F.3d 947, 952-55 (6th Cir. 1998). Because\n\n\n\n     4    Frierson had refused his medication while at FCI-Petersburg\nand, subsequently, decompensated.\n     5     The parties have not told us, nor does the record reveal,\nwhy, and under what authority, Frierson continued to be incarcerated at\nfederal medical centers subsequent to his discharge from the earlier\ncommitment order.\n     6    In technical terms, the statute refers to a motion, which is\nwhat the government filed, rather than a petition.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fFrierson was indigent, counsel was appointed. Counsel visited Frierson\n\nand found that, while Frierson was disturbed, he appeared to understand\n\nwhat courts and lawyers were and that a motion had been filed for\n\ncommitment.\n\n          On December 14, 1999, the district court held a conference\n\nwith the government and Frierson's appointed counsel, but without\n\nFrierson. Both sides seemed to agree that Frierson met the criteria\n\nfor commitment, and they disagreed only on whether Frierson's presence\n\nat a commitment hearing was required or whether he should be asked\n\nfirst if he wanted to attend. Frierson's counsel stated that Frierson\n\nshould be brought to the courthouse in Boston or the judge should hold\n\na hearing at FMC-Devens because the court should not commit Frierson\n\nwithout actually seeing him. The government was willing to bring\n\nFrierson to the courthouse, but suggested that first he should be asked\n\nif he wanted to attend the hearing. The district court decided to hold\n\na hearing the following week to determine if it was \"feasible and\n\nappropriate\" to have Frierson present at his § 4245 hearing.\n\n          On December 17th, at the request of appointed counsel, Devens\n\nClinical Psychologist Dr. Paul Anderson (whose case study of Frierson\n\nhad been filed by the government in support of its motion) asked\n\nFrierson if he wanted to attend the hearing. Frierson indicated that\n\nhe did. The government then notified the court that it was willing to\n\nbring Frierson to court. For unstated reasons, the court did not\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\frequest the government to do so.\n\n          Even though the statute plainly contemplates that ordinarily\n\na prisoner will attend his or her own commitment hearing, and even\n\nthough Frierson had said that he wanted to attend, and even though the\n\ngovernment said it would bring him to the hearing, the district court\n\nnonetheless conducted a hearing on December 20th without Frierson\n\nbeing there. The ostensible subject was to determine if Frierson\n\nshould attend his commitment hearing, but the hearing ended in a\n\ncommitment order. The only witness at this hearing was Dr. Anderson.\n\nAnderson testified that Frierson indicated that he wanted to attend the\n\nhearing, though not in his orange jumpsuit. Anderson also testified\n\nthat Frierson had filled out a form that requested a telephone call to\n\ncounsel, though a Devens staff member, Carlos Quiles, wrote in an e-\n\nmail to a staff attorney at Devens that he, Quiles, had attempted to\n\nmake the call but was unable to get Frierson's attention. Finally,\n\nAnderson testified that he believed that Frierson knew the purpose of\n\nthe hearing; Anderson testified, as well, that Frierson thought the\n\nhearing would also address his status as Michael the Archangel.\n\n          After Anderson's testimony, the government stated that, since\n\nFrierson indicated he wished to attend the hearing, he had a right to\n\ndo so under the statute and had a right to testify.       Counsel for\n\nFrierson repeated that Frierson should be brought to the hearing\n\nbecause he had a statutory and constitutional right to be there and\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsaid that in many other circuits the hearings are held at the medical\n\ncenter. He also pointed out that after Frierson had been committed\n\nearlier pursuant to § 4245 (at FMC-Lexington), Frierson decided to take\n\nhis medication voluntarily (thus avoiding forcible medication).\n\nCounsel believed that, if Frierson were brought before a judge again,\n\nhe would voluntarily take his medication. Rather than adjourning the\n\nhearing until Frierson could be present, the court directed counsel to\n\ncontact Frierson at Devens during a recess and discuss with him the\n\nfacts surrounding the e-mail. Counsel attempted to contact Frierson,\n\nbut Frierson refused to come to the phone when asked to do so by\n\nQuiles. Upon the resumption of the hearing, the government informed\n\nthe court that it changed its position because it felt that, as a\n\nresult of the phone call, Frierson had been offered the opportunity to\n\nparticipate in the hearing and had refused.       Frierson's counsel\n\ncontested this assertion.\n\n          The district court then entered the order of commitment. The\n\norder read, in part:\n\n          (3) Because of his present mental condition, it is not\n          possible, without undue risk to his own safety and security,\n          to have him brought into court for proceedings in his\n          presence.\n\n          (4) In these circumstances, applying the standard of due\n          process, the court finds it appropriate to afford counsel\n          appointed on his behalf to speak to the court on\n          respondent's behalf, to present evidence on his behalf, to\n          subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to cross-examine\n          witnesses on his behalf at this hearing. Counsel appointed\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          by the court to represent respondent did participate in the\n          hearings of December 14 and 20, 1999, reserving rights to\n          object to the proceedings.        After considering the\n          objections, the court overruled them.\n\n          (5) For reasons stated more fully on the record, the court\n          finds that respondent at this time is not competent to be a\n          witness and is not competent to make an informed decision.\n          He has been offered an opportunity to assist his appointed\n          attorney but has not responded to that opportunity.\n          Moreover, I find that in his present condition it would be\n          a futile gesture to purport to give him an opportunity to\n          participate in a hearing at the Federal Medical Center in\n          Devens, or elsewhere. He cannot become competent without\n          resuming medication, and only then after weeks, at minimum.\n          If he does resume medication and a material change bearing\n          on his competence occurs, a request for further hearing in\n          this court will be allowed.\n\nFrierson appeals from this order.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          The question presented is whether Frierson was provided with\n\nthe requisite \"opportunity\" to be present at his § 4245 hearing.\n\n          First, we clear away a justification for the order which is\n\nclearly erroneous. There is no support for the district court's first\n\n\"finding\" that Frierson could not have been brought into court \"without\n\nundue risk to his own safety and security.\" The government never took\n\nthat position and indeed had offered to bring Frierson to the\n\ncourthouse. Further, even were this so, it does not answer Frierson's\n\nargument that the court could have conducted the hearing at FMC-Devens.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fWe are told that this is routinely done in other circuits and could be\n\ndone at Devens as well.7\n\n          Although the government had said that Frierson should be\n\npresent for the commitment hearing, the government now attempts to\n\ndefend the order on three grounds: first, that the case is moot;\n\nsecond, that Frierson rejected the opportunity to be at the hearing\n\nwhen, on December 20th, he was non-responsive to the guard's efforts to\n\nhave him come to the phone to talk to counsel; and third, that there\n\nwas no right to be physically present under the statute, only the\n\nopportunity to participate in the hearing in certain other ways.\n\n          The matter is not moot.       Although Frierson has now been\n\nforcibly medicated, is taking his mediation, and is more lucid, the\n\ncommitment order, with its attendant consequences described earlier, is\n\nstill in place. Vitek forecloses the government's mootness argument,\n\nas does Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990). Vitek rejected a\n\nmootness argument, even though the inmate was no longer at the mental\n\nhospital, because there was a very real threat he would be transferred\n\n\n     7     While no commitment hearing has yet taken place at Devens,\nwe are told that if a judge decided to conduct a hearing there a\nsuitable space, such as a conference room, could be provided. Some\nfederal medical centers have courtrooms, which can be used for\nhearings, while others use conference rooms.\n      We are also told that there will be videoconferencing facilities\noperational between Devens and the U.S. Courthouse in Boston by the end\nof this year. The Fourth Circuit, in an uncontested § 4245 hearing,\nhas approved the use of videoconferencing. See United States v. Baker,\n45 F.3d 837, 848 (4th Cir. 1995). Whether such videoconferences\nsuffice for all or some § 4245 hearings we leave to another day.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fagain. See Vitek, 445 U.S. at 486. Here, the inmate is still confined\n\nin the mental hospital.8 In any event, as Harper holds, so long as the\n\ncommitment order is in place, the matter is not moot. See Harper, 494\n\nU.S. at 218-19.\n\n          Nor is the issue resolved by the phone call to the prison on\n\nDecember 20th and Frierson's non-responsiveness to the guard's efforts\n\nto get him to the phone. First, the hearing was largely concluded by\n\nthe time the call was made, Anderson having testified.         Second,\n\nFrierson was not told that this call was his opportunity to participate\n\nin the hearing (indeed, it was not); rather, Frierson had earlier said\n\nhe wanted to attend any hearing. The district court properly rejected\n\nthe government's request that it make a finding that the phone call\n\nconstituted an opportunity for Frierson to participate in the hearing.\n\n          Finally, the government, on appeal, argues that the inmate's\n\nphysical presence is not required by the statute at all in a commitment\n\nhearing.9 All that the statute requires, according to the government,\n\n\n     8    That confinement means, inter alia, that his access to\nactivities available to the general penal population is quite\nrestricted.\n     9     On appeal, the government says that it was within the\ndistrict court's \"supervisory authority\" to conduct the commitment\nhearing in Frierson's absence. But here there was no evidence on which\nto conclude that unusual protective measures were needed. Indeed,\nusually such measures are taken only after the patient is observed by\nthe court. See Suzuki v. Quisenberry, 411 F. Supp. 1113, 1130 (D. Haw.\n1976). Some states, such as Minnesota, allow the court to \"exclude or\nexcuse a proposed patient who is seriously disruptive or who is\nincapable of comprehending and participating in the proceedings,\" but,\n\n                                 -11-\n\fis the opportunity to participate.       For this proposition, the\n\ngovernment relies on United States v. Baker, in which the Fourth\n\nCircuit found that videoconferencing commitment hearings satisfied\n\nconstitutional due process. See United States v. Baker, 45 F.3d 837,\n\n848 (4th Cir. 1995). But Frierson was not offered the opportunity to\n\nbe present through videoconferencing.      Rather, the government's\n\nposition before the trial court is more apposite: that Frierson had a\n\nstatutory right to attend.\n\n          The statute reads: the person subject to the commitment\n\nmotion \"shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present\n\nevidence, to subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.\" 28 U.S.C.\n\n\nas the language of the Minnesota statute makes clear, this can only be\ndone when a person \"is\" disruptive or incapable, as observed by a judge\nduring a hearing. Minn. Stat. § 253B.08(5)(b); cf. Matter of Lawaetz,\n728 F.2d 225, 227-28 (3d Cir. 1984) (finding constitutional a patient's\nexclusion when he had been \"extremely disruptive\" at a prior proceeding\nbefore the same judge during which he had been medicated, medical\nexperts testified that the patient would be even more disruptive\nwithout his medication, and the district court preconditioned the\npatient's appearance on the taking of his medication). Some courts\nhave also allowed the temporary exclusion of a person from that portion\nof a hearing when testimony is given that may lead to emotional harm.\nSee Coll v. Hyland, 411 F. Supp. 905, 913 (D.N.J. 1976); Schmidt v.\nGoddin, 297 S.E.2d 701, 705-06 (Va. 1982). But see Matter of K.F., 582\nA.2d 1294, 1294-95 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1990). A judge, of\ncourse, may resort to needed measures when a defendant disrupts the\ncourtroom proceedings. See generally Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337,\n342-44 (1970). There may well be extreme cases where alternative\nmeasures are needed to protect the safety of the participants to the\nhearing and that can be established without having the inmate before\nthe judge. But that is not this case and we leave any legal issues\nemerging from that fact pattern to future cases.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f§ 4247(d). The language makes clear that Congress contemplated that a\n\nperson would be given the opportunity to be present. Cf. Specht v.\n\nPatterson, 386 U.S. 605, 610 (1967) (\"Due process . . . requires that\n\n[the person] be present with counsel, have an opportunity to be heard,\n\nbe confronted with witnesses against him, have the right to cross-\n\nexamine, and to offer evidence of his own.\").10 Even Baker, which the\n\ngovernment relies on, assumed that the prisoner had a right to be\n\npresent.   See Baker, 45 F.3d at 843-44.\n\n           Although Frierson's due process rights may be of a different\n\nmagnitude than the process due a criminal defendant, see Heller v. Doe,\n\n509 U.S. 312, 325 (1993), the language Congress used in § 4247(d) that\n\na prisoner has the right to testify and to confront witnesses rebuts\n\nthe government's broad argument.        Cf. Harper, 494 U.S. at 235\n\n(approving state policy that provided for \"notice, the right to be\n\npresent at an adversary hearing, and the right to present and cross-\n\n     10    Analogous state statutes are also instructive. See, e.g.,\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 17a-498(a) (\"right to be present at the hearing\");\nFla. Stat. ch. 945.43(3) (assuming the presence of the inmate); 405\nIll. Comp.

Congress chose to give these rights to\n\npersons who, by definition, are thought to suffer from mental disorder\n\nor disease. There was no room to say that because Frierson was thought\n\nto suffer from a mental disorder or disease he did not have such\n\nrights. An inmate's presence at a commitment hearing will assist the\n\njudge in reaching the correct decision, may serve as a deterrent to\n\nfalse testimony, and, more generally, reaffirms the dignity of the\n\nindividual. In this case, Frierson's presence before the court might\n\nhave had the additional advantage of convincing him to take his\n\nmedication voluntarily, as had occurred following his prior § 4245\n\nhearing.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n           Frierson either should have been brought to court, or, as is\n\ncommon elsewhere when judges feel that it is unsafe for the prisoner to\n\nbe brought to the courthouse, the court should have traveled to the\n\nfederal medical center.    The order of commitment is reversed and\n\nvacated.   If the government feels that Frierson should still be\n\ncommitted, it must file a new motion under § 4245.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f",

This case concerns the procedures for\n\ninvoluntarily committing a federal prisoner, Michael Frierson, to a\n\nmedical center for in-patient care for a mental disease. Because of\n\nthe resulting infringement on the liberty interests that even an\n\nimprisoned person retains, such commitments are girded by statutory\n\nprocedural requirements set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 4245. Those statutory\n\nprocedures were Congress's response to Vitek v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110231\"><a href=\"/opinion/110231/vitek-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n491-94 (1980), which held that the involuntary transfer of a prisoner\n\nto a mental hospital implicated liberty interests protected by\n\nconstitutional due process.1 While other circuits, which have within\n\ntheir geographic territory federal penal institutions, have reviewed\n\nproceedings under § 4245 before, this circuit has not.       With the\n\nopening of the new Federal Medical Center-Devens in Massachusetts (FMC-\n\nDevens) on the site of the former Ft. Devens, cases under the statute\n\nmay now arise in this circuit, as this one has. Because the district\n\ncourt departed from statutory procedures by holding the commitment\n\nhearing in the absence of the inmate, we vacate the order of\n\ncommitment.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          We describe what is at stake and thus the reasons for the\n\nprocedural protections required.\n\n\n\n     1    See S. Rep.

And once there, the inmate's commitment lasts until one of three\n\nthings happens. Commitment lasts until the director of the facility\n\ndetermines that the prisoner is no longer in need of care. See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 4245(e). But during a prisoner's commitment, the director of\n\nthe medical facility need only make an annual report on the person's\n\nmental condition and his or her continued need for hospitalization.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 4247(e)(1)(B). Or commitment lasts until counsel for\n\nthe person files a motion for a hearing and a judge determines, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that the person should be discharged.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 4245(d). But such a motion cannot be filed within 180\n\ndays of \"a court determination that the person should continue to be\n\nhospitalized.\" 28 U.S.C. § 4247(h). Or commitment can last until the\n\nperson's sentence of imprisonment has expired.2       See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4245(d). But under a separate section a person due for release can\n\ncontinue to be hospitalized if a judge determines, by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, that \"the person is presently suffering from a\n\n\n\n     2    Frierson's sentence expires on October 9, 2000. He could be\nreleased as early as June 20, 2000, because of good conduct.\n\n                                -3-\n\fmental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create\n\na substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage\n\nto property of another.\" 28 U.S.C. § 4246(d); see also 28 U.S.C. §\n\n4246(a), (c).\n\n          Given these consequences, it is no surprise that the statute\n\nthat authorizes involuntary commitment is sensitive to constitutional\n\ndue process concerns. The provisions at issue in this case, 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 4245 and 4247(d), are illustrative. A person whose mental condition\n\nis at issue may not be committed until there is a hearing at which the\n\nprisoner \"shall be represented by counsel [or counsel shall be\n\nappointed for him if he or she is financially unable to obtain adequate\n\ncounsel and] shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present\n\nevidence, to subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.\" 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4247(d); see also 28 U.S.C. § 4245(c).\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Michael Frierson is serving a 48-month federal sentence for\n\nimportation of methamphetamine.3 Until 1999, Frierson was imprisoned\n\nat the Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg, Virginia, and\n\nthe Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky (FMC-Lexington),\n\n\n\n     3    Frierson was originally found incompetent to stand trial\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241 and was committed for treatment to the\nUnited States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield,\nMissouri. He was tried after being restored to competency.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fwhere he had been committed, but then discharged, under an earlier\n\npetition pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4245.4      Since his stay at FMC-\n\nLexington, Frierson had been taking lithium voluntarily as treatment\n\nfor Bipolar I Disorder, Severe with Psychotic Features. Frierson was\n\ntransferred from FMC-Lexington to FMC-Devens on May 11, 1999.5 On\n\nSeptember 3, 1999, Frierson stopped taking the lithium, and his\n\ncondition deteriorated. As a result, he was placed in the Diagnosis\n\nand Observation area of FMC-Devens's Mental Health Unit.\n\n          On November 10, 1999, the government filed a motion6 with the\n\ndistrict court to commit Frierson pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 4245. The\n\npurpose of obtaining the commitment order, it appears, was to allow\n\ndoctors to treat him involuntarily. Involuntary treatment is permitted\n\nonly after commitment and, then, only after an opportunity for an\n\nadministrative hearing and appeal.      See 28 C.F.R. § 549.43; cf.\n\nWashington v.

Because\n\n\n\n     4    Frierson had refused his medication while at FCI-Petersburg\nand, subsequently, decompensated.\n     5     The parties have not told us, nor does the record reveal,\nwhy, and under what authority, Frierson continued to be incarcerated at\nfederal medical centers subsequent to his discharge from the earlier\ncommitment order.\n     6    In technical terms, the statute refers to a motion, which is\nwhat the government filed, rather than a petition.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fFrierson was indigent, counsel was appointed. Counsel visited Frierson\n\nand found that, while Frierson was disturbed, he appeared to understand\n\nwhat courts and lawyers were and that a motion had been filed for\n\ncommitment.\n\n          On December 14, 1999, the district court held a conference\n\nwith the government and Frierson's appointed counsel, but without\n\nFrierson. Both sides seemed to agree that Frierson met the criteria\n\nfor commitment, and they disagreed only on whether Frierson's presence\n\nat a commitment hearing was required or whether he should be asked\n\nfirst if he wanted to attend. Frierson's counsel stated that Frierson\n\nshould be brought to the courthouse in Boston or the judge should hold\n\na hearing at FMC-Devens because the court should not commit Frierson\n\nwithout actually seeing him. The government was willing to bring\n\nFrierson to the courthouse, but suggested that first he should be asked\n\nif he wanted to attend the hearing. The district court decided to hold\n\na hearing the following week to determine if it was \"feasible and\n\nappropriate\" to have Frierson present at his § 4245 hearing.\n\n          On December 17th, at the request of appointed counsel, Devens\n\nClinical Psychologist Dr. Paul Anderson (whose case study of Frierson\n\nhad been filed by the government in support of its motion) asked\n\nFrierson if he wanted to attend the hearing. Frierson indicated that\n\nhe did. The government then notified the court that it was willing to\n\nbring Frierson to court. For unstated reasons, the court did not\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\frequest the government to do so.\n\n          Even though the statute plainly contemplates that ordinarily\n\na prisoner will attend his or her own commitment hearing, and even\n\nthough Frierson had said that he wanted to attend, and even though the\n\ngovernment said it would bring him to the hearing, the district court\n\nnonetheless conducted a hearing on December 20th without Frierson\n\nbeing there. The ostensible subject was to determine if Frierson\n\nshould attend his commitment hearing, but the hearing ended in a\n\ncommitment order. The only witness at this hearing was Dr. Anderson.\n\nAnderson testified that Frierson indicated that he wanted to attend the\n\nhearing, though not in his orange jumpsuit. Anderson also testified\n\nthat Frierson had filled out a form that requested a telephone call to\n\ncounsel, though a Devens staff member, Carlos Quiles, wrote in an e-\n\nmail to a staff attorney at Devens that he, Quiles, had attempted to\n\nmake the call but was unable to get Frierson's attention. Finally,\n\nAnderson testified that he believed that Frierson knew the purpose of\n\nthe hearing; Anderson testified, as well, that Frierson thought the\n\nhearing would also address his status as Michael the Archangel.\n\n          After Anderson's testimony, the government stated that, since\n\nFrierson indicated he wished to attend the hearing, he had a right to\n\ndo so under the statute and had a right to testify.       Counsel for\n\nFrierson repeated that Frierson should be brought to the hearing\n\nbecause he had a statutory and constitutional right to be there and\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsaid that in many other circuits the hearings are held at the medical\n\ncenter. He also pointed out that after Frierson had been committed\n\nearlier pursuant to § 4245 (at FMC-Lexington), Frierson decided to take\n\nhis medication voluntarily (thus avoiding forcible medication).\n\nCounsel believed that, if Frierson were brought before a judge again,\n\nhe would voluntarily take his medication. Rather than adjourning the\n\nhearing until Frierson could be present, the court directed counsel to\n\ncontact Frierson at Devens during a recess and discuss with him the\n\nfacts surrounding the e-mail. Counsel attempted to contact Frierson,\n\nbut Frierson refused to come to the phone when asked to do so by\n\nQuiles. Upon the resumption of the hearing, the government informed\n\nthe court that it changed its position because it felt that, as a\n\nresult of the phone call, Frierson had been offered the opportunity to\n\nparticipate in the hearing and had refused.       Frierson's counsel\n\ncontested this assertion.\n\n          The district court then entered the order of commitment. The\n\norder read, in part:\n\n          (3) Because of his present mental condition, it is not\n          possible, without undue risk to his own safety and security,\n          to have him brought into court for proceedings in his\n          presence.\n\n          (4) In these circumstances, applying the standard of due\n          process, the court finds it appropriate to afford counsel\n          appointed on his behalf to speak to the court on\n          respondent's behalf, to present evidence on his behalf, to\n          subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to cross-examine\n          witnesses on his behalf at this hearing. Counsel appointed\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          by the court to represent respondent did participate in the\n          hearings of December 14 and 20, 1999, reserving rights to\n          object to the proceedings.        After considering the\n          objections, the court overruled them.\n\n          (5) For reasons stated more fully on the record, the court\n          finds that respondent at this time is not competent to be a\n          witness and is not competent to make an informed decision.\n          He has been offered an opportunity to assist his appointed\n          attorney but has not responded to that opportunity.\n          Moreover, I find that in his present condition it would be\n          a futile gesture to purport to give him an opportunity to\n          participate in a hearing at the Federal Medical Center in\n          Devens, or elsewhere. He cannot become competent without\n          resuming medication, and only then after weeks, at minimum.\n          If he does resume medication and a material change bearing\n          on his competence occurs, a request for further hearing in\n          this court will be allowed.\n\nFrierson appeals from this order.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          The question presented is whether Frierson was provided with\n\nthe requisite \"opportunity\" to be present at his § 4245 hearing.\n\n          First, we clear away a justification for the order which is\n\nclearly erroneous. There is no support for the district court's first\n\n\"finding\" that Frierson could not have been brought into court \"without\n\nundue risk to his own safety and security.\" The government never took\n\nthat position and indeed had offered to bring Frierson to the\n\ncourthouse. Further, even were this so, it does not answer Frierson's\n\nargument that the court could have conducted the hearing at FMC-Devens.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fWe are told that this is routinely done in other circuits and could be\n\ndone at Devens as well.7\n\n          Although the government had said that Frierson should be\n\npresent for the commitment hearing, the government now attempts to\n\ndefend the order on three grounds: first, that the case is moot;\n\nsecond, that Frierson rejected the opportunity to be at the hearing\n\nwhen, on December 20th, he was non-responsive to the guard's efforts to\n\nhave him come to the phone to talk to counsel; and third, that there\n\nwas no right to be physically present under the statute, only the\n\nopportunity to participate in the hearing in certain other ways.\n\n          The matter is not moot.       Although Frierson has now been\n\nforcibly medicated, is taking his mediation, and is more lucid, the\n\ncommitment order, with its attendant consequences described earlier, is\n\nstill in place. Vitek forecloses the government's mootness argument,\n\nas does Washington v.

Vitek rejected a\n\nmootness argument, even though the inmate was no longer at the mental\n\nhospital, because there was a very real threat he would be transferred\n\n\n     7     While no commitment hearing has yet taken place at Devens,\nwe are told that if a judge decided to conduct a hearing there a\nsuitable space, such as a conference room, could be provided. Some\nfederal medical centers have courtrooms, which can be used for\nhearings, while others use conference rooms.\n      We are also told that there will be videoconferencing facilities\noperational between Devens and the U.S. Courthouse in Boston by the end\nof this year.

Here, the inmate is still confined\n\nin the mental hospital.8 In any event, as Harper holds, so long as the\n\ncommitment order is in place, the matter is not moot.

First, the hearing was largely concluded by\n\nthe time the call was made, Anderson having testified.         Second,\n\nFrierson was not told that this call was his opportunity to participate\n\nin the hearing (indeed, it was not); rather, Frierson had earlier said\n\nhe wanted to attend any hearing. The district court properly rejected\n\nthe government's request that it make a finding that the phone call\n\nconstituted an opportunity for Frierson to participate in the hearing.\n\n          Finally, the government, on appeal, argues that the inmate's\n\nphysical presence is not required by the statute at all in a commitment\n\nhearing.9 All that the statute requires, according to the government,\n\n\n     8    That confinement means, inter alia, that his access to\nactivities available to the general penal population is quite\nrestricted.\n     9     On appeal, the government says that it was within the\ndistrict court's \"supervisory authority\" to conduct the commitment\nhearing in Frierson's absence. But here there was no evidence on which\nto conclude that unusual protective measures were needed. Indeed,\nusually such measures are taken only after the patient is observed by\nthe court. See Suzuki v. Quisenberry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1643435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1643435/suzuki-v-quisenberry/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

For this proposition, the\n\ngovernment relies on United States v. Baker, in which the Fourth\n\nCircuit found that videoconferencing commitment hearings satisfied\n\nconstitutional due process. See United States v.

Rather, the government's\n\nposition before the trial court is more apposite: that Frierson had a\n\nstatutory right to attend.\n\n          The statute reads: the person subject to the commitment\n\nmotion \"shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present\n\nevidence, to subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.\" 28 U.S.C.\n\n\nas the language of the Minnesota statute makes clear, this can only be\ndone when a person \"is\" disruptive or incapable, as observed by a judge\nduring a hearing.

Some courts\nhave also allowed the temporary exclusion of a person from that portion\nof a hearing when testimony is given that may lead to emotional harm.\nSee Coll v.

Congress chose to give these rights to\n\npersons who, by definition, are thought to suffer from mental disorder\n\nor disease. There was no room to say that because Frierson was thought\n\nto suffer from a mental disorder or disease he did not have such\n\nrights. An inmate's presence at a commitment hearing will assist the\n\njudge in reaching the correct decision, may serve as a deterrent to\n\nfalse testimony, and, more generally, reaffirms the dignity of the\n\nindividual. In this case, Frierson's presence before the court might\n\nhave had the additional advantage of convincing him to take his\n\nmedication voluntarily, as had occurred following his prior § 4245\n\nhearing.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n           Frierson either should have been brought to court, or, as is\n\ncommon elsewhere when judges feel that it is unsafe for the prisoner to\n\nbe brought to the courthouse, the court should have traveled to the\n\nfederal medical center.    The order of commitment is reversed and\n\nvacated.   If the government feels that Frierson should still be\n\ncommitted, it must file a new motion under § 4245.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f</pre>",
