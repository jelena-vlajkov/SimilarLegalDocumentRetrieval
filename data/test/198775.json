Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n            Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n      Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n         and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nGail E. Peabody for petitioner.\r\nNancy Torresen, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Andrew\r\nKetterer, Attorney General, and Donald Macomber, Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral, were on brief for respondent.\r\n\nJanuary 20, 2000\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Petitioner-appellant\r\nSandra Coombs appeals from the district court's denial of her\r\npetition for habeas corpus relief from her theft conviction in\r\n1996.  Coombs contends that she is entitled to relief because the\r\nstate compelled her confession to the theft by promising not to\r\ncharge her for possession of a small amount of marijuana discovered\r\nat the time of her arrest.  We affirm.\r\n           I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nCoombs was charged with the theft of a sweater from L.L.\r\nBean in Freeport, Maine.  On December 16, 1995, her companion,\r\nGifford Campbell, attempted to return a stolen sweater to the L.L.\r\nBean store while Coombs and another individual waited in her car in\r\nthe parking lot.  After detaining Campbell inside the store, a\r\nstore detective and Freeport Police Sergeant Terry Carter\r\napproached Coombs in her car and requested her driver's license and\r\nregistration.  When Coombs retrieved these items from the car's\r\nglove compartment, Carter saw a small bag of marijuana in the\r\ncompartment and seized it. \r\nAt the suppression hearing, Carter testified that the\r\nmarijuana was a \"very small quantity,\" while Coombs testified that\r\nit was approximately a quarter of an ounce.  At trial, Coombs\r\ntestified that it was \"quite a large amount,\" \"probably say half a\r\nsandwich bag full,\" an amount she later described as \"serious.\" \r\nUnder Maine law, possession of a usable amount of marijuana would\r\nbe a civil, not a criminal, infraction.  See 22 M.R.S.A.  2383(1)\r\n(1999).  Possession of more than one and one-quarter ounces of\r\nmarijuana gives rise to a presumption that a person is engaging in\r\nunlawful furnishing of marijuana, which is a crime.  See 17-A\r\nM.R.S.A.  1106(3)(a) (1999).\r\nCoombs agreed to go into the store with Carter to discuss\r\nthe matter of the sweater.  Carter radioed the Freeport Police\r\nDepartment to request a records check on Coombs.  Upon discovering\r\nthat there was an outstanding warrant for Coombs relating to an\r\nunpaid fine, Carter placed her under arrest.  He then transported\r\nher to the police station and gave her Miranda warnings.  Coombs\r\nindicated that she understood the warnings, and agreed to answer\r\nquestions.  At no point during the interrogation did Coombs request\r\na lawyer or state that she no longer wanted to answer Carter's\r\nquestions.\r\nCarter testified that he interrogated Coombs for \"a\r\ncouple of hours,\" but Coombs claimed the questioning went on for\r\n\"three or four hours.\"  Coombs testified at the suppression hearing\r\nthat she was handcuffed to a pole during the entire interrogation,\r\nwhile Carter testified she was only handcuffed for fifteen to\r\nthirty minutes while he photographed and fingerprinted her, and for\r\nadditional short periods of time while he was out of the room. \r\nCoombs further stated that she was afraid and physically\r\nuncomfortable during the interrogation, and cried periodically.  \r\nCoombs testified that Carter told her that she \"could\r\ntake two charges of theft and possession of marijuana or [she]\r\ncould confess to the theft and he'd flush the marijuana.\" \r\nEventually, Carter asked Coombs to make a \"voluntary written\r\nstatement,\" and she agreed.  At the suppression hearing, Coombs\r\nstated:\r\nI set there handcuffed to a pole for three or\r\nfour hours, you know, and it's either you take\r\nthe -  you know, confess to theft or you take\r\nboth, and I just figured that would be the\r\neasiest way to -  you know, instead of being\r\nhandcuffed to the pole for five more hours.  I\r\ndidn't feel there was any other way.\r\n\nContrary to Coombs's testimony, Carter denied making any\r\npromises to Coombs in exchange for her confession, and denied\r\ntelling her that he would not charge her with marijuana possession\r\nif she confessed to the theft.  He testified, however, that he had\r\noriginally intended to charge her with possession of marijuana and\r\nhad written a summons for that offense.  Moreover, he conceded that\r\nafter Coombs signed the written confession, he flushed the\r\nmarijuana down the toilet and tore up the summons.  Carter offered\r\nno explanation for these actions at the suppression hearing; at\r\ntrial, he testified that he \"felt bad\" for Coombs.\r\n          II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn January 11, 1996, Coombs was charged in the state\r\ndistrict court with Class E theft pursuant to 17-A M.R.S.A.  353\r\n(1983).  See State v. Coombs, No. 95-03959 (Maine Dist. Ct., Div.\r\nBath-Brunswick).  Class E theft is punishable by no more than six\r\nmonths' imprisonment.  See 17-A M.R.S.A.  1252(2)(E).  Coombs\r\npleaded not guilty at her arraignment.  On February 26, 1996, she\r\nfiled a motion to suppress her written confession on the ground\r\nthat the confession had been compelled by the state's promise to\r\ndrop the marijuana charge, and was therefore involuntary under the\r\nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \r\nAfter an evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion,\r\nthe Maine district court (\"the suppression court\") denied the\r\nmotion.  The suppression court found, inter alia, that Coombs was\r\nread her Miranda warnings at the station house; indicated that she\r\nunderstood the warnings; did not request counsel; did not tell\r\nCarter that she wanted to stop answering questions; was handcuffed\r\nto a horizontal rail during some intermittent periods of time\r\nduring the interrogation when she was left alone by Carter, who was\r\ngoing between Coombs's room and another suspect's room; and was\r\ninterrogated for approximately two to three hours.  As to Carter's\r\nalleged promise of leniency in exchange for Coombs's confession,\r\nthe court stated: \r\nI'm satisfied that there were no promises\r\nwhich would give rise to a constitutional\r\ninfirmity, and I'm satisfied beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that the con  - that the\r\nadmission or the statement or whatever is in\r\nthis was, in fact, voluntary.\r\n\nCoombs's confession was admitted into evidence at her\r\ntrial, which took place in the Maine Superior Court.  On September\r\n10, 1996, following a two-day trial, the jury returned a guilty\r\nverdict.  The court sentenced Coombs to thirty days' imprisonment,\r\nbut stayed the sentence pending appeal and the instant proceedings. \r\nOn September 27, 1996, Coombs appealed from her\r\nconviction to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court sitting as the Law\r\nCourt pursuant to 15 M.R.S.A.  2115 and M. R. Crim. P. 37.  Her\r\nappeal focused on the voluntariness of her confession and the\r\nvoluntariness of her waiver of Miranda rights.  The Law Court\r\naffirmed Coombs's conviction on January 2, 1998.  State v. Coombs,\r\n704 A.2d 387 (Me. 1998).  Accepting the suppression court's\r\nfindings that Coombs was handcuffed only intermittently (which the\r\nLaw Court construed, based on Carter's testimony, to have been\r\nfifteen to thirty minutes) and that proper Miranda procedures were\r\nfollowed, the Law Court rejected Coombs's argument that her theft\r\nconfession should have been suppressed.  See id. at 391.  On the\r\nquestion of whether the confession was involuntary because it was\r\ngiven in exchange for Carter's promise not to charge her with\r\nmarijuana possession, the court stated:\r\nA confession motivated by a promise of\r\nleniency by a person with apparent authority\r\nto execute the promise is involuntary and\r\ninadmissible.  State v. Tardiff, 374 A.2d 598,\r\n601 (Me. 1977).  At the suppression hearing,\r\nSergeant Carter testified that he did not\r\npromise Coombs anything in exchange for her\r\nconfession and, although he conceded that he\r\nflushed the marijuana down the toilet, he\r\ndenied telling Coombs that she would not be\r\ncharged with possession if she confessed to\r\nthe theft.  Although Coombs testified to the\r\ncontrary, the suppression judge, as the fact\r\nfinder, was free to accept Sergeant Carter's\r\ntestimony over Coombs'.  See State v.\r\nLarrivee, 479 A.2d 347, 349 (Me. 1984); State\r\nv. Knights, 482 A.2d 436, 442 (Me. 1984).  The\r\ntrial court's finding is based on competent\r\nevidence and is not clearly erroneous.  \r\n\nId.  The Law Court also rejected Coombs's contention that that\r\nfinding was ambiguous:\r\nThe suppression judge found that \"there were\r\nno promises which would give rise to a\r\nconstitutional infirmity[.]\"  Coombs contends\r\nthat this finding is ambiguous, that it is\r\nunclear whether the suppression judge found\r\nthat no promise had been made or that a\r\npromise of no constitutional significance had\r\nbeen made.  Because we assume that the\r\nsuppression judge found for the prosecution on\r\nall issues of fact necessarily raised by his\r\ndenial of the motion to suppress, State v.\r\nCefalo, 396 A.2d 233, 239 n.12 (Me. 1979), we\r\nreject Coombs' contention.\r\n\nId. at n.4.\r\nOn April 1, 1998, Coombs filed a petition for a writ of\r\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court, again on Fifth\r\nAmendment grounds.  The Court denied her petition on May 18, 1998. \r\nCoombs v. Maine, 118 S.Ct. 1819 (1998).  Next, on October 5, 1998,\r\nshe filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Maine, limiting her argument to\r\nthe voluntariness of her confession.  The magistrate judge held\r\nthat the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\r\nPub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (\"AEDPA\"), on which the state\r\nrelied, did not apply to Coombs's habeas petition.  Rather, he\r\napplied a pre-AEDPA standard, which permitted state court findings\r\nof fact to be overturned only if \"not fairly supported by the\r\nrecord.\"  The magistrate judge concluded that the voluntariness of\r\nCoombs's confession was supported by Carter's testimony.  He went\r\non to hold that his conclusion would be the same even under an\r\nindependent review of the totality of the circumstances. \r\nOn January 11, 1999, the district court affirmed the\r\nmagistrate judge's recommended decision and dismissed Coombs's\r\npetition, but for reasons other than those set forth by the\r\nmagistrate judge.  See Coombs v. Maine, Civ. No. 98-346-P-C (D. Me.\r\nJan. 11, 1998).  The district court held that AEDPA applied to\r\nCoombs's petition, so that the state court's factual findings were\r\n\"presumed to be correct\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2254(e)(1).  It\r\nfurther noted that AEDPA permitted it to grant the petition only if\r\nthe trial court's determination \"was contrary to . . . clearly\r\nestablished federal law as decided by the Supreme Court\" or\r\n\"resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\r\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\r\nthe State court proceeding.\"  See 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) &amp; (2). \r\nThe district court concluded that the suppression court's decision\r\nwas neither contrary to clearly established federal law nor based\r\non an unreasonable determination of the facts.  Coombs timely filed\r\na notice of appeal to this court on January 22, 1999.\r\n              III.  DISCUSSION\r\nIn reviewing a ruling on a petition for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus, we examine the district court's legal conclusions de novo. \r\nSee Simpson v. Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 205 (1st Cir. 1999).  As the\r\ndistrict court correctly held (and the parties do not contest), the\r\nstandard of review to be applied is set forth by Congress in the\r\nAEDPA statute.  AEDPA provides that in a habeas proceeding, \"a\r\ndetermination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be\r\npresumed to be correct,\" and the petitioner has the burden of\r\nrebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing\r\nevidence.  28 U.S.C.  2254(e)(1).  For this purpose, \"factual\r\nissues\" are defined as \"basic, primary, or historical facts:  facts\r\n'in the sense of a recital of external events and the credibility\r\nof their narrators.'\"  Bryson v. Ward, 187 F.3d 1193, 1211 (10th\r\nCir. 1999), quoting Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963).  See\r\nalso Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 112-13 (1995) (interpreting\r\npre-AEDPA version of habeas statute). \r\nA state court's ultimate conclusions, including its legal\r\nrulings, are reviewed pursuant to another clause of AEDPA, allowing\r\nhabeas relief only where the state court's adjudication\r\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\r\nto, or involved an unreasonable application\r\nof, clearly established Federal law, as\r\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates; or \r\n\n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on\r\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in\r\nlight of the evidence presented in the State\r\ncourt proceeding. \r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2254(d).  This provision governs not only pure issues\r\nof law, but mixed questions of law and fact in which legal\r\nprinciples are applied to historical facts.  See Trice v. Ward, 196\r\nF.3d 1151, 1169 (10th Cir. 1999); Sanchez v. Gilmore, 189 F.3d 619,\r\n623 (7th Cir. 1999).  See also O'Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 22-\r\n23 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIf the suppression court upheld the confession because it\r\ncredited Carter's testimony that he had made no promise to flush\r\nthe marijuana in return for Coombs's confession to theft, Coombs's\r\ncase for federal habeas relief largely evaporates.  Such a state\r\ncourt finding of \"basic, primary, or historical facts\" based on a\r\ncredibility determination is \"presumed to be correct,\" subject only\r\nto rebuttal by \"clear and convincing evidence.\"  28 U.S.C. \r\n2254(e)(1).  We find no rebuttal of that nature here.  \r\nCoombs's argument on appeal from the denial of her habeas\r\npetition is that the state suppression court's own finding that\r\n\"there were no promises which would give rise to a constitutional\r\ninfirmity\" fell short of indicating that it credited Carter's\r\nversion of events rather than Coombs's.  In the absence of an\r\nexpress finding, Coombs urges, the suppression court possibly may\r\nhave accepted Coombs's version   that Carter promised to get rid of\r\nthe marijuana in exchange for a confession of theft   yet still\r\nconcluded, as a matter of law, that Coombs's confession was\r\nvoluntary.  In that case, Coombs contends, she has raised a federal\r\nconstitutional issue meriting habeas review.\r\nTo accept Coombs's position, however, we would have to\r\nreject the Maine Law Court's interpretation of precisely what\r\naction was taken by the suppression court, a court under its\r\njurisdiction.  The Law Court clearly believed that the suppression\r\ncourt had credited Carter's testimony that he did not promise\r\nCoombs anything in exchange for her confession.  In its opinion,\r\nafter setting forth the state's rule that a confession motivated by\r\na promise of leniency \"is involuntary and inadmissible,\" the court\r\nwent on to recite Carter's denial of having made any such promise. \r\nCoombs, 704 A.2d at 391.  It then stated that while Coombs\r\ntestified to the contrary, the suppression court, as fact finder,\r\n\"was free to accept Sergeant Carter's testimony over Coombs's\" and\r\nthat \"the trial court's finding is based on competent evidence and\r\nis not clearly erroneous.\"  Id.  The Law Court thus plainly\r\nconstrued the suppression court as having based its finding of\r\nvoluntariness on acceptance of Carter's version of the facts. \r\nIndeed, to have accepted Coombs's version would seemingly be\r\ninconsistent with the legal premise stated at the outset of its\r\ndiscussion; instead, it reasonably assumed that the suppression\r\ncourt shared its understanding of the governing law, as previously\r\narticulated by the Law Court.  Moreover, in footnote 4, the court\r\nspecifically rejected Coombs's contention that the suppression\r\ncourt's finding was ambiguous, opining that the suppression court\r\n\"found for the prosecution on all issues of fact necessarily raised\r\nby his denial of the motion to suppress.\"  Id. at 391 n.4.  Even\r\nthe Law Court justice writing in dissent agreed that the majority\r\nassumed a finding that no promise was made.  See id. at 393.  \r\nHence, were we to speculate that the suppression court\r\ncredited Coombs, we would be rejecting an authoritative\r\ninterpretation by Maine's highest court of the findings of a\r\nsubordinate court   and would be doing so on an issue that,\r\nalthough close, was resolved well within reasonable parameters. \r\nUnder the circumstances, we can see no justification, even were we\r\nso inclined, for substituting our own different theory as to what\r\nthe suppression court might have intended.  Cf. Miller, 474 U.S. at\r\n112 (federal habeas court must \"give great weight to the considered\r\nconclusions of coequal state judiciary\").  Additionally, we cannot\r\nconclude, given the fact of Carter's testimony, that the\r\nsuppression court's decision, as so construed by the Law Court, was\r\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the state proceedings.  We hold, therefore,\r\nthat habeas review is barred under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(2) and\r\n(e)(1).\r\nTo keep the record clear, it is less apparent to us than\r\nto the Maine Law Court that if a promise had been made it\r\nautomatically would have rendered the confession involuntary.  See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Byram, 145 F.3d 405, 407 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(noting that Supreme Court has \"confined\" early common-law rule\r\nthat \"confessions produced by promises not to prosecute or offers\r\nof leniency were often excluded as involuntary.\"); Cole v. Lane,\r\n830 F.2d 104, 109 (7th Cir. 1987) (holding that promise of leniency\r\nis necessary, but not sufficient, condition of finding of\r\ninvoluntariness); United States v. Parker, 549 F.2d 1217, 1220 (9th\r\nCir. 1977) (confession not involuntary where defendant questioned\r\nby federal agents for four hours despite disputed testimony\r\nconcerning use of promises and physical force by agents).  \r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

Petitioner-appellant\r\nSandra Coombs appeals from the district court's denial of her\r\npetition for habeas corpus relief from her theft conviction in\r\n1996.  Coombs contends that she is entitled to relief because the\r\nstate compelled her confession to the theft by promising not to\r\ncharge her for possession of a small amount of marijuana discovered\r\nat the time of her arrest.  We affirm.\r\n           I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nCoombs was charged with the theft of a sweater from L.L.\r\nBean in Freeport, Maine.  On December 16, 1995, her companion,\r\nGifford Campbell, attempted to return a stolen sweater to the L.L.\r\nBean store while Coombs and another individual waited in her car in\r\nthe parking lot.

On February 26, 1996, she\r\nfiled a motion to suppress her written confession on the ground\r\nthat the confession had been compelled by the state's promise to\r\ndrop the marijuana charge, and was therefore involuntary under the\r\nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \r\nAfter an evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion,\r\nthe Maine district court (\"the suppression court\") denied the\r\nmotion.  The suppression court found, inter alia, that Coombs was\r\nread her Miranda warnings at the station house; indicated that she\r\nunderstood the warnings; did not request counsel; did not tell\r\nCarter that she wanted to stop answering questions; was handcuffed\r\nto a horizontal rail during some intermittent periods of time\r\nduring the interrogation when she was left alone by Carter, who was\r\ngoing between Coombs's room and another suspect's room; and was\r\ninterrogated for approximately two to three hours.  As to Carter's\r\nalleged promise of leniency in exchange for Coombs's confession,\r\nthe court stated: \r\nI'm satisfied that there were no promises\r\nwhich would give rise to a constitutional\r\ninfirmity, and I'm satisfied beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that the con  - that the\r\nadmission or the statement or whatever is in\r\nthis was, in fact, voluntary.\r\n\nCoombs's confession was admitted into evidence at her\r\ntrial, which took place in the Maine Superior Court.  On September\r\n10, 1996, following a two-day trial, the jury returned a guilty\r\nverdict.  The court sentenced Coombs to thirty days' imprisonment,\r\nbut stayed the sentence pending appeal and the instant proceedings. \r\nOn September 27, 1996, Coombs appealed from her\r\nconviction to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court sitting as the Law\r\nCourt pursuant to 15 M.R.S.A.  2115 and M. R. Crim. P. 37.  Her\r\nappeal focused on the voluntariness of her confession and the\r\nvoluntariness of her waiver of Miranda rights.  The Law Court\r\naffirmed Coombs's conviction on January 2, 1998.  State v. Coombs,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(Me. 1998).  Accepting the suppression court's\r\nfindings that Coombs was handcuffed only intermittently (which the\r\nLaw Court construed, based on Carter's testimony, to have been\r\nfifteen to thirty minutes) and that proper Miranda procedures were\r\nfollowed, the Law Court rejected Coombs's argument that her theft\r\nconfession should have been suppressed.  See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 391. </span><pre class=\"inline\"> On the\r\nquestion of whether the confession was involuntary because it was\r\ngiven in exchange for Carter's promise not to charge her with\r\nmarijuana possession, the court stated:\r\nA confession motivated by a promise of\r\nleniency by a person with apparent authority\r\nto execute the promise is involuntary and\r\ninadmissible.  State v. Tardiff, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n601 (Me. 1977).  At the suppression hearing,\r\nSergeant Carter testified that he did not\r\npromise Coombs anything in exchange for her\r\nconfession and, although he conceded that he\r\nflushed the marijuana down the toilet, he\r\ndenied telling Coombs that she would not be\r\ncharged with possession if she confessed to\r\nthe theft.  Although Coombs testified to the\r\ncontrary, the suppression judge, as the fact\r\nfinder, was free to accept Sergeant Carter's\r\ntestimony over Coombs'.

Because we assume that the\r\nsuppression judge found for the prosecution on\r\nall issues of fact necessarily raised by his\r\ndenial of the motion to suppress, State v.\r\nCefalo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 n.12 (Me. 1979), we\r\nreject Coombs' contention.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at n.4.\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">\nOn April 1, 1998, Coombs filed a petition for a writ of\r\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court, again on Fifth\r\nAmendment grounds.  The Court denied her petition on May 18, 1998. \r\nCoombs v. Maine, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1819</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1998).  Next, on October 5, 1998,\r\nshe filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Maine, limiting her argument to\r\nthe voluntariness of her confession.  The magistrate judge held\r\nthat the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\r\nPub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (\"AEDPA\"), on which the state\r\nrelied, did not apply to Coombs's habeas petition.  Rather, he\r\napplied a pre-AEDPA standard, which permitted state court findings\r\nof fact to be overturned only if \"not fairly supported by the\r\nrecord.\"  The magistrate judge concluded that the voluntariness of\r\nCoombs's confession was supported by Carter's testimony.  He went\r\non to hold that his conclusion would be the same even under an\r\nindependent review of the totality of the circumstances. \r\nOn January 11, 1999, the district court affirmed the\r\nmagistrate judge's recommended decision and dismissed Coombs's\r\npetition, but for reasons other than those set forth by the\r\nmagistrate judge.  See Coombs v. Maine, Civ. No. 98-346-P-C (D. Me.\r\nJan. 11, 1998).  The district court held that AEDPA applied to\r\nCoombs's petition, so that the state court's factual findings were\r\n\"presumed to be correct\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2254(e)(1).  It\r\nfurther noted that AEDPA permitted it to grant the petition only if\r\nthe trial court's determination \"was contrary to . . . clearly\r\nestablished federal law as decided by the Supreme Court\" or\r\n\"resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\r\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\r\nthe State court proceeding.\"  See 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) &amp; (2). \r\nThe district court concluded that the suppression court's decision\r\nwas neither contrary to clearly established federal law nor based\r\non an unreasonable determination of the facts.  Coombs timely filed\r\na notice of appeal to this court on January 22, 1999.\r\n              III.  DISCUSSION\r\nIn reviewing a ruling on a petition for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus, we examine the district court's legal conclusions de novo. \r\nSee Simpson v. Matesanz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198459\"><a href=\"/opinion/198459/simpson-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205 (1st Cir. 1999).  As the\r\ndistrict court correctly held (and the parties do not contest), the\r\nstandard of review to be applied is set forth by Congress in the\r\nAEDPA statute.  AEDPA provides that in a habeas proceeding, \"a\r\ndetermination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be\r\npresumed to be correct,\" and the petitioner has the burden of\r\nrebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing\r\nevidence.  28 U.S.C.  2254(e)(1).  For this purpose, \"factual\r\nissues\" are defined as \"basic, primary, or historical facts:  facts\r\n'in the sense of a recital of external events and the credibility\r\nof their narrators.'\"  Bryson v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158381\"><a href=\"/opinion/158381/bryson-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1211 (10th\r\nCir. 1999), quoting Townsend v.

This provision governs not only pure issues\r\nof law, but mixed questions of law and fact in which legal\r\nprinciples are applied to historical facts.  See Trice v.

See also O'Brien v.

Such a state\r\ncourt finding of \"basic, primary, or historical facts\" based on a\r\ncredibility determination is \"presumed to be correct,\" subject only\r\nto rebuttal by \"clear and convincing evidence.\"  28 U.S.C. \r\n2254(e)(1).  We find no rebuttal of that nature here.  \r\nCoombs's argument on appeal from the denial of her habeas\r\npetition is that the state suppression court's own finding that\r\n\"there were no promises which would give rise to a constitutional\r\ninfirmity\" fell short of indicating that it credited Carter's\r\nversion of events rather than Coombs's.  In the absence of an\r\nexpress finding, Coombs urges, the suppression court possibly may\r\nhave accepted Coombs's version   that Carter promised to get rid of\r\nthe marijuana in exchange for a confession of theft   yet still\r\nconcluded, as a matter of law, that Coombs's confession was\r\nvoluntary.  In that case, Coombs contends, she has raised a federal\r\nconstitutional issue meriting habeas review.\r\nTo accept Coombs's position, however, we would have to\r\nreject the Maine Law Court's interpretation of precisely what\r\naction was taken by the suppression court, a court under its\r\njurisdiction.  The Law Court clearly believed that the suppression\r\ncourt had credited Carter's testimony that he did not promise\r\nCoombs anything in exchange for her confession.  In its opinion,\r\nafter setting forth the state's rule that a confession motivated by\r\na promise of leniency \"is involuntary and inadmissible,\" the court\r\nwent on to recite Carter's denial of having made any such promise. \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Coombs,</span> <span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">391</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  It then stated that while Coombs\r\ntestified to the contrary, the suppression court, as fact finder,\r\n\"was free to accept Sergeant Carter's testimony over Coombs's\" and\r\nthat \"the trial court's finding is based on competent evidence and\r\nis not clearly erroneous.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The Law </span><pre class=\"inline\">Court thus plainly\r\nconstrued the suppression court as having based its finding of\r\nvoluntariness on acceptance of Carter's version of the facts. \r\nIndeed, to have accepted Coombs's version would seemingly be\r\ninconsistent with the legal premise stated at the outset of its\r\ndiscussion; instead, it reasonably assumed that the suppression\r\ncourt shared its understanding of the governing law, as previously\r\narticulated by the Law Court.  Moreover, in footnote 4, the court\r\nspecifically rejected Coombs's contention that the suppression\r\ncourt's finding was ambiguous, opining that the suppression court\r\n\"found for the prosecution on all issues of fact necessarily raised\r\nby his denial of the motion to suppress.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 391 </span><pre class=\"inline\">n.4.  Even\r\nthe Law Court justice writing in dissent agreed that the majority\r\nassumed a finding that no promise was made.  See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 393. </span><pre class=\"inline\"> \r\nHence, were we to speculate that the suppression court\r\ncredited Coombs, we would be rejecting an authoritative\r\ninterpretation by Maine's highest court of the findings of a\r\nsubordinate court   and would be doing so on an issue that,\r\nalthough close, was resolved well within reasonable parameters. \r\nUnder the circumstances, we can see no justification, even were we\r\nso inclined, for substituting our own different theory as to what\r\nthe suppression court might have intended.  Cf. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Miller,</span> <span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at\r\n<span class=\"page\">112</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(federal habeas court must \"give great weight to the considered\r\nconclusions of coequal state judiciary\").  Additionally, we cannot\r\nconclude, given the fact of Carter's testimony, that the\r\nsuppression court's decision, as so construed by the Law Court, was\r\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the state proceedings.  We hold, therefore,\r\nthat habeas review is barred under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(2) and\r\n(e)(1).\r\nTo keep the record clear, it is less apparent to us than\r\nto the Maine Law Court that if a promise had been made it\r\nautomatically would have rendered the confession involuntary.
