In 1995 and 1997, the appellant Robert Rooney\n\nd/b/a Biomet Rooney & Associates entered into two separate contracts\n\nwith the appellee Biomet, Inc., each of which included the following\n\nforum selection clause:\n\n          As you are aware, Biomet has many distributors\n          across the United States. It is agreed that, in\n          the event of any dispute between us, the laws of\n          the State of Indiana shall govern the validity,\n          performance, interpretation, enforcement and any\n          other aspect of our agreement or relationship. It\n          is further agreed that any and all actions\n          concerning any dispute arising under our\n          relationship shall be filed and maintained only\n          in a state or federal court of competent\n          jurisdiction sitting in the State of Indiana, and\n          both of us consent to such jurisdiction.\n\n(Emphasis added). Despite the forum selection clause, in September\n\n1998, Rooney brought this action against Biomet in the federal district\n\ncourt in Massachusetts. On September 16, 1999, the district court\n\nenforced the forum selection clause and dismissed the case. See Rooney\n\nv. Biomet, Inc., 63 F. Supp. 2d 126, 128 (D. Mass. 1999). In this\n\nappeal, Rooney challenges the district court's decision.\n\n          Having thoroughly reviewed the briefs and the record, we\n\naffirm for the reasons expressed in the district court's opinion. The\n\nforum selection clause is valid and enforceable and the Motion to\n\nDismiss was properly granted. See generally Lambert v. Kysar, 983 F.2d\n\n1110 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Affirmed.
