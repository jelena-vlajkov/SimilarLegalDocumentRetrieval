SAUCIER,\n\n                     Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n              WARDEN, NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE PRISON,\n\n                     Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n     [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                 Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Alcide H. Saucier on brief pro se.\n     Philip T. McLaughlin, Attorney General, and Christopher H.M.\nCarter, Assistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          JUNE 5, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam. Petitioner Alcide H. Saucier appeals\n\nfrom the district court's dismissal of his habeas petition\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254 for lack of exhaustion.                For reasons\n\nalready stated in our order dated November 10, 1999, we\n\nagree   with    petitioner     that   he   has    exhausted     his   state\n\nremedies.      We nonetheless affirm dismissal of the petition\n\non the ground that it is untimely.               In our November order,\n\nwe directed briefing on this question because it appeared\n\nthat petitioner had not filed his petition within the one-\n\nyear grace period for habeas claims accruing before the\n\nenactment of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty\n\nAct (\"AEDPA\").       See Gaskins v. Duval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (memorandum and order).            We now conclude that the\n\npetition was untimely and that it should be dismissed with\n\nprejudice.\n\n            First,   while     the    state    failed    to   assert     the\n\nlimitations     defense   in   its    answer      to   the   petition,   we\n\nconclude that it has not waived the defense.                    Given the\n\nearly stage of proceedings, the state might yet have raised\n\nthe defense by amending its answer or filing a motion for\n\nsummary judgment.     In its order dismissing the petition, the\n\ndistrict court mentioned the limitations period as bearing\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fon   any    future        petition,        alerting     both   the   state       and\n\npetitioner to this issue (albeit not with reference to the\n\ninstant petition).              Significantly, in his brief petitioner\n\nhas not asserted any prejudice attributable to the late\n\nraising of the defense.               For these reasons, we hold that\n\nthere      has   been      no    waiver.          See   Williams     v.    Ashland\n\nEngineering Co., 45 F.3d 588, 593 (1st Cir. 1995) (finding\n\nno waiver of an affirmative defense raised before the close\n\nof discovery and before summary judgment proceedings where\n\nthe plaintiff could anticipate litigation of the issue, had\n\nan opportunity to respond, and was not unfairly prejudiced\n\nby the late assertion of the defense); accord Conjugal\n\nPartnership v. Conjugal Partnership, 22 F.3d 391, 400 (1st\n\nCir.    1994)      (\"it    is     settled        that   '[w]hen    there    is     no\n\nprejudice and when fairness dictates, the strictures of [the\n\nraise or waive] rule may be relaxed\") (citation omitted).\n\n              Second, the petitioner has not shown that he timely\n\nfiled   his      petition,       as   he    suggests.       Finality       under    §\n\n2244(d)(1)(A) occurs on the \"conclusion of direct review or\n\nthe expiration of the time for seeking such review,\" but is\n\nnot determined by the time for filing a new trial motion\n\nunder      state     law,       as    petitioner        contends.          Section\n\n2244(d)(1)(D) does not apply because the petitioner knew the\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\ffactual predicates for his claims by the time his probation\n\nwas    revoked,    an   event   which      occurred   prior    to   AEDPA's\n\nenactment.        Hence, he was obligated to file his claims\n\nwithin the one-year grace period.               His failure to obtain\n\ndocuments of record to substantiate his claims until May\n\n1997    does     not    alter   that    fact,   especially      since    he\n\napparently made no effort to obtain those documents until\n\nthat time.\n\n           Finally, even if this court were to hold that the\n\nlimitations period may be equitably tolled in an appropriate\n\ncase, this is not such a case.               The detrimental reliance\n\nclaims considered in Libby v. Magnusson, 177 F.3d 43 (1st\n\nCir. 1999), and Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54 (1st\n\nCir.    1997),    cert.    denied,     523    U.S.    1123    (1998),   are\n\ndistinguishable.        The petitioners in those cases had filed\n\na second post-AEDPA petition and claimed that their filing\n\nhad been affected by pre-AEDPA law, so that application of\n\nAEDPA to their second petitions would have an impermissible\n\nretroactive effect.        In contrast, the petition at issue here\n\nis a first petition which was filed after AEDPA's enactment.\n\nWe also note that this pro se petitioner's ignorance of the\n\nlimitations period, allegedly based on now invalid case law,\n\nwould    not   justify     equitable       tolling.     See    Harris   v.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fHutchinson, -- F.3d -- , 2000 WL 345398 *5-*6 (4th Cir.\n\n2000)   (no      equitable    tolling      where       counsel    erroneously\n\nadvised     petitioner       that    limitations         period    began     at\n\nconclusion       of   post-conviction           proceedings);      Smith     v.\n\nMcGinnis, 208 F.3d 13, 16-18 (2d Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (no\n\nequitable     tolling      where    pro    se    petitioner       erroneously\n\nbelieved that filing federal petition could await exhaustion\n\nof state remedies); Felder v. Johnson, 204 F.3d 168, 171-73\n\n(5th Cir. 2000) (no equitable tolling where pro se inmate\n\nlacked knowledge of limitations period).\n\n            We    affirm     dismissal     of    the    28   U.S.C.   §    2254\n\npetition, but we remand to the district court with the\n\ndirection that it modify its judgment of dismissal to be\n\nwith prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
