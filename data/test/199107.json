Kevin C. Brown appeals from a district court\n\nopinion upholding the Commissioner's denial of social security\n\ndisability insurance benefits.                     Upon careful review of the\n\nbriefs and record, we affirm essentially for the reasons stated\n\nin the district court's opinion.                        We add only the following\n\ncomments          to   address           claimant's           contention         that      the\n\nAdministrative         Law       Judge    (\"ALJ\")       violated          the   regulations\n\nregarding the weighting of evidence.\n\n       As    an    initial        matter,    claimant's         suggestion        that     the\n\nopinions of Dr. Earley, Dr. Ruggiano, and Dr. Stern are entitled\n\nto controlling weight is frivolous.                          Of these three sources,\n\nonly       Dr.    Earley    (claimant's       primary         care    physician)         is    a\n\ntreating         source.1        Dr.   Earley's     statement         that      claimant      is\n\n\"psychologically            incapacitated         for       work\"    is    conclusory      and\n\nconflicts with other evidence in the record.                          More importantly,\n\nthe    statement       is    an    opinion    on       an    issue    reserved     for     the\n\nCommissioner.              See    20     C.F.R.    §    404.1527(e).             Under     the\n\ncircumstances, the ALJ was entitled to reject it.\n\n\n\n       1\n     The ALJ found that claimant never actually engaged in\ntreatment with Dr. Ruggiano, and this finding is supported by\nthe record. Dr. Stern was clearly just an examining source.\n\n                                             2\n\f     Moreover,   the    ALJ   accepted    the   opinion   of   claimant's\n\nexamining sources that he has a severe personality disorder\n\nseparate and apart from his alcoholism.             The question as to\n\nwhether this disorder meets or equals any Listing is an issue\n\nreserved to the Commissioner.2      Id. Similarly, claimant's mental\n\nresidual   functional    capacity    is   an    issue   reserved     to   the\n\nCommissioner.    Id.     On these latter issues, the regulations\n\nspecifically provide that the Commissioner will not give any\n\nspecial significance to the source of the opinion.             Id.    Thus,\n\nin reaching his conclusion as to claimant's residual limitations\n\nstemming from his personality disorder, the ALJ was not required\n\nto give any special weight to the examining sources' opinions.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n     And, in any event, Dr. Ruggiano's testimony (in which he\norally completed a Psychiatric Review Technique Form) is fully\nconsistent with the ALJ's implicit finding that claimant's\npersonality disorder is not of Listing severity. Specifically,\nthe functional limitations stated by Dr. Ruggiano--slight\nrestriction of activities of daily living; moderate difficulties\nin maintaining social functioning; often suffering from\ndeficiencies of concentration, persistence or pace; and repeated\nepisodes of deterioration or decompensation in work or work-like\nsettings--satisfy only one out of the four Paragraph B criteria.\nSee 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subp't P, App. 1, § 12.08(B)(1)-(4). To\nsatisfy the Listing for 12.08, at least three of the Paragraph\nB criteria must be met. Id.\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\f",
