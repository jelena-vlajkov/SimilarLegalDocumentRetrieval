Dynamic Image Technologies, Inc.\n\n(DIT) and Rafael Vega (DIT's principal) sued the United States\n\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346,\n\n2671-2680.           The    district    court      gave   their    claims      careful\n\nconsideration,         but   found     them      wanting.    See    Dynamic      Image\n\nTechnologies, Inc. v. United States, 68 F. Supp. 2d 113 (D.P.R.\n\n1999) (Dynamic II); Dynamic Image Technologies, Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 18 F. Supp. 2d 146 (D.P.R. 1998) (Dynamic I).                          DIT and\n\nVega appeal.         We affirm.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n               We    take    the    plaintiffs'       version      of   the    facts,\n\nconsistent with record support.                  See Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d\n\n343,     347    (1st       Cir.    1993)    (elucidating        summary       judgment\n\nstandard).          In the interests of fairness, however, we report\n\nthat the government disputes many of the facts.\n\n               In mid-1991, the United States Postal Service (USPS)\n\nannounced a set of requirements for obtaining bulk mail pre-sort\n\ndiscounts.          This innovation opened a window of opportunity for\n\ndirect-mail houses and other firms offering mail-processing\n\nservices.           In an attempt to pass through this window, DIT\n\ninvested appreciable time and money in the development of a\n\nsoftware system capable of effecting compliance with the new\n\nrequirements.          In July 1995, the USPS granted its seal of\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fapproval — termed, in an epitomical example of bureaucratic\n\ndoublespeak,     a    coding     accuracy        support   system     quality\n\ncertification (CASSQC) — to DIT's newly-developed software.\n\n           Later that month, the USPS hosted a trade show in San\n\nJuan to enable vendors to present mail-processing products and\n\nsystems to prospective customers.             The USPS's customer service\n\nmanager, Luis Peña, informed those attending the show that no\n\none in Puerto Rico had obtained the certification necessary for\n\npre-sort clearance.       When Vega objected to this misstatement,\n\nPeña ordered his forcible removal from the premises.                Following\n\nthis episode, DIT claims to have suffered a severe erosion of\n\nits customer base.\n\n           A   USPS   representative         subsequently    informed       the\n\nplaintiffs     that   a   new        (and    different)    test     would    be\n\nadministered.    This test bore tangentially, if at all, on the\n\nefficacy of techniques intended to comply with the announced\n\npre-sort   requirements,       and    employed    criteria   that    departed\n\nradically from the CASSQC standard.              Moreover, USPS employees\n\ncontinued to inform DIT's actual and potential customers that it\n\nlacked the proper credentials to obtain pre-sort discounts.\n\n           In response, the plaintiffs filed an administrative\n\nclaim with the USPS alleging negligent misrepresentation, libel,\n\nslander, intentional interference with contractual relations,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fand discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                    They averred, at\n\nsome length, that USPS personnel made false and misleading\n\nstatements      anent      DIT's    certification        status,        disrupted\n\nadvantageous economic relations between DIT and its customers,\n\ndrove DIT out of business, and, in the bargain, discriminated\n\nagainst Vega.       Notably, however, the document — which prayed for\n\n$5,000,000 in damages — did not mention the incident involving\n\nVega's ejection from the trade show.\n\n             When   the   matter    was    not     resolved    administratively\n\nwithin the obligatory six-month waiting period, the plaintiffs\n\nbrought      suit   in   the   United     States    District    Court    for   the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico.            See 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a).               Their\n\ncomplaint mirrored their administrative claim and did not refer\n\nto Vega's confrontation with Peña.               The United States moved to\n\ndismiss and to stay discovery.             The district court granted the\n\nstay.      It later granted the motion to dismiss.               See Dynamic I,\n\n18 F. Supp. 2d at 148.           Taking matters in sequence, the court\n\ninvoked an FTCA exception, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h), to dispose of\n\nthe       misrepresentation,       libel,     slander,        and   contractual\n\ninterference claims.1          See Dynamic I, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 149-51.\n\n\n      1\n     This statutory proviso exempts from the scope of waived\nimmunity \"any claim arising out of assault, battery, false\nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of\nprocess,   libel,   slander,   misrepresentation,  deceit or\ninterference with contract rights.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fThe court found Vega's discrimination claim wanting for several\n\nreasons, including the fact that the United States is not a\n\nproper party defendant in a suit brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nSee Dynamic I, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 151.\n\n              The district court could have stopped there, but it did\n\nnot.       The court believed that the general scenario described by\n\nthe    plaintiffs    arguably   encompassed    claims   for   intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision.            See\n\nid. at 151-52.        Noting that such claims might be permissible\n\nunder the FTCA, the court gave the plaintiffs an opportunity to\n\nfile an amended complaint.2           See id. at 151 (citing Santiago-\n\nRamirez v. Secretary of the Dep't of Defense, 984 F.2d 16, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1993)), 153.       The court cautioned, however, that any\n\namended complaint (a) must be consistent with the notice that\n\nthe plaintiffs previously had provided to the government via\n\ntheir       administrative   claim,    and   (b)   \"should    not   merely\n\nreformulate the contract, slander, libel and misrepresentation\n\nclaims which are dismissed herein because the court does not\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     Because corporations, unlike natural persons, have no\nemotions, they cannot press claims for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress.    See FDIC v. Hulsey, 22 F.3d 1472, 1489\n(10th Cir. 1994). Recognizing this circumstance, the district\ncourt properly limited its references to such a claim to Vega.\nSee Dynamic I, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 151, 153.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fhave       subject   matter    jurisdiction    over   them,    no   matter    how\n\nPlaintiffs dress them up.\"           Id. at 153.\n\n              The    plaintiffs    seized    this   lifeline    and   filed    an\n\namended complaint.           In it, they described for the first time the\n\naltercation that allegedly occurred at the 1995 trade show and\n\nclaimed       that    USPS    hierarchs      negligently   permitted     their\n\nunderlings to arrest Vega without sufficient cause in front of\n\nprospective clients and others.3 Vega also proffered a claim for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, linking that claim\n\nto the same episode.           The United States again moved to dismiss,\n\nasserting both lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure\n\nto state a cognizable claim.              See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1),\n\n12(b)(6).      Because documents dehors the pleadings were presented\n\nto (and considered by) the district court in connection with the\n\nmotion, the court converted the motion into one for summary\n\njudgment.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (providing for conversion\n\nof Rule 12(b)(6) motions).             Emphasizing that the plaintiffs'\n\nadministrative claim failed to mention any facts which would\n\nhave alerted the government to the possibility of litigation\n\n\n\n       3\n     In their amended complaint, their opposition to the\ngovernment's motion to dismiss, and their brief on appeal, the\nplaintiffs refer to this vignette under two rubrics:     false\narrest and false imprisonment. For convenience, we refer only\nto the former — but we use the term in a broad sense that\nencompasses the latter.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fbased on false arrest, the court then ruled that it lacked\n\njurisdiction to entertain the amended complaint.        See Dynamic\n\nII, 68 F. Supp. 2d at 117-18.     This appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n          We note, at the outset, our doubts about the district\n\ncourt's procedural praxis.   As a general matter, trial courts\n\nshould give Rule 12(b)(1) motions precedence.       See Northeast\n\nErectors Ass'n of the BTEA v. Secretary of Labor, 62 F.3d 37, 39\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).   The conversion principle does not apply in\n\nregard to such motions — and for good reason.           The court,\n\nwithout conversion, may consider extrinsic materials and, to the\n\nextent it engages in jurisdictional factfinding, is free to test\n\nthe truthfulness of the plaintiff's allegations.    See Mortensen\n\nv. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 890-91 (3d Cir.\n\n1977).   Thus, the district court's decision to convert the\n\ngovernment's motion to a motion for summary judgment strikes us\n\nas unnecessary.\n\n          Be that as it may, we need not pass definitively on the\n\npropriety of the conversion for two reasons.       First, neither\n\nparty objects to this aspect of the court's ruling, and any\n\nerror is therefore waived.   See Attallah v. United States, 955\n\nF.2d 776, 779 n.3 (1st Cir.1992).     Second, this appeal turns on\n\na purely legal question — one that requires a comparison of the\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fadministrative       claim           with     the        amended     complaint     —    so\n\ncharacterization of the government's motion has no practical\n\neffect.       At   any    rate,        the    plaintiffs       cannot     be    heard   to\n\ncomplain,     inasmuch         as    the     summary      judgment    standard     is   as\n\nfavorable     to   them    as        any   other    that     they    might     reasonably\n\nrequest.      Cf. United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114 n.6\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (using parallel logic to justify application of\n\nRule 12(b)(6) criteria to a standing challenge).                             Thus, we do\n\nnot probe the point more deeply, but, rather, proceed to address\n\nseriatim the stay of discovery and the dismissal of the amended\n\ncomplaint.\n\n                          A.    The Stay of Discovery.\n\n            The plaintiffs asseverate that the district court erred\n\nin denying them the opportunity to conduct discovery before it\n\nadjudicated the government's motion for brevis disposition.\n\nTrial courts have broad discretion in determining the timing of\n\npretrial    discovery,          and    appellate          courts    are   reluctant     to\n\ninterfere unless it clearly appears that a \"discovery order was\n\nplainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the\n\naggrieved party.\"         Mack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d\n\n179, 186 (1st Cir. 1989).                   This discretion obtains where, as\n\nhere,   the    question         is    whether       to    permit     discovery     before\n\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\fdeciding jurisdictional issues.               See Crocker v. Hilton Int'l\n\nBarbados, Ltd., 976 F.2d 797, 801 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            Here, the plaintiffs' \"denial of discovery\" claim fails\n\nfor two reasons.            First, they raise it too late.             When the\n\ngovernment moved to stay discovery in the district court, the\n\nplaintiffs did not file an opposition.              See D.P.R. Local Rule\n\n311.5 (stating that \"[i]f the respondent opposes a motion, he or\n\nshe shall file a response within ten (10) days after service of\n\nthe motion\").         Nor did they present in their opposition to the\n\ndismissal     motion        any   developed    argumentation      as        to     how\n\nadditional discovery might advance their cause.                 Consequently,\n\nthey forfeited the point.            See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d\n\n27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party\n\nhas not presented an argument to the district court, she may not\n\nunveil it in the court of appeals.\"); see also Sunview Condo.\n\nAss'n v. Flexel Int'l, Ltd., 116 F.3d 962, 964 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(holding that plaintiffs who fail to preserve their rights below\n\ncannot appeal on the ground that they were denied jurisdictional\n\ndiscovery).\n\n            In       all   events,   the   plaintiffs    have   not    shown        an\n\nentitlement to pretrial discovery.             Where, as here, a defendant\n\nchallenges       a     court's    jurisdiction,    the    court       has        broad\n\ndiscretion to defer pretrial discovery if the record indicates\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthat discovery is unnecessary (or, at least, is unlikely to be\n\nuseful) in regard to establishing the essential jurisdictional\n\nfacts.       See Noonan v. Winston Co., 135 F.3d 85, 94 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); St. Clair v. City of Chico, 880 F.2d 199, 201-02 (9th\n\nCir. 1989).         Orders staying discovery are particularly difficult\n\nto set aside in actions against the federal government, where\n\nuncontrolled discovery poses a special threat and compelling\n\npublic policy reasons support stringent limitations on discovery\n\npending the resolution of threshold jurisdictional questions.\n\nSee    6    James    Wm.    Moore   et    al.,   Moore's    Federal     Practice    §\n\n26.105[3][c], at 26-269 (3d ed. 2000); cf. Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982) (suggesting that, until threshold\n\nquestion of qualified immunity is settled in a suit against a\n\npublic       official,       unrestricted        discovery     should      not     be\n\npermitted).\n\n               In    this   instance,      the   plaintiffs   never     asked    for\n\njurisdictional discovery, nor have they explained (even at this\n\nlate date) how discovery, if allowed, would bear on the narrow\n\njurisdictional issue that lies on the doorstep of this case.                       On\n\nthis       austere   record,    the      district   court   did   not    abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in staying discovery pending a resolution of the\n\njurisdictional question.\n\n                     B.     The Notice-of-Claim Provision.\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f            We turn now to the merits of the district court's\n\norder.     Viewing that order as a ruling on a motion for summary\n\njudgment, see supra, we afford plenary review.       See Pagano, 983\n\nF.2d at 347.     In fulfilling this responsibility, we interpret\n\nthe record in the light most agreeable to the plaintiffs (the\n\nnon-moving parties) and draw all reasonable inferences in their\n\nfavor.     See id.     Despite this liberal approach, however, we\n\neschew   \"conclusory    allegations,   improbable   inferences,   and\n\nunsupported speculation.\"     Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\n\nCo., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            As a sovereign nation, the United States is immune from\n\nliability except to the extent that it consents to suit.          See\n\nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 304 (1992).      In general,\n\nthe FTCA waives the United States's sovereign immunity for tort\n\nliability, that is, for claims that allege a \"negligent or\n\nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while\n\nacting within the scope of his office or employment, under\n\ncircumstances where the United States, if a private person,\n\nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of\n\nthe place where the act or omission occurred.\"          28 U.S.C. §\n\n1346(b).     But this general waiver is far from an open-ended\n\npanacea for would-be claimants.        For one thing, it must be\n\nstrictly construed.     See Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149,\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f170 (1st Cir. 1988).     For another thing, it is hedged with a\n\nmyriad of exceptions.    See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a)-(h).\n\n         Nor is this all.    Congress has taken pains to establish\n\nan administrative framework that claimants must follow before\n\nthey can sue under the FTCA.     One important component of this\n\nframework is the notice-of-claim provision.          See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2675(a) (stating that \"an action shall not be instituted upon a\n\nclaim against the United States . . . unless the claimant shall\n\nhave first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency\n\nand his claim shall have been finally denied\");            see also 28\n\nC.F.R. § 14.2(a) (1999) (similar).       This appeal requires us to\n\ntest the elasticity of the notice-of-claim protocol.        On the one\n\nhand, the United States maintains that the plaintiffs flouted\n\nthe terms of the statute and must pay the price for their\n\nimpertinence.     On the other hand, the plaintiffs contend that\n\nthey complied sufficiently with the law, and that the lower\n\ncourt raised the statutory bar too high.        The United States has\n\nthe better of the argument.\n\n         We start this portion of our discussion by delineating\n\nwhich causes of action are at issue here.             On appeal, the\n\nplaintiffs have not challenged the district court's dismissal of\n\ntheir original complaint, i.e., the court's rejection of the\n\nplaintiffs'     misrepresentation,     libel,   slander,   contractual\n\n\n                                -13-\n\finterference,      and     discrimination         claims.           With    one\n\ninconsequential    exception,     see     infra   note   5,   they    did   not\n\nattempt either to resurrect or to preserve those claims in their\n\namended complaint.       Thus, they have forgone any opportunity to\n\nrevive them.     See Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9th\n\nCir. 1992) (explaining that \"an amended pleading supersedes the\n\noriginal [which] . . . is treated thereafter as non-existent\")\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).                    For this\n\nreason, we train our sights exclusively on the way in which the\n\nplaintiffs' administrative claim relates (or, more precisely\n\nput, fails to relate) to their amended complaint.\n\n          This court has refused to interpret the notice-of-claim\n\nrequirement woodenly.       We have attempted instead to achieve a\n\nbalance, recognizing that persons wishing to hold the federal\n\nsovereign liable in tort must satisfy the strictures of the law,\n\nbut also recognizing that Congress did not intend to shield the\n\nfederal   fisc    behind    an   impenetrable      thicket     of     lawyerly\n\ntechnicalities.    See Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 19; Lopez v.\n\nUnited States, 758 F.2d 806, 809 (1st Cir. 1985).               The test is\n\nan eminently pragmatic one:         as long as the language of an\n\nadministrative claim serves due notice that the agency should\n\ninvestigate the possibility of particular (potentially tortious)\n\nconduct and includes a specification of the damages sought, it\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\ffulfills the notice-of-claim requirement. See Santiago-Ramirez,\n\n984 F.2d at 20.\n\n          Insofar as the events comprising the alleged false\n\narrest are concerned, the plaintiffs' administrative claim fails\n\nthis test.    Though prolix, that claim did not contain so much as\n\na hint about the alleged false arrest or the incident that\n\nspawned   it.        To   that   extent,      then,       the   amended     complaint\n\nexceeded the scope of the administrative claim.                            See, e.g.,\n\nOrlando Helicopter Airways v. United States, 75 F.3d 622, 625-26\n\n(11th Cir. 1996); Deloria v. Veterans Admin., 927 F.2d 1009,\n\n1011-12   (7th    Cir.      1991).     Because        a    federal    court    cannot\n\nentertain a suit under the FTCA in circumstances in which the\n\nplaintiff has failed to satisfy the administrative notice-of-\n\nclaim requirement, the district court appropriately dismissed\n\nthe false arrest cause of action.4\n\n          The plaintiffs have a fallback position. As they point\n\nout, it may well be possible to find the rudiments of claims for\n\nintentional      infliction      of   emotional       distress       and    negligent\n\nsupervision     in    the   penumbra    of    their       administrative       claim.\n\n\n\n\n    4We hasten to add that, even had the plaintiffs provided\nadequate notice, claims arising out of false arrest and\nimprisonment are not viable under the FTCA.  See 28 U.S.C. §\n2680(h).\n\n                                       -15-\n\fConsequently, those causes of action may appear to stand on a\n\nsomewhat different footing.\n\n           However, appearances can be deceiving.          Cf. Aesop, The\n\nWolf in Sheep's Clothing (circa 550 B.C.).           To the extent that\n\nthe amended complaint advances claims for intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress and negligent supervision, those claims\n\nare inextricably intertwined with the incident involving the\n\nfalse arrest.    In other words, regardless of the labels employed\n\nin the amended complaint, that complaint, in substance, seeks\n\nrecovery based solely on an incident that was not mentioned in\n\nthe plaintiffs' administrative claim.\n\n           That ends the matter.            The short of it is that the\n\nplaintiffs, with one inconsequential exception,5 have not alleged\n\nany injury sustained independent of the false arrest incident.\n\nThe   injuries   for   which   the   plaintiffs    now   seek   to   recover\n\noccurred when Vega was forcibly removed from the convention hall\n\nand humiliated in front of onlookers (including customers and\n\nfamily members).       Calling a false arrest claim by another name\n\nis nothing more than a poorly-disguised effort to achieve by\n\n\n\n      5\n      In addition to alleging false arrest, the amended complaint\nreiterated that USPS's customer service manager misrepresented\nto the plaintiffs' clientele that DIT had not achieved proper\ncertification. These averments lead nowhere, because the claim\nthat they portend is barred by 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h). See Dynamic\nI, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 150.\n\n                                     -16-\n\findirection what cannot be achieved directly.      Courts must guard\n\nzealously against such attempts to circumvent sections 2675(a)\n\nand 2680(h).    See United States v. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 703\n\n(1961).\n\n            We need go no further.6    Since the plaintiffs' amended\n\ncomplaint and their administrative claim did not jibe, the\n\ndistrict court appropriately dismissed the amended complaint for\n\nwant of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    6As the plaintiffs have not alleged any basis for a\nnegligent supervision claim independent of the arrest incident,\nwe need not pass upon the government's assertion that such a\nclaim would be barred by the FTCA's discretionary function\nexception, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a). See generally Irving v. United\nStates, 162 F.3d 154, 162-69 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc)\n(discussing that exception).\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the plaintiffs' version of the facts, consistent with record support.  See Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir. 1993) (elucidating summary judgment standard).  In the interests of fairness, however, we report that the government disputes many of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1991, the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced a set of requirements for obtaining bulk mail pre-sort discounts.  This innovation opened a window of opportunity for direct-mail houses and other firms offering mail-processing services.  In an attempt to pass through this window, DIT invested appreciable time and money in the development of a software system capable of effecting compliance with the new requirements.  In July 1995, the USPS granted its seal of approval -- termed, in an epitomical example of bureaucratic doublespeak, a coding accuracy support system quality certification (CASSQC) -- to DIT's newly-developed software.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, the USPS hosted a trade show in San Juan to enable vendors to present mail-processing products and systems to prospective customers.  The USPS's customer service manager, Luis Pena, informed those attending the show that no one in Puerto Rico had obtained the certification necessary for pre-sort clearance.  When Vega objected to this misstatement, Pena ordered his forcible removal from the premises.  Following this episode, DIT claims to have suffered a severe erosion of its customer base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A USPS representative subsequently informed the plaintiffs that a new (and different) test would be administered. This test bore tangentially, if at all, on the efficacy of techniques intended to comply with the announced pre-sort requirements, and employed criteria that departed radically from the CASSQC standard.  Moreover, USPS employees continued to inform DIT's actual and potential customers that it lacked the proper credentials to obtain pre-sort discounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the plaintiffs filed an administrative claim with the USPS alleging negligent misrepresentation, libel, slander, intentional interference with contractual relations, and discrimination under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  They averred, at some length, that USPS personnel made false and misleading statements anent DIT's certification status, disrupted advantageous economic relations between DIT and its customers, drove DIT out of business, and, in the bargain, discriminated against Vega.  Notably, however, the document -- which prayed for $5,000,000 in damages -- did not mention the incident involving Vega's ejection from the trade show.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the matter was not resolved administratively within the obligatory six-month waiting period, the plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2675(a).  Their complaint mirrored their administrative claim and did not refer to Vega's confrontation with Pena.  The United States moved to dismiss and to stay discovery. The district court granted the stay.  It later granted the motion to dismiss.  See Dynamic I, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 148.  Taking matters in sequence, the court invoked an FTCA exception, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h), to dispose of the misrepresentation, libel, slander, and contractual interference claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See Dynamic I, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 149-51.  The court found Vega's discrimination claim wanting for several reasons, including the fact that the United States is not a proper party defendant in a suit brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. See Dynamic I, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court could have stopped there, but it did not.  The court believed that the general scenario described by the plaintiffs arguably encompassed claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision.  See id. at 151-52.  Noting that such claims might be permissible under the FTCA, the court gave the plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See id. at 151 (citing Santiago-Ramirez v. Secretary of the Dep't of Defense, 984 F.2d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1993)), 153. The court cautioned, however, that any amended complaint (a) must be consistent with the notice that the plaintiffs previously had provided to the government via their administrative claim, and (b) \"should not merely reformulate the contract, slander, libel and misrepresentation claims which are dismissed herein because the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over them, no matter how Plaintiffs dress them up.\"  Id. at 153.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs seized this lifeline and filed an amended complaint.  In it, they described for the first time the altercation that allegedly occurred at the 1995 trade show and claimed that USPS hierarchs negligently permitted their underlings to arrest Vega without sufficient cause in front of prospective clients and others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Vega also proffered a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, linking that claim to the same episode.  The United States again moved to dismiss, asserting both lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a cognizable claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6).  Because documents dehors the pleadings were presented to (and considered by) the district court in connection with the motion, the court converted the motion into one for summary judgment.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (providing for conversion of Rule 12(b)(6) motions). Emphasizing that the plaintiffs' administrative claim failed to mention any facts which would have alerted the government to the possibility of litigation based on false arrest, the court then ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the amended complaint.  See Dynamic II, 68 F. Supp. 2d at 117-18.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, at the outset, our doubts about the district court's procedural praxis.  As a general matter, trial courts should give Rule 12(b)(1) motions precedence.  See Northeast Erectors Ass'n of the BTEA v. Secretary of Labor, 62 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir. 1995).  The conversion principle does not apply in regard to such motions -- and for good reason.  The court, without conversion, may consider extrinsic materials and, to the extent it engages in jurisdictional factfinding, is free to test the truthfulness of the plaintiff's allegations.  See Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 890-91 (3d Cir. 1977). Thus, the district court's decision to convert the government's motion to a motion for summary judgment strikes us as unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Be that as it may, we need not pass definitively on the propriety of the conversion for two reasons.  First, neither party objects to this aspect of the court's ruling, and any error is therefore waived.  See Attallah v. United States, 955 F.2d 776, 779 n.3 (1st Cir.1992).  Second, this appeal turns on a purely legal question -- one that requires a comparison of the administrative claim with the amended complaint -- so characterization of the government's motion has no practical effect.  At any rate, the plaintiffs cannot be heard to complain, inasmuch as the summary judgment standard is as favorable to them as any other that they might reasonably request.  Cf. United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114 n.6 (1st Cir. 1992) (using parallel logic to justify application of Rule 12(b)(6) criteria to a standing challenge). Thus, we do not probe the point more deeply, but, rather, proceed to address seriatim the stay of discovery and the dismissal of the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  The Stay of Discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs asseverate that the district court erred in denying them the opportunity to conduct discovery before it adjudicated the government's motion for brevis disposition.  Trial courts have broad discretion in determining the timing of pretrial discovery, and appellate courts are reluctant to interfere unless it clearly appears that a \"discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"  Mack v.Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir. 1989).  This discretion obtains where, as here, the question is whether to permit discovery before deciding jurisdictional issues.  SeeCrocker v. Hilton Int'l Barbados, Ltd., 976 F.2d 797, 801 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs' \"denial of discovery\" claim fails for two reasons.  First, they raise it too late.  When the government moved to stay discovery in the district court, the plaintiffs did not file an opposition.  See D.P.R. Local Rule 311.5 (stating that \"[i]f the respondent opposes a motion, he or she shall file a response within ten (10) days after service of the motion\").  Nor did they present in their opposition to the dismissal motion any developed argumentation as to how additional discovery might advance their cause.  Consequently, they forfeited the point.  See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"); see also Sunview Condo. Ass'n v. Flexel Int'l, Ltd., 116 F.3d 962, 964 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that plaintiffs who fail to preserve their rights below cannot appeal on the ground that they were denied jurisdictional discovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to pretrial discovery.  Where, as here, a defendant challenges a court's jurisdiction, the court has broad discretion to defer pretrial discovery if the record indicates that discovery is unnecessary (or, at least, is unlikely to be useful) in regard to establishing the essential jurisdictional facts.  See Noonan v.Winston Co., 135 F.3d 85, 94 (1st Cir. 1998); St. Clair v. City of Chico, 880 F.2d 199, 201-02 (9th Cir. 1989).  Orders staying discovery are particularly difficult to set aside in actions against the federal government, where uncontrolled discovery poses a special threat and compelling public policy reasons support stringent limitations on discovery pending the resolution of threshold jurisdictional questions.  See 6 James Wm. Moore et al.,Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 26.105[3][c], at 26-269 (3d ed. 2000);cf. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982) (suggesting that, until threshold question of qualified immunity is settled in a suit against a public official, unrestricted discovery should not be permitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the plaintiffs never asked for jurisdictional discovery, nor have they explained (even at this late date) how discovery, if allowed, would bear on the narrow jurisdictional issue that lies on the doorstep of this case.  On this austere record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in staying discovery pending a resolution of the jurisdictional question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.  The Notice-of-Claim Provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the merits of the district court's order. Viewing that order as a ruling on a motion for summary judgment, see supra, we afford plenary review.  See Pagano, 983 F.2d at 347. In fulfilling this responsibility, we interpret the record in the light most agreeable to the plaintiffs (the non-moving parties) and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.  See id.  Despite this liberal approach, however, we eschew \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"  Medina-Munozv. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a sovereign nation, the United States is immune from liability except to the extent that it consents to suit.  See Molzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 304 (1992).  In general, the FTCA waives the United States's sovereign immunity for tort liability, that is, for claims that allege a \"negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b).  But this general waiver is far from an open-ended panacea for would-be claimants. For one thing, it must be strictly construed.  See Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 170 (1st Cir. 1988).  For another thing, it is hedged with a myriad of exceptions.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a)-(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this all.  Congress has taken pains to establish an administrative framework that claimants must follow before they can sue under the FTCA.  One important component of this framework is the notice-of-claim provision.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2675(a) (stating that \"an action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States . . . unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied\"); see also 28 C.F.R. &#167; 14.2(a) (1999) (similar).  This appeal requires us to test the elasticity of the notice-of-claim protocol.  On the one hand, the United States maintains that the plaintiffs flouted the terms of the statute and must pay the price for their impertinence.  On the other hand, the plaintiffs contend that they complied sufficiently with the law, and that the lower court raised the statutory bar too high.  The United States has the better of the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start this portion of our discussion by delineating which causes of action are at issue here.  On appeal, the plaintiffs have not challenged the district court's dismissal of their original complaint, i.e., the court's rejection of the plaintiffs' misrepresentation, libel, slander, contractual interference, and discrimination claims.  With one inconsequential exception, see infra note 5, they did not attempt either to resurrect or to preserve those claims in their amended complaint. Thus, they have forgone any opportunity to revive them.  See Ferdikv. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9th Cir. 1992) (explaining that \"an amended pleading supersedes the original [which] . . . is treated thereafter as non-existent\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  For this reason, we train our sights exclusively on the way in which the plaintiffs' administrative claim relates (or, more precisely put, fails to relate) to their amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has refused to interpret the notice-of-claim requirement woodenly.  We have attempted instead to achieve a balance, recognizing that persons wishing to hold the federal sovereign liable in tort must satisfy the strictures of the law, but also recognizing that Congress did not intend to shield the federal fisc behind an impenetrable thicket of lawyerly technicalities.  See Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 19; Lopez v. United States, 758 F.2d 806, 809 (1st Cir. 1985).  The test is an eminently pragmatic one:  as long as the language of an administrative claim serves due notice that the agency should investigate the possibility of particular (potentially tortious) conduct and includes a specification of the damages sought, it fulfills the notice-of-claim requirement.  See Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the events comprising the alleged false arrest are concerned, the plaintiffs' administrative claim fails this test.  Though prolix, that claim did not contain so much as a hint about the alleged false arrest or the incident that spawned it.  To that extent, then, the amended complaint exceeded the scope of the administrative claim.  See, e.g., Orlando Helicopter Airways v. United States, 75 F.3d 622, 625-26 (11th Cir. 1996); Deloria  v. Veterans Admin., 927 F.2d 1009, 1011-12 (7th Cir. 1991).  Because a federal court cannot entertain a suit under the FTCA in circumstances in which the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the administrative notice-of-claim requirement, the district court appropriately dismissed the false arrest cause of action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have a fallback position.  As they point out, it may well be possible to find the rudiments of claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision in the penumbra of their administrative claim. Consequently, those causes of action may appear to stand on a somewhat different footing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, appearances can be deceiving.  Cf. Aesop, The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing (circa 550 B.C.).  To the extent that the amended complaint advances claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision, those claims are inextricably intertwined with the incident involving the false arrest.  In other words, regardless of the labels employed in the amended complaint, that complaint, in substance, seeks recovery based solely on an incident that was not mentioned in the plaintiffs' administrative claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  The short of it is that the plaintiffs, with one inconsequential exception,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> have not alleged any injury sustained independent of the false arrest incident.  The injuries for which the plaintiffs now seek to recover occurred when Vega was forcibly removed from the convention hall and humiliated in front of onlookers (including customers and family members). Calling a false arrest claim by another name is nothing more than a poorly-disguised effort to achieve by indirection what cannot be achieved directly.  Courts must guard zealously against such attempts to circumvent sections 2675(a) and 2680(h).  See United States v. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 703 (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Since the plaintiffs' amended complaint and their administrative claim did not jibe, the district court appropriately dismissed the amended complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>      This statutory proviso exempts from the scope of waived immunity \"any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>      Because corporations, unlike natural persons, have no emotions, they cannot press claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the plaintiffs' version of the facts, consistent with record support.  See Pagano v. Frank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597806\"><a href=\"/opinion/597806/michael-pagano-v-anthony-m-frank-postmaster-general-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 347 (1st Cir. 1993) (elucidating summary judgment standard).  In the interests of fairness, however, we report that the government disputes many of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1991, the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced a set of requirements for obtaining bulk mail pre-sort discounts.  This innovation opened a window of opportunity for direct-mail houses and other firms offering mail-processing services.  In an attempt to pass through this window, DIT invested appreciable time and money in the development of a software system capable of effecting compliance with the new requirements.  In July 1995, the USPS granted its seal of approval -- termed, in an epitomical example of bureaucratic doublespeak, a coding accuracy support system quality certification (CASSQC) -- to DIT's newly-developed software.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, the USPS hosted a trade show in San Juan to enable vendors to present mail-processing products and systems to prospective customers.  The USPS's customer service manager, Luis Pena, informed those attending the show that no one in Puerto Rico had obtained the certification necessary for pre-sort clearance.  When Vega objected to this misstatement, Pena ordered his forcible removal from the premises.  Following this episode, DIT claims to have suffered a severe erosion of its customer base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A USPS representative subsequently informed the plaintiffs that a new (and different) test would be administered. This test bore tangentially, if at all, on the efficacy of techniques intended to comply with the announced pre-sort requirements, and employed criteria that departed radically from the CASSQC standard.  Moreover, USPS employees continued to inform DIT's actual and potential customers that it lacked the proper credentials to obtain pre-sort discounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the plaintiffs filed an administrative claim with the USPS alleging negligent misrepresentation, libel, slander, intentional interference with contractual relations, and discrimination under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  They averred, at some length, that USPS personnel made false and misleading statements anent DIT's certification status, disrupted advantageous economic relations between DIT and its customers, drove DIT out of business, and, in the bargain, discriminated against Vega.  Notably, however, the document -- which prayed for $5,000,000 in damages -- did not mention the incident involving Vega's ejection from the trade show.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the matter was not resolved administratively within the obligatory six-month waiting period, the plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2675(a).  Their complaint mirrored their administrative claim and did not refer to Vega's confrontation with Pena.  The United States moved to dismiss and to stay discovery. The district court granted the stay.  It later granted the motion to dismiss.  See Dynamic <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449755\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2449755/dynamic-image-technologies-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>.  Taking matters in sequence, the court invoked an FTCA exception, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h), to dispose of the misrepresentation, libel, slander, and contractual interference claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See Dynamic <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449755\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2449755/dynamic-image-technologies-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">149-51</span></a></span>.  The court found Vega's discrimination claim wanting for several reasons, including the fact that the United States is not a proper party defendant in a suit brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. See Dynamic <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449755\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2449755/dynamic-image-technologies-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court could have stopped there, but it did not.  The court believed that the general scenario described by the plaintiffs arguably encompassed claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449755\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449755/dynamic-image-technologies-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 151-52. </a></span> Noting that such claims might be permissible under the FTCA, the court gave the plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449755\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449755/dynamic-image-technologies-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 151 </a></span>(citing Santiago-Ramirez v. Secretary of the Dep't of Defense, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599017\"><a href=\"/opinion/599017/lynette-santiago-ramirez-v-secretary-of-the-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1993)), 153. The court cautioned, however, that any amended complaint (a) must be consistent with the notice that the plaintiffs previously had provided to the government via their administrative claim, and (b) \"should not merely reformulate the contract, slander, libel and misrepresentation claims which are dismissed herein because the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over them, no matter how Plaintiffs dress them up.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599017\"><a href=\"/opinion/599017/lynette-santiago-ramirez-v-secretary-of-the-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 153.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs seized this lifeline and filed an amended complaint.  In it, they described for the first time the altercation that allegedly occurred at the 1995 trade show and claimed that USPS hierarchs negligently permitted their underlings to arrest Vega without sufficient cause in front of prospective clients and others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Vega also proffered a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, linking that claim to the same episode.  The United States again moved to dismiss, asserting both lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a cognizable claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6).  Because documents dehors the pleadings were presented to (and considered by) the district court in connection with the motion, the court converted the motion into one for summary judgment.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (providing for conversion of Rule 12(b)(6) motions). Emphasizing that the plaintiffs' administrative claim failed to mention any facts which would have alerted the government to the possibility of litigation based on false arrest, the court then ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the amended complaint.  See Dynamic <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2377387\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2377387/vega-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">117-18</span></a></span>.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, at the outset, our doubts about the district court's procedural praxis.  As a general matter, trial courts should give Rule 12(b)(1) motions precedence.  See Northeast Erectors Ass'n of the BTEA v. Secretary of Labor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196246\"><a href=\"/opinion/196246/northeast-erectors-v-dol/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir. 1995).  The conversion principle does not apply in regard to such motions -- and for good reason.  The court, without conversion, may consider extrinsic materials and, to the extent it engages in jurisdictional factfinding, is free to test the truthfulness of the plaintiff's allegations.  See Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343137\"><a href=\"/opinion/343137/bent-e-mortensen-and-lise-lotte-mortensen-his-wife-individually-and-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 890-91 (3d Cir. 1977). Thus, the district court's decision to convert the government's motion to a motion for summary judgment strikes us as unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Be that as it may, we need not pass definitively on the propriety of the conversion for two reasons.  First, neither party objects to this aspect of the court's ruling, and any error is therefore waived.  See Attallah v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577110\"><a href=\"/opinion/577110/elias-attallah-violeta-lajam-de-attallah-and-the-conjugal-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span>, 779 n.3 (1st Cir.1992).  Second, this appeal turns on a purely legal question -- one that requires a comparison of the administrative claim with the amended complaint -- so characterization of the government's motion has no practical effect.  At any rate, the plaintiffs cannot be heard to complain, inasmuch as the summary judgment standard is as favorable to them as any other that they might reasonably request.  Cf. United States v. AVX Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582534\"><a href=\"/opinion/582534/united-states-of-america-v-avx-corporation-national-wildlife-federation/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 114 n.6 (1st Cir. 1992) (using parallel logic to justify application of Rule 12(b)(6) criteria to a standing challenge). Thus, we do not probe the point more deeply, but, rather, proceed to address seriatim the stay of discovery and the dismissal of the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  The Stay of Discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs asseverate that the district court erred in denying them the opportunity to conduct discovery before it adjudicated the government's motion for brevis disposition.  Trial courts have broad discretion in determining the timing of pretrial discovery, and appellate courts are reluctant to interfere unless it clearly appears that a \"discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"  Mack v.Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 186 (1st Cir. 1989).  This discretion obtains where, as here, the question is whether to permit discovery before deciding jurisdictional issues.  SeeCrocker v. Hilton Int'l Barbados, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592074\"><a href=\"/opinion/592074/kimberly-crocker-and-julian-h-crocker-v-the-hilton-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span>, 801 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs' \"denial of discovery\" claim fails for two reasons.  First, they raise it too late.  When the government moved to stay discovery in the district court, the plaintiffs did not file an opposition.  See D.P.R. Local Rule 311.5 (stating that \"[i]f the respondent opposes a motion, he or she shall file a response within ten (10) days after service of the motion\").  Nor did they present in their opposition to the dismissal motion any developed argumentation as to how additional discovery might advance their cause.  Consequently, they forfeited the point.  See United States v. Slade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"); see also Sunview Condo. Ass'n v. Flexel Int'l, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197446\"><a href=\"/opinion/197446/sunview-v-flexel/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span>, 964 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that plaintiffs who fail to preserve their rights below cannot appeal on the ground that they were denied jurisdictional discovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to pretrial discovery.  Where, as here, a defendant challenges a court's jurisdiction, the court has broad discretion to defer pretrial discovery if the record indicates that discovery is unnecessary (or, at least, is unlikely to be useful) in regard to establishing the essential jurisdictional facts.  See Noonan v.Winston Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751216\"><a href=\"/opinion/751216/george-f-noonan-and-ann-marie-noonan-v-the-winston-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir. 1998); St. Clair v. City of Chico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526528\"><a href=\"/opinion/526528/william-st-clair-john-shelton-v-city-of-chico-county-of-butte/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 201-02 (9th Cir. 1989).  Orders staying discovery are particularly difficult to set aside in actions against the federal government, where uncontrolled discovery poses a special threat and compelling public policy reasons support stringent limitations on discovery pending the resolution of threshold jurisdictional questions.  See 6 James Wm. Moore et al.,Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 26.105[3][c], at 26-269 (3d ed. 2000);cf. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818 (1982) (suggesting that, until threshold question of qualified immunity is settled in a suit against a public official, unrestricted discovery should not be permitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the plaintiffs never asked for jurisdictional discovery, nor have they explained (even at this late date) how discovery, if allowed, would bear on the narrow jurisdictional issue that lies on the doorstep of this case.  On this austere record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in staying discovery pending a resolution of the jurisdictional question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

See Molzof v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112676\"><a href=\"/opinion/112676/molzof-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 304 (1992).  In general, the FTCA waives the United States's sovereign immunity for tort liability, that is, for claims that allege a \"negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b).  But this general waiver is far from an open-ended panacea for would-be claimants. For one thing, it must be strictly construed.  See Reilly v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515719\"><a href=\"/opinion/515719/donna-reilly-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 170 (1st Cir. 1988).  For another thing, it is hedged with a myriad of exceptions.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a)-(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this all.  Congress has taken pains to establish an administrative framework that claimants must follow before they can sue under the FTCA.  One important component of this framework is the notice-of-claim provision.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2675(a) (stating that \"an action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States . . . unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied\"); see also 28 C.F.R. &#167; 14.2(a) (1999) (similar).  This appeal requires us to test the elasticity of the notice-of-claim protocol.  On the one hand, the United States maintains that the plaintiffs flouted the terms of the statute and must pay the price for their impertinence.  On the other hand, the plaintiffs contend that they complied sufficiently with the law, and that the lower court raised the statutory bar too high.  The United States has the better of the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start this portion of our discussion by delineating which causes of action are at issue here.  On appeal, the plaintiffs have not challenged the district court's dismissal of their original complaint, i.e., the court's rejection of the plaintiffs' misrepresentation, libel, slander, contractual interference, and discrimination claims.  With one inconsequential exception, see infra note 5, they did not attempt either to resurrect or to preserve those claims in their amended complaint. Thus, they have forgone any opportunity to revive them.  See Ferdikv. Bonzelet, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></span>, 1262 (9th Cir. 1992) (explaining that \"an amended pleading supersedes the original [which] . . . is treated thereafter as non-existent\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  For this reason, we train our sights exclusively on the way in which the plaintiffs' administrative claim relates (or, more precisely put, fails to relate) to their amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has refused to interpret the notice-of-claim requirement woodenly.  We have attempted instead to achieve a balance, recognizing that persons wishing to hold the federal sovereign liable in tort must satisfy the strictures of the law, but also recognizing that Congress did not intend to shield the federal fisc behind an impenetrable thicket of lawyerly technicalities.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599017\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Santiago-Ramirez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/599017/lynette-santiago-ramirez-v-secretary-of-the-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>; Lopez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450375\"><a href=\"/opinion/450375/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 809 (1st Cir. 1985).  The test is an eminently pragmatic one:  as long as the language of an administrative claim serves due notice that the agency should investigate the possibility of particular (potentially tortious) conduct and includes a specification of the damages sought, it fulfills the notice-of-claim requirement.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599017\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Santiago-Ramirez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/599017/lynette-santiago-ramirez-v-secretary-of-the-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the events comprising the alleged false arrest are concerned, the plaintiffs' administrative claim fails this test.  Though prolix, that claim did not contain so much as a hint about the alleged false arrest or the incident that spawned it.  To that extent, then, the amended complaint exceeded the scope of the administrative claim.  See, e.g., Orlando Helicopter Airways v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70681\"><a href=\"/opinion/70681/orlando-helicopter-airways-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 625-26 (11th Cir. 1996); Deloria  v. Veterans Admin., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557253\"><a href=\"/opinion/557253/william-r-deloria-v-veterans-administration-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span>, 1011-12 (7th Cir. 1991).  Because a federal court cannot entertain a suit under the FTCA in circumstances in which the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the administrative notice-of-claim requirement, the district court appropriately dismissed the false arrest cause of action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have a fallback position.  As they point out, it may well be possible to find the rudiments of claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision in the penumbra of their administrative claim. Consequently, those causes of action may appear to stand on a somewhat different footing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, appearances can be deceiving.  Cf. Aesop, The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing (circa 550 B.C.).  To the extent that the amended complaint advances claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision, those claims are inextricably intertwined with the incident involving the false arrest.  In other words, regardless of the labels employed in the amended complaint, that complaint, in substance, seeks recovery based solely on an incident that was not mentioned in the plaintiffs' administrative claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  The short of it is that the plaintiffs, with one inconsequential exception,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> have not alleged any injury sustained independent of the false arrest incident.  The injuries for which the plaintiffs now seek to recover occurred when Vega was forcibly removed from the convention hall and humiliated in front of onlookers (including customers and family members). Calling a false arrest claim by another name is nothing more than a poorly-disguised effort to achieve by indirection what cannot be achieved directly.  Courts must guard zealously against such attempts to circumvent sections 2675(a) and 2680(h).  See United States v. Neustadt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106257\"><a href=\"/opinion/106257/united-states-v-neustadt/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span>, 703 (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Since the plaintiffs' amended complaint and their administrative claim did not jibe, the district court appropriately dismissed the amended complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>      This statutory proviso exempts from the scope of waived immunity \"any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>      Because corporations, unlike natural persons, have no emotions, they cannot press claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Recognizing this circumstance, the district court properly limited its references to such a claim to Vega.

These averments lead nowhere, because the claim that they portend is barred by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).
