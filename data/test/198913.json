HUGHES,\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n         [Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Selya, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Joseph R. Palumbo, Jr. for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Edwin J.\nGale, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 8, 2000\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.      The defendant, Edward Hughes,\n\nwas convicted by a jury on one count of attempted extortion.\n\nAccording to the government, Hughes attempted to extort money\n\nfrom his employer by murdering the company president, Brian\n\nMcCarthy, in Mexico, reporting it as a kidnapping and issuing a\n\nphony ransom demand.   On appeal, Hughes contends that: (1) the\n\nevidence was insufficient to support the conviction; (2) the\n\ngovernment improperly made statements to the jury during closing\n\nargument that were unsupported by the evidence in the record;\n\n(3) the government's failure to produce all of the crime scene\n\nphotographs violated his right to a fair trial; (4) his sentence\n\nwas incorrectly calculated using the guideline for first degree\n\nmurder; and (5) the district court erred in ordering him to pay\n\nrestitution.   Unpersuaded by these arguments, we affirm both the\n\nconviction and the sentence.\n\n                          I.   THE PLOT\n\n          We begin by summarizing the twisted plot, adding more\n\ndetail below as it becomes relevant to the legal analysis.     We\n\nrecite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's\n\nverdict, to the extent consistent with record support.        See\n\nUnited States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 157 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   By the early 1980s, Hughes had earned a reputation as\n\none of the top computer software engineers in America.      After\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fdesigning       complex      computer     systems     for    the   United        States\n\nDepartment of Defense,               Hughes and his close friend, Dennis\n\nToomey,    started     their     own    computer      software     company,       Ocean\n\nSystems.    The two added a third partner, Donald Hastings, and in\n\n1982 the three men sold the company to Analysis & Technology (\"A\n\n& T\"), staying on as A & T employees.                   In 1986, A & T entered\n\ninto a joint business venture with Browne & Sharpe to create\n\nAutomation Software, Inc. (\"ASI\").               Thereafter, Hughes, Toomey,\n\nand Hastings became ASI employees, with Hastings serving as\n\npresident       and   Hughes    as    vice    president.     Hastings         died   the\n\nfollowing year, and the ASI board commenced a search for a new\n\npresident.       The top candidates were Hughes and Brian McCarthy,\n\na new ASI employee in sales and marketing hired by Hastings\n\nshortly    before      his     death.        Although    McCarthy        was    an   ASI\n\nneophyte, significantly younger than Hughes, and lacked Hughes's\n\ntechnical       expertise,      the     board   chose     McCarthy       to     succeed\n\nHastings.       Hughes was upset.         As the sitting vice president, he\n\nbelieved that he should have been offered the job, and he\n\nquestioned        McCarthy's         qualifications         for    the     position.\n\nMoreover,       McCarthy's     vision     for   ASI     clashed    with    Hughes's.\n\nMcCarthy wanted to expand ASI into a large company; Hughes\n\nwanted    ASI    to   remain     small,      employing      only   elite       software\n\ndesigners who would produce high-end programs.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f            In 1992, Hughes resigned as vice president, contracting\n\nto work half time in exchange for two-thirds of his original\n\nsalary.     Thereafter, Hughes spent most of his time in Mexico,\n\ninstalling and servicing computer software for ASI's Mexican\n\ncustomers.       Although Hughes maintained his residence in Rhode\n\nIsland, he purchased a home in Mexico and planned to relocate\n\nthere.     Meanwhile, Hughes persistently complained about the\n\nquality     of       ASI's    software     under        McCarthy's      leadership,\n\noccasionally         even    criticizing        ASI's   software     in    front   of\n\nclients.    Aware of this conduct, McCarthy arranged at a meeting\n\nof ASI's board of directors to terminate Hughes's relationship\n\nwith the company by buying out the remainder of his contract. In\n\nmid-January 1994, McCarthy decided to travel to Mexico to meet\n\nwith Martin Marquez, an ASI sales representative, and to visit\n\nthe Cummins diesel engine plant, an ASI customer located in San\n\nLuis Potosi. While there, McCarthy also planned to tell Hughes\n\nabout     the    board's       decision     to     terminate      his     employment\n\nrelationship with ASI.\n\n            On January 30, Hughes traveled by bus from Florida,\n\nwhere he had been vacationing with his wife, to Laredo, Texas.\n\nHughes later told FBI Special Agent Nicholas Murphy that he was\n\nin no hurry because he did not expect to install the new ASI\n\nequipment       at   the     Chrysler    plant     in   Toluca,    Mexico,     until\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fFebruary 3 or 4. Arriving in Laredo on February 1, Hughes rented\n\na Ford Tempo from the Budget rental agency in Laredo and drove\n\nto Mexico City.       Upon reaching Mexico City, Hughes notified\n\nMarquez that he planned to pick up McCarthy at the Mexico City\n\nairport on Sunday night and that the two of them would drive to\n\nSan Luis Potosi, four hours northwest of Mexico City.                   Marquez\n\nadvised Hughes not to drive, and even volunteered to drive\n\nhimself, but Hughes insisted, saying that he needed to talk to\n\nMcCarthy in private.\n\n           On    Sunday,     February       6,    McCarthy     celebrated      his\n\ndaughter's tenth birthday in Michigan.                    He then boarded an\n\nairplane   to   Mexico     City,    meeting      Hughes   at   the   airport    at\n\napproximately 10:30 p.m.            The two men left the airport in\n\nHughes's rental car and drove northwest toward Queretaro, a city\n\nabout   half    way   between      Mexico    City   and    San   Luis   Potosi.\n\nMcCarthy was never again seen alive.              The next day, February 7,\n\nat approximately 10:00 p.m., the Mexican authorities found his\n\npartially buried body in rubble alongside the Queretaro bypass\n\nhighway.   He had been shot five times.\n\n           On February 7 at 5:15 p.m., Hughes boarded a flight\n\nfrom Mexico City to New York, arriving in New York at 11:00 p.m.\n\nThe next morning, while still in New York, Hughes placed a\n\ntelephone call to Joanne Keaney, ASI's controller.                   He told her\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthat during the drive from the Mexico City airport to San Luis\n\nPotosi, when he and McCarthy had pulled over to the side of the\n\nroad because McCarthy had to relieve himself, they were attacked\n\nby three men.      He said that the assailants threw him into the\n\nback seat of the rental car, ordered him to keep his head down,\n\nand drove the car around for a while before stopping at a house.\n\nIn the house, Hughes said he heard his abductors refer to\n\nMcCarthy in the present tense, thereby implying that McCarthy\n\nwas still alive.        The kidnappers then brought Hughes to the\n\nairport, provided him with his credit card and passport, and\n\nwarned him that they would kill McCarthy if he did not return\n\nwith   one   million   pesos   (about      $325,000)   within    forty-eight\n\nhours.\n\n             Later that morning, when he arrived back at ASI's Rhode\n\nIsland   office,    Hughes     met   with    several   members     of   ASI's\n\nmanagement team.       He recounted the story of the kidnapping and\n\nransom demand. ASI owned executive kidnapping insurance, and the\n\ninsurer promptly hired the Ackerman Group, a Miami-based company\n\nthat     specializes      in     handling       executive       kidnappings.\n\nCollaborating with Emanuel Ackerman, the group devised a plan to\n\nwire the ransom money to Hughes and an ASI vice president,\n\nStephen Logee, in Mexico.            Hughes would then meet with the\n\nkidnappers to make the payment.             Hughes objected to the plan.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fHe proposed instead that the money be given to him directly and\n\nthat he fly alone to Mexico to execute the exchange.             Hughes\n\nrefused to say exactly where the ransom exchange would be,\n\nstating only that he was to contact the kidnappers in a public\n\nplace.    The group decided to follow the Ackerman plan, in part\n\nbecause customs procedures would prevent carrying large sums of\n\ncash across the border.\n\n           Hughes then borrowed a car, explaining that he wanted\n\nto go home to take a shower.            A little while later, Hughes\n\ncalled the office to say that he had decided not to return to\n\nMexico.   After some coaxing, however, Hughes agreed to          travel\n\nto Miami with Logee to meet with Ackerman.             Meanwhile, the\n\nMexican police, who had recovered McCarthy's body the night\n\nbefore, traced a bloody parking ticket found in his shirt pocket\n\nto his company car parked in the Detroit airport.           When Hughes\n\narrived   at   Rhode   Island's   T.F.    Green   airport   later   that\n\nafternoon for his trip to Miami, Logee informed him that the\n\nMexican police had recovered a body believed to be McCarthy's.\n\nHughes, appearing to get sick, immediately left the airport and\n\nrefused to travel to Miami. The next day Hughes called Keaney to\n\nsay that he was resigning from ASI.\n\n           In September 1996, a federal grand jury indicted Hughes\n\nfor attempting to extort money from ASI in violation of the\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fHobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951.1             Following a ten day trial, Hughes\n\nwas convicted by a jury, sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment\n\nand   three      years'   supervised        release,    and    ordered   to   pay\n\nrestitution.        Hughes    now    appeals     from    his    conviction    and\n\nsentence.\n\n                  II. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n            We must evaluate whether the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight     most   favorable    to    the    government,    was    sufficient   to\n\nsupport the jury's verdict--i.e., whether a rational trier of\n\nfact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.          See United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d\n\n1069, 1073 (1st Cir. 1997).           When reviewing for the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence, \"all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government.\"                United States v. Bay\n\nState Ambulance & Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., 874 F.2d 20, 36 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (citation omitted).             The government need not produce\n\ndirect evidence to meet its burden of proof: \"circumstantial\n\nevidence, if it meets all the other criteria of admissibility,\n\n\n\n      1\n     Hughes was prosecuted for homicide in Mexico.       He was\ninitially acquitted, but, as permitted under Mexican law, the\nacquittal was appealed by the public prosecutor. The Mexican\nappellate court reversed, convicting Hughes of murder and\nsentencing him to 19 years imprisonment. Prior to the appellate\ncourt's conviction, Hughes had been released on bail, and at the\ntime of his trial in the United States, Hughes was a fugitive\nfrom the Mexican judicial system.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fis just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be\n\ngiven whatever weight the jury deems it should be given under\n\nthe circumstances within which it unfolds.\"                   United States v.\n\nGamache,    156    F.3d   1,    8   (1st    Cir.   1998).       Moreover,     the\n\ngovernment    \"need   not      present     evidence    that   precludes   every\n\nreasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt\"; the jury is\n\ngenerally    \"at   liberty     to   select    freely    among   a   variety    of\n\nreasonable alternative constructions of the evidence.\"                    United\n\nStates v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 102 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            To affirm Hughes's conviction under the Hobbs Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1951,2 we must find that the evidence was sufficient to\n\npermit a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes\n\nattempted to extort money from ASI.3               Our sufficiency inquiry\n\n\n    2   The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), provides in relevant\npart:\n\n    Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\n    affects commerce or the movement of any article or\n    commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or\n    attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or\n    threatens physical violence to any person or property\n    in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in\n    violation of this section shall be fined under this\n    title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or\n    both.\n\n    3For a conviction under the Hobbs Act, the government must\nalso prove that the extortion \"obstructs, delays, or affects\"\ninterstate commerce.    See 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).     ASI does\nbusiness in several states and Mexico, and Hughes does not\ncontest that an attempt to extort money from ASI would have an\n\n                                      -9-\n\fmust, therefore, focus on whether Hughes killed McCarthy.          If he\n\ndid, the kidnapping story was bogus and his ransom request was\n\nan attempt to extort money from ASI.         Conversely, if Hughes was\n\nan innocent messenger merely conveying the kidnappers' ransom\n\ndemand, he is obviously not guilty of extortion.\n\n              We conclude that there was sufficient circumstantial\n\nevidence to establish that Hughes killed McCarthy and contrived\n\na fallacious kidnapping and ransom story.          First, Hughes was the\n\nlast person seen alive with McCarthy.        McCarthy's body was found\n\non a bypass highway where Hughes and McCarthy were likely to\n\nhave been traveling together on their drive from Mexico City to\n\nSan Luis Potosi.       The autopsy established that the time of death\n\nwas between 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on February 7.                 Thus,\n\nMcCarthy was already dead by the evening of February 7, the time\n\nthat Hughes says the bandits made the ransom demand and took him\n\nto the Mexico City airport.\n\n              Second, Hughes had a motive to kill McCarthy.        There\n\nis no doubt that the relationship between the two men had been\n\nstrained from the time that ASI's board selected McCarthy over\n\nHughes   to    serve   as   company   president.    Hughes   objected   to\n\nMcCarthy's leadership and vision for the company, and frequently\n\n\n\neffect on interstate commerce sufficient to trigger the Hobbs\nAct.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcomplained about McCarthy.           Hughes confessed to his friend\n\nToomey that he feared he would be fired and that ASI would\n\n\"abrogate\" his employment contract.            Hughes's fears were well\n\nfounded.   Prior to traveling to Mexico, McCarthy arranged with\n\nASI's board to terminate Hughes, and he planned to convey the\n\nnews to Hughes during the trip to Mexico.          Of course, the money\n\nHughes   stood   to   recover   as    ransom   provides   an   independent\n\nfinancial motive for the murder.\n\n           Third, Hughes behaved unusually in the days preceding\n\nthe murder in several ways.           Although Hughes did not like to\n\ndrive in Mexico, and virtually never did, he rebuffed Marquez's\n\noffer to drive and decided to rent a car.         Moreover, although he\n\ncould have rented the car in Mexico City, he went to Laredo,\n\nTexas, twelve hours from his destination.            What is normally a\n\ntwelve hour drive from Laredo to Mexico City took Hughes forty-\n\nsix hours to complete.     Hughes told McCarthy's secretary to book\n\nMcCarthy on a late flight into Mexico because Hughes said he\n\nwould be busy all day.      As it turns out, Hughes was not busy at\n\nall. Finally, although Marquez warned him that the roads were\n\nbad and advised him not to drive at night, Hughes decided to\n\npick up McCarthy at the airport at 10:00 p.m. and to drive four\n\nhours to San Luis Potosi, explaining to Marquez that he needed\n\nto talk to McCarthy in private.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f          Fourth, Hughes arrived in the Mexico City airport for\n\na flight home in the late afternoon of February 7, but he did\n\nnot notify anyone about the kidnapping or ransom demand until\n\nthe morning of February 8--almost 15 hours later.     He offered\n\nonly the lame excuse that he did not have his calling card with\n\nhim.\n\n          Fifth, McCarthy's five-thousand-dollar laptop computer\n\nand a car worth over ten thousand dollars were found abandoned.\n\nWhy would bandits, who were allegedly seeking ransom money,\n\nabandon these valuable items?    No good explanation was offered.\n\n          Sixth, the story told by Hughes to Special Agent Murphy\n\nwas full of holes.   Hughes told Murphy that when he arrived in\n\nLaredo on February 1, he considered traveling to Mexico City by\n\nbus.   However, Marquez testified that in January 1994, almost a\n\nmonth earlier, Hughes told him that when McCarthy came to Mexico\n\nhe planned to rent a car in Laredo.      Hughes also told Murphy\n\nthat when he arrived in San Luis Potosi, on his way to Mexico\n\nCity, he tried unsuccessfully to reach Marquez.     Yet, Marquez\n\ntestified that he or some family member was home all day.\n\nHughes said that he slept in his car that night because he could\n\nnot find a hotel, even though San Luis Potosi is a large city\n\nwith many hotels and Hughes had stayed in hotels there on prior\n\noccasions.   Hughes said he awoke at 2:00 a.m. and continued his\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fdrive to Mexico City, arriving at approximately 2:00 p.m.             This\n\nmeans that it took Hughes almost twelve hours to complete the\n\nfour hour drive from San Luis Potosi to             Mexico City.    Hughes\n\nalso stated that the bandits held McCarthy because McCarthy was\n\ndressed in business attire.           Yet, the evidence suggests that\n\nMcCarthy was wearing jeans and boat shoes when he left Detroit\n\nfor Mexico.      Hughes claimed that he was forced to stop several\n\ntimes during the drive because McCarthy complained of some kind\n\nof intestinal infection and needed to relieve himself.                 The\n\nautopsy report, however, showed no sign of intestinal distress,\n\nand McCarthy's wife testified that her husband had not been ill\n\nwhen he left home several hours earlier.\n\n            Seventh, when Hughes met with ASI officers, he was\n\nadamant that he be given the money directly and that he be\n\nallowed   to    return   alone   to   Mexico   to   execute   the   ransom\n\nexchange.      He refused to divulge the precise location where the\n\nransom exchange would take place.         Yet, after the ASI officers\n\ndecided to wire the money to Mexico, and to send Logee to Mexico\n\nto accompany him, Hughes refused to participate in the rescue\n\nplan.\n\n            Finally, and decisively, the FBI recovered cartridge\n\ncasings on Hughes's property in Rhode Island, and the ballistics\n\nexpert testified that these casings were expelled from the same\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fgun that produced the spent cartridge casings recovered at the\n\nscene of the crime in Queretaro.                     Moreover, the expert stated\n\nthat only one gun in the world could have produced the signature\n\nmarkings shared by these casings, explaining that a gun leaves\n\nunique         marks    on   a    spent    shell   casing     somewhat   akin     to   a\n\nfingerprint.           The expert further testified that all the casings\n\nwere       9    mm,    and   that    the    bullet    fragments      recovered    from\n\nMcCarthy's body could have been 9 mm.                    In addition, a salesman\n\nat a Rhode Island gun store testified that in September 1993,\n\nHughes purchased a Sig Sauer 9 mm pistol, and a friend of\n\nHughes's son testified that he had participated in some target\n\nshooting on Hughes's Rhode Island property a short time before\n\nthe murder took place using a gun that resembled the Sig Sauer.\n\nThe evidence, therefore, indicates that the same 9 mm pistol\n\nused       on    Hughes's        Rhode    Island   property    was    used   to   kill\n\nMcCarthy, or, more precisely, that Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer\n\npistol purchased in September 1993 was the murder weapon.4\n\n\n\n       4\n     Hughes also contends that the evidence was insufficient to\nestablish his intent to extort money from ASI because\n\"[a]ssuming arguendo that the defendant for some reason did not\ntruthfully reveal the events of the night of February 6, the\nevidence points at least equally to an intent solely to cover up\nthe events as it does to any intent to actually obtain money\nfrom ASI as 'revenge.'\"    Hughes confuses motive with intent.\nEven if, as Hughes contends, his primary motive was to cover up\nthe murder, he nevertheless intended to carry out the cover up\nscheme by issuing an extortionate demand to ASI.\n\n                                            -14-\n\f         For all of these reasons, we find that the evidence was\n\nsufficient   to   permit    a   rational     jury   to   conclude    beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt that Hughes murdered McCarthy.                Accordingly,\n\nHughes did not innocently transmit to ASI a ransom demand for\n\none million pesos.         Instead, he used the threat of harm to\n\nMcCarthy to extort money from ASI.5\n\n             III. THE GOVERNMENT'S CLOSING ARGUMENT\n\n         Hughes     assails     the    government    for    making   numerous\n\nstatements--nine in all--within its closing argument that were\n\nunsupported by the evidence in the record.6                He demands a new\n\n\n    5 Hughes also contends that the district court omitted an\nessential element of the crime by failing to instruct the jury\nthat it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that ASI was the\nvictim of the attempted extortion.         This contention is\nfrivolous. The court instructed the jury in plain terms that\nthe charge against Hughes was that he \"attempted to obtain money\nfrom Automation Software, Inc. by the wrongful use of fear or\nthreats of violence or violence.\" (Emphasis added.)\n    6Hughes also identifies an additional twenty-seven errors of\nthis kind in an addendum to his brief. With respect to those\nerrors asserted only in the addendum, Hughes has waived his\nargument. It is a \"settled appellate rule that issues adverted\nto in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.\" United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).      Whatever level of\ndevelopment is required to satisfy this standard, it is not met\nby merely cataloguing bare portions of the record in an\naddendum.   Although Local Rule 28(a)(4) provides that the\nappellant must include in an addendum, \"Other items or short\nexcerpts from the record, if any, considered necessary for\nunderstanding the specific issues on appeal,\" inclusion in the\naddendum is no substitute for developed argumentation in the\nbody of the brief. Indeed, allowing a party to use an addendum\nto raise a laundry list of additional issues not individually\n\n                                      -15-\n\ftrial because of these abuses.           Given defense counsel's failure\n\nto       object   to     these   statements   at   trial,   we   review      the\n\nprosecutor's remarks only for plain error.             See United States v.\n\nBey, 188 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1999).                 We will not reverse a\n\nconviction for plain error unless it is clear that, inter alia,\n\nthe error \"affected the outcome of the proceedings.\" Id. (citing\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993)).                   We discern\n\nonly one minor error--and no            plain error--in the prosecutor's\n\nclosing argument.\n\nA.       The Ballistics Expert's Testimony\n\n               Hughes     objects to the prosecution's statement to the\n\njury       that   the     ballistics   expert's    testimony,    \"tells      us,\n\ncircumstantially, that the murder weapon was the Defendant's 9\n\nmm Sig Sauer, the one he bought on September 30th of 1993 from\n\nD    &    L   Shooting    Supplies.\"    Hughes     contends:   (1)    that   the\n\nballistics expert did not identify the type of gun used in the\n\nmurder; (2) that the bullets were as likely to have come from a\n\n.38 caliber as a 9 millimeter; (3) that there was no evidence\n\n\n\naddressed and argued in the brief would all but eviscerate Fed.\nR. App. P. 32(a)(7), which prescribes detailed page limitations\nto which both parties must adhere.      We do not suggest that\nwaiver applies unless every objected-to portion of the record is\nquoted in full in the brief.        Rather we reiterate that,\nirrespective of any material reproduced in an addendum, we will\nonly credit arguments actually developed within the body of the\nbrief.\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthat Hughes had a gun in Mexico; (4) that the presence of the\n\ncartridge casings at the murder scene was not tied to the\n\nbullets recovered from the body; and (5) that there was no proof\n\nthat the bullets from the spent cartridge casings were fired\n\nwhere the cartridge casings were found or that they were fired\n\nfrom Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol.\n\n          Hughes's    objections      disregard    the nature of\n\ncircumstantial   evidence   and    reasonable   inferences   drawn\n\ntherefrom.   The ballistics expert testified that only one gun in\n\nthe world could have produced the markings found on both the\n\ncartridge casings recovered at the scene of the crime and those\n\nfound on Hughes's property in Rhode Island.     As detailed above,\n\nthis evidence permits the inference that the same 9 mm pistol\n\nthat was used on Hughes's Rhode Island property was also used as\n\nthe murder weapon, and that this gun was the Sig Sauer 9 mm\n\npistol that Hughes purchased in September 1993.      Moreover, as\n\ndetailed below, the evidence suggests that the likely reason\n\nthat Hughes drove from Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City just prior\n\nto McCarthy's arrival was to smuggle his pistol into Mexico.\n\nB.   The Trip Across the Mexican Border\n\n          Hughes objects to the prosecutor's statement to the\n\njury that:\n\n          the defendant tells [FBI Special Agent]\n          Murphy that he gets the car from Budget. He\n\n                              -17-\n\f           must have told them that he wasn't going\n           south of Monterey. Why did he have to have a\n           car? He needed a car to get his gun across\n           the border. That's what it boils down to,\n           Ladies and Gentlemen. No magnetometers, no\n           x-rays, lots of places to hide a gun.\n\nThere is ample evidence in the record to support this statement.\n\nHughes told agent Murphy that he rented a car from the Budget\n\nagency in Laredo, Texas.      Because the manager at that agency\n\ntestified that it was company policy not to allow cars to be\n\ndriven south of Monterey, and the agency rented a car to Hughes,\n\nit is reasonable to infer that Hughes said he was not going\n\nsouth of Monterey.\n\n           The evidence also supports an inference that Hughes\n\nrented a car and drove across the border as a means of smuggling\n\na gun into Mexico.   First, on the numerous prior occasions that\n\nHughes visited Mexico on business, he had virtually never rented\n\na car.   Marquez testified that Hughes disliked driving in Mexico\n\nand typically requested that Marquez drive.      Second, there is\n\nsimply no good alternative explanation for Hughes's decision to\n\nrent a car in Laredo, Texas, a twelve hour drive from his final\n\ndestination of Mexico City.    There were rental cars available in\n\nMexico City, including cars from American rental car agencies.\n\nThird, because the evidence suggested that Hughes's 9 mm Sig\n\nSauer pistol ejected the cartridge casings found at the crime\n\nscene in Queretaro, Hughes must have transported a gun into\n\n                                -18-\n\fMexico somehow.              The most plausible explanation is that he\n\ncarried it with him during his drive from Laredo.                     It is common\n\nknowledge that airports have magnetometers and x-ray machines\n\ndesigned to detect concealed weapons.\n\nC.     McCarthy's Late-Night Arrival in Mexico\n\n               Hughes    objects     to     the   prosecutor's      statement     that\n\nHughes \"said [to Sawicke] he was busy that weekend, and he\n\ncouldn't pick up [Brian McCarthy] until at least ten o'clock. .\n\n. . This is the reason.               He wants it dark.          Darkness is the\n\nancient       ally      of    criminals.\"           Hughes   insists       that    the\n\nprosecutor's attempt to show that he was not actually busy on\n\nthat    date    was     misleading        because   the   \"undisputed      evidence\"\n\nindicated that he would have been busy but for the failure of\n\ncertain equipment to be delivered to the Chrysler plant in\n\nToluca.        Moreover, the attribution, \"he wants it dark,\" was\n\nparticularly misleading because it was McCarthy who selected the\n\nevening flight time.            We find no error.\n\n                Sandy Sawicke, McCarthy's secretary, testified that\n\nin a telephone conversation with Hughes, he said that he had a\n\nvery busy schedule that weekend and McCarthy should not arrive\n\nbefore 10:00 Sunday night.                  Although McCarthy had previously\n\nsuggested that he take an evening flight, the 10:00 p.m. arrival\n\ntime    was    scheduled       at   the    behest    of   Hughes,    not   McCarthy.\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\fFurthermore,   the   evidence   established   that   Hughes   was   not\n\nparticularly busy that Sunday, as he had claimed he would be.\n\nAlthough there was some indication that Hughes's work plans may\n\nhave been disrupted by a delayed shipment of ASI equipment to\n\nthe Chrysler plant, the jury was entitled to infer that Hughes's\n\nbusy schedule was a pretext to justify McCarthy's late arrival.\n\nFrom the evidence that Hughes wanted McCarthy to arrive late,\n\nand that Hughes's Sig Sauer was the likely murder weapon, a\n\nreasonable juror could also have inferred that Hughes wanted it\n\ndark during the drive to San Luis Potosi so that he could kill\n\nMcCarthy undetected.\n\nD.   The Queretaro Bypass Highway\n\n          The defendant objects to the prosecutor's following\n\nstatements:\n\n          Let's briefly talk about the murder.     You\n          know that the Defendant picked up Brian\n          McCarthy between ten and eleven in Mexico\n          City.   The Defendant uses the directions\n          provided to him by Martin Marquez to get on\n          the road to Queretaro. Two days earlier, of\n          course, he's had lots and lots of time to go\n          through in daylight and at night to check\n          out any sites he might want to use for\n          killing Brian McCarthy.    And it's late at\n          night, and the evidence is that the\n          Defendant took the Queretaro bypass.\n\n          . . . .\n\n          He had a lot of time, a lot of time to scope\n          out a location where he would kill McCarthy\n          on the way to San Luis Potosi. Against the\n\n                                -20-\n\f           advice of Martin Marquez, he chose to drive\n           that lonely dark road in the middle of the\n           night, when there was just no reason to.\n\nHughes insists that this is a \"prejudicial misstatement of fact\"\n\nbecause there is no evidence that Hughes and McCarthy took the\n\nbypass road around Queretaro, or that Hughes spent time during\n\nthe   previous two days checking out a site to murder McCarthy.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           Marquez testified that Hughes told him he planned to\n\npick up McCarthy at the Mexico City airport and drive to San\n\nLuis Potosi.     The city of Queretaro is on the way from Mexico\n\nCity to San Luis Potosi, about half way between those two\n\ncities, and it would have been logical for Hughes to take the\n\nbypass highway.     There was also ample evidence from which the\n\njury could infer that Hughes spent time during his trip from\n\nLaredo to Mexico City checking out potential murder sites.\n\nSpecial Agent Murphy testified that Hughes told him that he\n\ncrossed the border into Mexico at about 4:00 p.m. on February 1,\n\nand did not arrive in Mexico City until 2:00 p.m. on February 3,\n\nforty-six hours later.       The drive from Laredo to Mexico City\n\nnormally   takes   about   twelve    hours   and   the   route   runs   past\n\nQueretaro.     Thus, Hughes had plenty of unaccounted-for time in\n\nthe area of the murder.     Finally, because Marquez testified that\n\nhe told Hughes that the roads between Queretaro and San Luis\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fPotosi were under construction and dangerous, and he advised\n\nHughes against driving at night, the prosecutor's statement to\n\nthat effect was accurate.\n\nE.   The Murder Site\n\n          Hughes objects to these statements of the prosecutor:\n\n          Let me ask you, Ladies and Gentlemen, an\n          ideal place to kill Brian McCarthy, but why\n          would bandits select that site?          The\n          evidence suggests they wouldn't, and this is\n          why. You will recall that Hughes tells us\n          that once they're attacked, they're put in\n          the car and driven around for some length of\n          time. This is a toll road, and to get off\n          this road, you have to go through another\n          toll. What bandits. What bandit is going\n          to drive through a toll booth, where there's\n          evidence there are police with Mr. Hughes in\n          the back seat as a hostage?\n\n          . . . .\n\n          No Robber is going to work off that toll\n          road.   Why? . . . [T]here's a toll booth\n          just before you get on it. . . . [L]ikewise,\n          . . . there's a toll booth just before you\n          get off.\n\nHughes   argues     that    \"[t]here     is     no    evidence,     expert,\n\ncircumstantial, or otherwise, that McCarthy was killed at the\n\nplace that he was found.      There is no evidence that the accused\n\nwas ever on that toll road.       There is no evidence that anyone\n\nhad to drive through 'another toll.'\" (Emphasis in original.)\n\n          Absent    any    evidence    that    the   body   was   moved    or\n\ntransported,   it   was    appropriate   for    a    jury   to   infer   that\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fMcCarthy was killed where he was found, particularly when the\n\nshell casings were found near the body and a trail of blood led\n\nfrom the roadside to a shallow grave in which the body was\n\nburied.     As discussed above, there was circumstantial evidence\n\nthat Hughes and McCarthy drove on the bypass highway.                     There was\n\nalso evidence that the bypass was a toll road with at least one\n\ntollbooth, and that it is common practice in Mexico for police\n\nor military officers to be stationed at tollbooths.                           Hence,\n\nthere    was    some    basis    in   the   evidence    for      the   government's\n\nexplanation       of    why    kidnappers    would    be    unlikely     to   abduct\n\nsomeone on the bypass highway.\n\n               To the extent, however, that the government's statement\n\nemphasized the existence of a second toll booth through which\n\nthe bandits would have had to pass after the abduction, there\n\nwas    an   insufficient        evidentiary     basis      for   that    assertion.\n\nIndeed, FBI Special Agent Gilbert Contreras testified that he\n\ndid not think that there was a second toll booth in place at the\n\ntime of the killing.             We readily conclude, nonetheless, that\n\nthis    misstatement,           in    the   context        of    the    substantial\n\ncircumstantial evidence supporting the jury's verdict, did not\n\nprejudice Hughes, and therefore, did not constitute plain error.\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d 1148, 1153-54\n\n(1st    Cir.    1991)    (no    plain   error   where      improper     remarks   in\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fgovernment's closing statement did not effect the outcome of the\n\ntrial given the strength of the government's case against the\n\ndefendant).\n\nF.   The Leatherman Tool\n\n          Hughes complains that \"twice, the prosecutor misstated\n\nthe evidence about the Leatherman tool to inflame the jury.\"\n\nDuring closing argument, the prosecution suggested that Hughes's\n\ndescription of the kidnappers patting him down did not square\n\nwith the fact that he arrived back in the United States carrying\n\nthe Leatherman tool--a device with several sharp knives--in his\n\ncanvas bag.    Moreover, the government argued that because Hughes\n\nrealized this inconsistency in his story, he eagerly sought to\n\nretrieve the bag from the FBI.    Again, we find the government's\n\nreasoning valid.\n\n          The Leatherman tool was considered dangerous enough\n\nthat it was confiscated by a flight attendant during Hughes's\n\nreturn trip to the United States from Mexico;   Hughes told agent\n\nMurphy that the bandits had patted him down; and Hughes did\n\nappear especially eager to retrieve the canvas bag, telephoning\n\nLoraine Bertolini, in whose car he had left it, to ask her to\n\nget the bag back from the FBI because it had \"sentimental value\"\n\nto his wife.\n\nG.   The Tire Tracks\n\n\n                                -24-\n\f            According to Hughes, it was a \"raw abuse\" of power for\n\nthe government to tell the jury that \"the tire tracks are not\n\npart of the case.\"        Once again, Hughes's complaint misses the\n\nmark.   Although a crime scene investigator for the Mexican\n\ngovernment    testified    that   he   had    noted    tire   tracks   by    the\n\nroadside,    the   significance        of    this     evidence   was   fairly\n\ndebatable.    Hughes presented a witness who testified that the\n\nfactory tires on the Ford Tempo he rented were slightly wider\n\nthan the tracks measured at the crime scene.             Hughes argued that\n\nthe rental car probably had factory tires because it was new,\n\nand the discrepancy in the measurements proved that Hughes's\n\nrental car did not make the tracks found at the crime scene.\n\nUpon cross-examination, however, Hughes's witness admitted that\n\nhe had never measured the imprint that such a tire would make in\n\nsand, the surface at the crime scene, and that he did not know\n\nwhat make of tire was actually on the car that Hughes drove.\n\nAccordingly, the government was entitled to argue that the tire\n\ntrack evidence was insignificant, although, as always, the jury\n\nwas free to adopt a different interpretation of the evidence.\n\n             IV. THE MISSING CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS\n\n            Roberto Gonzalez Moreno, a Mexican police officer, took\n\nthirty-seven photographs of the crime scene, some of which were\n\napparently used during Hughes's murder trial in Mexico.                     Only\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fnine of these photographs, however, made their way to the United\n\nStates Attorney's Office for use in the trial.                  One of these\n\nnine photographs depicted one of the two cartridge casings\n\nrecovered    from   the   crime   scene.      Hughes    insists      that     this\n\nphotograph was exculpatory because the cartridge casing depicted\n\nin the photograph differed in color from the actual cartridge\n\ncasing that the government introduced in evidence.                    Among the\n\nmissing photographs was one that depicted the second cartridge\n\ncasing recovered at the crime scene.             Extrapolating from the\n\nputatively    exculpatory    value    of   the    picture      of    the     first\n\ncartridge casing, Hughes contends that this missing photograph\n\nwould likely have proven exculpatory as well.                   Thus, Hughes\n\nargued to the court at trial that the government's failure to\n\nproduce the photograph of the second cartridge casing required\n\nthe court to exclude both of the actual cartridge casings from\n\nevidence.7\n\n            The district court rejected this argument, concluding\n\nthat the government was under no obligation to produce the\n\nmissing     photographs     because    they      were    not        within    the\n\n\n     7In addition to his objections based on the missing\nphotographs,   Hughes   vigorously   contested   at  trial   the\nauthenticity of the shell casings and the bullet fragments. The\ncourt focused considerable attention on this issue before ruling\nthat the casings and the fragments had been properly\nauthenticated and were admissible as evidence. Hughes does not\nchallenge these evidentiary rulings on appeal.\n\n                                   -26-\n\fgovernment's control.              Moreover, despite Hughes's insistence\n\nthat       the    photograph   of     the   first     cartridge    casing   was\n\nexculpatory, the court found \"the color of the casing in that\n\nphotograph . . . to be the same as the casing the government\n\nintends      to    offer,\"   and    concluded,   \"I   fail   to   see   anything\n\nexculpatory about it.\"\n\n                 In affirming the district court's ruling, we need not\n\ninquire into the potential exculpatory value of the missing\n\nphotographs.         Because the government was never in control of the\n\nphotographs, it is not responsible for any failure to produce\n\nthem. See United States v. Friedman, 593 F.2d 109, 119-20 (9th\n\nCir. 1979) (evidence that was in Chile was not within the\n\ncontrol of the government for the purposes of Brady or Rule 16);\n\nUnited States v. Flores, 540 F.2d 432, 437-38 (9th Cir. 1976).\n\nIt is axiomatic that the government must provide the criminal\n\ndefendant with access to material exculpatory evidence within\n\nits control, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C),8 and the government may not\n\nin bad faith fail to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence,\n\n\n\n       8\n     Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(C) provides in\nrelevant part: \"Upon request of the defendant the government\nshall permit the defendant to inspect . . . photographs . . .\nwhich are within the possession, custody or control of the\ngovernment, and which are material to the preparation of the\ndefendant's defense . . . .\"\n\n                                       -27-\n\fsee Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988).                       However, the\n\ngovernment      has    no    duty     to   produce     evidence       outside    of   its\n\ncontrol, see United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1179 (1st\n\nCir. 1993), and it is not responsible for the preservation of\n\nevidence that was never in its control in the first place, see\n\nUnited States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1340 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990, 993 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            Although the government obviously did not have physical\n\npossession       or    custody      of     the     missing    photographs,       Hughes\n\ncontends that its inadequate efforts to secure the missing\n\nphotographs from Mexico belied its ability to control them.\n\nThis    argument      is    unavailing.          As   the    district    court    aptly\n\nexplained, \"Mexico is a sovereign nation, and it's clear that\n\nthe United States Government has no authority to require the\n\nMexican Government to produce any evidence that may be in its\n\npossession or under its control.                   It has to rely on the Mexican\n\ngovernment to comply with reasonable and appropriate requests.\"\n\n            The government's persistent, but fruitless, efforts to\n\nobtain the missing photographs demonstrate its lack of control\n\nover    them.         In    December       1997,    the     United    States    Justice\n\nDepartment requested in writing that the Mexican government\n\nproduce    all \"sketches and photographs of the crime scene\"; in\n\nearly    1998,     FBI      Special      Agent     Jimmy     Garcia    asked    Mexican\n\n\n                                            -28-\n\fofficials several times to turn over all evidence in the case,\n\nonly to be told that such evidence could not be relinquished\n\nbecause it was still under review; eight days before trial,\n\nAgent Garcia asked an official in the Mexico Attorney General's\n\noffice to contact several Queretaro justice officials to help\n\nobtain the missing photographs, only to be told that all of the\n\nevidence had already been turned over to the U.S. government;\n\none week before trial Agent Garcia asked each of the Mexican\n\nofficials who were to testify as government witnesses about the\n\nphotographs in hopes of locating them; and during trial, the\n\nFBI's Legate Office in Mexico made yet another request of the\n\nMexican government to search for the missing photographs.   Like\n\nthe district court, we wonder \"what else the United States\n\nGovernment could have reasonably done under the circumstances.\"\n\n    V. THE SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER\n\n         Sentencing guideline § 2B3.2 sets the base offense\n\nlevel for extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951.   Section\n\n2B3.2 contains a cross-reference provision, § 2B3.2(c)(1), which\n\napplies when the extortion scheme results in a murder that\n\noccurs outside the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States.   In particular, § 2B3.2(c)(1) states:\n\n         If a victim was killed under circumstances\n         that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C.\n         § 1111 had such killing taken place within\n         the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of\n\n                              -29-\n\f              the United States,       apply    §    2A1.1     (First\n              Degree Murder).\n\nGuideline § 2A1.1, in turn, describes the punishment for first\n\ndegree murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1111.                   Section 2A1.1\n\nsets a base offense level of 43, which translates into life\n\nimprisonment pursuant to the sentencing table in the guidelines.\n\n              The district court sentenced Hughes to twenty years'\n\nimprisonment.         It arrived at this sentence by applying the\n\nguideline for first degree murder, § 2A1.1, after determining\n\nthat       Hughes's   extortion   scheme     resulted     in    the     murder   of\n\nMcCarthy outside the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States, and thus triggered the cross-reference found in\n\n§ 2B3.2(c)(1).        Pursuant to § 2A1.1's base offense level of 43,\n\nthe    district       court   would   have    sentenced        Hughes    to   life\n\nimprisonment, but 18 U.S.C. § 1951 sets the maximum penalty for\n\nextortion at twenty years' imprisonment.                     See USSG § 5G1.1\n\n(\"Where the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than\n\nthe minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily\n\nauthorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\").\n\n              Hughes argues that the district court erred in applying\n\nthe    §    2B3.2(c)(1)       cross-reference       for   three   reasons:       (A)\n\n§ 2B3.2(c)(1) is superceded by 18 U.S.C. § 1119; (B) there was\n\ninsufficient evidence of first degree murder; and (C) McCarthy\n\nwas not \"a victim\" of the extortion scheme within the meaning of\n\n                                      -30-\n\f§ 2B3.2(c)(1).         Rejecting each of these arguments, we affirm\n\nHughes's sentence.\n\nA.   The Relationship Between § 2B3.2(c)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 1119\n\n            Hughes argues that § 2B3.2(c)(1) is superceded by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1119.         Section 1119 provides that \"[a] person who,\n\nbeing a national of the United States, kills or attempts to kill\n\na national of the United States while such national is outside\n\nthe United States but within the jurisdiction of another country\n\nshall be punished as provided under sections 1111 [murder], 1112\n\n[manslaughter],        and        1113   [attempted    murder/manslaughter].\"\n\nSection    1119    also      contains      the   following    limitation:     \"No\n\nprosecution shall be approved if prosecution has been previously\n\nundertaken by a foreign country for the same conduct.\"                     Hughes\n\ninsists that this limitation prevents calculating his sentence\n\nusing § 2B3.2(c)(1)'s cross-reference to the first degree murder\n\nguideline    because         he    was   previously     prosecuted   for    (and\n\nconvicted of) murder in Mexico.             See supra note 1.      We disagree.\n\n\n\n            By its own terms, the limiting language within § 1119\n\nspeaks    only    of   \"prosecutions,\"           not   sentence   enhancements.\n\nMoreover, although § 1119 prohibits prosecuting a defendant for\n\nmurder \"as provided under section[] 1111,\" Hughes was not being\n\nprosecuted or punished for murder in violation of § 1111, but\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\ffor extortion in violation of § 1951.              If Hughes had been\n\nprosecuted and punished for murder, he would have received the\n\ndeath penalty or life imprisonment, see 18 U.S.C. § 1111, not\n\ntwenty years' imprisonment, the statutory maximum for extortion.\n\n\n\n            It is well-established that a defendant's sentence may\n\nbe enhanced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines for conduct\n\nunderlying a prior prosecution, conviction, and punishment.              As\n\nthe Supreme Court explained in Witte:\n\n            To the extent that the Guidelines aggravate\n            punishment for related conduct outside the\n            elements of the crime on the theory that\n            such conduct bears upon the \"character of\n            the offense,\" the offender is still punished\n            only for the fact that the present offense\n            was carried out in a manner that warrants\n            increased punishment, not for a different\n            offense (which that related conduct may or\n            may not constitute).\n\nWitte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389, 402-03 (1995).                This is\n\ntrue even where, as in this case, the defendant is subject to\n\n\"separate    prosecutions      involving    the   same    or   overlapping\n\n'relevant    conduct'\"   Id.   at   404    (emphasis     added)   (citation\n\nomitted).     The guidelines specifically contemplate multiple\n\nprosecutions for different offenses based on the same conduct.\n\nSee, e.g., USSG § 5G1.3(c).\n\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence of First Degree Murder\n\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\f             Hughes contends that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto   support    the    district    court's    finding    that    he   murdered\n\nMcCarthy within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1111--i.e., that\n\nHughes killed McCarthy with \"malice aforethought.\"                     See 18\n\nU.S.C.   §     1111.      Our     review     \"of   a    sentencing    court's\n\nfact-specific determination of a defendant's role in the offense\n\nis limited to clear error.\"          United States v. Alicea, 204 F.3d\n\n480, 485 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             First degree murder is \"willful, deliberate, malicious,\n\nand premeditated killing.\"          18 U.S.C. § 1111.           Hughes argues\n\nthat the evidence equally supports a finding that he committed\n\nvoluntary manslaughter--i.e., killing \"[u]pon a sudden quarrel\n\nor heat of passion.\"            18 U.S.C. § 1112.          The government,\n\nhowever, presented strong circumstantial evidence that Hughes\n\nplanned to murder McCarthy when they met in Mexico.                    Hughes\n\npurchased a gun, devised a plan to transport it to Mexico,\n\nsurveyed the area of the crime to choose a suitable location to\n\nkill McCarthy, and planned for McCarthy to arrive late at night.\n\nTo sustain a sentencing enhancement, the government need only\n\nprove the relevant facts by a preponderance of the evidence. See\n\nUnited States v. Medina, 167 F.3d 77, 79 (1st Cir. 1999).                  The\n\n\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fdistrict court did not commit clear error in finding that the\n\ngovernment met its burden.9\n\nC.   The Meaning of \"A Victim\" Within § 2B3.2(c)(1)\n\n                Arguing that the district court erred in determining\n\nthat McCarthy was \"a victim\" of the extortion within the meaning\n\nof   §       2B3.2(c)(1),       Hughes   encourages    us   to   read   that   term\n\nnarrowly to require that the \"victim\" be the target of the\n\nextortionate demand. We decline Hughes's invitation, concluding\n\ninstead        that   §   2B3.2(c)(1)      contemplates     that   there     may   be\n\n\"victims\" of an extortion scheme other than the target of the\n\nextortionate demand.\n\n                Application note 7 to § 2B3.2 explains that \"[i]f the\n\noffense involved the threat of death or serious bodily injury to\n\nnumerous victims (e.g., in the case of a plan to derail a\n\npassenger        train     or     poison    consumer   products),       an   upward\n\n\n         9\n     Although the jury's conviction on the extortion charge\nrequired it to find as a factual predicate that Hughes killed\nMcCarthy--i.e., that the two were not victims of a kidnapping\nand ransom scheme as Hughes had claimed--the jury need not have\nconcluded that, as a legal matter, Hughes murdered McCarthy\nwithin the meaning of § 1111--that is, that he killed him with\nmalice aforethought.    Indeed, despite strong circumstantial\nevidence to the contrary, it is possible that the jury concluded\nthat Hughes killed McCarthy without malice and, as such, only\ncommitted manslaughter. See 18 U.S.C. § 1112.       Whatever the\nfactual predicate the jury relied upon to convict Hughes,\nhowever, the evidence supported the sentencing court's finding\nby a preponderance of the evidence that, for the purpose of\napplying the § 2B3.2(c)(1) cross-reference, Hughes's conduct\nconstituted first degree murder.\n\n                                           -34-\n\fdeparture may be warranted.\" (Emphasis added.)                    In this example,\n\nthe train passengers are \"victims\" of the train derailment\n\nextortion scheme even though the extortionate demand is not made\n\nof the passengers themselves.             Likewise, because Hughes's plan\n\nto extort money from ASI included killing McCarthy, McCarthy was\n\na    victim    of   the   extortion     scheme     even   though     Hughes    never\n\ndemanded that McCarthy pay him any money.\n\n              Additional support for this conclusion comes from the\n\ntext of § 2B3.2.          Section 2B3.2(b)(2) adds levels to the base\n\noffense level for excessive \"loss to the victim.\"                      There, the\n\nuse of the definite article “the” to indicate a narrower class\n\nof    \"victims\"      makes    sense    because     only     the    target    of   the\n\nextortionate demand will suffer a financial \"loss\" as a result\n\nof    the     extortion      scheme.      Section     2B3.2(c)(1)       uses      the\n\nindefinite article, referring the sentencing court to the first-\n\ndegree      murder    guideline       \"[i]f    a   victim    was    killed     under\n\ncircumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1111.\"      In contrast to § 2B3.3(b)(2), the use of the indefinite\n\narticle suggests a class of potential victims broader than the\n\ntarget or targets of the extortionate demand.\n\n              There are many precedents for a similar construction\n\nof the term \"victim\" in other guidelines sections.                      The Fifth\n\nCircuit concluded that a person killed in the aftermath of a\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\fbank robbery, though not the target of the robbery itself, was\n\n\"a victim\" within the meaning of § 2B3.1(c)(1).                        See United\n\nStates     v.    Harris,     104   F.3d    1465,    1474-75     (5th   Cir.     1997)\n\n(construing        a     cross-reference         provision    identical       to     §\n\n2B3.2(c)(1)).          Other courts have declined to construe the term\n\n\"victim\"        narrowly,    except    where     the   guidelines      employ      the\n\ndefinite article.            See United States v. Sickinger, 179 F.3d\n\n1091, 1094 (8th Cir. 1999) (emphasizing that \"increases based on\n\ninjury     to     'the      victim'    under       sentencing     guideline        for\n\nkidnapping,        abduction,      unlawful        restraint,    §     2A4.1,      are\n\npredicated on the risk to a single intended individual,\" and\n\ndistinguishing \"the victim\" from the phrase \"any victim\" found\n\nin   the    robbery       guideline)      (internal     quotation       marks      and\n\ncitations omitted) (emphasis added); United States v. Malpeso,\n\n115 F.3d 155, 170 (2d Cir. 1997) (under assault-with-intent-to-\n\ncommit-murder guideline, § 2A2.1(b)(1), holding that phrase \"the\n\nvictim\" refers only to a single intended victim of assault, and\n\ndistinguishing provisions that employ the phrase \"any victim\");\n\nUnited States v. Sherwood, 98 F.3d 402, 412-13 (9th Cir. 1996)\n\n(under USSG § 5K2.8, the kidnapped child, not just the father\n\nwho was the target of the extortionate demand, was a \"victim.\");\n\nUnited States v. Muhammmad, 948 F.2d 1449, 1456 (6th Cir. 1991)\n\n(under robbery guideline, § 2B3.1(b)(3), adjustment referring to\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\f\"any    victim\"   covered     bystander      injured    during     bank   robbery\n\ndespite defense argument that only the bank was the victim of\n\nthe offense); United States v.

THE RESTITUTION ORDER\n\n            The district court also ordered that Hughes \"pay full\n\nrestitution to the Hartford Insurance Company\" in an amount of\n\n$123,100, plus additional amounts paid by the insurance company\n\nto   McCarthy's    widow    until    Hughes    is     released     from   prison.\n\nHughes argues that the district court's order to pay restitution\n\n\n\n       10\n      We note that the district court indicated that even if the\ncross-reference provision of § 2B3.2(c)(1) did not apply, it\nwould have sentenced Hughes to twenty years' imprisonment. The\ncourt explained:\n\n       [T]he murder here is relevant conduct that takes this\n       case outside of the Heartland of the run of the mill\n       extortion case and therefore would be ample grounds\n       for an upward departure. . . . [I] don't think it is\n       debatable that the court should go to, at least, to\n       level thirty-seven which would trigger the twenty year\n       maximum sentence under the statute.\n\n                                      -37-\n\fwas \"fatally flawed\" because it failed to take into account his\n\ninability to pay.      We disagree.\n\n           \"We have repeatedly pointed out that the provision\n\naddressing restitution, [the former] 18 U.S.C. § 3664(a) (1994),\n\ndoes not require an explicit finding that the defendant has the\n\nability    to   pay   the    restitution     ordered.       Rather,    it     is\n\nsufficient if the record on appeal reveals that the judge made\n\nimplicit    findings        or   otherwise     adequately     evinced        his\n\nconsideration of those factors.\"11          United States v.

According to the government, Hughes attempted to extort money from his employer by murdering the company president, Brian McCarthy, in Mexico, reporting it as a kidnapping and issuing a phony ransom demand. On appeal, Hughes contends that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction; (2) the government improperly made statements to the jury during closing argument that were unsupported by the evidence in the record; (3) the government's failure to produce all of the crime scene photographs violated his right to a fair trial; (4) his sentence was incorrectly calculated using the guideline for first degree murder; and (5) the district court erred in ordering him to pay restitution. Unpersuaded by these arguments, we affirm both the conviction and the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE PLOT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by summarizing the twisted plot, adding more detail below as it becomes relevant to the legal analysis. We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, to the extent consistent with record support. See United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 157 (1st Cir. 1999). By the early 1980s, Hughes had earned a reputation as one of the top computer software engineers in America. After designing complex computer systems for the United States Department of Defense, Hughes and his close friend, Dennis Toomey, started their own computer software company, Ocean Systems. The two added a third partner, Donald Hastings, and in 1982 the three men sold the company to Analysis &amp; Technology (\"A &amp; T\"), staying on as A &amp; T employees. In 1986, A &amp; T entered into a joint business venture with Browne &amp; Sharpe to create Automation Software, Inc. (\"ASI\"). Thereafter, Hughes, Toomey, and Hastings became ASI employees, with Hastings serving as president and Hughes as vice president. Hastings died the following year, and the ASI board commenced a search for a new president. The top candidates were Hughes and Brian McCarthy, a new ASI employee in sales and marketing hired by Hastings shortly before his death. Although McCarthy was an ASI neophyte, significantly younger than Hughes, and lacked Hughes's technical expertise, the board chose McCarthy to succeed Hastings. Hughes was upset. As the sitting vice president, he believed that he should have been offered the job, and he questioned McCarthy's qualifications for the position. Moreover, McCarthy's vision for ASI clashed with Hughes's. McCarthy wanted to expand ASI into a large company; Hughes wanted ASI to remain small, employing only elite software designers who would produce high-end programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Hughes resigned as vice president, contracting to work half time in exchange for two-thirds of his original salary. Thereafter, Hughes spent most of his time in Mexico, installing and servicing computer software for ASI's Mexican customers. Although Hughes maintained his residence in Rhode Island, he purchased a home in Mexico and planned to relocate there. Meanwhile, Hughes persistently complained about the quality of ASI's software under McCarthy's leadership, occasionally even criticizing ASI's software in front of clients. Aware of this conduct, McCarthy arranged at a meeting of ASI's board of directors to terminate Hughes's relationship with the company by buying out the remainder of his contract. In mid-January 1994, McCarthy decided to travel to Mexico to meet with Martin Marquez, an ASI sales representative, and to visit the Cummins diesel engine plant, an ASI customer located in San Luis Potosi. While there, McCarthy also planned to tell Hughes about the board's decision to terminate his employment relationship with ASI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, Hughes traveled by bus from Florida, where he had been vacationing with his wife, to Laredo, Texas. Hughes later told FBI Special Agent Nicholas Murphy that he was in no hurry because he did not expect to install the new ASI equipment at the Chrysler plant in Toluca, Mexico, until February 3 or 4. Arriving in Laredo on February 1, Hughes rented a Ford Tempo from the Budget rental agency in Laredo and drove to Mexico City. Upon reaching Mexico City, Hughes notified Marquez that he planned to pick up McCarthy at the Mexico City airport on Sunday night and that the two of them would drive to San Luis Potosi, four hours northwest of Mexico City. Marquez advised Hughes not to drive, and even volunteered to drive himself, but Hughes insisted, saying that he needed to talk to McCarthy in private.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Sunday, February 6, McCarthy celebrated his daughter's tenth birthday in Michigan. He then boarded an airplane to Mexico City, meeting Hughes at the airport at approximately 10:30 p.m. The two men left the airport in Hughes's rental car and drove northwest toward Queretaro, a city about half way between Mexico City and San Luis Potosi. McCarthy was never again seen alive. The next day, February 7, at approximately 10:00 p.m., the Mexican authorities found his partially buried body in rubble alongside the Queretaro bypass highway. He had been shot five times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7 at 5:15 p.m., Hughes boarded a flight from Mexico City to New York, arriving in New York at 11:00 p.m. The next morning, while still in New York, Hughes placed a telephone call to Joanne Keaney, ASI's controller. He told her that during the drive from the Mexico City airport to San Luis Potosi, when he and McCarthy had pulled over to the side of the road because McCarthy had to relieve himself, they were attacked by three men. He said that the assailants threw him into the back seat of the rental car, ordered him to keep his head down, and drove the car around for a while before stopping at a house. In the house, Hughes said he heard his abductors refer to McCarthy in the present tense, thereby implying that McCarthy was still alive. The kidnappers then brought Hughes to the airport, provided him with his credit card and passport, and warned him that they would kill McCarthy if he did not return with one million pesos (about $325,000) within forty-eight hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that morning, when he arrived back at ASI's Rhode Island office, Hughes met with several members of ASI's management team. He recounted the story of the kidnapping and ransom demand. ASI owned executive kidnapping insurance, and the insurer promptly hired the Ackerman Group, a Miami-based company that specializes in handling executive kidnappings. Collaborating with Emanuel Ackerman, the group devised a plan to wire the ransom money to Hughes and an ASI vice president, Stephen Logee, in Mexico. Hughes would then meet with the kidnappers to make the payment. Hughes objected to the plan. He proposed instead that the money be given to him directly and that he fly alone to Mexico to execute the exchange. Hughes refused to say exactly where the ransom exchange would be, stating only that he was to contact the kidnappers in a public place. The group decided to follow the Ackerman plan, in part because customs procedures would prevent carrying large sums of cash across the border.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes then borrowed a car, explaining that he wanted to go home to take a shower. A little while later, Hughes called the office to say that he had decided not to return to Mexico. After some coaxing, however, Hughes agreed to travel to Miami with Logee to meet with Ackerman. Meanwhile, the Mexican police, who had recovered McCarthy's body the night before, traced a bloody parking ticket found in his shirt pocket to his company car parked in the Detroit airport. When Hughes arrived at Rhode Island's T.F. Green airport later that afternoon for his trip to Miami, Logee informed him that the Mexican police had recovered a body believed to be McCarthy's. Hughes, appearing to get sick, immediately left the airport and refused to travel to Miami. The next day Hughes called Keaney to say that he was resigning from ASI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1996, a federal grand jury indicted Hughes for attempting to extort money from ASI in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following a ten day trial, Hughes was convicted by a jury, sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment and three years' supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution. Hughes now appeals from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must evaluate whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, was sufficient to support the jury's verdict--i.e., whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1073 (1st Cir. 1997). When reviewing for the sufficiency of the evidence, \"all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the light most favorable to the government.\" United States v. Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., 874 F.2d 20, 36 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation omitted). The government need not produce direct evidence to meet its burden of proof: \"circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of admissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the jury deems it should be given under the circumstances within which it unfolds.\" United States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998). Moreover, the government \"need not present evidence that precludes every reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt\"; the jury is generally \"at liberty to select freely among a variety of reasonable alternative constructions of the evidence.\" United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 102 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To affirm Hughes's conviction under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we must find that the evidence was sufficient to permit a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes attempted to extort money from ASI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Our sufficiency inquiry must, therefore, focus on whether Hughes killed McCarthy. If he did, the kidnapping story was bogus and his ransom request was an attempt to extort money from ASI. Conversely, if Hughes was an innocent messenger merely conveying the kidnappers' ransom demand, he is obviously not guilty of extortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that Hughes killed McCarthy and contrived a fallacious kidnapping and ransom story. First, Hughes was the last person seen alive with McCarthy. McCarthy's body was found on a bypass highway where Hughes and McCarthy were likely to have been traveling together on their drive from Mexico City to San Luis Potosi. The autopsy established that the time of death was between 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on February 7. Thus, McCarthy was already dead by the evening of February 7, the time that Hughes says the bandits made the ransom demand and took him to the Mexico City airport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Hughes had a motive to kill McCarthy. There is no doubt that the relationship between the two men had been strained from the time that ASI's board selected McCarthy over Hughes to serve as company president. Hughes objected to McCarthy's leadership and vision for the company, and frequently complained about McCarthy. Hughes confessed to his friend Toomey that he feared he would be fired and that ASI would \"abrogate\" his employment contract. Hughes's fears were well founded. Prior to traveling to Mexico, McCarthy arranged with ASI's board to terminate Hughes, and he planned to convey the news to Hughes during the trip to Mexico. Of course, the money Hughes stood to recover as ransom provides an independent financial motive for the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Hughes behaved unusually in the days preceding the murder in several ways. Although Hughes did not like to drive in Mexico, and virtually never did, he rebuffed Marquez's offer to drive and decided to rent a car. Moreover, although he could have rented the car in Mexico City, he went to Laredo, Texas, twelve hours from his destination. What is normally a twelve hour drive from Laredo to Mexico City took Hughes forty-six hours to complete. Hughes told McCarthy's secretary to book McCarthy on a late flight into Mexico because Hughes said he would be busy all day. As it turns out, Hughes was not busy at all. Finally, although Marquez warned him that the roads were bad and advised him not to drive at night, Hughes decided to pick up McCarthy at the airport at 10:00 p.m. and to drive four hours to San Luis Potosi, explaining to Marquez that he needed to talk to McCarthy in private.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Hughes arrived in the Mexico City airport for a flight home in the late afternoon of February 7, but he did not notify anyone about the kidnapping or ransom demand until the morning of February 8--almost 15 hours later. He offered only the lame excuse that he did not have his calling card with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, McCarthy's five-thousand-dollar laptop computer and a car worth over ten thousand dollars were found abandoned. Why would bandits, who were allegedly seeking ransom money, abandon these valuable items? No good explanation was offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth, the story told by Hughes to Special Agent Murphy was full of holes. Hughes told Murphy that when he arrived in Laredo on February 1, he considered traveling to Mexico City by bus. However, Marquez testified that in January 1994, almost a month earlier, Hughes told him that when McCarthy came to Mexico he planned to rent a car in Laredo. Hughes also told Murphy that when he arrived in San Luis Potosi, on his way to Mexico City, he tried unsuccessfully to reach Marquez. Yet, Marquez testified that he or some family member was home all day. Hughes said that he slept in his car that night because he could not find a hotel, even though San Luis Potosi is a large city with many hotels and Hughes had stayed in hotels there on prior occasions. Hughes said he awoke at 2:00 a.m. and continued his drive to Mexico City, arriving at approximately 2:00 p.m. This means that it took Hughes almost twelve hours to complete the four hour drive from San Luis Potosi to Mexico City. Hughes also stated that the bandits held McCarthy because McCarthy was dressed in business attire. Yet, the evidence suggests that McCarthy was wearing jeans and boat shoes when he left Detroit for Mexico. Hughes claimed that he was forced to stop several times during the drive because McCarthy complained of some kind of intestinal infection and needed to relieve himself. The autopsy report, however, showed no sign of intestinal distress, and McCarthy's wife testified that her husband had not been ill when he left home several hours earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seventh, when Hughes met with ASI officers, he was adamant that he be given the money directly and that he be allowed to return alone to Mexico to execute the ransom exchange. He refused to divulge the precise location where the ransom exchange would take place. Yet, after the ASI officers decided to wire the money to Mexico, and to send Logee to Mexico to accompany him, Hughes refused to participate in the rescue plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and decisively, the FBI recovered cartridge casings on Hughes's property in Rhode Island, and the ballistics expert testified that these casings were expelled from the same gun that produced the spent cartridge casings recovered at the scene of the crime in Queretaro. Moreover, the expert stated that only one gun in the world could have produced the signature markings shared by these casings, explaining that a gun leaves unique marks on a spent shell casing somewhat akin to a fingerprint. The expert further testified that all the casings were 9 mm, and that the bullet fragments recovered from McCarthy's body could have been 9 mm. In addition, a salesman at a Rhode Island gun store testified that in September 1993, Hughes purchased a Sig Sauer 9 mm pistol, and a friend of Hughes's son testified that he had participated in some target shooting on Hughes's Rhode Island property a short time before the murder took place using a gun that resembled the Sig Sauer. The evidence, therefore, indicates that the same 9 mm pistol used on Hughes's Rhode Island property was used to kill McCarthy, or, more precisely, that Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol purchased in September 1993 was the murder weapon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we find that the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes murdered McCarthy. Accordingly, Hughes did not innocently transmit to ASI a ransom demand for one million pesos. Instead, he used the threat of harm to McCarthy to extort money from ASI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE GOVERNMENT'S CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes assails the government for making numerous statements--nine in all--within its closing argument that were unsupported by the evidence in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> He demands a new trial because of these abuses. Given defense counsel's failure to object to these statements at trial, we review the prosecutor's remarks only for plain error. See United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1999). We will not reverse a conviction for plain error unless it is clear that, inter alia, the error \"affected the outcome of the proceedings.\" Id. (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993)). We discern only one minor error--and no plain error--in the prosecutor's closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Ballistics Expert's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to the prosecution's statement to the jury that the ballistics expert's testimony, \"tells us, circumstantially, that the murder weapon was the Defendant's 9 mm Sig Sauer, the one he bought on September 30th of 1993 from D &amp; L Shooting Supplies.\" Hughes contends: (1) that the ballistics expert did not identify the type of gun used in the murder; (2) that the bullets were as likely to have come from a.38 caliber as a 9 millimeter; (3) that there was no evidence that Hughes had a gun in Mexico; (4) that the presence of the cartridge casings at the murder scene was not tied to the bullets recovered from the body; and (5) that there was no proof that the bullets from the spent cartridge casings were fired where the cartridge casings were found or that they were fired from Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes's objections disregard the nature of circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. The ballistics expert testified that only one gun in the world could have produced the markings found on both the cartridge casings recovered at the scene of the crime and those found on Hughes's property in Rhode Island. As detailed above, this evidence permits the inference that the same 9 mm pistol that was used on Hughes's Rhode Island property was also used as the murder weapon, and that this gun was the Sig Sauer 9 mm pistol that Hughes purchased in September 1993. Moreover, as detailed below, the evidence suggests that the likely reason that Hughes drove from Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City just prior to McCarthy's arrival was to smuggle his pistol into Mexico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Trip Across the Mexican Border</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to the prosecutor's statement to the jury that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the defendant tells [FBI Special Agent] Murphy that he gets the car from Budget. He must have told them that he wasn't going south of Monterey. Why did he have to have a car? He needed a car to get his gun across the border. That's what it boils down to, Ladies and Gentlemen. No magnetometers, no x-rays, lots of places to hide a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample evidence in the record to support this statement. Hughes told agent Murphy that he rented a car from the Budget agency in Laredo, Texas. Because the manager at that agency testified that it was company policy not to allow cars to be driven south of Monterey, and the agency rented a car to Hughes, it is reasonable to infer that Hughes said he was not going south of Monterey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also supports an inference that Hughes rented a car and drove across the border as a means of smuggling a gun into Mexico. First, on the numerous prior occasions that Hughes visited Mexico on business, he had virtually never rented a car. Marquez testified that Hughes disliked driving in Mexico and typically requested that Marquez drive. Second, there is simply no good alternative explanation for Hughes's decision to rent a car in Laredo, Texas, a twelve hour drive from his final destination of Mexico City. There were rental cars available in Mexico City, including cars from American rental car agencies. Third, because the evidence suggested that Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol ejected the cartridge casings found at the crime scene in Queretaro, Hughes must have transported a gun into Mexico somehow. The most plausible explanation is that he carried it with him during his drive from Laredo. It is common knowledge that airports have magnetometers and x-ray machines designed to detect concealed weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. McCarthy's Late-Night Arrival in Mexico</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to the prosecutor's statement that Hughes \"said [to Sawicke] he was busy that weekend, and he couldn't pick up [Brian McCarthy] until at least ten o'clock.... This is the reason. He wants it dark. Darkness is the ancient ally of criminals.\" Hughes insists that the prosecutor's attempt to show that he was not actually busy on that date was misleading because the \"undisputed evidence\" indicated that he would have been busy but for the failure of certain equipment to be delivered to the Chrysler plant in Toluca. Moreover, the attribution, \"he wants it dark,\" was particularly misleading because it was McCarthy who selected the evening flight time. We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sandy Sawicke, McCarthy's secretary, testified that in a telephone conversation with Hughes, he said that he had a very busy schedule that weekend and McCarthy should not arrive before 10:00 Sunday night. Although McCarthy had previously suggested that he take an evening flight, the 10:00 p.m. arrival time was scheduled at the behest of Hughes, not McCarthy. Furthermore, the evidence established that Hughes was not particularly busy that Sunday, as he had claimed he would be. Although there was some indication that Hughes's work plans may have been disrupted by a delayed shipment of ASI equipment to the Chrysler plant, the jury was entitled to infer that Hughes's busy schedule was a pretext to justify McCarthy's late arrival. From the evidence that Hughes wanted McCarthy to arrive late, and that Hughes's Sig Sauer was the likely murder weapon, a reasonable juror could also have inferred that Hughes wanted it dark during the drive to San Luis Potosi so that he could kill McCarthy undetected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Queretaro Bypass Highway</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant objects to the prosecutor's following statements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let's briefly talk about the murder. You know that the Defendant picked up Brian McCarthy between ten and eleven in Mexico City. The Defendant uses the directions provided to him by Martin Marquez to get on the road to Queretaro. Two days earlier, of course, he's had lots and lots of time to go through in daylight and at night to check out any sites he might want to use for killing Brian McCarthy. And it's late at night, and the evidence is that the Defendant took the Queretaro bypass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had a lot of time, a lot of time to scope out a location where he would kill McCarthy on the way to San Luis Potosi. Against the advice of Martin Marquez, he chose to drive that lonely dark road in the middle of the night, when there was just no reason to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes insists that this is a \"prejudicial misstatement of fact\" because there is no evidence that Hughes and McCarthy took the bypass road around Queretaro, or that Hughes spent time during the previous two days checking out a site to murder McCarthy. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marquez testified that Hughes told him he planned to pick up McCarthy at the Mexico City airport and drive to San Luis Potosi. The city of Queretaro is on the way from Mexico City to San Luis Potosi, about half way between those two cities, and it would have been logical for Hughes to take the bypass highway. There was also ample evidence from which the jury could infer that Hughes spent time during his trip from Laredo to Mexico City checking out potential murder sites. Special Agent Murphy testified that Hughes told him that he crossed the border into Mexico at about 4:00 p.m. on February 1, and did not arrive in Mexico City until 2:00 p.m. on February 3, forty-six hours later. The drive from Laredo to Mexico City normally takes about twelve hours and the route runs past Queretaro. Thus, Hughes had plenty of unaccounted-for time in the area of the murder. Finally, because Marquez testified that he told Hughes that the roads between Queretaro and San Luis Potosi were under construction and dangerous, and he advised Hughes against driving at night, the prosecutor's statement to that effect was accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Murder Site</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to these statements of the prosecutor:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me ask you, Ladies and Gentlemen, an ideal place to kill Brian McCarthy, but why would bandits select that site? The evidence suggests they wouldn't, and this is why. You will recall that Hughes tells us that once they're attacked, they're put in the car and driven around for some length of time. This is a toll road, and to get off this road, you have to go through another toll. What bandits. What bandit is going to drive through a toll booth, where there's evidence there are police with Mr. Hughes in the back seat as a hostage?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">.  .  .  .  .  .  .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Robber is going to work off that toll road. Why?... [T]here's a toll booth just before you get on it.... [L]ikewise,... there's a toll booth just before you get off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes argues that \"[t]here is no evidence, expert, circumstantial, or otherwise, that McCarthy was killed at the place that he was found. There is no evidence that the accused was ever on that toll road. There is no evidence that anyone had to drive through 'another toll.'\" (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent any evidence that the body was moved or transported, it was appropriate for a jury to infer that McCarthy was killed where he was found, particularly when the shell casings were found near the body and a trail of blood led from the roadside to a shallow grave in which the body was buried. As discussed above, there was circumstantial evidence that Hughes and McCarthy drove on the bypass highway. There was also evidence that the bypass was a toll road with at least one tollbooth, and that it is common practice in Mexico for police or military officers to be stationed at tollbooths. Hence, there was some basis in the evidence for the government's explanation of why kidnappers would be unlikely to abduct someone on the bypass highway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent, however, that the government's statement emphasized the existence of a second toll booth through which the bandits would have had to pass after the abduction, there was an insufficient evidentiary basis for that assertion. Indeed, FBI Special Agent Gilbert Contreras testified that he did not think that there was a second toll booth in place at the time of the killing. We readily conclude, nonetheless, that this misstatement, in the context of the substantial circumstantial evidence supporting the jury's verdict, did not prejudice Hughes, and therefore, did not constitute plain error. See United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d 1148, 1153-54 (1st Cir. 1991) (no plain error where improper remarks in government's closing statement did not effect the outcome of the trial given the strength of the government's case against the defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. The Leatherman Tool</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes complains that \"twice, the prosecutor misstated the evidence about the Leatherman tool to inflame the jury.\" During closing argument, the prosecution suggested that Hughes's description of the kidnappers patting him down did not square with the fact that he arrived back in the United States carrying the Leatherman tool--a device with several sharp knives--in his canvas bag. Moreover, the government argued that because Hughes realized this inconsistency in his story, he eagerly sought to retrieve the bag from the FBI. Again, we find the government's reasoning valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Leatherman tool was considered dangerous enough that it was confiscated by a flight attendant during Hughes's return trip to the United States from Mexico; Hughes told agent Murphy that the bandits had patted him down; and Hughes did appear especially eager to retrieve the canvas bag, telephoning Loraine Bertolini, in whose car he had left it, to ask her to get the bag back from the FBI because it had \"sentimental value\" to his wife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. The Tire Tracks</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Hughes, it was a \"raw abuse\" of power for the government to tell the jury that \"the tire tracks are not part of the case.\" Once again, Hughes's complaint misses the mark. Although a crime scene investigator for the Mexican government testified that he had noted tire tracks by the roadside, the significance of this evidence was fairly debatable. Hughes presented a witness who testified that the factory tires on the Ford Tempo he rented were slightly wider than the tracks measured at the crime scene. Hughes argued that the rental car probably had factory tires because it was new, and the discrepancy in the measurements proved that Hughes's rental car did not make the tracks found at the crime scene. Upon cross-examination, however, Hughes's witness admitted that he had never measured the imprint that such a tire would make in sand, the surface at the crime scene, and that he did not know what make of tire was actually on the car that Hughes drove. Accordingly, the government was entitled to argue that the tire track evidence was insignificant, although, as always, the jury was free to adopt a different interpretation of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE MISSING CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberto Gonzalez Moreno, a Mexican police officer, took thirty-seven photographs of the crime scene, some of which were apparently used during Hughes's murder trial in Mexico. Only nine of these photographs, however, made their way to the United States Attorney's Office for use in the trial. One of these nine photographs depicted one of the two cartridge casings recovered from the crime scene. Hughes insists that this photograph was exculpatory because the cartridge casing depicted in the photograph differed in color from the actual cartridge casing that the government introduced in evidence. Among the missing photographs was one that depicted the second cartridge casing recovered at the crime scene. Extrapolating from the putatively exculpatory value of the picture of the first cartridge casing, Hughes contends that this missing photograph would likely have proven exculpatory as well. Thus, Hughes argued to the court at trial that the government's failure to produce the photograph of the second cartridge casing required the court to exclude both of the actual cartridge casings from evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument, concluding that the government was under no obligation to produce the missing photographs because they were not within the government's control. Moreover, despite Hughes's insistence that the photograph of the first cartridge casing was exculpatory, the court found \"the color of the casing in that photograph... to be the same as the casing the government intends to offer,\" and concluded, \"I fail to see anything exculpatory about it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the district court's ruling, we need not inquire into the potential exculpatory value of the missing photographs. Because the government was never in control of the photographs, it is not responsible for any failure to produce them. See United States v. Friedman, 593 F.2d 109, 119-20 (9th Cir. 1979) (evidence that was in Chile was not within the control of the government for the purposes of Brady or Rule 16); United States v. Flores, 540 F.2d 432, 437-38 (9th Cir. 1976). It is axiomatic that the government must provide the criminal defendant with access to material exculpatory evidence within its control, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and the government may not in bad faith fail to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence, see Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988). However, the government has no duty to produce evidence outside of its control, see United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1179 (1st Cir. 1993), and it is not responsible for the preservation of evidence that was never in its control in the first place, see United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1340 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990, 993 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the government obviously did not have physical possession or custody of the missing photographs, Hughes contends that its inadequate efforts to secure the missing photographs from Mexico belied its ability to control them. This argument is unavailing. As the district court aptly explained, \"Mexico is a sovereign nation, and it's clear that the United States Government has no authority to require the Mexican Government to produce any evidence that may be in its possession or under its control. It has to rely on the Mexican government to comply with reasonable and appropriate requests.\"The government's persistent, but fruitless, efforts to obtain the missing photographs demonstrate its lack of control over them. In December 1997, the United States Justice Department requested in writing that the Mexican government produce all \"sketches and photographs of the crime scene\"; in early 1998, FBI Special Agent Jimmy Garcia asked Mexican officials several times to turn over all evidence in the case, only to be told that such evidence could not be relinquished because it was still under review; eight days before trial, Agent Garcia asked an official in the Mexico Attorney General's office to contact several Queretaro justice officials to help obtain the missing photographs, only to be told that all of the evidence had already been turned over to the U.S. government; one week before trial Agent Garcia asked each of the Mexican officials who were to testify as government witnesses about the photographs in hopes of locating them; and during trial, the FBI's Legate Office in Mexico made yet another request of the Mexican government to search for the missing photographs. Like the district court, we wonder \"what else the United States Government could have reasonably done under the circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

Section 2B3.2 contains a cross-reference provision, &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1), which applies when the extortion scheme results in a murder that occurs outside the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States. In particular, &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply &#167; 2A1.1 (First Degree Murder). Guideline &#167; 2A1.1, in turn, describes the punishment for first degree murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111. Section 2A1.1 sets a base offense level of 43, which translates into life imprisonment pursuant to the sentencing table in the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Hughes to twenty years' imprisonment. It arrived at this sentence by applying the guideline for first degree murder, &#167; 2A1.1, after determining that Hughes's extortion scheme resulted in the murder of McCarthy outside the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and thus triggered the cross-reference found in &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1). Pursuant to &#167; 2A1.1's base offense level of 43, the district court would have sentenced Hughes to life imprisonment, but 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951 sets the maximum penalty for extortion at twenty years' imprisonment. See USSG &#167; 5G1.1 (\"Where the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes argues that the district court erred in applying the &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) cross-reference for three reasons: (A) &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) is superceded by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1119; (B) there was insufficient evidence of first degree murder; and (C) McCarthy was not \"a victim\" of the extortion scheme within the meaning of &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1).

Section 1119 provides that \"[a] person who, being a national of the United States, kills or attempts to kill a national of the United States while such national is outside the United States but within the jurisdiction of another country shall be punished as provided under sections 1111 [murder], 1112 [manslaughter], and 1113 [attempted murder/manslaughter].\" Section 1119 also contains the following limitation: \"No prosecution shall be approved if prosecution has been previously undertaken by a foreign country for the same conduct.\" Hughes insists that this limitation prevents calculating his sentence using &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1)'s cross-reference to the first degree murder guideline because he was previously prosecuted for (and convicted of) murder in Mexico. See supra note 1. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the limiting language within &#167; 1119 speaks only of \"prosecutions,\" not sentence enhancements. Moreover, although &#167; 1119 prohibits prosecuting a defendant for murder \"as provided under section[] 1111,\" Hughes was not being prosecuted or punished for murder in violation of &#167; 1111, but for extortion in violation of &#167; 1951. If Hughes had been prosecuted and punished for murder, he would have received the death penalty or life imprisonment, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111, not twenty years' imprisonment, the statutory maximum for extortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that a defendant's sentence may be enhanced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines for conduct underlying a prior prosecution, conviction, and punishment. As the Supreme Court explained in Witte:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the Guidelines aggravate punishment for related conduct outside the elements of the crime on the theory that such conduct bears upon the \"character of the offense,\" the offender is still punished only for the fact that the present offense was carried out in a manner that warrants increased punishment, not for a different offense (which that related conduct may or may not constitute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Witte v.

This is true even where, as in this case, the defendant is subject to \"separate prosecutions involving the same or overlapping 'relevant conduct'\" Id. at 404 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).

Our review \"of a sentencing court's fact-specific determination of a defendant's role in the offense is limited to clear error.\" United States v. Alicea, 204 F.3d 480, 485 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First degree murder is \"willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111. Hughes argues that the evidence equally supports a finding that he committed voluntary manslaughter--i.e., killing \"[u]pon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1112. The government, however, presented strong circumstantial evidence that Hughes planned to murder McCarthy when they met in Mexico. Hughes purchased a gun, devised a plan to transport it to Mexico, surveyed the area of the crime to choose a suitable location to kill McCarthy, and planned for McCarthy to arrive late at night. To sustain a sentencing enhancement, the government need only prove the relevant facts by a preponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Medina, 167 F.3d 77, 79 (1st Cir. 1999). The district court did not commit clear error in finding that the government met its burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

We decline Hughes's invitation, concluding instead that &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) contemplates that there may be \"victims\" of an extortion scheme other than the target of the extortionate demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application note 7 to &#167; 2B3.2 explains that \"[i]f the offense involved the threat of death or serious bodily injury to numerous victims (e.g., in the case of a plan to derail a passenger train or poison consumer products), an upward departure may be warranted.\" (Emphasis added.) In this example, the train passengers are \"victims\" of the train derailment extortion scheme even though the extortionate demand is not made of the passengers themselves. Likewise, because Hughes's plan to extort money from ASI included killing McCarthy, McCarthy was a victim of the extortion scheme even though Hughes never demanded that McCarthy pay him any money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additional support for this conclusion comes from the text of &#167; 2B3.2. Section 2B3.2(b)(2) adds levels to the base offense level for excessive \"loss to the victim.\" There, the use of the definite article \"the\" to indicate a narrower class of \"victims\" makes sense because only the target of the extortionate demand will suffer a financial \"loss\" as a result of the extortion scheme. Section 2B3.2(c)(1) uses the indefinite article, referring the sentencing court to the first-degree murder guideline \"[i]f a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111.\" In contrast to &#167; 2B3.3(b)(2), the use of the indefinite article suggests a class of potential victims broader than the target or targets of the extortionate demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are many precedents for a similar construction of the term \"victim\" in other guidelines sections. The Fifth Circuit concluded that a person killed in the aftermath of a bank robbery, though not the target of the robbery itself, was \"a victim\" within the meaning of &#167; 2B3.1(c)(1). See United States v. Harris, 104 F.3d 1465, 1474-75 (5th Cir. 1997) (construing a cross-reference provision identical to &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1)). Other courts have declined to construe the term \"victim\" narrowly, except where the guidelines employ the definite article. See United States v. Sickinger, 179 F.3d 1091, 1094 (8th Cir. 1999) (emphasizing that \"increases based on injury to 'the victim' under sentencing guideline for kidnapping, abduction, unlawful restraint, &#167; 2A4.1, are predicated on the risk to a single intended individual,\" and distinguishing \"the victim\" from the phrase \"any victim\" found in the robbery guideline) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis added); United States v.

Although Hughes claimed to have no assets, the PSR reflects that between 1974 and 1994, he earned an aggregate salary of over $2 million.

Even if, as Hughes contends, his primary motive was to cover up the murder, he nevertheless intended to carry out the cover up scheme by issuing an extortionate demand to ASI.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Hughes also contends that the district court omitted an essential element of the crime by failing to instruct the jury that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that ASI was the victim of the attempted extortion. This contention is frivolous. The court instructed the jury in plain terms that the charge against Hughes was that he \"attempted to obtain money from Automation Software, Inc. by the wrongful use of fear or threats of violence or violence.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Hughes also identifies an additional twenty-seven errors of this kind in an addendum to his brief. With respect to those errors asserted only in the addendum, Hughes has waived his argument. It is a \"settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). Whatever level of development is required to satisfy this standard, it is not met by merely cataloguing bare portions of the record in an addendum. Although Local Rule 28(a)(4) provides that the appellant must include in an addendum, \"Other items or short excerpts from the record, if any, considered necessary for understanding the specific issues on appeal,\" inclusion in the addendum is no substitute for developed argumentation in the body of the brief. Indeed, allowing a party to use an addendum to raise a laundry list of additional issues not individually addressed and argued in the brief would all but eviscerate Fed. R. App. P. 32(a)(7), which prescribes detailed page limitations to which both parties must adhere. We do not suggest that waiver applies unless every objected-to portion of the record is quoted in full in the brief. Rather we reiterate that, irrespective of any material reproduced in an addendum, we will only credit arguments actually developed within the body of the brief.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  In addition to his objections based on the missing photographs, Hughes vigorously contested at trial the authenticity of the shell casings and the bullet fragments.

Indeed, despite strong circumstantial evidence to the contrary, it is possible that the jury concluded that Hughes killed McCarthy without malice and, as such, only committed manslaughter. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1112. Whatever the factual predicate the jury relied upon to convict Hughes, however, the evidence supported the sentencing court's finding by a preponderance of the evidence that, for the purpose of applying the &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) cross-reference, Hughes's conduct constituted first degree murder.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  We note that the district court indicated that even if the cross-reference provision of &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) did not apply, it would have sentenced Hughes to twenty years' imprisonment.

According to the government, Hughes attempted to extort money from his employer by murdering the company president, Brian McCarthy, in Mexico, reporting it as a kidnapping and issuing a phony ransom demand. On appeal, Hughes contends that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction; (2) the government improperly made statements to the jury during closing argument that were unsupported by the evidence in the record; (3) the government's failure to produce all of the crime scene photographs violated his right to a fair trial; (4) his sentence was incorrectly calculated using the guideline for first degree murder; and (5) the district court erred in ordering him to pay restitution. Unpersuaded by these arguments, we affirm both the conviction and the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE PLOT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by summarizing the twisted plot, adding more detail below as it becomes relevant to the legal analysis. We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, to the extent consistent with record support. See United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765611\"><a href=\"/opinion/765611/united-states-v-eusebio-escobar-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 157 (1st Cir. 1999). By the early 1980s, Hughes had earned a reputation as one of the top computer software engineers in America. After designing complex computer systems for the United States Department of Defense, Hughes and his close friend, Dennis Toomey, started their own computer software company, Ocean Systems. The two added a third partner, Donald Hastings, and in 1982 the three men sold the company to Analysis &amp; Technology (\"A &amp; T\"), staying on as A &amp; T employees. In 1986, A &amp; T entered into a joint business venture with Browne &amp; Sharpe to create Automation Software, Inc. (\"ASI\"). Thereafter, Hughes, Toomey, and Hastings became ASI employees, with Hastings serving as president and Hughes as vice president. Hastings died the following year, and the ASI board commenced a search for a new president. The top candidates were Hughes and Brian McCarthy, a new ASI employee in sales and marketing hired by Hastings shortly before his death. Although McCarthy was an ASI neophyte, significantly younger than Hughes, and lacked Hughes's technical expertise, the board chose McCarthy to succeed Hastings. Hughes was upset. As the sitting vice president, he believed that he should have been offered the job, and he questioned McCarthy's qualifications for the position. Moreover, McCarthy's vision for ASI clashed with Hughes's. McCarthy wanted to expand ASI into a large company; Hughes wanted ASI to remain small, employing only elite software designers who would produce high-end programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Hughes resigned as vice president, contracting to work half time in exchange for two-thirds of his original salary. Thereafter, Hughes spent most of his time in Mexico, installing and servicing computer software for ASI's Mexican customers. Although Hughes maintained his residence in Rhode Island, he purchased a home in Mexico and planned to relocate there. Meanwhile, Hughes persistently complained about the quality of ASI's software under McCarthy's leadership, occasionally even criticizing ASI's software in front of clients. Aware of this conduct, McCarthy arranged at a meeting of ASI's board of directors to terminate Hughes's relationship with the company by buying out the remainder of his contract. In mid-January 1994, McCarthy decided to travel to Mexico to meet with Martin Marquez, an ASI sales representative, and to visit the Cummins diesel engine plant, an ASI customer located in San Luis Potosi. While there, McCarthy also planned to tell Hughes about the board's decision to terminate his employment relationship with ASI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, Hughes traveled by bus from Florida, where he had been vacationing with his wife, to Laredo, Texas. Hughes later told FBI Special Agent Nicholas Murphy that he was in no hurry because he did not expect to install the new ASI equipment at the Chrysler plant in Toluca, Mexico, until February 3 or 4. Arriving in Laredo on February 1, Hughes rented a Ford Tempo from the Budget rental agency in Laredo and drove to Mexico City. Upon reaching Mexico City, Hughes notified Marquez that he planned to pick up McCarthy at the Mexico City airport on Sunday night and that the two of them would drive to San Luis Potosi, four hours northwest of Mexico City. Marquez advised Hughes not to drive, and even volunteered to drive himself, but Hughes insisted, saying that he needed to talk to McCarthy in private.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Sunday, February 6, McCarthy celebrated his daughter's tenth birthday in Michigan. He then boarded an airplane to Mexico City, meeting Hughes at the airport at approximately 10:30 p.m. The two men left the airport in Hughes's rental car and drove northwest toward Queretaro, a city about half way between Mexico City and San Luis Potosi. McCarthy was never again seen alive. The next day, February 7, at approximately 10:00 p.m., the Mexican authorities found his partially buried body in rubble alongside the Queretaro bypass highway. He had been shot five times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7 at 5:15 p.m., Hughes boarded a flight from Mexico City to New York, arriving in New York at 11:00 p.m. The next morning, while still in New York, Hughes placed a telephone call to Joanne Keaney, ASI's controller. He told her that during the drive from the Mexico City airport to San Luis Potosi, when he and McCarthy had pulled over to the side of the road because McCarthy had to relieve himself, they were attacked by three men. He said that the assailants threw him into the back seat of the rental car, ordered him to keep his head down, and drove the car around for a while before stopping at a house. In the house, Hughes said he heard his abductors refer to McCarthy in the present tense, thereby implying that McCarthy was still alive. The kidnappers then brought Hughes to the airport, provided him with his credit card and passport, and warned him that they would kill McCarthy if he did not return with one million pesos (about $325,000) within forty-eight hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that morning, when he arrived back at ASI's Rhode Island office, Hughes met with several members of ASI's management team. He recounted the story of the kidnapping and ransom demand. ASI owned executive kidnapping insurance, and the insurer promptly hired the Ackerman Group, a Miami-based company that specializes in handling executive kidnappings. Collaborating with Emanuel Ackerman, the group devised a plan to wire the ransom money to Hughes and an ASI vice president, Stephen Logee, in Mexico. Hughes would then meet with the kidnappers to make the payment. Hughes objected to the plan. He proposed instead that the money be given to him directly and that he fly alone to Mexico to execute the exchange. Hughes refused to say exactly where the ransom exchange would be, stating only that he was to contact the kidnappers in a public place. The group decided to follow the Ackerman plan, in part because customs procedures would prevent carrying large sums of cash across the border.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes then borrowed a car, explaining that he wanted to go home to take a shower. A little while later, Hughes called the office to say that he had decided not to return to Mexico. After some coaxing, however, Hughes agreed to travel to Miami with Logee to meet with Ackerman. Meanwhile, the Mexican police, who had recovered McCarthy's body the night before, traced a bloody parking ticket found in his shirt pocket to his company car parked in the Detroit airport. When Hughes arrived at Rhode Island's T.F. Green airport later that afternoon for his trip to Miami, Logee informed him that the Mexican police had recovered a body believed to be McCarthy's. Hughes, appearing to get sick, immediately left the airport and refused to travel to Miami. The next day Hughes called Keaney to say that he was resigning from ASI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1996, a federal grand jury indicted Hughes for attempting to extort money from ASI in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following a ten day trial, Hughes was convicted by a jury, sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment and three years' supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution. Hughes now appeals from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must evaluate whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, was sufficient to support the jury's verdict--i.e., whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Czubinski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197216\"><a href=\"/opinion/197216/united-states-v-czubinski/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></a></span>, 1073 (1st Cir. 1997). When reviewing for the sufficiency of the evidence, \"all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the light most favorable to the government.\" United States v. Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522863\"><a href=\"/opinion/522863/25-socsecrepser-443-medicaremedicaid-gu-37849-28-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation omitted). The government need not produce direct evidence to meet its burden of proof: \"circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of admissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the jury deems it should be given under the circumstances within which it unfolds.\" United States v. Gamache, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198087\"><a href=\"/opinion/198087/united-states-v-gamache/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1998). Moreover, the government \"need not present evidence that precludes every reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt\"; the jury is generally \"at liberty to select freely among a variety of reasonable alternative constructions of the evidence.\" United States v. Reeder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762263\"><a href=\"/opinion/762263/united-states-v-george-wayneti-reeder-aka-wayne-reeder/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To affirm Hughes's conviction under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we must find that the evidence was sufficient to permit a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes attempted to extort money from ASI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Our sufficiency inquiry must, therefore, focus on whether Hughes killed McCarthy. If he did, the kidnapping story was bogus and his ransom request was an attempt to extort money from ASI. Conversely, if Hughes was an innocent messenger merely conveying the kidnappers' ransom demand, he is obviously not guilty of extortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that Hughes killed McCarthy and contrived a fallacious kidnapping and ransom story. First, Hughes was the last person seen alive with McCarthy. McCarthy's body was found on a bypass highway where Hughes and McCarthy were likely to have been traveling together on their drive from Mexico City to San Luis Potosi. The autopsy established that the time of death was between 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on February 7. Thus, McCarthy was already dead by the evening of February 7, the time that Hughes says the bandits made the ransom demand and took him to the Mexico City airport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Hughes had a motive to kill McCarthy. There is no doubt that the relationship between the two men had been strained from the time that ASI's board selected McCarthy over Hughes to serve as company president. Hughes objected to McCarthy's leadership and vision for the company, and frequently complained about McCarthy. Hughes confessed to his friend Toomey that he feared he would be fired and that ASI would \"abrogate\" his employment contract. Hughes's fears were well founded. Prior to traveling to Mexico, McCarthy arranged with ASI's board to terminate Hughes, and he planned to convey the news to Hughes during the trip to Mexico. Of course, the money Hughes stood to recover as ransom provides an independent financial motive for the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Hughes behaved unusually in the days preceding the murder in several ways. Although Hughes did not like to drive in Mexico, and virtually never did, he rebuffed Marquez's offer to drive and decided to rent a car. Moreover, although he could have rented the car in Mexico City, he went to Laredo, Texas, twelve hours from his destination. What is normally a twelve hour drive from Laredo to Mexico City took Hughes forty-six hours to complete. Hughes told McCarthy's secretary to book McCarthy on a late flight into Mexico because Hughes said he would be busy all day. As it turns out, Hughes was not busy at all. Finally, although Marquez warned him that the roads were bad and advised him not to drive at night, Hughes decided to pick up McCarthy at the airport at 10:00 p.m. and to drive four hours to San Luis Potosi, explaining to Marquez that he needed to talk to McCarthy in private.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Hughes arrived in the Mexico City airport for a flight home in the late afternoon of February 7, but he did not notify anyone about the kidnapping or ransom demand until the morning of February 8--almost 15 hours later. He offered only the lame excuse that he did not have his calling card with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, McCarthy's five-thousand-dollar laptop computer and a car worth over ten thousand dollars were found abandoned. Why would bandits, who were allegedly seeking ransom money, abandon these valuable items? No good explanation was offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth, the story told by Hughes to Special Agent Murphy was full of holes. Hughes told Murphy that when he arrived in Laredo on February 1, he considered traveling to Mexico City by bus. However, Marquez testified that in January 1994, almost a month earlier, Hughes told him that when McCarthy came to Mexico he planned to rent a car in Laredo. Hughes also told Murphy that when he arrived in San Luis Potosi, on his way to Mexico City, he tried unsuccessfully to reach Marquez. Yet, Marquez testified that he or some family member was home all day. Hughes said that he slept in his car that night because he could not find a hotel, even though San Luis Potosi is a large city with many hotels and Hughes had stayed in hotels there on prior occasions. Hughes said he awoke at 2:00 a.m. and continued his drive to Mexico City, arriving at approximately 2:00 p.m. This means that it took Hughes almost twelve hours to complete the four hour drive from San Luis Potosi to Mexico City. Hughes also stated that the bandits held McCarthy because McCarthy was dressed in business attire. Yet, the evidence suggests that McCarthy was wearing jeans and boat shoes when he left Detroit for Mexico. Hughes claimed that he was forced to stop several times during the drive because McCarthy complained of some kind of intestinal infection and needed to relieve himself. The autopsy report, however, showed no sign of intestinal distress, and McCarthy's wife testified that her husband had not been ill when he left home several hours earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seventh, when Hughes met with ASI officers, he was adamant that he be given the money directly and that he be allowed to return alone to Mexico to execute the ransom exchange. He refused to divulge the precise location where the ransom exchange would take place. Yet, after the ASI officers decided to wire the money to Mexico, and to send Logee to Mexico to accompany him, Hughes refused to participate in the rescue plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and decisively, the FBI recovered cartridge casings on Hughes's property in Rhode Island, and the ballistics expert testified that these casings were expelled from the same gun that produced the spent cartridge casings recovered at the scene of the crime in Queretaro. Moreover, the expert stated that only one gun in the world could have produced the signature markings shared by these casings, explaining that a gun leaves unique marks on a spent shell casing somewhat akin to a fingerprint. The expert further testified that all the casings were 9 mm, and that the bullet fragments recovered from McCarthy's body could have been 9 mm. In addition, a salesman at a Rhode Island gun store testified that in September 1993, Hughes purchased a Sig Sauer 9 mm pistol, and a friend of Hughes's son testified that he had participated in some target shooting on Hughes's Rhode Island property a short time before the murder took place using a gun that resembled the Sig Sauer. The evidence, therefore, indicates that the same 9 mm pistol used on Hughes's Rhode Island property was used to kill McCarthy, or, more precisely, that Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol purchased in September 1993 was the murder weapon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we find that the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes murdered McCarthy. Accordingly, Hughes did not innocently transmit to ASI a ransom demand for one million pesos. Instead, he used the threat of harm to McCarthy to extort money from ASI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE GOVERNMENT'S CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes assails the government for making numerous statements--nine in all--within its closing argument that were unsupported by the evidence in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> He demands a new trial because of these abuses. Given defense counsel's failure to object to these statements at trial, we review the prosecutor's remarks only for plain error. See United States v.

We discern only one minor error--and no plain error--in the prosecutor's closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Ballistics Expert's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to the prosecution's statement to the jury that the ballistics expert's testimony, \"tells us, circumstantially, that the murder weapon was the Defendant's 9 mm Sig Sauer, the one he bought on September 30th of 1993 from D &amp; L Shooting Supplies.\" Hughes contends: (1) that the ballistics expert did not identify the type of gun used in the murder; (2) that the bullets were as likely to have come from a.38 caliber as a 9 millimeter; (3) that there was no evidence that Hughes had a gun in Mexico; (4) that the presence of the cartridge casings at the murder scene was not tied to the bullets recovered from the body; and (5) that there was no proof that the bullets from the spent cartridge casings were fired where the cartridge casings were found or that they were fired from Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes's objections disregard the nature of circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. The ballistics expert testified that only one gun in the world could have produced the markings found on both the cartridge casings recovered at the scene of the crime and those found on Hughes's property in Rhode Island. As detailed above, this evidence permits the inference that the same 9 mm pistol that was used on Hughes's Rhode Island property was also used as the murder weapon, and that this gun was the Sig Sauer 9 mm pistol that Hughes purchased in September 1993. Moreover, as detailed below, the evidence suggests that the likely reason that Hughes drove from Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City just prior to McCarthy's arrival was to smuggle his pistol into Mexico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Trip Across the Mexican Border</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to the prosecutor's statement to the jury that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the defendant tells [FBI Special Agent] Murphy that he gets the car from Budget. He must have told them that he wasn't going south of Monterey. Why did he have to have a car? He needed a car to get his gun across the border. That's what it boils down to, Ladies and Gentlemen. No magnetometers, no x-rays, lots of places to hide a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample evidence in the record to support this statement. Hughes told agent Murphy that he rented a car from the Budget agency in Laredo, Texas. Because the manager at that agency testified that it was company policy not to allow cars to be driven south of Monterey, and the agency rented a car to Hughes, it is reasonable to infer that Hughes said he was not going south of Monterey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also supports an inference that Hughes rented a car and drove across the border as a means of smuggling a gun into Mexico. First, on the numerous prior occasions that Hughes visited Mexico on business, he had virtually never rented a car. Marquez testified that Hughes disliked driving in Mexico and typically requested that Marquez drive. Second, there is simply no good alternative explanation for Hughes's decision to rent a car in Laredo, Texas, a twelve hour drive from his final destination of Mexico City. There were rental cars available in Mexico City, including cars from American rental car agencies. Third, because the evidence suggested that Hughes's 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol ejected the cartridge casings found at the crime scene in Queretaro, Hughes must have transported a gun into Mexico somehow. The most plausible explanation is that he carried it with him during his drive from Laredo. It is common knowledge that airports have magnetometers and x-ray machines designed to detect concealed weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. McCarthy's Late-Night Arrival in Mexico</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to the prosecutor's statement that Hughes \"said [to Sawicke] he was busy that weekend, and he couldn't pick up [Brian McCarthy] until at least ten o'clock.... This is the reason. He wants it dark. Darkness is the ancient ally of criminals.\" Hughes insists that the prosecutor's attempt to show that he was not actually busy on that date was misleading because the \"undisputed evidence\" indicated that he would have been busy but for the failure of certain equipment to be delivered to the Chrysler plant in Toluca. Moreover, the attribution, \"he wants it dark,\" was particularly misleading because it was McCarthy who selected the evening flight time. We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sandy Sawicke, McCarthy's secretary, testified that in a telephone conversation with Hughes, he said that he had a very busy schedule that weekend and McCarthy should not arrive before 10:00 Sunday night. Although McCarthy had previously suggested that he take an evening flight, the 10:00 p.m. arrival time was scheduled at the behest of Hughes, not McCarthy. Furthermore, the evidence established that Hughes was not particularly busy that Sunday, as he had claimed he would be. Although there was some indication that Hughes's work plans may have been disrupted by a delayed shipment of ASI equipment to the Chrysler plant, the jury was entitled to infer that Hughes's busy schedule was a pretext to justify McCarthy's late arrival. From the evidence that Hughes wanted McCarthy to arrive late, and that Hughes's Sig Sauer was the likely murder weapon, a reasonable juror could also have inferred that Hughes wanted it dark during the drive to San Luis Potosi so that he could kill McCarthy undetected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Queretaro Bypass Highway</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant objects to the prosecutor's following statements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let's briefly talk about the murder. You know that the Defendant picked up Brian McCarthy between ten and eleven in Mexico City. The Defendant uses the directions provided to him by Martin Marquez to get on the road to Queretaro. Two days earlier, of course, he's had lots and lots of time to go through in daylight and at night to check out any sites he might want to use for killing Brian McCarthy. And it's late at night, and the evidence is that the Defendant took the Queretaro bypass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had a lot of time, a lot of time to scope out a location where he would kill McCarthy on the way to San Luis Potosi. Against the advice of Martin Marquez, he chose to drive that lonely dark road in the middle of the night, when there was just no reason to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes insists that this is a \"prejudicial misstatement of fact\" because there is no evidence that Hughes and McCarthy took the bypass road around Queretaro, or that Hughes spent time during the previous two days checking out a site to murder McCarthy. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marquez testified that Hughes told him he planned to pick up McCarthy at the Mexico City airport and drive to San Luis Potosi. The city of Queretaro is on the way from Mexico City to San Luis Potosi, about half way between those two cities, and it would have been logical for Hughes to take the bypass highway. There was also ample evidence from which the jury could infer that Hughes spent time during his trip from Laredo to Mexico City checking out potential murder sites. Special Agent Murphy testified that Hughes told him that he crossed the border into Mexico at about 4:00 p.m. on February 1, and did not arrive in Mexico City until 2:00 p.m. on February 3, forty-six hours later. The drive from Laredo to Mexico City normally takes about twelve hours and the route runs past Queretaro. Thus, Hughes had plenty of unaccounted-for time in the area of the murder. Finally, because Marquez testified that he told Hughes that the roads between Queretaro and San Luis Potosi were under construction and dangerous, and he advised Hughes against driving at night, the prosecutor's statement to that effect was accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Murder Site</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes objects to these statements of the prosecutor:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me ask you, Ladies and Gentlemen, an ideal place to kill Brian McCarthy, but why would bandits select that site? The evidence suggests they wouldn't, and this is why. You will recall that Hughes tells us that once they're attacked, they're put in the car and driven around for some length of time. This is a toll road, and to get off this road, you have to go through another toll. What bandits. What bandit is going to drive through a toll booth, where there's evidence there are police with Mr. Hughes in the back seat as a hostage?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">.  .  .  .  .  .  .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Robber is going to work off that toll road. Why?... [T]here's a toll booth just before you get on it.... [L]ikewise,... there's a toll booth just before you get off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes argues that \"[t]here is no evidence, expert, circumstantial, or otherwise, that McCarthy was killed at the place that he was found. There is no evidence that the accused was ever on that toll road. There is no evidence that anyone had to drive through 'another toll.'\" (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent any evidence that the body was moved or transported, it was appropriate for a jury to infer that McCarthy was killed where he was found, particularly when the shell casings were found near the body and a trail of blood led from the roadside to a shallow grave in which the body was buried. As discussed above, there was circumstantial evidence that Hughes and McCarthy drove on the bypass highway. There was also evidence that the bypass was a toll road with at least one tollbooth, and that it is common practice in Mexico for police or military officers to be stationed at tollbooths. Hence, there was some basis in the evidence for the government's explanation of why kidnappers would be unlikely to abduct someone on the bypass highway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent, however, that the government's statement emphasized the existence of a second toll booth through which the bandits would have had to pass after the abduction, there was an insufficient evidentiary basis for that assertion. Indeed, FBI Special Agent Gilbert Contreras testified that he did not think that there was a second toll booth in place at the time of the killing. We readily conclude, nonetheless, that this misstatement, in the context of the substantial circumstantial evidence supporting the jury's verdict, did not prejudice Hughes, and therefore, did not constitute plain error. See United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555433\"><a href=\"/opinion/555433/united-states-v-osvaldo-rodriguez-cardona-aka-valdo/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1153-54 (1st Cir. 1991) (no plain error where improper remarks in government's closing statement did not effect the outcome of the trial given the strength of the government's case against the defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. The Leatherman Tool</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes complains that \"twice, the prosecutor misstated the evidence about the Leatherman tool to inflame the jury.\" During closing argument, the prosecution suggested that Hughes's description of the kidnappers patting him down did not square with the fact that he arrived back in the United States carrying the Leatherman tool--a device with several sharp knives--in his canvas bag. Moreover, the government argued that because Hughes realized this inconsistency in his story, he eagerly sought to retrieve the bag from the FBI. Again, we find the government's reasoning valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Leatherman tool was considered dangerous enough that it was confiscated by a flight attendant during Hughes's return trip to the United States from Mexico; Hughes told agent Murphy that the bandits had patted him down; and Hughes did appear especially eager to retrieve the canvas bag, telephoning Loraine Bertolini, in whose car he had left it, to ask her to get the bag back from the FBI because it had \"sentimental value\" to his wife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. The Tire Tracks</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Hughes, it was a \"raw abuse\" of power for the government to tell the jury that \"the tire tracks are not part of the case.\" Once again, Hughes's complaint misses the mark. Although a crime scene investigator for the Mexican government testified that he had noted tire tracks by the roadside, the significance of this evidence was fairly debatable. Hughes presented a witness who testified that the factory tires on the Ford Tempo he rented were slightly wider than the tracks measured at the crime scene. Hughes argued that the rental car probably had factory tires because it was new, and the discrepancy in the measurements proved that Hughes's rental car did not make the tracks found at the crime scene. Upon cross-examination, however, Hughes's witness admitted that he had never measured the imprint that such a tire would make in sand, the surface at the crime scene, and that he did not know what make of tire was actually on the car that Hughes drove. Accordingly, the government was entitled to argue that the tire track evidence was insignificant, although, as always, the jury was free to adopt a different interpretation of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE MISSING CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberto Gonzalez Moreno, a Mexican police officer, took thirty-seven photographs of the crime scene, some of which were apparently used during Hughes's murder trial in Mexico. Only nine of these photographs, however, made their way to the United States Attorney's Office for use in the trial. One of these nine photographs depicted one of the two cartridge casings recovered from the crime scene. Hughes insists that this photograph was exculpatory because the cartridge casing depicted in the photograph differed in color from the actual cartridge casing that the government introduced in evidence. Among the missing photographs was one that depicted the second cartridge casing recovered at the crime scene. Extrapolating from the putatively exculpatory value of the picture of the first cartridge casing, Hughes contends that this missing photograph would likely have proven exculpatory as well. Thus, Hughes argued to the court at trial that the government's failure to produce the photograph of the second cartridge casing required the court to exclude both of the actual cartridge casings from evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument, concluding that the government was under no obligation to produce the missing photographs because they were not within the government's control. Moreover, despite Hughes's insistence that the photograph of the first cartridge casing was exculpatory, the court found \"the color of the casing in that photograph... to be the same as the casing the government intends to offer,\" and concluded, \"I fail to see anything exculpatory about it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the district court's ruling, we need not inquire into the potential exculpatory value of the missing photographs. Because the government was never in control of the photographs, it is not responsible for any failure to produce them. See United States v. Friedman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"363787\"><a href=\"/opinion/363787/united-states-v-allan-friedman-united-states-of-america-v-robert-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 119-20 (9th Cir. 1979) (evidence that was in Chile was not within the control of the government for the purposes of Brady or Rule 16); United States v. Flores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"338480\"><a href=\"/opinion/338480/united-states-v-marcela-flores-united-states-of-america-v-felipe/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 437-38 (9th Cir. 1976). It is axiomatic that the government must provide the criminal defendant with access to material exculpatory evidence within its control, see Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1963); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and the government may not in bad faith fail to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence, see Arizona v. Youngblood, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, 58 (1988). However, the government has no duty to produce evidence outside of its control, see United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1179 (1st Cir. 1993), and it is not responsible for the preservation of evidence that was never in its control in the first place, see United States v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195723\"><a href=\"/opinion/195723/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1340 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v.

This argument is unavailing. As the district court aptly explained, \"Mexico is a sovereign nation, and it's clear that the United States Government has no authority to require the Mexican Government to produce any evidence that may be in its possession or under its control. It has to rely on the Mexican government to comply with reasonable and appropriate requests.\"The government's persistent, but fruitless, efforts to obtain the missing photographs demonstrate its lack of control over them. In December 1997, the United States Justice Department requested in writing that the Mexican government produce all \"sketches and photographs of the crime scene\"; in early 1998, FBI Special Agent Jimmy Garcia asked Mexican officials several times to turn over all evidence in the case, only to be told that such evidence could not be relinquished because it was still under review; eight days before trial, Agent Garcia asked an official in the Mexico Attorney General's office to contact several Queretaro justice officials to help obtain the missing photographs, only to be told that all of the evidence had already been turned over to the U.S. government; one week before trial Agent Garcia asked each of the Mexican officials who were to testify as government witnesses about the photographs in hopes of locating them; and during trial, the FBI's Legate Office in Mexico made yet another request of the Mexican government to search for the missing photographs. Like the district court, we wonder \"what else the United States Government could have reasonably done under the circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

Section 2B3.2 contains a cross-reference provision, &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1), which applies when the extortion scheme results in a murder that occurs outside the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States. In particular, &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply &#167; 2A1.1 (First Degree Murder). Guideline &#167; 2A1.1, in turn, describes the punishment for first degree murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111. Section 2A1.1 sets a base offense level of 43, which translates into life imprisonment pursuant to the sentencing table in the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Hughes to twenty years' imprisonment. It arrived at this sentence by applying the guideline for first degree murder, &#167; 2A1.1, after determining that Hughes's extortion scheme resulted in the murder of McCarthy outside the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and thus triggered the cross-reference found in &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1). Pursuant to &#167; 2A1.1's base offense level of 43, the district court would have sentenced Hughes to life imprisonment, but 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951 sets the maximum penalty for extortion at twenty years' imprisonment. See USSG &#167; 5G1.1 (\"Where the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hughes argues that the district court erred in applying the &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) cross-reference for three reasons: (A) &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) is superceded by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1119; (B) there was insufficient evidence of first degree murder; and (C) McCarthy was not \"a victim\" of the extortion scheme within the meaning of &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1).

Section 1119 provides that \"[a] person who, being a national of the United States, kills or attempts to kill a national of the United States while such national is outside the United States but within the jurisdiction of another country shall be punished as provided under sections 1111 [murder], 1112 [manslaughter], and 1113 [attempted murder/manslaughter].\" Section 1119 also contains the following limitation: \"No prosecution shall be approved if prosecution has been previously undertaken by a foreign country for the same conduct.\" Hughes insists that this limitation prevents calculating his sentence using &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1)'s cross-reference to the first degree murder guideline because he was previously prosecuted for (and convicted of) murder in Mexico. See supra note 1. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the limiting language within &#167; 1119 speaks only of \"prosecutions,\" not sentence enhancements. Moreover, although &#167; 1119 prohibits prosecuting a defendant for murder \"as provided under section[] 1111,\" Hughes was not being prosecuted or punished for murder in violation of &#167; 1111, but for extortion in violation of &#167; 1951.

Hughes argues that the evidence equally supports a finding that he committed voluntary manslaughter--i.e., killing \"[u]pon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1112. The government, however, presented strong circumstantial evidence that Hughes planned to murder McCarthy when they met in Mexico. Hughes purchased a gun, devised a plan to transport it to Mexico, surveyed the area of the crime to choose a suitable location to kill McCarthy, and planned for McCarthy to arrive late at night. To sustain a sentencing enhancement, the government need only prove the relevant facts by a preponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Medina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198305\"><a href=\"/opinion/198305/united-states-v-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir. 1999).

We decline Hughes's invitation, concluding instead that &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) contemplates that there may be \"victims\" of an extortion scheme other than the target of the extortionate demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application note 7 to &#167; 2B3.2 explains that \"[i]f the offense involved the threat of death or serious bodily injury to numerous victims (e.g., in the case of a plan to derail a passenger train or poison consumer products), an upward departure may be warranted.\" (Emphasis added.) In this example, the train passengers are \"victims\" of the train derailment extortion scheme even though the extortionate demand is not made of the passengers themselves. Likewise, because Hughes's plan to extort money from ASI included killing McCarthy, McCarthy was a victim of the extortion scheme even though Hughes never demanded that McCarthy pay him any money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additional support for this conclusion comes from the text of &#167; 2B3.2. Section 2B3.2(b)(2) adds levels to the base offense level for excessive \"loss to the victim.\" There, the use of the definite article \"the\" to indicate a narrower class of \"victims\" makes sense because only the target of the extortionate demand will suffer a financial \"loss\" as a result of the extortion scheme. Section 2B3.2(c)(1) uses the indefinite article, referring the sentencing court to the first-degree murder guideline \"[i]f a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111.\" In contrast to &#167; 2B3.3(b)(2), the use of the indefinite article suggests a class of potential victims broader than the target or targets of the extortionate demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are many precedents for a similar construction of the term \"victim\" in other guidelines sections. The Fifth Circuit concluded that a person killed in the aftermath of a bank robbery, though not the target of the robbery itself, was \"a victim\" within the meaning of &#167; 2B3.1(c)(1). See United States v.

Other courts have declined to construe the term \"victim\" narrowly, except where the guidelines employ the definite article. See United States v.

Hughes argues that the district court's order to pay restitution was \"fatally flawed\" because it failed to take into account his inability to pay.

Rather, it is sufficient if the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> United States v. LiCausi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198296\"><a href=\"/opinion/198296/united-states-v-licausi/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A district court adequately considers the defendant's ability to pay if the defendant's financial information is contained in the presentence report (PSR), and the district court relies on the PSR in issuing its restitution order. See United States v. Newman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195935\"><a href=\"/opinion/195935/united-states-v-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.

Although Hughes claimed to have no assets, the PSR reflects that between 1974 and 1994, he earned an aggregate salary of over $2 million. Moreover, as a talented software designer, Hughes has substantial human capital, and there was evidence presented at trial that Hughes owned stock options and had recently purchased a house in Mexico. The district court did not err in ordering restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Hughes was prosecuted for homicide in Mexico. He was initially acquitted, but, as permitted under Mexican law, the acquittal was appealed by the public prosecutor. The Mexican appellate court reversed, convicting Hughes of murder and sentencing him to 19 years imprisonment. Prior to the appellate court's conviction, Hughes had been released on bail, and at the time of his trial in the United States, Hughes was a fugitive from the Mexican judicial system.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a), provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  For a conviction under the Hobbs Act, the government must also prove that the extortion \"obstructs, delays, or affects\" interstate commerce. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). ASI does business in several states and Mexico, and Hughes does not contest that an attempt to extort money from ASI would have an effect on interstate commerce sufficient to trigger the Hobbs Act.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  Hughes also contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish his intent to extort money from ASI because \"[a]ssuming arguendo that the defendant for some reason did not truthfully reveal the events of the night of February 6, the evidence points at least equally to an intent solely to cover up the events as it does to any intent to actually obtain money from ASI as 'revenge.'\" Hughes confuses motive with intent. Even if, as Hughes contends, his primary motive was to cover up the murder, he nevertheless intended to carry out the cover up scheme by issuing an extortionate demand to ASI.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Hughes also contends that the district court omitted an essential element of the crime by failing to instruct the jury that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that ASI was the victim of the attempted extortion. This contention is frivolous. The court instructed the jury in plain terms that the charge against Hughes was that he \"attempted to obtain money from Automation Software, Inc. by the wrongful use of fear or threats of violence or violence.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Hughes also identifies an additional twenty-seven errors of this kind in an addendum to his brief. With respect to those errors asserted only in the addendum, Hughes has waived his argument. It is a \"settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). Whatever level of development is required to satisfy this standard, it is not met by merely cataloguing bare portions of the record in an addendum. Although Local Rule 28(a)(4) provides that the appellant must include in an addendum, \"Other items or short excerpts from the record, if any, considered necessary for understanding the specific issues on appeal,\" inclusion in the addendum is no substitute for developed argumentation in the body of the brief. Indeed, allowing a party to use an addendum to raise a laundry list of additional issues not individually addressed and argued in the brief would all but eviscerate Fed. R. App. P. 32(a)(7), which prescribes detailed page limitations to which both parties must adhere. We do not suggest that waiver applies unless every objected-to portion of the record is quoted in full in the brief. Rather we reiterate that, irrespective of any material reproduced in an addendum, we will only credit arguments actually developed within the body of the brief.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  In addition to his objections based on the missing photographs, Hughes vigorously contested at trial the authenticity of the shell casings and the bullet fragments. The court focused considerable attention on this issue before ruling that the casings and the fragments had been properly authenticated and were admissible as evidence.

Indeed, despite strong circumstantial evidence to the contrary, it is possible that the jury concluded that Hughes killed McCarthy without malice and, as such, only committed manslaughter. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1112. Whatever the factual predicate the jury relied upon to convict Hughes, however, the evidence supported the sentencing court's finding by a preponderance of the evidence that, for the purpose of applying the &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) cross-reference, Hughes's conduct constituted first degree murder.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  We note that the district court indicated that even if the cross-reference provision of &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) did not apply, it would have sentenced Hughes to twenty years' imprisonment.
