SCOTT,\r\n\n                    Petitioner, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n    INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY;\r\n                        UNITED STATES,\r\n\n                   Respondents, Appellees.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n          [Hon. Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Michael Scott on brief pro se.\r\n   Loretta C. Argrett, Assistant Attorney General, Frank P.\r\nCihlar, John A. Dudeck, Jr., Attorneys, Tax Division, Department of\r\nJustice, and Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, on brief for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nDecember 14, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Pro se taxpayer Michael Scott appeals\r\nfrom the district court's decision denying his petition to\r\nquash certain Internal Revenue Service summonses and granting\r\nthe government's request to enforce certain summonses.  After\r\ncareful review of the appellant's and government's briefs, we\r\nconclude, for the reasons given by the government, that\r\nappellant's claims of error lack merit.  We also conclude,\r\nessentially for the reasons given by the magistrate judge in\r\nhis November 13, 1998 order, which the district court adopted\r\nafter de novo review as its final order on February 9, 1999,\r\nthat the petition to quash was properly denied and the request\r\nfor enforcement properly granted.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27(c). \n",
