Three armed men dressed in\nsecurity guard uniforms held up the Loomis, Fargo & Co. armored\ncar depot in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on May 13, 1997, while a fourth\nrobber stood watch outside.   The robbers took the Loomis Fargo\nguards captive as they returned to the company's offices in\narmored vehicles from runs to area banks. All told, the robbers\ngot away with an estimated $5.5 million.      Only about half a\nmillion dollars was recovered; the weapons used were never\nrecovered.   Four of the five defendants involved in this appeal\nwere convicted of the robbery and received sentences ranging\nfrom 308 months to 355 months; the fifth defendant was convicted\nof helping in the aftermath and was sentenced to 150 months\nimprisonment.\n\n         The defendants originally raised a myriad of arguments\n\non appeal.   In addition, after the Supreme Court decided United\n\nStates v. Castillo, 120 S. Ct. 2090 (2000), we requested that\n\nthe parties brief the effect of that decision.      None of the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fdefendants had raised at trial or on appeal a Castillo claim\n\nthat the use of a semiautomatic assault weapon in the robbery\n\nwas an element -- and not merely a sentencing factor -- of a\n\nfirearms offense.   See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), (B).   This is\n\nour first occasion to discuss the effects of Castillo on trials\n\nand indictments, and our view on the indictment issue is quite\n\ndifferent from the view of another circuit.       Save for one\n\nsentencing issue regarding one defendant -- as to which the\n\ngovernment agrees that there was error and that the matter\n\nshould be remanded -- we reject the defendants' arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\f                                  I.\n\n          The four main defendants are John Alexis Mojica-Baez,\n\nJosue G. Reyes-Hernandez, Nelson Cartagena-Merced, and Jose\n\nRamos-Cartagena.    After a trial lasting almost a month, they\n\nwere convicted of committing the robbery.          Specifically, all\n\nfour of these defendants were convicted of two counts of armed\n\nrobbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2113(a), (d); one count\n\nof assault, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2114(a); one count\n\nof breaking and entering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2117;\n\nand one count of using and carrying a firearm in relation to a\n\ncrime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1).\n\nAnother co-defendant, Rodolfo E. Landa-Rivera, was convicted of\n\nbeing an accessory after the fact to the robbery, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 3, 2113(a).1\n\n          The jury reasonably could have found the following\n\nfacts.   Loomis Fargo2 armored trucks and vans began arriving at\n\nthe Loomis Fargo depot in Ponce shortly after 7 p.m. on May 13,\n\n1997.    The vehicles were returning with cash from the day's\n\n\n     1     We address the appeal of another co-defendant, Jessica Vega-\nCoreano, in United States v. Vega-Coreano, No. 99-1343, in an opinion\npublished simultaneously with this one.\n     2    At the time, the company was named Wells Fargo.\n\n                                 -6-\n\froutes, which included a stop at a United States Post Office and\n\ntwo federally insured banks, Banco Popular and Banco Santander.\n\nWhen one of the guards from the first vehicle to arrive entered\n\nthe depot office, he was met by three men carrying long\n\nfirearms.    They told him it was a hold up and that he was not to\n\nmove or they would shoot him.         The three were dressed in\n\nuniforms similar to Loomis Fargo uniforms and were wearing\n\nbulletproof vests.     As four successive trucks arrived at the\n\ndepot, the three men disarmed the guards, handcuffed them, and\n\nlocked them in a bathroom.     The contents of the Loomis Fargo\n\nvehicles were systematically transferred to a Loomis Fargo van\n\ncommandeered by the robbers.    A fourth person, outside, worked\n\nin tandem with the three fake guards, communicating with them by\n\nwalkie-talkie.\n\n            The robbers were voluble, threatening the guards,\n\ntelling them, \"Last week we had to kill one guy, so you guys\n\nbetter do what we say.\"   They also told the guards several times\n\nhow powerful their weapons were, claiming, \"This AK-47 that I\n\nhave here can actually punch through 12 guys,\" and \"This thing\n\ncan even go through cement.\"      One of the guards recognized a\n\nweapon as an AK-47 and heard one of the robbers say, \"This is an\n\n                                -7-\n\fAK-47, and if I shoot you with this, I'll rip you up.   I'll just\n\nrip a part of you off.\"     Another guard described the firearms\n\ncarried by the robbers as \"assault weapons, big weapons.\"\n\n         The robbers also commented on their professionalism.\n\nOne of the guards testified that the robbers kept saying, \"Look\n\nhow professional we are.     We're really professionals.\"     The\n\nrobbers reiterated that they were professionals, unlike the\n\nother robbers who had been quickly caught after a recent,\n\nunrelated Brinks robbery.\n\n         Once the Loomis Fargo van was loaded, the guard the\n\nrobbers had forced to help them was trussed and pushed into the\n\nsmall bathroom that held nine other guards.     The guards were\n\nthen locked in and they heard the robbers threaten to set the\n\nplace on fire.    It took the guards about forty minutes to free\n\nthemselves; they then called for help.   The handcuffs had to be\n\ncut off of the guards, as the key holes had been soldered (or\n\nwelded) closed.\n\n         The robbers drove the Loomis Fargo van to another\n\nlocation and transferred the money to a different vehicle, but\n\nthey left thirty unopened bags of money in the Loomis Fargo van.\n\n         Evidence tied the defendants to the robbery almost\n\n                               -8-\n\fimmediately afterwards.     When news of the robbery was broadcast\n\non television, Ramos-Cartagena's wife, Jessica Vega-Coreano,\n\ntold Jessica Diaz-Nevarro, a friend and upstairs neighbor, that\n\nRamos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez had committed the robbery.\n\nThe evening of the robbery, Ramos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez\n\narrived back at Ramos-Cartagena's house driving a heavily laden\n\nvan.   Reyes-Hernandez was wearing a uniform similar to a Loomis\n\nFargo uniform.     Ramos-Cartagena ran into the house and asked\n\nVega-Coreano for keys.       He had a cut on his head and was\n\nshirtless.   Vega-Coreano gave him a shirt to put on and asked\n\nwhy they had not gotten rid of the clothes, to which he\n\nresponded, \"Forget the shirt, I need the keys, I want the keys,\n\nbecause we have to leave.\"        He found the keys and drove off.       A\n\nshort time later, Cartagena-Merced and Mojica-Baez arrived.\n\nMojica-Baez appeared happy, and he embraced Vega-Coreano and\n\nsaid, \"We did it.      We did it\" or \"We won, we won.\"         Cartagena-\n\nMerced          also       appeared             to       be        happy.\n\n          The    robbery   was,    of     course,   planned   in   advance.\n\nAccording to Diaz-Nevarro, the defendants met almost daily\n\nduring the two weeks prior the robbery.             Diaz-Nevarro also saw\n\nRamos-Cartagena,    Mojica-Baez,        and    Reyes-Hernandez     loading\n\n                                    -9-\n\fammunition into two long and three short guns the day before the\n\nrobbery. Landa-Rivera, who ultimately took some of the money to\n\nhide, was also seen around the house before the robbery.\n\n          A confidential informant reported to the FBI that\n\nbefore the robbery the defendants had stolen a van in the San\n\nJuan area. After the robbery, a white van containing veterinary\n\nproducts was found in a parking lot near the Loomis Fargo depot.\n\nThe van had been stolen from a veterinary products distributor\n\nabout a week before the robbery.         Diaz-Nevarro testified to\n\nseeing similar veterinary products in Ramos-Cartagena's house,\n\nand, after having obtained warrants to search the defendants'\n\nhomes (based upon information provided by the confidential\n\ninformant), FBI agents found such products when they searched\n\nthe house.\n\n          The searches of the defendants' homes produced a wealth\n\nof other incriminating evidence, including:        $387,000 in cash\n\nburied near Mojica-Baez's uncle's house and $13,000 in cash\n\ninside the house;3 AK-47 ammunition and part of the barrel of an\n\nAR-15 assault rifle at Mojica-Baez's house; $2,500 in cash in a\n\n     3    Mojica-Baez's uncle told police that someone had given him\nthe $13,000 to hold and had told him that it was from the Loomis Fargo\nrobbery.\n\n                                -10-\n\fMcDonald's bag hidden in a mattress and over $1,000 in a box and\n\nin a magazine at Cartagena-Merced's house; a photograph of\n\nRamos-Cartagena holding an AK-47, AK-47 ammunition, police\n\nuniforms similar to Loomis Fargo uniforms, two ski masks, four\n\nboxes of two-way radios, some welding equipment, and wrappers\n\nfrom Banco Popular and Banco Santander at Ramos-Cartagena's\n\nhouse; wrappers from Banco Santander, a bag containing almost\n\n$8,000 in cash, and a $45,000 check from the Lottery of Puerto\n\nRico made out to Reyes-Hernandez's mother and issued a week\n\nafter the robbery4 at Reyes-Hernandez's house; and a total of\n\n$8,800 in cash in Landa-Rivera's car.\n\n          After   their   homes   were   searched,   Ramos-Cartagena,\n\nReyes-Hernandez, Mojica-Baez, and Vega-Coreano traveled together\n\nto the Geminis Hotel and rented rooms there.         From there they\n\nmoved to the Joyuda Beach Parador Hotel, registering for three\n\nrooms under a false name.\n\n          Unable to contain themselves with the riches, some of\n\nthe defendants went on spending sprees.           The day after the\n\n     4     The record does not reveal the government's theory with\nregard to the lottery check. It would seem that the government\nbelieved the check was evidence of money laundering, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir. 1997), but there\nis no evidence in the record to that effect.\n\n                                  -11-\n\frobbery, Reyes-Hernandez bought a jet ski for $9,300 in cash\n\n(carried in a plastic grocery bag).       A search of the car in\n\nwhich Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-Hernandez, Mojica-Baez, and Vega-\n\nCoreano were traveling when they were arrested turned up a\n\njewelry store receipt for a $900 cash purchase of two watches.\n\nCash abounded.\n\n          Unable to contain themselves verbally, the different\n\ndefendants made incriminating statements to others.     Two days\n\nafter the robbery, Diaz-Nevarro overheard Reyes-Hernandez, in\n\nthe presence of Ramos-Cartagena, detailing what happened at the\n\nLoomis   Fargo   office   to   Vega-Coreano.   Diaz-Nevarro   also\n\noverheard Landa-Rivera describing to Vega-Coreano how the guards\n\nhad been tied up as they arrived at the depot.       Diaz-Nevarro\n\ntestified that Ramos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez were laughing\n\nin response.     Once arrested, Reyes-Hernandez, Ramos-Cartagena,\n\nand Landa-Rivera told a fellow jailmate, Luis Nevarez-Marrero,\n\ndetails of the planning and execution of the crime and their\n\nefforts to get away.      When arrested, Landa-Rivera told police\n\nthat he had been paid $6,000 to watch over two suitcases\n\ncontaining $200,000 each from the Loomis Fargo robbery.\n\n          After he was arrested, Ramos-Cartagena told an FBI\n\n                                 -12-\n\fagent, \"We were millionaires for a short time.\"           The jury\n\ndecided that statement was true.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Many of the arguments are joined by several of the\n\ndefendants    and   we   cluster    them.   We   deal   first   with\n\njurisdictional arguments, then with evidentiary objections.       As\n\nthe defendants argue that their evidentiary objections are\n\nprecursors to their sufficiency of the evidence arguments, we\n\nnext deal with those sufficiency arguments. Finally, we address\n\nthe Castillo and sentencing issues.\n\nA.   Jurisdiction: Whether the money stolen was insured by the\n\nFDIC or belonged to the United States\n\n            Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment, which alleged\n\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), (d), required the government\n\nto prove that the money taken during the robbery was insured by\n\nthe FDIC.     See United States v. Wood, 780 F.2d 555, 556 (6th\n\nCir. 1986).     At the close of the prosecution's case, Reyes-\n\nHernandez and Ramos-Cartagena moved for acquittal under Federal\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 29, arguing that the government had\n\nfailed to prove this essential element.     The motion was denied,\n\nand they renew the argument on appeal.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           It appears that the prosecution simply forgot to put\n\non    evidence   as   to   FDIC   insurance   in    its   case    in   chief.\n\nConsequently, the defendants moved for entry of judgment of\n\nacquittal after the government rested. Recognizing its blunder,\n\nthe    prosecution     requested     that     the    court       reopen   the\n\nprosecution's case in chief to permit it to present such\n\nevidence or, alternatively, that the court take judicial notice\n\nof the fact that Banco Popular and Banco Santander are insured\n\nby the FDIC.     The district court then indicated its inclination\n\nto reopen to correct a \"purely technical\" error and urged the\n\nparties to enter into a stipulation. The parties did enter into\n\na stipulation, without prejudice to their appellate rights, that\n\nBanco Popular and Banco Santander were both insured by the FDIC.\n\nThe stipulation was presented to the jury.\n\n           On appeal the defendants object to the trial court’s\n\nintervention on this issue, saying the court assumed the role of\n\nthe prosecution.      We disagree and find that the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in deciding to reopen.               See United\n\nStates v. Santana 175 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir. 1999).           There was no\n\nserious dispute that the banks were federally insured, and the\n\ngovernment’s lapse was recognized in time.\n\n                                    -14-\n\f         Count 3 of the indictment, which alleged a violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a), required the government to prove that\n\nthe money belonged to the United States.       See United States v.\n\nLawrence, 699 F.2d 697, 701-02 (5th Cir. 1983).       With regard to\n\nhis conviction   on   this   count,    Ramos-Cartegena     presses   two\n\narguments. First, he says, § 2114 is limited to offenses having\n\na \"postal nexus,\" and, although the jury instruction indicated\n\nthat the jury needed to find that postal service money was\n\nstolen, the indictment failed specifically to allege that the\n\nstolen money belonged to the United States Postal Service.\n\nSecond, he says there was insufficient evidence for the jury to\n\nfind that the money belonged to the United States Postal\n\nService. In fact, there was testimony from a Loomis Fargo guard\n\nthat he had stopped at a United States Post Office before the\n\nrobbers emptied his truck of its contents at the depot, and\n\ndocuments were   introduced    estimating    losses   to   the   postal\n\nservice of over $2 million.     The evidence was sufficient, and\n\nthe indictment, which referenced the statute and specifically\n\ncharged the robbers with stealing money belonging to the United\n\nStates, adequately and fairly charged the crime.\n\nB. Evidentiary Rulings\n\n                                -15-\n\f         We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for\n\nabuse of discretion.    See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183,\n\n195 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 432 (1999).\n\n1. Admission of Hearsay Statement of Deceased Informant\n\n         At trial, FBI Agent Raymond Lopez testified that, as\n\na result of information from a confidential informant, he\n\nprepared an affidavit that led to warrants to search the four\n\nmain defendants' homes on May 23, 1997.         Agent Lopez said that\n\nthe informant    had   provided   information    that    was   detailed,\n\nspecific, and consistent with information that was not publicly\n\navailable. As a condition of the admissibility of Agent Lopez's\n\ntestimony as to what he was told by the informant, the court\n\ninquired into why the informant was not available to testify.\n\nThe response was that he had been murdered.             Defense counsel\n\nmoved for a mistrial, which was denied, or for an instruction.\n\nThe court, in response, simply instructed the jury that the\n\nreason the informant was not there was that he was dead.\n\n         Agent    Lopez,   over    objection,    testified     that   the\n\ninformant had told him that two weeks before the robbery \"this\n\ngroup\" had stolen a white van in the metropolitan San Juan area\n\nin order to commit the Loomis Fargo robbery; that they had\n\n                                  -16-\n\ftinted the windows of the van to make it look like a standard\n\nLoomis Fargo van; and that the van could be found at a K-Mart\n\nshopping plaza near the Loomis Fargo depot.              The van was found\n\nthere. The ostensible purpose of the testimony was to establish\n\nthat the stolen van had been used in the robbery, and the agent\n\nnever explicitly testified that the informant meant that the\n\ndefendants on trial constituted \"this group.\"              The court found\n\nthat   the    information   from      the    informant    had     sufficient\n\nguarantees of trustworthiness to be admissible hearsay under\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 807.\n\n             The court, apparently recognizing in hindsight the\n\ndangers posed by the testimony that the informant had been\n\nmurdered, instructed the jury the next day that there was no\n\nclaim that the informant’s death was related to the case and\n\nthat his death could not be considered against any defendant.\n\n             The defendants level two objections. First, they claim\n\nit was error for the court to have allowed the government to\n\nintroduce     evidence   that   the   informant     had    been   murdered.\n\nSecond, they argue that the informants' statements did not meet\n\nthe trustworthiness requirements established under Ohio v.\n\nRoberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980).            This error, they say, denied\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthem their Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the\n\nwitnesses against them.     See Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116,\n\n139 (1999).\n\n         The testimony that the witness was unavailable because\n\nhe had been murdered was unfortunate, and the trial judge's\n\ninitial instruction was insufficient.     It would have been far\n\nbetter if the trial judge had immediately made clear that there\n\nwas no claim, implicit or explicit, that these defendants were\n\nsomehow responsible for the murder. If matters had been left at\n\nthat, the defendants would have a very serious claim.          But\n\nmatters were not left at that; the court quickly corrected the\n\nerror as its first order of business the next morning.     That was\n\nsufficient.\n\n         The second attack, based on Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n807, rests on the premise that the informant's statements lacked\n\ncommon attributes of trustworthiness: the informant never gave\n\nhis statement under oath, and he never claimed to be an\n\neyewitness.   Moreover, his unavailability cannot be attributed\n\nto the defendants so as to warrant admission of his statement.\n\n         Under   Roberts,   hearsay   statements   are   considered\n\nsufficiently trustworthy when the evidence either falls within\n\n                               -18-\n\fa firmly rooted hearsay exception or it possesses particularized\n\nguarantees of trustworthiness.        See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66.\n\nThis test was recently reaffirmed in Lilly, which emphasized\n\nthat appellate courts should conduct an independent review of\n\nthe trustworthiness finding.    See Lilly, 527 U.S. at 136.        The\n\ninformant's statements do not fall within the category of a\n\nfirmly rooted hearsay exception, so we look for any guarantees\n\nof   trustworthiness.    The   justification   for   a   finding   of\n\ntrustworthiness in this case is very thin, and the record on the\n\npoint is sparse.    But this is not a case in which the issue is\n\nimportant to the outcome.   The testimony was admitted primarily\n\nto show that the defendants stole the van (from which the\n\ninference could be drawn that they stole it to use in the\n\nrobbery).   This fact was established by evidence regarding the\n\nveterinary products (1) that the van's owner testified were in\n\nthe van when it was stolen; (2) that Diaz-Nevarro saw in Ramos-\n\nCartagena's house; (3) that the FBI found in Ramos-Cartagena's\n\nhouse; and (4) that the FBI found in the stolen van.      Moreover,\n\nthere was considerable other evidence linking the defendants to\n\nthe robbery.   If there was any error, it was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.    See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24\n\n                               -19-\n\f(1967).\n\n2. Admission of Statements of Witnesses Nevarez-Marrero and\n\nDiaz-Nevarro\n\n           Reyes-Hernandez    and     Mojica-Baez    seek     to   raise   an\n\nargument that had its brief moment in the sun but has since\n\nfaded.    The claim is that two prosecution witnesses received\n\nsomething of value from the government in return for their\n\ntestimony, to wit, a reduced sentence and a cash stipend\n\nrespectively, and that this violates 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2),\n\nwhich prohibits offering \"anything of value\" as an inducement to\n\na witness.      This court flatly rejected that argument in Lara,\n\n181 F.3d at 197-98, and we do so here.\n\n3. Exclusion of Melendez testimony\n\n           The defendants wanted to put on evidence from Tomas\n\nMelendez attacking the credibility of FBI agent Carlos Cintron,\n\nwho gave testimony inculpating the defendants.              In particular,\n\nthey wanted to attack the investigation performed by the agent.\n\n           The issue of the exclusion of such evidence is,\n\nhowever, more complicated than that.           The first salvo by the\n\ndefense   was    to   move   to     dismiss   the    second    superceding\n\nindictment, supporting       that    motion   with   an   affidavit    from\n\n                                    -20-\n\fMelendez   to    the   effect    that    the   indictment    was   based    on\n\nstatements from Melendez and that Melendez had been coached on\n\nwhat to say by agent Cintron.          In response to this, the district\n\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing and heard Melendez testify.\n\nThe court found that Melendez had committed perjury and ordered\n\nhis imprisonment.       The agent next testified.           In the end, the\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss the second superceding indictment\n\nand proceeded at trial only on the first superceding indictment.\n\n           Agent Cintron testified at trial.           Cintron testified\n\nthat he participated in the arrests of Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-\n\nHernandez, Mojica-Baez, and Vega-Coreano on May 28, 1997, at the\n\nJoyuda Beach Parador, and he identified evidence obtained at the\n\ntime of the arrests. The evidence included false identification\n\ncards and a receipt for a May 21, 1997, cash purchase of two\n\nexpensive watches, both found in Vega-Coreano's handbag; false\n\nidentification cards in Ramos-Cartagena’s wallet; more than\n\n$1,000    in    cash   taken    from    Reyes-Hernandez's      person;     and\n\nnewspapers with stories about the Loomis Fargo robbery. Cintron\n\nalso testified that Landa-Rivera provided a false name upon his\n\narrest.\n\n           After the agent's examination, the defendants indicated\n\n                                       -21-\n\fthey wanted to subpoena the agent to testify in their case.   The\n\ncourt, noting the agent had an obligation to testify in another\n\ncourt a few days hence, offered the defendants the opportunity\n\nto call him as their witness at that time.   The court also noted\n\nthat it would not permit testimony on the matters already\n\ncovered at the evidentiary hearing, that is, matters regarding\n\nthe second superceding indictment.   At the end of the day, the\n\ndefendants pressed the issue and said they wanted to inquire\n\nabout the limits and inadequacy of the investigation. The trial\n\njudge said those matters could have been covered on cross-\n\nexamination and that this agent played only a limited role in\n\nthe investigation, but that he would allow the defendants to\n\nrecall Agent Cintron if, after a proffer outside of the jury, he\n\nwas convinced counsel was not attempting to reintroduce the\n\nMelendez issue related to the second superceding indictment.\n\n         Later in the trial, counsel for Ramos-Cartagena asked\n\nthe court to permit Melendez to testify. The defense theory was\n\nthat a cursory investigation had been done -- that once a few\n\npieces of seemingly incriminatory evidence were found, the\n\nauthorities concentrated on trying to link what was found in\n\nRamos-Cartagena's house with the Loomis Fargo robbery.     This,\n\n                              -22-\n\fthey contended, evidenced bias by the government, and that bias\n\nwas exemplified by Melendez being used by Cintron to obtain the\n\nsecond superceding indictment.   The government responded that\n\nwhile that argument may have been relevant to the second\n\nsuperceding indictment, that indictment had been dismissed, and\n\nthe argument was not relevant to the charges before the jury.\n\nDefense counsel countered that the testimony of two other\n\nwitnesses buttressed their claim that the government had not\n\nadequately investigated the crime, and the government agreed\n\nthat Agent Cintron could be brought back so those points could\n\nbe pursued.   The defendants pressed for permission to call\n\nMelendez as a witness, but the court refused, saying Melendez\n\nhad committed perjury.   Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-Hernandez, and\n\nMojica-Baez claim the district court erred in not allowing them\n\nto call Melendez as a witness.\n\n         The district court did not abuse its discretion.   As\n\nthe trial judge recognized, there was considerable danger in\n\ngetting into a peripheral matter that had already been disposed\n\nof -- the second superceding indictment. The probative value of\n\nMelendez's testimony to the defendants' attempt to attack the\n\ngovernment’s investigation was weak, at best.   The defendants\n\n                             -23-\n\fhad a number of opportunities to make such an attack, some of\n\nwhich they took.         They had the opportunity to recall agent\n\nCintron and chose not take it.              The trial judge’s ruling,\n\nparticularly with regard to a witness already determined to be\n\na perjurer, was eminently reasonable.\n\n           We   need     not   address    the   government’s     additional\n\nargument   that    the     proposed      Melendez   testimony    would    be\n\nprohibited under Federal Rule of Evidence 608 as impeachment by\n\nextrinsic evidence.\n\n4. Admission of Tools of the Trade\n\n           During the robbery, the gunmen bragged that they were\n\n\"professionals.\"       At trial, the government put in certain\n\nphysical evidence seized from the defendants' homes on the\n\ntheory   that   the    items   were   the    \"tools   of   the   trade\"   of\n\nprofessional robbers. The evidence included ski masks, bullets,\n\na blue police emergency light, and police uniforms.               There was\n\nno claim by the government that these were used during the\n\nLoomis Fargo robbery.\n\n           Reyes-Hernandez, Ramos-Cartagena, and Mojica-Baez claim\n\nthe evidence is impermissible character propensity evidence\n\nbarred by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) and that it should\n\n                                   -24-\n\fhave been excluded as overly prejudicial under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.\n\n         There was no error.   Disguises are common tools of the\n\ntrade and have been found admissible even if not used in the\n\ncrime charged.   See, e.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva,\n\n162 F.3d 698, 705 (1st Cir. 1998).        There was no unfair\n\nprejudice to the defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f5. Admission of Redacted Post-Arrest Admission of Papo, a Co-\n\nDefendant Not On Trial\n\n            Rafael A. Baez-Gonzalez was a charged co-defendant who\n\nwas not on trial with these defendants.              On May 23, 1997, FBI\n\nagents went to his house and found almost $400,000 hidden on the\n\nproperty.     After he received his Miranda warnings, he signed a\n\nwaiver   of   rights   and    gave    a     statement.     Baez-Gonzalez's\n\nstatement,    redacted   to    remove       the   names   of   some    of   the\n\ndefendants, was admitted at trial through the testimony of an\n\nFBI agent.    The statement was that one week before the robbery\n\nan individual told Baez-Gonzalez that he (the individual) would\n\nbe coming into some large money and asked Baez-Gonzalez whether\n\nhe would hold the money for him; and further, that the Friday or\n\nSaturday after the robbery, the individual told Baez-Gonzalez\n\nthat the money was from the Loomis Fargo robbery.\n\n            Baez-Gonzalez’s redacted statement did not identify any\n\nof the defendants. Other evidence identified Mojica-Baez as the\n\nindividual. Specifically, Nevarez-Marrero (the fellow jailmate)\n\ntestified that Mojica-Baez had told him that \"somebody had taken\n\nfrom one of his uncles almost half a million dollars, and he was\n\nthinking that his own uncle was squealing on him.\"                    Nevarez-\n\n                                     -26-\n\fMarrero further testified that Mojica-Baez had told him that the\n\nmoney was \"[f]rom the holdup\" and that he (Mojica-Baez) had\n\n\"given it to his uncle for safekeeping.\"         While there was an\n\noverruled objection to Nevarez-Marrero’s statement, there was no\n\nobjection to the FBI agent's testimony about Baez-Gonzalez's\n\nstatement.   A Bruton objection was initially made to the Baez-\n\nGonzalez statement, see Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123\n\n(1968), but it was withdrawn upon counsel's learning that the\n\nstatement was redacted.5     Thus, there was no relevant objection\n\nto the Baez-Gonzalez statement, although the issue is now\n\npursued on appeal by Mojica-Baez and Cartagena-Merced.\n\n          There was no clear theory of admissibility for Baez-\n\nGonzalez's statement; there is no evidence from the record that\n\nthe statement was admitted as a co-conspirator statement, and no\n\nPetrozziello ruling was made as to the statement.          See United\n\nStates v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).           But\n\nthe defendants did not make these points at trial and so are in\n\na very weak position to argue them now.\n\n          The government urges that if there were any error, it\n\n     5    Reyes-Hernandez initially objected on the assumption that the\ngovernment was going to seek to introduce the statement as a\ndeclaration against interest.\n\n                                 -27-\n\fwas harmless. The defendants say that the claimed error was not\n\nharmless, because if the Baez-Gonzalez statement had not been\n\nadmitted, the jury would have found that Nevarez-Marrero’s\n\nstatement, which was admissible, was not credible.\n\n             If there was any error, it was harmless. Baez-Gonzalez\n\nwas Mojica-Baez’s uncle; a huge and unexplained sum of money was\n\nfound buried at his home; and, considering the other evidence\n\nthat    linked     Mojica-Baez     with    the   robbery,    a   jury   could\n\nreasonably infer that it came from Mojica-Baez, whether or not\n\nBaez-Gonzalez's statement came in.               The inference was given\n\ngreater strength by Nevarez-Marrero’s recounting of Mojica-\n\nBaez’s own words.\n\n6. Admission of Co-Conspirators' Statements\n\n             Mojica-Baez argues that it was a Petrozziello violation\n\nfor    the   district     court    to    allow   Diaz-Nevarro    to   testify\n\nregarding statements made by co-conspirators after the robbery\n\nhad been committed and to admit the statement Baez-Gonzalez gave\n\nfollowing his arrest.       See Petrozziello, 548 F.2d at 23.           Baez-\n\nGonzalez's statement, which was not explicitly admitted as a co-\n\nconspirator statement, was discussed above.\n\n             The   main   attack    launched     is   that   Diaz-Nevarro's\n\n                                        -28-\n\ftestimony involved statements that were made after the robbery\n\nand, thus, after the conspiracy ended.   There is a distinction,\n\nfor purposes of the co-conspirator statement exception to the\n\nhearsay rule, between an initial conspiracy to commit a crime\n\nand later actions to conceal the crime. See Grunewald v. United\n\nStates, 353 U.S. 391, 399-406 (1957); Krulewitch v. United\n\nStates, 336 U.S. 440, 443-44 (1949); United States v. Twitty, 72\n\nF.3d 228, 233-34 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          Our review of the district court's determination that\n\nthe statements were co-conspirator statements is for clear\n\nerror.   See   United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 703 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 273 (1999).   The district court\n\nfound that, in addition to the robbery, the conspiracy included\n\nthe division and hiding of the money, a ruling that is plainly\n\ncorrect under United States v. Hickey, 596 F.2d 1082, 1089-90\n\n(1st Cir. 1979).    It was hardly clear error for the district\n\ncourt to conclude that the robbers had not divided up all of the\n\nabundant cash by the night of the robbery or even immediately\n\nthereafter, and it is reasonable to conclude that it would have\n\ntaken at least a few days to count $5.5 million. The statements\n\n\n\n                              -29-\n\fDiaz-Nevarro recounted were made well within this time frame.6\n\n           The district court also admitted the evidence on a\n\ntheory that the conspiracy included the concealment of the\n\ncrime.   The district court found that the conspiracy included\n\n\"the use of false identifications by some of the defendants to\n\nhide their true identities and escape detection and punishment.\"\n\nThis ground is much more problematic in light of Krulewitch, 336\n\nU.S. at 443-44, but the other ground suffices to admit the\n\nstatements.\n\n           We do not reach the government's alternate ground, that\n\nthe statements are admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n\n\n     6     Diaz-Nevarro testified as to two statements Vega-Coreano made\nto her. Vega-Coreano told Diaz-Nevarro on the day of the robbery that\nRamos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez \"went to Ponce\" (the location of\nthe robbery), and, when Diaz-Nevarro mentioned news coverage of the\nrobbery, Vega-Coreano said \"it was them.\" The two Vega-Coreano\nstatements are attacked as not being in furtherance of the conspiracy;\nbut they may be understood as an effort by the one woman implicitly to\nsecure the silence of the other.\n           Mojica-Baez also challenges Diaz-Nevarro's testimony that,\ntwo days after the robbery, she overheard two of the conspirators\ndescribing to Vega-Coreano how a guard was hit. Mojica-Baez describes\nthe statement Diaz-Nevarro overheard as coming from Reyes-Hernandez and\nLanda-Rivera. Diaz-Nevarro testified, however, that she heard Reyes-\nHernandez making this statement. We assume this is the statement to\nwhich Mojica-Baez raises an objection. We do not decide whether this\nconversation was in furtherance of the conspiracy, as, even if it was\nerror to admit the statement, any error was harmless in light of all\nthe other testimony Diaz-Nevarro gave.\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f807, the residual hearsay exception.\n\n7. Cumulative Evidentiary Errors\n\n          The defendants also appear to argue that even if any\n\nerror in admitting a particular item of evidence was harmless,\n\nthe cumulative effects of the errors denied them a fair trial.\n\nSee United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir.\n\n1993). Given our rulings on the evidentiary issues and the very\n\nlimited number of errors we have deemed harmless, there is\n\nnothing to this argument.\n\nC.   Limiting Instructions\n\n          Cartagena-Merced says instructions should have been\n\ngiven limiting to other defendants the testimony of Nevarez-\n\nMarrero, the flight evidence, and the evidence of use of false\n\nidentification cards.        No such limiting instructions were\n\nsought, and it was hardly plain error, much less an abuse of\n\ndiscretion,   for   the   district     court   not   to   give   those\n\ninstructions sua sponte.\n\n          Cartagena-Merced also seeks to attack the admissibility\n\nof the Diaz-Nevarro testimony and the tools of the trade\n\nevidence, attacks that we have already rejected.\n\nD.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n                                -31-\n\f1.   Mojica-Baez\n\n          Mojica-Baez's defense theory apparently was that he was\n\na 19-year-old innocent and that it was his 40-year-old uncle,\n\nBaez-Gonzalez, who was one of the robbers.          There was evidence,\n\nthough, that Mojica-Baez was at Ramos-Cartagena's house almost\n\ndaily during the two weeks preceding the robbery, that he loaded\n\nweapons at the house the day before the robbery, and that, after\n\nthe robbery, he embraced Vega-Coreano, saying \"We did it.              We\n\ndid it,\" or \"We won, we won.\" Mojica-Baez told Nevarez-Marrero\n\nthat he (Mojica-Baez) had given his uncle money from the Loomis\n\nFargo robbery for safekeeping and that he was worried his uncle\n\nwas squealing on him.        AK-47 ammunition and part of the barrel\n\nof an assault rifle were found in his home.            Further, Mojica-\n\nBaez was arrested while traveling from hotel to hotel after the\n\nrobbery with Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-Hernandez, and Vega-Coreano.\n\nThe evidence was sufficient.\n\n2.   Cartagena-Merced\n\n          Cartagena-Merced offered an alibi defense that he was\n\nat a birthday party for his mother the day of the robbery until\n\nsome   time   after   8:00    p.m.,   and   he   produced   a   photograph\n\nallegedly showing him at the party.         If he had been at the party\n\n                                   -32-\n\funtil at least 8:00 p.m., he could not have been at the robbery.\n\nClose scrutiny of the photo showed Cartagena-Merced was wearing\n\na watch, and, according to the government's expert, the time on\n\nthe watch was either 12:15 or 3:00.7     His false alibi was itself\n\nevidence of guilt.\n\n          Cartagena-Merced ultimately premises his insufficiency\n\nargument on the alleged \"Limiting Instruction\" errors discussed\n\nabove.    There were no such errors and the argument fails.\n\nCartagena-Merced was seen at Ramos-Cartagena's house regularly\n\nduring the two weeks prior to the robbery; he arrived at the\n\nhouse just after the robbery with Mojica-Baez (who then embraced\n\nVega-Coreano and exclaimed that they had been successful); and\n\nFBI agents found a McDonald's bag containing $2,500 hidden in a\n\nmattress and over $1,000 in a box and between the pages of a\n\nmagazine at his house.     The evidence was sufficient to sustain\n\nthe conviction.\n\n\n     7     Cartagena-Merced's expert stated that the watch showed 7:10.\nHowever, both Cartagena-Merced's expert and the government's expert\nagreed that the photo from the previous frame on the roll (which was\nnot of Cartagena-Merced and which, if the photos in fact came from the\nsame roll, had to have been taken prior to the photo of Cartagena-\nMerced) included a watch showing 7:50. Thus, the jury was entitled to\ndiscredit Cartagena-Merced's expert's opinion that Cartagena-Merced's\nwatch showed 7:10 and to infer that the photo of Cartagena-Merced was\ntaken at 12:15 or 3:00 some time after the party.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fE.   Sentencing\n\n1. Use of Semi-Automatic Assault Weapon\n\n           Mojica Baez, Reyes-Hernandez, and Ramos-Cartagena say\n\nthat they should not have been sentenced to the mandatory ten\n\nyears imprisonment on Count 5 of the indictment for use of a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon.    See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A),\n\n(B).    Use of an ordinary firearm results in a sentence of not\n\nless than 5 years imprisonment.       See id.   §   924(c)(1)(A).\n\nSubsection (B) of the statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n           If the firearm possessed by a person convicted of a\n           violation of this subsection -- (i) is a short-\n           barreled    rifle,   short-barreled    shotgun,   or\n           semiautomatic assault weapon, the person shall be\n           sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than\n           10 years . . . .\n\nId. § 924(c)(1)(B).   A violation of § 924(c)(1) was charged in\n\nthe indictment without reference to subsection (B) and without\n\nany reference to the type of weapon used.   Reyes-Hernandez made\n\nan objection at sentencing that there was inadequate evidence to\n\nsupport the conclusion that a semiautomatic assault weapon was\n\nused.\n\na. Effect of Castillo\n\n           After this appeal was briefed, the Supreme Court\n\n\n                              -34-\n\fdecided that the distinctions in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) between\n\ntypes of firearms (which result in different sentences), were\n\nelements of separate crimes and not just sentencing factors.\n\nSee Castillo v. United States, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 2091 (2000).\n\nThis       means    that   the   question   of   whether   a   firearm     is   a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon must (1) go to the jury, not the\n\njudge, and (2) be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, not by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, as is true with sentencing\n\nfactors.       See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 2362-63\n\n(2000) (\"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact\n\nthat increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\n\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\"); Sustache-Rivera v. United States, No. 99-\n\n2128, 2000 WL 1015879, at *1 (1st Cir. July 25, 2000).                   At our\n\nrequest, counsel filed supplemental briefs on the effect of\n\nCastillo on this case.\n\n              The    only   objections      at   sentencing    regarding    the\n\n§ 924(c)(1) conviction did not encompass Castillo's distinction\n\nbetween sentencing factors and elements.8 Nor were the arguments\n\n       8   Although Reyes-Hernandez argues that his objection at\nsentencing -- that there was insufficient evidence with regard to the\ntype of the weapons used -- encompassed Castillo's distinction between\n\n                                      -35-\n\fin the initial briefs on appeal addressed to this point.             As a\n\nresult, our review of this type of trial error is for plain\n\nerror.   Plain error review requires four showings: that there\n\nwas   error;    that   it   was   plain;    that   the    error   affected\n\nsubstantial rights; and that the error seriously affected the\n\nfairness,      integrity    or    public     reputation     of    judicial\n\nproceedings.     See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 467\n\n(1997); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).              The\n\nfirst two criteria are met here;           there was error, and it was\n\nplain, at least by the time of argument on the direct appeal.\n\nSee Johnson, 520 U.S. at 468.\n\n            The \"affecting substantial rights test\" for trial error\n\nmeans that the error must have caused prejudice.           See Olano, 507\n\nU.S. at 734.     However, unlike the harmless error test, in which\n\nthe government bears the burden of showing that an error did not\n\nresult in any prejudice, the defendant bears the burden of\n\nshowing prejudice under the plain error test.             See id.   Thus,\n\nthe \"affecting substantial rights\" prong of the test is not\n\nsatisfied simply by showing that an element of an offense was\n\n\n\na sentencing factor and an element of the crime, that objection clearly\ndid not address the point.\n\n                                   -36-\n\fnot submitted to the jury. See United States v. Pérez-Montañez,\n\n202 F.3d 434, 442 (1st Cir. 2000), petition for cert. filed on\n\nJuly 5, 2000 (U.S. No. 00-5096); see also Neder v. United\n\nStates, 527 U.S. 1, 15 (1999) (holding that failure to submit an\n\nelement to the jury is trial error, subject to harmless error\n\nreview).     Instead, to show prejudice, the defendants must\n\ndemonstrate that the error \"affected the outcome of the district\n\ncourt proceedings.\" United States v. Colón-Muñoz, 192 F.3d 210,\n\n222 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1559 (2000).\n\n            The trial error alleged under Castillo is the failure\n\nto have submitted the question of whether the robbers used a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon to the jury.      We ask, then, what\n\nprospects there were that submission of the question to the jury\n\nwould have resulted in a different outcome, keeping in mind the\n\nhigher standard of proof required before a jury.      None of the\n\ndefendants' briefs address the key question: whether, given the\n\nevidence actually introduced as to the weapons used, there was\n\nany prejudice from the failure to have submitted the question to\n\nthe jury.    Rather than treat the issue as waived, we address it.\n\nOne of the Loomis Fargo guards testified at trial that one of\n\n                                -37-\n\fthe robbers was carrying an AK-47.           The robbers twice told the\n\nguards they had AK-47 rifles, and AK-47 rounds were found at\n\nsome of the defendants' homes.           One of the robbers claimed that\n\nhis weapon could shoot through cement, and an FBI firearms\n\ninstructor      testified   that    an    AK-47    round   is    capable    of\n\npenetrating cement.     The FBI firearms instructor also testified\n\nthat the weapon in the photograph of Ramos-Cartagena was an AK-\n\n47.    He further testified that an AK-47 can operate either as a\n\nsemiautomatic or as a fully automatic weapon.              In light of this\n\nevidence, the defendants have not met their burden of showing\n\nprejudice, nor would we, applying the fourth Olano factor, find\n\nany miscarriage of justice.\n\n           The defendants' main argument, though, is based upon\n\nthe fact that the indictment only charged them with a violation\n\nof § 924(c)(1) for use of a firearm during the robbery, but did\n\nnot specifically charge them with a violation under subsection\n\n(B) of the statute or state that a semiautomatic assault weapon\n\nwas used in the robbery.      They urge, therefore, that this is not\n\nan instance merely of trial error.              This requires, they say,\n\nthat    their   convictions   for    the    §     924(c)(1)     violation   be\n\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\freversed,9 because such indictment errors are not subject to\n\nharmless or plain error analysis.          In other words, they claim\n\nthat the indictment was fatally deficient, and that this, per\n\nse, requires reversal.       They do not argue that the indictment\n\nfailed to provide them with fair notice of the charge against\n\nthem.\n\n          Mojica-Baez    cites    to     some    recent   cases      for   the\n\nproposition that omission of an element from an indictment is\n\nnever harmless error.    He relies on United States v. Du Bo, 186\n\nF.3d 1177 (9th Cir. 1999) (reversing conviction and dismissing\n\nindictment   for   failure   to   include       element   of   the   charged\n\noffense), but that case involved a timely pre-trial challenge to\n\n\n     9     Defendants' choice of remedy is overreaching. There is no\nquestion that the indictment fairly and adequately charged them with\nthe basic \"use of a firearm\" offense under § 924(c)(1)(A). And there\nis no question that the government proved the elements of that offense\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and that the elements were found by the jury.\nIn fact, there were no objections to the sentencing for the firearm\noffense until the government requested that the court sentence the\ndefendants to the longer term pursuant to the semiautomatic assault\nweapon subsection of the statute, and the objections went only to the\nsufficiency of the evidence.\n           As a result, the only possible relief for the defendants\nwould be a remand for reindictment, see United States v. Spinner, 180\nF.3d 514, 517 (3rd Cir. 1999), or resentencing, see United States v.\nRudisill, No. 99-4588, 2000 WL 620314, at *1 (4th Cir. May 15, 2000)\n(per curiam) (unpublished); United States v. Matthews, 178 F.3d 295,\n301 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 359 (1999). We do not decide\nwhether the proper remedy would be remanding for reindictment or for\nresentencing.\n\n                                  -39-\n\fa deficient indictment. See id. at 1179.                  The case expressly\n\nlimits its analysis to timely challenges.             See id. at 1180 n.3.\n\nIn a later unpublished opinion, that court declined to abandon\n\nharmless error analysis where the claim was not timely made at\n\nor before trial.           See United States v. Woodruff, No. 98-10358,\n\n1999        WL   776213,   at   **1   n.5   (9th   Cir.    Sept.    29,   1999)\n\n(unpublished), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 2202 (2000).                 Closer to\n\ndefendants' mark is the Tenth Circuit's recent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Prentiss, 206 F.3d 960 (10th Cir. 2000),\n\nvacating a conviction based on a post-conviction challenge to an\n\nindictment that had failed to include an element of the crime\n\ncharged.10 See id. at 966. The court described the indictment's\n\nfailure to include all of the essential elements of the offense\n\nand the indictment's lack of other language that would have\n\nremedied the omission as a \"fundamental jurisdictional defect\n\nthat is not subject to harmless error analysis.\"                   Id. at 975.\n\nPrentiss was decided over an argument in dissent that the\n\ndecision was inconsistent with Neder. See Prentiss, 206 F.3d at\n\n       10 It is not clear from the Prentiss opinion whether the court\nvacated the conviction or reversed the conviction. The court simply\nstated that it was vacating the conviction and remanding for further\nproceedings, but in the following sentence it stated that it was\nreversing the conviction. See Prentiss, 206 F.3d at 977.\n\n                                       -40-\n\f978-79 (Baldock, J., dissenting).       The majority thought Neder\n\nwas inapplicable, primarily because Neder involved a failure to\n\nsubmit an element of an offense to a petit jury rather than to\n\na grand jury. See Prentiss, 206 F.3d at 977 n.14.        Furthermore,\n\nthe Third Circuit vacated a guilty plea in United States v.\n\nSpinner, 180 F.3d 514 (3rd Cir. 1999), remanding so that the\n\ndefendant could be reindicted where the original indictment had\n\nfailed to allege the interstate commerce element of the crime.\n\nSee id. at 517. Spinner did not mention Neder and was concerned\n\nwith an element that went to the constitutionally required basis\n\nfor federal jurisdiction.       In addition, in United States v.\n\nRudisill, No. 99-4588, 2000 WL 620314 (4th Cir. May 15, 2000)\n\n(unpublished), the court vacated a sentence where the indictment\n\nhad not referenced the statutory section.           See id. at *1.\n\nRudisill also did not discuss Neder.11\n\n          We accept as true two general propositions.            Those\n\n\n\n     11    These cases may be part of a renewed interest in the role of\nthe grand jury as a bulwark against prosecutorial abuse. See generally\nNational Ass'n of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Federal Grand Jury Reform\nReport & 'Bill of Rights' (2000). As the Du Bo court noted, \"[a]t\ncommon law, 'the most valuable function of the grand jury was . . . to\nstand between the prosecutor and the accused, and to determine whether\nthe charge was founded upon credible testimony . . . .\" Du Bo, 186\nF.3d at 1179 (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 59 (1906)).\n\n                                 -41-\n\fpropositions do not mean, though, that the defendants' argument\n\nis sound.   The first proposition is that an objection that an\n\nindictment fails to state an essential element of an offense\n\n\"shall be noticed by the court at any time during the pendency\n\nof the proceedings.\"        Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2).        This means\n\nthat the defendant may raise the objection for the first time on\n\nappeal or that this court may raise the issue sua sponte.            See\n\nUnited States v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294, 1297 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Seuss, 474 F.2d 385, 387 n.2 (1st Cir. 1973).\n\nThe second proposition is that a statutory citation standing\n\nalone in an indictment does not excuse the government's failure\n\nto set forth each of the elements of an offense.           See Forbes, 16\n\nF.3d at 1297; United States v. McLennan, 672 F.2d 239, 243 (1st\n\nCir. 1982).     An indictment may incorporate the words of a\n\nstatute to set forth the offense, but the statutory language\n\n\"must be accompanied with such a statement of the facts and\n\ncircumstances   as   will    inform   the   accused   of   the   specific\n\noffence, coming under the general description, with which he is\n\ncharged.\"   Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117-18 (1974)\n\n(quoting United States v. Hess, 124 U.S. 483, 487 (1888))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).           We do not decide here\n\n                                  -42-\n\fwhether the indictment was defective or inadequate for its\n\nfailure to do more than refer to the \"use of a firearm\" statute\n\nin the context of accusing defendants of using a firearm in the\n\nrobbery, see id. (stating that, to be adequate, indictment must\n\nfairly inform a defendant of the charges against him and enable\n\nhim to assert a double jeopardy defense to future prosecution),\n\nbut we take it that there is an argument that it was inadequate.\n\nThe government's brief seems to assume, without analysis, that\n\nthe indictment was inadequate.\n\n           The argument that the sentences should be vacated is\n\npremised upon the distinction between \"trial error,\" which is\n\nreviewed    for   prejudice   (discussed      above),   and   the   more\n\nfundamental \"structural error,\" which is per se prejudicial.\n\nCertain categories of error interfere with such basic and\n\nfundamental constitutional protections that they go to the\n\nstructure of our criminal law system. These \"structural errors\"\n\nrequire that convictions, or sentences, be set aside without any\n\nexamination of prejudice because, among other things, it would\n\nbe well-nigh impossible to determine the amount of harm.               The\n\nharm caused by these types of error is surely great, though, as\n\nwhen   a   defendant   is   deprived    of   counsel,   see   Gideon    v.\n\n                                 -43-\n\fWainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), or when the trial judge is\n\nbiased, see Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927).                Other errors\n\nhave   been   designated   as   structural        in   order   to   vindicate\n\ncompelling constitutional policies, such as freeing the trial\n\nand grand jury processes from state-sponsored discrimination in\n\nthe selection of jurors, see Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254\n\n(1986);   preserving   open     and    public     trials,   see     Waller   v.\n\nGeorgia, 467 U.S. 39 (1984); and reinforcing the core of the\n\nprinciple of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases,\n\nsee Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993).\n\n          The error in this case is not of that dimension.                   No\n\ninterest in safeguarding fair trials or vindicating compelling\n\nconstitutional policies would be served by classifying the error\n\nhere as structural.        Nor do we think the integrity of the\n\njudicial system is implicated. See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 469-70.\n\nThe reason the indictment in this case did not specify that a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon or AK-47 had been used in the\n\nrobbery was that circuit precedent at the time did not require\n\nit. After the defendants in this case were convicted, but prior\n\nto their sentencing, we decided that § 924(c)(1)'s subsections\n\ndefined   sentencing   factors        and   not    elements    of    separate\n\n                                  -44-\n\foffenses.     See United States v. Shea, 150 F.3d 44, 51 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1030 (1998).   It is one thing to\n\nvacate a conviction or sentence where the prosecutor failed to\n\nindict in accordance with the current state of the law.    It is\n\nquite another thing to vacate a conviction or sentence based on\n\nan indictment that was entirely proper at the time.       Neither\n\nthe prosecution nor defense counsel in this case anticipated\n\nthat the Supreme Court would rule as it did in Castillo.\n\n            There are some serious harms, to be sure, that can\n\nemerge from flawed indictments.   The most serious may be when a\n\ndefendant is without fair notice of the charges against him.\n\nSee United States v. Murphy, 762 F.2d 1151, 1155 (1st Cir.\n\n1985).   The defendants have not argued on appeal that they\n\nlacked fair notice.     Moreover, when the government requested\n\nthat the defendants be sentenced pursuant to the semiautomatic\n\nassault weapon subsection, the defendants made no claim of lack\n\nof fair notice.    The § 924(c)(1) charge against the defendants\n\nput them on notice that they could be sentenced for using a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon (pursuant to § 924(c)(1)(B)) if the\n\njudge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such a\n\n\n\n                               -45-\n\fweapon had been used.12    We see no unfairness to the defendants\n\nin terms of notice.\n\n          We think we are compelled by the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Neder to subject the indictment error in this case\n\nto plain error review.       In Neder the court held that a jury\n\ninstruction \"that omits an element of the offense does not\n\nnecessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an\n\nunreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence\" and is,\n\ntherefore, subject to harmless error review. Neder, 527 U.S. at\n\n9.   This is so even though the Fifth Amendment requires the\n\ngovernment to prove every element of a criminal offense beyond\n\n\n     12    Whether the use of a semiautomatic assault weapon pursuant\nto subsection (B) of § 924(c)(1) was an element of a separate offense\nor a sentencing factor had not been decided in this circuit at the time\nof the defendants' trial. Defendants had a great incentive to raise\nthe issue because of the less rigorous standard of proof upon which a\njudge could make the finding at sentencing. However, we had already\ndecided, in an analogous context, that the subsections to the federal\ncarjacking statute that provide for longer sentences where a victim\nsuffers bodily injury were sentencing factors, not elements of an\nindependent offense. See United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993,\n1000 (1st Cir. 1995). Other circuits agreed. See, e.g., United States\nv. Oliver, 60 F.3d 547, 552 (9th Cir. 1995); United States v. Williams,\n51 F.3d 1004, 1009 (11th Cir. 1995). These decisions were later\noverturned in Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 251-52 (1999).\nWith regard to § 924(c)(1)'s subsections, at the time of defendants'\ntrial, there was a split among the circuits on the \"sentencing factor\nvs. element\" issue. Compare United States v. Branch, 91 F.3d 699, 737-\n41 (5th Cir. 1996) (sentencing factor), with United States v. Alerta,\n96 F.3d 1230, 1235 (9th Cir. 1996) (element).\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\fa reasonable doubt, see In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970),\n\nand the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury, and not a judge,\n\nfind that the elements of the offense have been proven, see\n\nSullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277 (1993).                 It is true, as\n\nthe    majority   in    Prentiss      says,    that    Neder    was   explicitly\n\nconcerned with the failure to submit an element of an offense to\n\nthe petit jury at trial and not with the failure to present an\n\nelement   to   the     grand   jury    to     secure   an    indictment.       See\n\nPrentiss, 206 F.3d at 977 n.14.                 But we do not think that\n\ndistinction is significant where the indictment provided the\n\ndefendant with fair notice of the charges against him.                         The\n\nNeder court explained that \"most constitutional errors can be\n\nharmless.\"     Neder, 527 U.S. at 8 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n           Prior     to   Neder,      the     Court    had   recognized    other\n\nconstitutional errors that can be harmless.                  See, e.g., Arizona\n\nv. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 310 (1991) (erroneous admission of\n\nevidence in violation of Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-\n\nincrimination may be harmless); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475\n\nU.S.   673,    684   (1986)    (erroneous       exclusion      of   evidence    in\n\nviolation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront\n\n                                       -47-\n\fwitnesses may be harmless).     Against this background, we see no\n\nreason why harmless error review should not apply to the failure\n\nto include an element in an indictment that otherwise provided\n\nthe defendants with fair notice of the charges against them.\n\nCf. United States v. Jackson, 214 F.3d 687, 690 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n(suggesting that harmless error analysis might be appropriate\n\nwhere an element of an offense was not specifically included in\n\nthe indictment or submitted to the jury).\n\n          This approach is consistent with circuit law concerning\n\nother defects in indictments.         See, e.g., United States v.\n\nYefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 894 (1st Cir. 1993) (applying harmless\n\nerror   review   where   indictment   did   not   give   the   defendant\n\nadequate notice of the charges against him, but where adequate\n\nnotice had been given prior to trial).        Even where a defendant\n\nalleges that there was misconduct before the grand jury, the\n\nharmless error test applies. See United States v. Mechanik, 475\n\nU.S. 66, 71-72 (1986); see also United States v. Lamela, 942\n\nF.2d 100, 104 n.7 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          The evidence as to use of semiautomatic assault weapons\n\nwas, at it happens, presented to the petit jury (we are doubtful\n\nthat much rests on it being presented to the jury as opposed to\n\n                                -48-\n\fthe judge).    That evidence may well have also been presented to\n\nthe grand jury; we do not know.     There is no question that the\n\npetit jury in this case would have found that the defendants\n\nused at least one AK-47.    To paraphrase Neder, the indictment's\n\nfailure to charge the defendants under the semiautomatic assault\n\nweapon subsection of the statute did not necessarily render the\n\nindictment unfair or make it an unreliable vehicle with which to\n\ncommence the proceedings in this case.     See Neder, 527 U.S. at\n\n9.   We reject the argument that Castillo requires the sentences\n\nbe vacated based on an error in the indictment.\n\nb.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Viewing the issue not as a Castillo issue but simply\n\nas an issue of whether the trial judge's determination was\n\nsufficiently supported by the record, we find there was no\n\nerror.     The 10-year sentences under § 924(c)(1)(B) for Ramos-\n\nCartagena, Cartagena-Merced, Reyes-Hernandez, and Mojica-Baez\n\nare affirmed.\n\n2.   Landa-Rivera's Sentencing\n\n            Landa-Rivera was convicted of being an accessory after\n\nthe fact to the robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3,\n\n2113(a).    He makes two arguments on appeal.   First he says, and\n\n                                 -49-\n\fthe government agrees, that while he was charged and convicted\n\nfor being an accessory to a simple robbery, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2113(a), he was erroneously sentenced as though he were an\n\naccessory to an armed robbery, see 18 U.S.C. § 2113(d).            The\n\ngovernment asks that this aspect of the sentence be remanded for\n\nresentencing, and we do so.\n\n          Second, Landa-Rivera argues that the district court\n\nerred in calculating his total offense level.          We review the\n\napplicability and interpretation of a sentencing guideline de\n\nnovo, but we review the district court's factual findings at\n\nsentencing only for clear error.        See United States v. Cali, 87\n\nF.3d 571, 575 (1st Cir. 1996).     Landa-Rivera makes two separate\n\nclaims relating to the calculation of his offense level. First,\n\nhe claims the court incorrectly increased his offense level for\n\n\"specific offense characteristics that were known, or reasonably\n\nshould have been known, by the defendant.\"13       U.S.S.G. § 2X3.1,\n\napplication note 1.    According to Landa-Rivera, since being an\n\n\n\n     13    Specifically, he asserts error for the following increases:\nfive levels because of the use of firearms, under U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C); three levels because the guards were restrained and\nfirearms were taken from them, under U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(4)(B), (b)(6);\nand two levels because the guards sustained bodily injuries, under\nU.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(3)(A).\n\n                                 -50-\n\faccessory after the fact is not itself a crime of violence,\n\nsentencing enhancements related to the violent nature of the\n\nrobbery in this case should not apply to him.      He is incorrect.\n\nThe relevant Guidelines sections make clear that the specific\n\ncharacteristics of the underlying offense constitute relevant\n\nconduct for the purpose of calculating an accessory sentence.\n\nApplication note 1 of § 2X3.1 (the accessory after the fact\n\nguideline) references § 1B1.3, application note 10, for purposes\n\nof computing the total offense level.         That note, in turn,\n\nstates, \"In the case of . . . accessory after the fact, the\n\nconduct for which the defendant is accountable includes           all\n\nconduct relevant to determining the offense level for the\n\nunderlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have\n\nbeen known, by the defendant.\"     U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, application\n\nnote 10 (emphasis added).   As a factual matter, there was no\n\nclear error in finding that Landa-Rivera knew or should have\n\nknown of these characteristics of the robbery.        In fact, the\n\nrecord shows that Landa-Rivera recounted the details of the\n\nrobbery to Nevarez-Marrero and Diaz-Nevarro.\n\n         Landa-Rivera's   second   argument   is   that   there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support a finding that he knew or\n\n                              -51-\n\fshould have known that the property of a financial institution\n\nwas taken, see U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(1), and that the total losses\n\nwere over $5 million, see U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(7)(H).          There was\n\nno error.        Landa-Rivera told Nevarez-Marrero that over $5\n\nmillion had been stolen; there was ample evidence that much of\n\nthe money came from banks -- Banco Popular and Banco Santander\n\nin particular; and it was reasonable for the trial judge to\n\nconclude that Landa-Rivera knew or should have known this\n\ninformation.\n\n                                  III.\n\n            The convictions and sentences of defendants Mojica-\n\nBaez, Reyes-Hernandez, Cartagena-Merced, and Ramos-Cartagena are\n\naffirmed.    Defendant Landa-Rivera's conviction is affirmed, but\n\nhis   sentence    is   vacated   and   remanded   for   resentencing   in\n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -52-\n\f",

Three armed men dressed in\nsecurity guard uniforms held up the Loomis, Fargo & Co. armored\ncar depot in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on May 13, 1997, while a fourth\nrobber stood watch outside.   The robbers took the Loomis Fargo\nguards captive as they returned to the company's offices in\narmored vehicles from runs to area banks. All told, the robbers\ngot away with an estimated $5.5 million.      Only about half a\nmillion dollars was recovered; the weapons used were never\nrecovered.   Four of the five defendants involved in this appeal\nwere convicted of the robbery and received sentences ranging\nfrom 308 months to 355 months; the fifth defendant was convicted\nof helping in the aftermath and was sentenced to 150 months\nimprisonment.\n\n         The defendants originally raised a myriad of arguments\n\non appeal.   In addition, after the Supreme Court decided United\n\nStates v. Castillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118373\"><a href=\"/opinion/118373/castillo-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

None of the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fdefendants had raised at trial or on appeal a Castillo claim\n\nthat the use of a semiautomatic assault weapon in the robbery\n\nwas an element -- and not merely a sentencing factor -- of a\n\nfirearms offense.   See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), (B).   This is\n\nour first occasion to discuss the effects of Castillo on trials\n\nand indictments, and our view on the indictment issue is quite\n\ndifferent from the view of another circuit.       Save for one\n\nsentencing issue regarding one defendant -- as to which the\n\ngovernment agrees that there was error and that the matter\n\nshould be remanded -- we reject the defendants' arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\f                                  I.\n\n          The four main defendants are John Alexis Mojica-Baez,\n\nJosue G. Reyes-Hernandez, Nelson Cartagena-Merced, and Jose\n\nRamos-Cartagena.    After a trial lasting almost a month, they\n\nwere convicted of committing the robbery.          Specifically, all\n\nfour of these defendants were convicted of two counts of armed\n\nrobbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2113(a), (d); one count\n\nof assault, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2114(a); one count\n\nof breaking and entering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2117;\n\nand one count of using and carrying a firearm in relation to a\n\ncrime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1).\n\nAnother co-defendant, Rodolfo E. Landa-Rivera, was convicted of\n\nbeing an accessory after the fact to the robbery, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 3, 2113(a).1\n\n          The jury reasonably could have found the following\n\nfacts.   Loomis Fargo2 armored trucks and vans began arriving at\n\nthe Loomis Fargo depot in Ponce shortly after 7 p.m. on May 13,\n\n1997.    The vehicles were returning with cash from the day's\n\n\n     1     We address the appeal of another co-defendant, Jessica Vega-\nCoreano, in United States v. Vega-Coreano, No. 99-1343, in an opinion\npublished simultaneously with this one.\n     2    At the time, the company was named Wells Fargo.\n\n                                 -6-\n\froutes, which included a stop at a United States Post Office and\n\ntwo federally insured banks, Banco Popular and Banco Santander.\n\nWhen one of the guards from the first vehicle to arrive entered\n\nthe depot office, he was met by three men carrying long\n\nfirearms.    They told him it was a hold up and that he was not to\n\nmove or they would shoot him.         The three were dressed in\n\nuniforms similar to Loomis Fargo uniforms and were wearing\n\nbulletproof vests.     As four successive trucks arrived at the\n\ndepot, the three men disarmed the guards, handcuffed them, and\n\nlocked them in a bathroom.     The contents of the Loomis Fargo\n\nvehicles were systematically transferred to a Loomis Fargo van\n\ncommandeered by the robbers.    A fourth person, outside, worked\n\nin tandem with the three fake guards, communicating with them by\n\nwalkie-talkie.\n\n            The robbers were voluble, threatening the guards,\n\ntelling them, \"Last week we had to kill one guy, so you guys\n\nbetter do what we say.\"   They also told the guards several times\n\nhow powerful their weapons were, claiming, \"This AK-47 that I\n\nhave here can actually punch through 12 guys,\" and \"This thing\n\ncan even go through cement.\"      One of the guards recognized a\n\nweapon as an AK-47 and heard one of the robbers say, \"This is an\n\n                                -7-\n\fAK-47, and if I shoot you with this, I'll rip you up.   I'll just\n\nrip a part of you off.\"     Another guard described the firearms\n\ncarried by the robbers as \"assault weapons, big weapons.\"\n\n         The robbers also commented on their professionalism.\n\nOne of the guards testified that the robbers kept saying, \"Look\n\nhow professional we are.     We're really professionals.\"     The\n\nrobbers reiterated that they were professionals, unlike the\n\nother robbers who had been quickly caught after a recent,\n\nunrelated Brinks robbery.\n\n         Once the Loomis Fargo van was loaded, the guard the\n\nrobbers had forced to help them was trussed and pushed into the\n\nsmall bathroom that held nine other guards.     The guards were\n\nthen locked in and they heard the robbers threaten to set the\n\nplace on fire.    It took the guards about forty minutes to free\n\nthemselves; they then called for help.   The handcuffs had to be\n\ncut off of the guards, as the key holes had been soldered (or\n\nwelded) closed.\n\n         The robbers drove the Loomis Fargo van to another\n\nlocation and transferred the money to a different vehicle, but\n\nthey left thirty unopened bags of money in the Loomis Fargo van.\n\n         Evidence tied the defendants to the robbery almost\n\n                               -8-\n\fimmediately afterwards.     When news of the robbery was broadcast\n\non television, Ramos-Cartagena's wife, Jessica Vega-Coreano,\n\ntold Jessica Diaz-Nevarro, a friend and upstairs neighbor, that\n\nRamos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez had committed the robbery.\n\nThe evening of the robbery, Ramos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez\n\narrived back at Ramos-Cartagena's house driving a heavily laden\n\nvan.   Reyes-Hernandez was wearing a uniform similar to a Loomis\n\nFargo uniform.     Ramos-Cartagena ran into the house and asked\n\nVega-Coreano for keys.       He had a cut on his head and was\n\nshirtless.   Vega-Coreano gave him a shirt to put on and asked\n\nwhy they had not gotten rid of the clothes, to which he\n\nresponded, \"Forget the shirt, I need the keys, I want the keys,\n\nbecause we have to leave.\"        He found the keys and drove off.       A\n\nshort time later, Cartagena-Merced and Mojica-Baez arrived.\n\nMojica-Baez appeared happy, and he embraced Vega-Coreano and\n\nsaid, \"We did it.      We did it\" or \"We won, we won.\"         Cartagena-\n\nMerced          also       appeared             to       be        happy.\n\n          The    robbery   was,    of     course,   planned   in   advance.\n\nAccording to Diaz-Nevarro, the defendants met almost daily\n\nduring the two weeks prior the robbery.             Diaz-Nevarro also saw\n\nRamos-Cartagena,    Mojica-Baez,        and    Reyes-Hernandez     loading\n\n                                    -9-\n\fammunition into two long and three short guns the day before the\n\nrobbery. Landa-Rivera, who ultimately took some of the money to\n\nhide, was also seen around the house before the robbery.\n\n          A confidential informant reported to the FBI that\n\nbefore the robbery the defendants had stolen a van in the San\n\nJuan area. After the robbery, a white van containing veterinary\n\nproducts was found in a parking lot near the Loomis Fargo depot.\n\nThe van had been stolen from a veterinary products distributor\n\nabout a week before the robbery.         Diaz-Nevarro testified to\n\nseeing similar veterinary products in Ramos-Cartagena's house,\n\nand, after having obtained warrants to search the defendants'\n\nhomes (based upon information provided by the confidential\n\ninformant), FBI agents found such products when they searched\n\nthe house.\n\n          The searches of the defendants' homes produced a wealth\n\nof other incriminating evidence, including:        $387,000 in cash\n\nburied near Mojica-Baez's uncle's house and $13,000 in cash\n\ninside the house;3 AK-47 ammunition and part of the barrel of an\n\nAR-15 assault rifle at Mojica-Baez's house; $2,500 in cash in a\n\n     3    Mojica-Baez's uncle told police that someone had given him\nthe $13,000 to hold and had told him that it was from the Loomis Fargo\nrobbery.\n\n                                -10-\n\fMcDonald's bag hidden in a mattress and over $1,000 in a box and\n\nin a magazine at Cartagena-Merced's house; a photograph of\n\nRamos-Cartagena holding an AK-47, AK-47 ammunition, police\n\nuniforms similar to Loomis Fargo uniforms, two ski masks, four\n\nboxes of two-way radios, some welding equipment, and wrappers\n\nfrom Banco Popular and Banco Santander at Ramos-Cartagena's\n\nhouse; wrappers from Banco Santander, a bag containing almost\n\n$8,000 in cash, and a $45,000 check from the Lottery of Puerto\n\nRico made out to Reyes-Hernandez's mother and issued a week\n\nafter the robbery4 at Reyes-Hernandez's house; and a total of\n\n$8,800 in cash in Landa-Rivera's car.\n\n          After   their   homes   were   searched,   Ramos-Cartagena,\n\nReyes-Hernandez, Mojica-Baez, and Vega-Coreano traveled together\n\nto the Geminis Hotel and rented rooms there.         From there they\n\nmoved to the Joyuda Beach Parador Hotel, registering for three\n\nrooms under a false name.\n\n          Unable to contain themselves with the riches, some of\n\nthe defendants went on spending sprees.           The day after the\n\n     4     The record does not reveal the government's theory with\nregard to the lottery check. It would seem that the government\nbelieved the check was evidence of money laundering, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197384\"><a href=\"/opinion/197384/united-states-v-gonzalez-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 1997), but there\nis no evidence in the record to that effect.\n\n                                  -11-\n\frobbery, Reyes-Hernandez bought a jet ski for $9,300 in cash\n\n(carried in a plastic grocery bag).       A search of the car in\n\nwhich Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-Hernandez, Mojica-Baez, and Vega-\n\nCoreano were traveling when they were arrested turned up a\n\njewelry store receipt for a $900 cash purchase of two watches.\n\nCash abounded.\n\n          Unable to contain themselves verbally, the different\n\ndefendants made incriminating statements to others.     Two days\n\nafter the robbery, Diaz-Nevarro overheard Reyes-Hernandez, in\n\nthe presence of Ramos-Cartagena, detailing what happened at the\n\nLoomis   Fargo   office   to   Vega-Coreano.   Diaz-Nevarro   also\n\noverheard Landa-Rivera describing to Vega-Coreano how the guards\n\nhad been tied up as they arrived at the depot.       Diaz-Nevarro\n\ntestified that Ramos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez were laughing\n\nin response.     Once arrested, Reyes-Hernandez, Ramos-Cartagena,\n\nand Landa-Rivera told a fellow jailmate, Luis Nevarez-Marrero,\n\ndetails of the planning and execution of the crime and their\n\nefforts to get away.      When arrested, Landa-Rivera told police\n\nthat he had been paid $6,000 to watch over two suitcases\n\ncontaining $200,000 each from the Loomis Fargo robbery.\n\n          After he was arrested, Ramos-Cartagena told an FBI\n\n                                 -12-\n\fagent, \"We were millionaires for a short time.\"           The jury\n\ndecided that statement was true.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Many of the arguments are joined by several of the\n\ndefendants    and   we   cluster    them.   We   deal   first   with\n\njurisdictional arguments, then with evidentiary objections.       As\n\nthe defendants argue that their evidentiary objections are\n\nprecursors to their sufficiency of the evidence arguments, we\n\nnext deal with those sufficiency arguments.

Recognizing its blunder,\n\nthe    prosecution     requested     that     the    court       reopen   the\n\nprosecution's case in chief to permit it to present such\n\nevidence or, alternatively, that the court take judicial notice\n\nof the fact that Banco Popular and Banco Santander are insured\n\nby the FDIC.     The district court then indicated its inclination\n\nto reopen to correct a \"purely technical\" error and urged the\n\nparties to enter into a stipulation.

With regard to\n\nhis conviction   on   this   count,    Ramos-Cartegena     presses   two\n\narguments. First, he says, § 2114 is limited to offenses having\n\na \"postal nexus,\" and, although the jury instruction indicated\n\nthat the jury needed to find that postal service money was\n\nstolen, the indictment failed specifically to allege that the\n\nstolen money belonged to the United States Postal Service.\n\nSecond, he says there was insufficient evidence for the jury to\n\nfind that the money belonged to the United States Postal\n\nService. In fact, there was testimony from a Loomis Fargo guard\n\nthat he had stopped at a United States Post Office before the\n\nrobbers emptied his truck of its contents at the depot, and\n\ndocuments were   introduced    estimating    losses   to   the   postal\n\nservice of over $2 million.     The evidence was sufficient, and\n\nthe indictment, which referenced the statute and specifically\n\ncharged the robbers with stealing money belonging to the United\n\nStates, adequately and fairly charged the crime.\n\nB.

Admission of Hearsay Statement of Deceased Informant\n\n         At trial, FBI Agent Raymond Lopez testified that, as\n\na result of information from a confidential informant, he\n\nprepared an affidavit that led to warrants to search the four\n\nmain defendants' homes on May 23, 1997.         Agent Lopez said that\n\nthe informant    had   provided   information    that    was   detailed,\n\nspecific, and consistent with information that was not publicly\n\navailable. As a condition of the admissibility of Agent Lopez's\n\ntestimony as to what he was told by the informant, the court\n\ninquired into why the informant was not available to testify.\n\nThe response was that he had been murdered.             Defense counsel\n\nmoved for a mistrial, which was denied, or for an instruction.\n\nThe court, in response, simply instructed the jury that the\n\nreason the informant was not there was that he was dead.\n\n         Agent    Lopez,   over    objection,    testified     that   the\n\ninformant had told him that two weeks before the robbery \"this\n\ngroup\" had stolen a white van in the metropolitan San Juan area\n\nin order to commit the Loomis Fargo robbery; that they had\n\n                                  -16-\n\ftinted the windows of the van to make it look like a standard\n\nLoomis Fargo van; and that the van could be found at a K-Mart\n\nshopping plaza near the Loomis Fargo depot.              The van was found\n\nthere. The ostensible purpose of the testimony was to establish\n\nthat the stolen van had been used in the robbery, and the agent\n\nnever explicitly testified that the informant meant that the\n\ndefendants on trial constituted \"this group.\"              The court found\n\nthat   the    information   from      the    informant    had     sufficient\n\nguarantees of trustworthiness to be admissible hearsay under\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 807.\n\n             The court, apparently recognizing in hindsight the\n\ndangers posed by the testimony that the informant had been\n\nmurdered, instructed the jury the next day that there was no\n\nclaim that the informant’s death was related to the case and\n\nthat his death could not be considered against any defendant.\n\n             The defendants level two objections. First, they claim\n\nit was error for the court to have allowed the government to\n\nintroduce     evidence   that   the   informant     had    been   murdered.\n\nSecond, they argue that the informants' statements did not meet\n\nthe trustworthiness requirements established under Ohio v.\n\nRoberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (1980).            This error, they say, denied\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthem their Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the\n\nwitnesses against them.     See Lilly v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118300\"><a href=\"/opinion/118300/lilly-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n139 (1999).\n\n         The testimony that the witness was unavailable because\n\nhe had been murdered was unfortunate, and the trial judge's\n\ninitial instruction was insufficient.     It would have been far\n\nbetter if the trial judge had immediately made clear that there\n\nwas no claim, implicit or explicit, that these defendants were\n\nsomehow responsible for the murder. If matters had been left at\n\nthat, the defendants would have a very serious claim.          But\n\nmatters were not left at that; the court quickly corrected the\n\nerror as its first order of business the next morning.     That was\n\nsufficient.\n\n         The second attack, based on Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n807, rests on the premise that the informant's statements lacked\n\ncommon attributes of trustworthiness: the informant never gave\n\nhis statement under oath, and he never claimed to be an\n\neyewitness.   Moreover, his unavailability cannot be attributed\n\nto the defendants so as to warrant admission of his statement.\n\n         Under   Roberts,   hearsay   statements   are   considered\n\nsufficiently trustworthy when the evidence either falls within\n\n                               -18-\n\fa firmly rooted hearsay exception or it possesses particularized\n\nguarantees of trustworthiness.

The\n\ninformant's statements do not fall within the category of a\n\nfirmly rooted hearsay exception, so we look for any guarantees\n\nof   trustworthiness.    The   justification   for   a   finding   of\n\ntrustworthiness in this case is very thin, and the record on the\n\npoint is sparse.    But this is not a case in which the issue is\n\nimportant to the outcome.   The testimony was admitted primarily\n\nto show that the defendants stole the van (from which the\n\ninference could be drawn that they stole it to use in the\n\nrobbery).   This fact was established by evidence regarding the\n\nveterinary products (1) that the van's owner testified were in\n\nthe van when it was stolen; (2) that Diaz-Nevarro saw in Ramos-\n\nCartagena's house; (3) that the FBI found in Ramos-Cartagena's\n\nhouse; and (4) that the FBI found in the stolen van.      Moreover,\n\nthere was considerable other evidence linking the defendants to\n\nthe robbery.   If there was any error, it was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.    See Chapman v.

The claim is that two prosecution witnesses received\n\nsomething of value from the government in return for their\n\ntestimony, to wit, a reduced sentence and a cash stipend\n\nrespectively, and that this violates 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2),\n\nwhich prohibits offering \"anything of value\" as an inducement to\n\na witness.

Exclusion of Melendez testimony\n\n           The defendants wanted to put on evidence from Tomas\n\nMelendez attacking the credibility of FBI agent Carlos Cintron,\n\nwho gave testimony inculpating the defendants.              In particular,\n\nthey wanted to attack the investigation performed by the agent.\n\n           The issue of the exclusion of such evidence is,\n\nhowever, more complicated than that.           The first salvo by the\n\ndefense   was    to   move   to     dismiss   the    second    superceding\n\nindictment, supporting       that    motion   with   an   affidavit    from\n\n                                    -20-\n\fMelendez   to    the   effect    that    the   indictment    was   based    on\n\nstatements from Melendez and that Melendez had been coached on\n\nwhat to say by agent Cintron.          In response to this, the district\n\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing and heard Melendez testify.\n\nThe court found that Melendez had committed perjury and ordered\n\nhis imprisonment.       The agent next testified.           In the end, the\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss the second superceding indictment\n\nand proceeded at trial only on the first superceding indictment.\n\n           Agent Cintron testified at trial.           Cintron testified\n\nthat he participated in the arrests of Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-\n\nHernandez, Mojica-Baez, and Vega-Coreano on May 28, 1997, at the\n\nJoyuda Beach Parador, and he identified evidence obtained at the\n\ntime of the arrests. The evidence included false identification\n\ncards and a receipt for a May 21, 1997, cash purchase of two\n\nexpensive watches, both found in Vega-Coreano's handbag; false\n\nidentification cards in Ramos-Cartagena’s wallet; more than\n\n$1,000    in    cash   taken    from    Reyes-Hernandez's      person;     and\n\nnewspapers with stories about the Loomis Fargo robbery. Cintron\n\nalso testified that Landa-Rivera provided a false name upon his\n\narrest.\n\n           After the agent's examination, the defendants indicated\n\n                                       -21-\n\fthey wanted to subpoena the agent to testify in their case.   The\n\ncourt, noting the agent had an obligation to testify in another\n\ncourt a few days hence, offered the defendants the opportunity\n\nto call him as their witness at that time.   The court also noted\n\nthat it would not permit testimony on the matters already\n\ncovered at the evidentiary hearing, that is, matters regarding\n\nthe second superceding indictment.   At the end of the day, the\n\ndefendants pressed the issue and said they wanted to inquire\n\nabout the limits and inadequacy of the investigation. The trial\n\njudge said those matters could have been covered on cross-\n\nexamination and that this agent played only a limited role in\n\nthe investigation, but that he would allow the defendants to\n\nrecall Agent Cintron if, after a proffer outside of the jury, he\n\nwas convinced counsel was not attempting to reintroduce the\n\nMelendez issue related to the second superceding indictment.\n\n         Later in the trial, counsel for Ramos-Cartagena asked\n\nthe court to permit Melendez to testify. The defense theory was\n\nthat a cursory investigation had been done -- that once a few\n\npieces of seemingly incriminatory evidence were found, the\n\nauthorities concentrated on trying to link what was found in\n\nRamos-Cartagena's house with the Loomis Fargo robbery.     This,\n\n                              -22-\n\fthey contended, evidenced bias by the government, and that bias\n\nwas exemplified by Melendez being used by Cintron to obtain the\n\nsecond superceding indictment.   The government responded that\n\nwhile that argument may have been relevant to the second\n\nsuperceding indictment, that indictment had been dismissed, and\n\nthe argument was not relevant to the charges before the jury.\n\nDefense counsel countered that the testimony of two other\n\nwitnesses buttressed their claim that the government had not\n\nadequately investigated the crime, and the government agreed\n\nthat Agent Cintron could be brought back so those points could\n\nbe pursued.   The defendants pressed for permission to call\n\nMelendez as a witness, but the court refused, saying Melendez\n\nhad committed perjury.   Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-Hernandez, and\n\nMojica-Baez claim the district court erred in not allowing them\n\nto call Melendez as a witness.\n\n         The district court did not abuse its discretion.   As\n\nthe trial judge recognized, there was considerable danger in\n\ngetting into a peripheral matter that had already been disposed\n\nof -- the second superceding indictment. The probative value of\n\nMelendez's testimony to the defendants' attempt to attack the\n\ngovernment’s investigation was weak, at best.   The defendants\n\n                             -23-\n\fhad a number of opportunities to make such an attack, some of\n\nwhich they took.         They had the opportunity to recall agent\n\nCintron and chose not take it.              The trial judge’s ruling,\n\nparticularly with regard to a witness already determined to be\n\na perjurer, was eminently reasonable.\n\n           We   need     not   address    the   government’s     additional\n\nargument   that    the     proposed      Melendez   testimony    would    be\n\nprohibited under Federal Rule of Evidence 608 as impeachment by\n\nextrinsic evidence.\n\n4. Admission of Tools of the Trade\n\n           During the robbery, the gunmen bragged that they were\n\n\"professionals.\"       At trial, the government put in certain\n\nphysical evidence seized from the defendants' homes on the\n\ntheory   that   the    items   were   the    \"tools   of   the   trade\"   of\n\nprofessional robbers. The evidence included ski masks, bullets,\n\na blue police emergency light, and police uniforms.               There was\n\nno claim by the government that these were used during the\n\nLoomis Fargo robbery.\n\n           Reyes-Hernandez, Ramos-Cartagena, and Mojica-Baez claim\n\nthe evidence is impermissible character propensity evidence\n\nbarred by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) and that it should\n\n                                   -24-\n\fhave been excluded as overly prejudicial under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.\n\n         There was no error.   Disguises are common tools of the\n\ntrade and have been found admissible even if not used in the\n\ncrime charged.   See, e.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198241\"><a href=\"/opinion/198241/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705 (1st Cir. 1998).        There was no unfair\n\nprejudice to the defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f5. Admission of Redacted Post-Arrest Admission of Papo, a Co-\n\nDefendant Not On Trial\n\n            Rafael A. Baez-Gonzalez was a charged co-defendant who\n\nwas not on trial with these defendants.              On May 23, 1997, FBI\n\nagents went to his house and found almost $400,000 hidden on the\n\nproperty.     After he received his Miranda warnings, he signed a\n\nwaiver   of   rights   and    gave    a     statement.     Baez-Gonzalez's\n\nstatement,    redacted   to    remove       the   names   of   some    of   the\n\ndefendants, was admitted at trial through the testimony of an\n\nFBI agent.    The statement was that one week before the robbery\n\nan individual told Baez-Gonzalez that he (the individual) would\n\nbe coming into some large money and asked Baez-Gonzalez whether\n\nhe would hold the money for him; and further, that the Friday or\n\nSaturday after the robbery, the individual told Baez-Gonzalez\n\nthat the money was from the Loomis Fargo robbery.\n\n            Baez-Gonzalez’s redacted statement did not identify any\n\nof the defendants. Other evidence identified Mojica-Baez as the\n\nindividual. Specifically, Nevarez-Marrero (the fellow jailmate)\n\ntestified that Mojica-Baez had told him that \"somebody had taken\n\nfrom one of his uncles almost half a million dollars, and he was\n\nthinking that his own uncle was squealing on him.\"                    Nevarez-\n\n                                     -26-\n\fMarrero further testified that Mojica-Baez had told him that the\n\nmoney was \"[f]rom the holdup\" and that he (Mojica-Baez) had\n\n\"given it to his uncle for safekeeping.\"         While there was an\n\noverruled objection to Nevarez-Marrero’s statement, there was no\n\nobjection to the FBI agent's testimony about Baez-Gonzalez's\n\nstatement.   A Bruton objection was initially made to the Baez-\n\nGonzalez statement, see Bruton v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span>\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1968), but it was withdrawn upon counsel's learning that the\n\nstatement was redacted.5     Thus, there was no relevant objection\n\nto the Baez-Gonzalez statement, although the issue is now\n\npursued on appeal by Mojica-Baez and Cartagena-Merced.\n\n          There was no clear theory of admissibility for Baez-\n\nGonzalez's statement; there is no evidence from the record that\n\nthe statement was admitted as a co-conspirator statement, and no\n\nPetrozziello ruling was made as to the statement.          See United\n\nStates v. Petrozziello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).           But\n\nthe defendants did not make these points at trial and so are in\n\na very weak position to argue them now.\n\n          The government urges that if there were any error, it\n\n     5    Reyes-Hernandez initially objected on the assumption that the\ngovernment was going to seek to introduce the statement as a\ndeclaration against interest.\n\n                                 -27-\n\fwas harmless. The defendants say that the claimed error was not\n\nharmless, because if the Baez-Gonzalez statement had not been\n\nadmitted, the jury would have found that Nevarez-Marrero’s\n\nstatement, which was admissible, was not credible.\n\n             If there was any error, it was harmless. Baez-Gonzalez\n\nwas Mojica-Baez’s uncle; a huge and unexplained sum of money was\n\nfound buried at his home; and, considering the other evidence\n\nthat    linked     Mojica-Baez     with    the   robbery,    a   jury   could\n\nreasonably infer that it came from Mojica-Baez, whether or not\n\nBaez-Gonzalez's statement came in.               The inference was given\n\ngreater strength by Nevarez-Marrero’s recounting of Mojica-\n\nBaez’s own words.\n\n6. Admission of Co-Conspirators' Statements\n\n             Mojica-Baez argues that it was a Petrozziello violation\n\nfor    the   district     court    to    allow   Diaz-Nevarro    to   testify\n\nregarding statements made by co-conspirators after the robbery\n\nhad been committed and to admit the statement Baez-Gonzalez gave\n\nfollowing his arrest.

Baez-\n\nGonzalez's statement, which was not explicitly admitted as a co-\n\nconspirator statement, was discussed above.\n\n             The   main   attack    launched     is   that   Diaz-Nevarro's\n\n                                        -28-\n\ftestimony involved statements that were made after the robbery\n\nand, thus, after the conspiracy ended.   There is a distinction,\n\nfor purposes of the co-conspirator statement exception to the\n\nhearsay rule, between an initial conspiracy to commit a crime\n\nand later actions to conceal the crime.

Vega-Coreano told Diaz-Nevarro on the day of the robbery that\nRamos-Cartagena and Reyes-Hernandez \"went to Ponce\" (the location of\nthe robbery), and, when Diaz-Nevarro mentioned news coverage of the\nrobbery, Vega-Coreano said \"it was them.\" The two Vega-Coreano\nstatements are attacked as not being in furtherance of the conspiracy;\nbut they may be understood as an effort by the one woman implicitly to\nsecure the silence of the other.\n           Mojica-Baez also challenges Diaz-Nevarro's testimony that,\ntwo days after the robbery, she overheard two of the conspirators\ndescribing to Vega-Coreano how a guard was hit. Mojica-Baez describes\nthe statement Diaz-Nevarro overheard as coming from Reyes-Hernandez and\nLanda-Rivera. Diaz-Nevarro testified, however, that she heard Reyes-\nHernandez making this statement. We assume this is the statement to\nwhich Mojica-Baez raises an objection. We do not decide whether this\nconversation was in furtherance of the conspiracy, as, even if it was\nerror to admit the statement, any error was harmless in light of all\nthe other testimony Diaz-Nevarro gave.\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f807, the residual hearsay exception.\n\n7. Cumulative Evidentiary Errors\n\n          The defendants also appear to argue that even if any\n\nerror in admitting a particular item of evidence was harmless,\n\nthe cumulative effects of the errors denied them a fair trial.\n\nSee United States v. Sepulveda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1195-96 (1st Cir.\n\n1993). Given our rulings on the evidentiary issues and the very\n\nlimited number of errors we have deemed harmless, there is\n\nnothing to this argument.\n\nC.   Limiting Instructions\n\n          Cartagena-Merced says instructions should have been\n\ngiven limiting to other defendants the testimony of Nevarez-\n\nMarrero, the flight evidence, and the evidence of use of false\n\nidentification cards.        No such limiting instructions were\n\nsought, and it was hardly plain error, much less an abuse of\n\ndiscretion,   for   the   district     court   not   to   give   those\n\ninstructions sua sponte.\n\n          Cartagena-Merced also seeks to attack the admissibility\n\nof the Diaz-Nevarro testimony and the tools of the trade\n\nevidence, attacks that we have already rejected.\n\nD.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n                                -31-\n\f1.   Mojica-Baez\n\n          Mojica-Baez's defense theory apparently was that he was\n\na 19-year-old innocent and that it was his 40-year-old uncle,\n\nBaez-Gonzalez, who was one of the robbers.          There was evidence,\n\nthough, that Mojica-Baez was at Ramos-Cartagena's house almost\n\ndaily during the two weeks preceding the robbery, that he loaded\n\nweapons at the house the day before the robbery, and that, after\n\nthe robbery, he embraced Vega-Coreano, saying \"We did it.              We\n\ndid it,\" or \"We won, we won.\" Mojica-Baez told Nevarez-Marrero\n\nthat he (Mojica-Baez) had given his uncle money from the Loomis\n\nFargo robbery for safekeeping and that he was worried his uncle\n\nwas squealing on him.        AK-47 ammunition and part of the barrel\n\nof an assault rifle were found in his home.            Further, Mojica-\n\nBaez was arrested while traveling from hotel to hotel after the\n\nrobbery with Ramos-Cartagena, Reyes-Hernandez, and Vega-Coreano.\n\nThe evidence was sufficient.\n\n2.   Cartagena-Merced\n\n          Cartagena-Merced offered an alibi defense that he was\n\nat a birthday party for his mother the day of the robbery until\n\nsome   time   after   8:00    p.m.,   and   he   produced   a   photograph\n\nallegedly showing him at the party.         If he had been at the party\n\n                                   -32-\n\funtil at least 8:00 p.m., he could not have been at the robbery.\n\nClose scrutiny of the photo showed Cartagena-Merced was wearing\n\na watch, and, according to the government's expert, the time on\n\nthe watch was either 12:15 or 3:00.7     His false alibi was itself\n\nevidence of guilt.\n\n          Cartagena-Merced ultimately premises his insufficiency\n\nargument on the alleged \"Limiting Instruction\" errors discussed\n\nabove.    There were no such errors and the argument fails.\n\nCartagena-Merced was seen at Ramos-Cartagena's house regularly\n\nduring the two weeks prior to the robbery; he arrived at the\n\nhouse just after the robbery with Mojica-Baez (who then embraced\n\nVega-Coreano and exclaimed that they had been successful); and\n\nFBI agents found a McDonald's bag containing $2,500 hidden in a\n\nmattress and over $1,000 in a box and between the pages of a\n\nmagazine at his house.     The evidence was sufficient to sustain\n\nthe conviction.\n\n\n     7     Cartagena-Merced's expert stated that the watch showed 7:10.\nHowever, both Cartagena-Merced's expert and the government's expert\nagreed that the photo from the previous frame on the roll (which was\nnot of Cartagena-Merced and which, if the photos in fact came from the\nsame roll, had to have been taken prior to the photo of Cartagena-\nMerced) included a watch showing 7:50. Thus, the jury was entitled to\ndiscredit Cartagena-Merced's expert's opinion that Cartagena-Merced's\nwatch showed 7:10 and to infer that the photo of Cartagena-Merced was\ntaken at 12:15 or 3:00 some time after the party.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fE.   Sentencing\n\n1. Use of Semi-Automatic Assault Weapon\n\n           Mojica Baez, Reyes-Hernandez, and Ramos-Cartagena say\n\nthat they should not have been sentenced to the mandatory ten\n\nyears imprisonment on Count 5 of the indictment for use of a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon.    See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A),\n\n(B).    Use of an ordinary firearm results in a sentence of not\n\nless than 5 years imprisonment.

As a\n\nresult, our review of this type of trial error is for plain\n\nerror.   Plain error review requires four showings: that there\n\nwas   error;    that   it   was   plain;    that   the    error   affected\n\nsubstantial rights; and that the error seriously affected the\n\nfairness,      integrity    or    public     reputation     of    judicial\n\nproceedings.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1559</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(2000).\n\n            The trial error alleged under Castillo is the failure\n\nto have submitted the question of whether the robbers used a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon to the jury.      We ask, then, what\n\nprospects there were that submission of the question to the jury\n\nwould have resulted in a different outcome, keeping in mind the\n\nhigher standard of proof required before a jury.      None of the\n\ndefendants' briefs address the key question: whether, given the\n\nevidence actually introduced as to the weapons used, there was\n\nany prejudice from the failure to have submitted the question to\n\nthe jury.    Rather than treat the issue as waived, we address it.\n\nOne of the Loomis Fargo guards testified at trial that one of\n\n                                -37-\n\fthe robbers was carrying an AK-47.           The robbers twice told the\n\nguards they had AK-47 rifles, and AK-47 rounds were found at\n\nsome of the defendants' homes.           One of the robbers claimed that\n\nhis weapon could shoot through cement, and an FBI firearms\n\ninstructor      testified   that    an    AK-47    round   is    capable    of\n\npenetrating cement.     The FBI firearms instructor also testified\n\nthat the weapon in the photograph of Ramos-Cartagena was an AK-\n\n47.    He further testified that an AK-47 can operate either as a\n\nsemiautomatic or as a fully automatic weapon.              In light of this\n\nevidence, the defendants have not met their burden of showing\n\nprejudice, nor would we, applying the fourth Olano factor, find\n\nany miscarriage of justice.\n\n           The defendants' main argument, though, is based upon\n\nthe fact that the indictment only charged them with a violation\n\nof § 924(c)(1) for use of a firearm during the robbery, but did\n\nnot specifically charge them with a violation under subsection\n\n(B) of the statute or state that a semiautomatic assault weapon\n\nwas used in the robbery.      They urge, therefore, that this is not\n\nan instance merely of trial error.              This requires, they say,\n\nthat    their   convictions   for    the    §     924(c)(1)     violation   be\n\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\freversed,9 because such indictment errors are not subject to\n\nharmless or plain error analysis.          In other words, they claim\n\nthat the indictment was fatally deficient, and that this, per\n\nse, requires reversal.       They do not argue that the indictment\n\nfailed to provide them with fair notice of the charge against\n\nthem.\n\n          Mojica-Baez    cites    to     some    recent   cases      for   the\n\nproposition that omission of an element from an indictment is\n\nnever harmless error.    He relies on United States v. Du Bo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765599\"><a href=\"/opinion/765599/united-states-v-du-bo/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(9th Cir. 1999) (reversing conviction and dismissing\n\nindictment   for   failure   to   include       element   of   the   charged\n\noffense), but that case involved a timely pre-trial challenge to\n\n\n     9     Defendants' choice of remedy is overreaching. There is no\nquestion that the indictment fairly and adequately charged them with\nthe basic \"use of a firearm\" offense under § 924(c)(1)(A).

It is one thing to\n\nvacate a conviction or sentence where the prosecutor failed to\n\nindict in accordance with the current state of the law.    It is\n\nquite another thing to vacate a conviction or sentence based on\n\nan indictment that was entirely proper at the time.       Neither\n\nthe prosecution nor defense counsel in this case anticipated\n\nthat the Supreme Court would rule as it did in Castillo.\n\n            There are some serious harms, to be sure, that can\n\nemerge from flawed indictments.   The most serious may be when a\n\ndefendant is without fair notice of the charges against him.\n\nSee United States v.

The defendants have not argued on appeal that they\n\nlacked fair notice.     Moreover, when the government requested\n\nthat the defendants be sentenced pursuant to the semiautomatic\n\nassault weapon subsection, the defendants made no claim of lack\n\nof fair notice.    The § 924(c)(1) charge against the defendants\n\nput them on notice that they could be sentenced for using a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon (pursuant to § 924(c)(1)(B)) if the\n\njudge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such a\n\n\n\n                               -45-\n\fweapon had been used.12    We see no unfairness to the defendants\n\nin terms of notice.\n\n          We think we are compelled by the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Neder to subject the indictment error in this case\n\nto plain error review.       In Neder the court held that a jury\n\ninstruction \"that omits an element of the offense does not\n\nnecessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an\n\nunreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence\" and is,\n\ntherefore, subject to harmless error review. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Neder,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at\n\n<span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   This is so even though the Fifth Amendment requires the\n\ngovernment to prove every element of a criminal offense beyond\n\n\n     12    Whether the use of a semiautomatic assault weapon pursuant\nto subsection (B) of § 924(c)(1) was an element of a separate offense\nor a sentencing factor had not been decided in this circuit at the time\nof the defendants' trial. Defendants had a great incentive to raise\nthe issue because of the less rigorous standard of proof upon which a\njudge could make the finding at sentencing. However, we had already\ndecided, in an analogous context, that the subsections to the federal\ncarjacking statute that provide for longer sentences where a victim\nsuffers bodily injury were sentencing factors, not elements of an\nindependent offense.

Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768953\"><a href=\"/opinion/768953/united-states-v-jeffrey-lee-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n(suggesting that harmless error analysis might be appropriate\n\nwhere an element of an offense was not specifically included in\n\nthe indictment or submitted to the jury).\n\n          This approach is consistent with circuit law concerning\n\nother defects in indictments.         See, e.g., United States v.\n\nYefsky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 894 (1st Cir. 1993) (applying harmless\n\nerror   review   where   indictment   did   not   give   the   defendant\n\nadequate notice of the charges against him, but where adequate\n\nnotice had been given prior to trial).        Even where a defendant\n\nalleges that there was misconduct before the grand jury, the\n\nharmless error test applies. See United States v. Mechanik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111598\"><a href=\"/opinion/111598/united-states-v-mechanik/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71-72 (1986); see also United States v. Lamela, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566806\"><a href=\"/opinion/566806/united-states-v-jose-juan-lamela-united-states-of-america-v-james-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 n.7 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          The evidence as to use of semiautomatic assault weapons\n\nwas, at it happens, presented to the petit jury (we are doubtful\n\nthat much rests on it being presented to the jury as opposed to\n\n                                -48-\n\fthe judge).    That evidence may well have also been presented to\n\nthe grand jury; we do not know.     There is no question that the\n\npetit jury in this case would have found that the defendants\n\nused at least one AK-47.    To paraphrase Neder, the indictment's\n\nfailure to charge the defendants under the semiautomatic assault\n\nweapon subsection of the statute did not necessarily render the\n\nindictment unfair or make it an unreliable vehicle with which to\n\ncommence the proceedings in this case.     See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Neder,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at\n\n<span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   We reject the argument that Castillo requires the sentences\n\nbe vacated based on an error in the indictment.\n\nb.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Viewing the issue not as a Castillo issue but simply\n\nas an issue of whether the trial judge's determination was\n\nsufficiently supported by the record, we find there was no\n\nerror.     The 10-year sentences under § 924(c)(1)(B) for Ramos-\n\nCartagena, Cartagena-Merced, Reyes-Hernandez, and Mojica-Baez\n\nare affirmed.\n\n2.   Landa-Rivera's Sentencing\n\n            Landa-Rivera was convicted of being an accessory after\n\nthe fact to the robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3,\n\n2113(a).    He makes two arguments on appeal.   First he says, and\n\n                                 -49-\n\fthe government agrees, that while he was charged and convicted\n\nfor being an accessory to a simple robbery, see 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2113(a), he was erroneously sentenced as though he were an\n\naccessory to an armed robbery, see 18 U.S.C. § 2113(d).            The\n\ngovernment asks that this aspect of the sentence be remanded for\n\nresentencing, and we do so.\n\n          Second, Landa-Rivera argues that the district court\n\nerred in calculating his total offense level.          We review the\n\napplicability and interpretation of a sentencing guideline de\n\nnovo, but we review the district court's factual findings at\n\nsentencing only for clear error.        See United States v. Cali, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196836\"><a href=\"/opinion/196836/united-states-v-cali/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (1st Cir. 1996).     Landa-Rivera makes two separate\n\nclaims relating to the calculation of his offense level. First,\n\nhe claims the court incorrectly increased his offense level for\n\n\"specific offense characteristics that were known, or reasonably\n\nshould have been known, by the defendant.\"13       U.S.S.G. § 2X3.1,\n\napplication note 1.    According to Landa-Rivera, since being an\n\n\n\n     13    Specifically, he asserts error for the following increases:\nfive levels because of the use of firearms, under U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C); three levels because the guards were restrained and\nfirearms were taken from them, under U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(4)(B), (b)(6);\nand two levels because the guards sustained bodily injuries, under\nU.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(3)(A).\n\n                                 -50-\n\faccessory after the fact is not itself a crime of violence,\n\nsentencing enhancements related to the violent nature of the\n\nrobbery in this case should not apply to him.      He is incorrect.\n\nThe relevant Guidelines sections make clear that the specific\n\ncharacteristics of the underlying offense constitute relevant\n\nconduct for the purpose of calculating an accessory sentence.\n\nApplication note 1 of § 2X3.1 (the accessory after the fact\n\nguideline) references § 1B1.3, application note 10, for purposes\n\nof computing the total offense level.         That note, in turn,\n\nstates, \"In the case of . . . accessory after the fact, the\n\nconduct for which the defendant is accountable includes           all\n\nconduct relevant to determining the offense level for the\n\nunderlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have\n\nbeen known, by the defendant.\"     U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, application\n\nnote 10 (emphasis added).   As a factual matter, there was no\n\nclear error in finding that Landa-Rivera knew or should have\n\nknown of these characteristics of the robbery.        In fact, the\n\nrecord shows that Landa-Rivera recounted the details of the\n\nrobbery to Nevarez-Marrero and Diaz-Nevarro.\n\n         Landa-Rivera's   second   argument   is   that   there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support a finding that he knew or\n\n                              -51-\n\fshould have known that the property of a financial institution\n\nwas taken, see U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(1), and that the total losses\n\nwere over $5 million, see U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(7)(H).          There was\n\nno error.        Landa-Rivera told Nevarez-Marrero that over $5\n\nmillion had been stolen; there was ample evidence that much of\n\nthe money came from banks -- Banco Popular and Banco Santander\n\nin particular; and it was reasonable for the trial judge to\n\nconclude that Landa-Rivera knew or should have known this\n\ninformation.\n\n                                  III.\n\n            The convictions and sentences of defendants Mojica-\n\nBaez, Reyes-Hernandez, Cartagena-Merced, and Ramos-Cartagena are\n\naffirmed.    Defendant Landa-Rivera's conviction is affirmed, but\n\nhis   sentence    is   vacated   and   remanded   for   resentencing   in\n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -52-\n\f</pre>",
