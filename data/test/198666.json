  "plain_text": "            United States Court of Appeals\r\n                For the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 99-1882\r\n\n              TRUSTMARK INSURANCE COMPANY,\r\n\n                 Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n      CARMINE J. GALLUCCI, a/k/a Michael Gallucci,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n      [Hon. Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJames A. Currier and Hodosh, Spinella &amp; Angelone on Motion to\r\nRemand for appellant.\r\nLauren E. Jones and Jones Associates on Objection to Motion\r\nfor Remand for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 4, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam. Plaintiff Trustmark Insurance Company wishes to\r\nexecute a money judgment it obtained against its insured, defendant\r\nGallucci.  The district court concluded that Trustmark could not\r\nexecute the judgment because Trustmark's appeal from the judgment\r\nwas pending.  We summarily vacate the order denying Trustmark's\r\nmotion for execution of the judgment and remand for further\r\nproceedings.\r\nBelow, Trustmark filed an action against its insured, Carmine\r\nJ. Gallucci, seeking to recover payments Trustmark had made to\r\nGallucci under a disability insurance policy.  Trustmark contended\r\nthat Gallucci had claimed to be totally disabled when he fact he\r\nwas not.  The jury eventually returned a verdict for Trustmark, and\r\njudgment entered on that verdict. Both Gallucci and Trustmark have\r\nappealed from the judgment, Trustmark challenging the denial of\r\npre-judgment interest, and those appeals are now pending in this\r\ncourt. \r\nAs Gallucci had not posted a supersedeas bond under Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 62(d), Trustmark moved  to execute the judgment in the\r\namount of the jury award plus post-judgment interest, but not\r\nincluding the pre-judgment interest which is the subject of\r\nTrustmark's other pending appeal.  The district court denied the\r\nmotion on the ground that Trustmark's appeal from the denial of\r\npre-judgment interest \"indirectly challenges the validity of the\r\njudgment,\" so \"execution cannot issue . . . until the appeal is\r\nresolved.\"\r\nThe district court's position draws support from Tennessee\r\nValley Authority v. Atlas Machine &amp; Iron Works, Inc., 803 F.2d 794,\r\n797 (4th Cir. 1986), where the Fourth Circuit indicated that an\r\nappeal by the prevailing party suspends the execution of the\r\njudgment, thereby relieving the judgment debtor from filing a\r\nsupersedeas bond.  The Seventh Circuit, however, has disagreed with\r\nthe Fourth Circuit and has concluded that Rule 62(d) controls and\r\n\"requires a bond as a condition of a money judgment during an\r\nappeal.\"  BASF Corp. v. Old World Trading Co., 979 F.2d 615, 617\r\n(7th Cir. 1992). \"[A] prevailing party's appeal suspends enforcement\r\nof the judgment only when the theory of the appeal is inconsistent\r\nwith enforcement in the interim.\"  Id.; see also Enserch Corp. v.\r\nShand Morahan &amp; Co., 918 F.2d 462 (5th Cir. 1990).  \r\nWe are persuaded by the Seventh Circuit's opinion and adopt\r\nits reasoning.  Here, Trustmark's appeal, which seeks to increase\r\nthe amount of the judgment, is not inconsistent with immediate\r\nenforcement of the judgment as it now stands.  Ordinarily,\r\ntherefore, Gallucci would be required to post a supersedeas bond if\r\nhe wants execution of the judgment stayed pending his appeal. \r\nConsequently, we vacate the district court's  June 28, 1999 order\r\ndenying Trustmark's motion to execute the December 18, 1997\r\njudgment and remand for further proceedings.\r\nVacated and remanded.\r\n",
