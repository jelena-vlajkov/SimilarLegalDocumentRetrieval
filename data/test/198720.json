Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                 Lynch, Noonan,* and Lipez,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Mary A. Davis, by appointment of the court, with whom Tisdale\r\n&amp; Davis was on brief, for appellant.\r\n   Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nNovember 19, 1999\r\n\n   *Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.  LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Albert Verrecchia, a convicted\r\nfelon, was indicted on two counts of possessing a firearm in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  Each count accused Verrecchia\r\nof possessing multiple firearms.  He was convicted after a jury\r\ntrial.  For the first time on appeal, Verrecchia argues that the\r\ntrial court erred in not instructing the jurors that they had to\r\nagree unanimously on at least one particular firearm that he\r\npossessed out of the two named in Count One and out of the twenty-\r\none named in Count Two.  He also objects -- again, for the first\r\ntime on appeal -- to numerous portions of the prosecutor's closing\r\nargument.  We affirm.\r\n                       I.  Background\r\nIn early 1996, the Rhode Island State Police were\r\nattempting to locate a number of weapons that had been stolen\r\nduring a series of burglaries in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\r\nThe police arrested one Michael Rossi in connection with several\r\nburglaries, and eventually secured his cooperation in the\r\ninvestigation into the location of the stolen weapons.  Rossi\r\nclaimed that Verrecchia, his associate, had hidden the weapons in\r\na location unknown to Rossi.  The police initiated a sting\r\noperation whereby a police officer would pose as a drug dealer\r\nwishing to purchase two of the firearms.  Rossi contacted\r\nVerrecchia and arranged for Verrecchia to meet the officer.  After\r\nmeeting, the undercover officer agreed to purchase a .45 caliber\r\nStar Arms handgun and an AK-47 assault rifle from Verrecchia. \r\nVerrecchia stated that it would take him some time to find the two\r\nguns, which he said he had stored in a coffin-sized crate.\r\nVerrecchia left in his truck, drove to a barn he rented,\r\nand retrieved the two weapons from the crate, all while under\r\npolice airplane surveillance.  After meeting the undercover officer\r\nand displaying the two weapons, which were in a box in the truck,\r\nVerrecchia was arrested.  After his arrest he acknowledged that the\r\ncrate contained guns and gave the police keys to the barn and the\r\ncrate.  Inside the crate the police found, inter alia, twenty-one\r\nadditional firearms, a sawed-off shotgun, and several pipe bombs,\r\nthe latter being separately packaged in a bag.\r\nA four-count federal indictment issued against\r\nVerrecchia.  Count One charged that he was a felon and that he\r\npossessed the Star Arms handgun and the AK-47 that he had\r\ntransported in his truck and attempted to sell to the undercover\r\nofficer, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  Count Two charged\r\nthat he possessed the twenty-one firearms found in the crate in the\r\nbarn, also in violation of  922(g)(1).  Counts Three and Four\r\ncharged that he possessed the sawed-off shotgun and two pipe bombs\r\nin violation of 26 U.S.C.  5861(d) (prohibiting the possession of\r\ncertain types of firearms defined in 26 U.S.C.  5845 if not\r\nregistered to the possessor in the National Firearms Registration\r\nand Transfer Record).\r\nAt trial Verrecchia argued that he was entrapped into the\r\nsale of the guns described in Count One, and that Rossi, acting as\r\nan agent of the government, had threatened him with violence and\r\nthat these threats caused Verrecchia to deliver the guns.\r\nVerrecchia denied possession of the contents of the crate (the guns\r\ndescribed in Counts Two and Three and the pipe bombs described in\r\nCount Four), claiming that Rossi had borrowed the crate and sublet\r\nthe barn space, and that Rossi had the key to the locks on the barn\r\nand the crate.  The jury found Verrecchia guilty on Counts One and\r\nTwo and not guilty on Counts Three and Four. \r\n               II. Jury Unanimity Instruction\r\nCounts One and Two alleged that Verrecchia violated 18\r\nU.S.C.  922(g)(1), which provides: \"It shall be unlawful for any\r\nperson . . . who has been convicted in any court of, a crime\r\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . to\r\n. . . possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition\r\n. . . .\"  The district court gave the following instruction to the\r\njury regarding those counts:\r\n  The government is not required to prove that\r\nthe defendant possessed every firearm\r\ndescribed in every count of the indictment.\r\nThe possession element for a particular count\r\nmay be established if you find that the\r\ndefendant knowingly possessed any firearm\r\ndescribed in that count of the indictment.\r\n\nTowards the end of the charge to the jury, the court instructed the\r\njury that \"to render a verdict, all 12 of you must agree.  That is,\r\nyour verdict must be unanimous.\"  \r\nVerrecchia claims on appeal that the district court erred\r\nin failing to instruct the jurors that they had to agree\r\nunanimously on at least one particular weapon that he possessed out\r\nof the two listed in Count One and out of the twenty-one listed in\r\nCount Two.  Because he did not object to the unanimity\r\ninstructions given before the jury began its deliberations, we\r\nreview for plain error.  See United States v. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d\r\n46, 50 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1805 (1998).\r\nVerrecchia raises two related arguments for requiring\r\njury unanimity on the specific weapons he possessed.  He argues\r\nfirst that Counts One and Two each charged more than one crime --\r\ni.e., that they were duplicitous -- and that a specific unanimity\r\ninstruction was required to cure that duplicity.  He also argues\r\nthat if each count charged only one crime, and hence was not\r\nduplicitous, the possession of a particular weapon is still an\r\nelement of the crime on which the jury must be unanimous.\r\nA.  Duplicity and \"the allowable unit of prosecution\"\r\n\"Duplicity is the joining in a single count of two or\r\nmore distinct and separate offenses.\"  United States v. Martinez-\r\nCanas, 595 F.2d 73, 78 (1st Cir. 1979).  \"[T]he prohibition against\r\nduplicitous indictments arises primarily out of a concern that the\r\njury may find a defendant guilty on a count without having reached \r\na unanimous verdict on the commission of any particular offense.\" \r\nUnited States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir. 1995).  Although\r\nan argument that an indictment should be dismissed as duplicitous\r\nis waived if not made before trial, see id.; Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n12(b)(2), a defendant is still entitled on request to an\r\ninstruction requiring jury unanimity on which offense (of the two\r\nor more alleged in the duplicitous count) he committed, see United\r\nStates v. Puerta, 38 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 1994).  Verrecchia made\r\nno such request in this case.  He argues nevertheless that it was\r\nplain error to fail to give such an instruction, contending that\r\nthe possession of each firearm is a separate violation of \r\n922(g)(1) that should be charged in a separate count of the\r\nindictment.\r\nVerrecchia's argument raises the question, addressed by\r\nthe Supreme Court in the leading case of Bell v. United States, 349\r\nU.S. 81 (1955), of \"[w]hat Congress has made the allowable unit of\r\nprosecution under a statute which does not explicitly give the\r\nanswer.\"  Id. at 81 (citation and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).  The defendant in Bell had been convicted of two\r\nviolations of the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C.  2421 (prohibiting the\r\ninterstate transportation of \"any woman or girl\" for purposes of\r\nprostitution), for transporting two women at the same time.  The\r\nCourt, noting that when Congress chooses to allow multiple\r\nprosecutions for a single transaction it has no difficulty\r\nexpressing its will, found the statute to be ambiguous on the\r\nallowable unit of prosecution.  See id. at 83.  The Court thus\r\napplied the \"presupposition of our law to resolve doubts in the\r\nenforcement of a penal code against the imposition of a harsher\r\npunishment,\" and held that the simultaneous transportation of two\r\nwomen was only one violation of the Mann Act.  Id.\r\nWe are the only circuit that has not ruled on \"the\r\nallowable unit of prosecution\" under the felon-in-possession\r\nstatute ( 922(g)(1) or its predecessors).  The other courts of\r\nappeals have addressed the issue and have all agreed that the\r\nsimultaneous possession of multiple firearms, or a firearm and\r\nammunition, constitutes only one crime.  See United States v.\r\nPelusio, 725 F.2d 161, 168-69 (2d Cir. 1983); United States v.\r\nFrankenberry, 696 F.2d 239, 244-45 (3d Cir. 1982); United States v.\r\nDunford, 148 F.3d 385, 390 (4th Cir. 1998); United States v.\r\nBullock, 615 F.2d 1082, 1084 (5th Cir. 1980); United States v.\r\nRosenbarger, 536 F.2d 715, 721 (6th Cir. 1976); McFarland v.\r\nPickett, 469 F.2d 1277, 1279 (7th Cir. 1972); United States v.\r\nKinsley, 518 F.2d 665, 668-70 (8th Cir. 1975); United States v.\r\nWiga, 662 F.2d 1325, 1336-37 (9th Cir. 1981); United States v.\r\nValentine, 706 F.2d 282, 292-94 (10th Cir. 1983); United States v.\r\nBonavia, 927 F.2d 565, 568-69 (11th Cir. 1991); United States v.\r\nCunningham, 145 F.3d 1385, 1398 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\r\nThose cases all rely, directly or indirectly, on Bell and\r\nthe Supreme Court's holding therein that \"if Congress does not fix\r\nthe punishment for a federal offense clearly and without ambiguity,\r\ndoubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into\r\nmultiple offenses.\"  349 U.S. at 84.  The other circuits have found\r\nit particularly appropriate to follow the rule of Bell because of\r\nthe similarity in the statutory language:  922(g)(1), like its\r\npredecessors, forbids possession by a felon of \"any firearm or\r\nammunition,\" while the Mann Act forbade interstate transportation\r\nfor immoral purposes of \"any woman or girl.\"  See, e.g., Kinsley,\r\n518 F.2d at 668-69.  \r\n  Significantly, in many of the cases in which\r\nthe courts have found a Bell-type ambiguity,\r\nthe object of the offense has been prefaced by\r\nthe word 'any.'  Seemingly this is because\r\n'any' may be said to fully encompass (i.e.,\r\nnot necessarily exclude any part of) plural\r\nactivity, and thus fails to unambiguously\r\ndefine the unit of prosecution in singular\r\nterms.\r\n\nId. at 667.  \r\nWe agree with the Kinsley court that with respect to the\r\nallowable unit of prosecution, \"any firearm\" is as ambiguous as\r\n\"any woman or girl\" was in Bell.  See id. at 669.  In the absence\r\nof any evidence that Congress clearly intended to treat each\r\npossession of a firearm as a separate violation of  922(g)(1), the\r\nSupreme Court's holding in Bell requires us to resolve the\r\nambiguity \"against turning a single transaction into multiple\r\noffenses.\"  349 U.S. at 84.  We thus join our sister circuits in\r\nholding that the simultaneous possession by a felon of multiple\r\nfirearms, that is, possession of multiple firearms in one place at\r\none time, is only one violation of  922(g)(1).\r\nContrary to Verrecchia's contention, therefore, the\r\ngovernment could not have properly charged him with twenty-three\r\nseparate crimes for the twenty-three different guns he allegedly\r\npossessed.  Instead, the indictment here correctly grouped the\r\nfirearms into counts based on the place of possession: the guns\r\nVerrecchia had in his truck during the sting operation were charged\r\ntogether under Count One, and those he possessed in the crate in\r\nthe barn were charged together under Count Two.  Each count charged\r\nonly one offense, despite the references in each to multiple\r\nfirearms.  Verrecchia was not entitled to a specific unanimity\r\ninstruction to cure the alleged duplicity because neither count was\r\nduplicitous.\r\nB.  Possession of a particular firearm as an element of the crime\r\nVerrecchia also argues, albeit somewhat opaquely, that\r\neven if the simultaneous possession of multiple firearms is only\r\none violation of  922(g)(1), the district court still plainly\r\nerred by failing to instruct the jurors that to convict him of such\r\na violation they must unanimously agree on at least one particular\r\nfirearm that he possessed.  The recent Supreme Court case of\r\nRichardson v. United States, 119 S. Ct. 1707 (1999), guides our\r\nanalysis of this argument.  The issue in Richardson was whether a\r\njury in a continuing criminal enterprise prosecution under 21\r\nU.S.C.  848, where the charge involves \"a continuing series of\r\nviolations\" of the federal drug laws, must unanimously agree on\r\nthree particular violations that the defendant had committed out of\r\nthe many alleged by the government.  A federal criminal jury must\r\nunanimously agree on each \"element\" of the crime in order to\r\nconvict, but need not agree on all the \"underlying brute facts\r\n[that] make up a particular element.\"  Id. at 1710.  The crucial\r\ndistinction is thus between a fact that is an element of the crime\r\nand one that is \"but the means\" to the commission of an element. \r\nId.; see also United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 105 (1st Cir.\r\n1999), cert. denied, 68 U.S.L.W. 3079 (U.S. Oct. 4, 1999) (No. 99-\r\n79) (\"While a jury must agree on all of the elements of an offense,\r\nit need not agree on the means by which all the elements were\r\naccomplished.\").  \r\nWhether a particular fact is a means or an element is a\r\n\"value choice[] more appropriately made in the first instance by a\r\nlegislature than by a court.\"  Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 637\r\n(1991) (plurality opinion).  The Court in Richardson thus addressed\r\nthe jury unanimity issue as one of statutory construction and\r\nlooked to considerations of \"language, tradition, and potential\r\nunfairness\" to discern Congressional intent.  119 S. Ct. at 1711. \r\nBecause those considerations pointed to a Congressional intent to\r\ntreat each of three predicate violations as a separate element, the\r\nCourt held that it was error to fail to give an instruction\r\nrequiring unanimity on which particular violations the defendant\r\nhad committed.  See id. at 1713.  We must determine, looking to the\r\nsame considerations, whether Congress intended to make the\r\npossession of a particular firearm an element of a  922(g)(1)\r\nviolation when simultaneous possession of multiple firearms is\r\nalleged.\r\n\"When interpreting a statute, we look first to the\r\nlanguage.\"  Richardson, 119 S. Ct. at 1710.  Section 922(g) states\r\nthat \"It shall be unlawful for any person\" in nine categories \"to\r\n. . . possess in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition .\r\n. . .\"  The plain language of the statute suggests that the element\r\nof the crime is simply the possession of \"any firearm.\"  If so,\r\nthen twelve jurors who agreed that a defendant possessed a firearm,\r\nbut disagreed about which particular one, would be unanimous on the\r\nelement -- that he possessed \"any firearm.\"  Their disagreement\r\nwould be acceptable because it would only concern \"underlying brute\r\nfacts.\"  Richardson, 119 S. Ct. at 1710.  \r\nOther provisions of the statute are consistent with this\r\ninterpretation.  The categories of persons prohibited from\r\npossessing firearms include not only those, like Verrecchia, \"who\r\nha[ve] been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by\r\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\"  922(g)(1), but also\r\nfugitives, drug addicts, illegal aliens, domestic abusers, and\r\nthose who have renounced their U.S. citizenship, been committed to\r\na mental institution, or dishonorably discharged from the military,\r\nsee  922(g)(2)-(9).   In addition, the category of felons is\r\nmodified by 18 U.S.C.  921(a)(20), which carves out exceptions for\r\ncriminal antitrust convictions, state offenses formally classified\r\nby state law as misdemeanors despite carrying sentences longer than\r\none year, and convictions which have been expunged, set aside,\r\npardoned, or for which civil rights have been restored without\r\nrestriction on the right to possess firearms.  The specific,\r\ntechnical description of the status of the possessor contrasts with\r\nthe general description \"any firearm,\" supporting the conclusion\r\nthat Congress's focus was on the felon and not on the nature or\r\nnumber of firearms possessed.\r\nThe punishment provisions for violations of  922(g)\r\nreveal a similar focus.  Knowing violations of  922(g) are\r\npunishable by imprisonment for up to ten years.  See 18 U.S.C.\r\n924(a)(2).  Violators with three prior violent felony or drug\r\noffenses may be punished by a fine of up to $25,000 and are subject\r\nto a minimum sentence of fifteen years.  See id.  924(e)(1). \r\nConversely, where an individual's circumstances are judged to make\r\nhim less of a threat to public safety, he may petition the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury for exceptional relief from the\r\nproscriptions of  922(g).  See id.  925(c).  Nothing in these\r\nstatutory provisions indicates an intent on the part of Congress to\r\nlink culpability to the nature or quantity of the weapons\r\npossessed, and the fine and minimum sentence provisions, as well as\r\nthe available exception, reinforce our impression that Congress was\r\nprimarily concerned with the characteristics of the individual\r\nfelon in possession.  \r\nWe also look to the legislative history for further\r\nevidence of Congressional intent.  See Kinsley, 518 F.2d at 669\r\n(reviewing legislative history in considering allowable unit of\r\nprosecution under felon-in-possession statute); see also United\r\nStates v. Meade, 175 F.3d 215, 218-19 (1st Cir. 1999) (examining\r\nlegislative history in construing  922(g)(9)).  Section 922(g)(1)\r\nhas its origins in former subsections of 18 U.S.C.  922 and in 18\r\nU.S.C. App.  1202(a)(1), which were adopted in 1968 and superseded\r\nby the current version of  922(g)(1) in 1986.  See Pub. L. No. 90-\r\n351, 82 Stat. 197 (1968); Pub. L. No. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213 (1968);\r\nPub. L. 99-308,  104(b), 100 Stat. 449, 459 (1986).  Former\r\n1202(a)(1) criminalized firearm possession by convicted felons,\r\noverlapping with former  922(h)(1), which criminalized receiving\r\nfirearms that had been shipped or transported in interstate\r\ncommerce by persons under indictment for or convicted of a felony. \r\nBoth former subsections referred, like present  922(g), to \"any\r\nfirearm.\"   \r\nIn Congressional discussion of  1202(a), Senator Tydings\r\nstated that it was \"primarily designed to restrict access to\r\nhandguns to criminals.\"  Ball v. United States, 470 U.S. 856, 863\r\nn.12 (1985) (quoting 114 Cong. Rec. 13639 (1968)). According to \r\nSenator Long, the sponsor of  1202(a), the odd assortment of\r\npersons covered by that section (including those dishonorably\r\ndischarged from the armed forces, illegal aliens, and those who had\r\nrenounced U.S. citizenship) reflected those responsible for some of\r\nthe notorious assassinations of the 1960s.  See id. at 863 n.13\r\n(quoting 114 Cong. Rec. 14773 (1968)).  Senator Long also stated\r\nthat the provision \"simply set[] forth the fact that anybody who\r\nhas been convicted of a felony . . . is not permitted to possess a\r\nfirearm . . . .\"  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 345 n.13\r\n(1971) (quoting 114 Cong. Rec. 13868 (1968)).  A \"principal\r\npurpose\" of  922 \"was to make 'it possible to keep firearms out of\r\nthe hands of those not . . . entitled to possess them because of\r\n. . . criminal background . . . .'\"  Ball, 470 U.S. at 863 (quoting\r\nS. Rep. No. 90-1097, at 28 (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r\n2112, 2113).  The Supreme Court noted that  922 and 1202\r\ndemonstrate \"Congress' worry about the easy availability of\r\nfirearms . . . to those persons who pose a threat to community\r\npeace,\" Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 66 (1980), and \"seek[]\r\nto keep a firearm from 'any person . . . who has been convicted' of\r\na felony,\" id. at 64, and other \"persons Congress classified as\r\npotentially irresponsible and dangerous.\"  Barrett v. United\r\nStates, 423 U.S. 212, 218 (1976).  Like the statutory language, the\r\nlegislative history focuses on the person, not the firearm.  See\r\nUnited States v. Berry, 977 F.2d 915, 919 (5th Cir. 1992) (\"The\r\nevil Congress sought to suppress by section 922 was the arming of\r\nfelons; the section is based on the status of the offender and not\r\nthe number of guns possessed.\").\r\nConsiderations of tradition and potential unfairness, the\r\nother factors analyzed by the Supreme Court in Richardson, do not\r\nindicate that Congress had a different focus.  Verrecchia does not\r\nidentify, and we are not aware of, any legal tradition that sheds\r\nlight on the question before us.  Cf. Richardson, 119 S. Ct. at\r\n1710-11 (stating that treating each \"violation\" as an element is\r\nsupported by \"a tradition of requiring juror unanimity where the\r\nissue is whether a defendant has engaged in conduct that violates\r\nthe law\").\r\n  Nor does this case present the kind of potential\r\nunfairness noted in Richardson.  The Court saw two risks in\r\ntreating each \"violation\" as a means to the series required for a\r\ncontinuing criminal enterprise conviction rather than as an\r\nelement.  First, it would permit \"wide disagreement\" among jurors\r\nabout what the defendant had done, considering the many types of\r\nconduct \"of varying degrees of seriousness\" that qualify as\r\nviolations of the federal drug laws.  Id. at 1711.  Second, it\r\nwould aggravate the danger that jurors might fail to focus on\r\nfactual detail and convict a defendant of being a drug kingpin on\r\nthe basis of bad reputation alone.  See id.  Those risks are not\r\npresent here.  Each possession of a firearm by a felon is of equal\r\nseriousness, a fact that mitigates the significance of potential\r\njuror disagreement about which firearms are possessed. \r\nFurthermore, the only issue in a  922(g)(1) case is usually\r\nwhether the defendant possessed the gun or guns in question. \r\nTherefore, a juror in such a case is less likely to ignore the\r\nunderlying factual detail than one presented with the massive and\r\ncomplicated evidence that typically accompanies a continuing\r\ncriminal enterprise prosecution.  We thus see no reason to conclude\r\nthat Congress was moved by any perception of unfairness to treat\r\nthe possession of a particular firearm as an element of a \r\n922(g)(1) violation.\r\nFinally, although there is almost no case law directly on\r\npoint, relevant precedent supports the view that the possession of\r\na particular firearm is not an element.  One court of appeals faced\r\nthe identical issue and held, without extensive discussion, that\r\nfailure to give a specific unanimity instruction was not plain\r\nerror warranting reversal.  See United States v. Sims, 975 F.2d\r\n1225, 1240-41 (6th Cir. 1992).  No circuit has come to the opposite\r\nconclusion.  We have held, in accord with other circuits, that jury\r\nunanimity on a particular firearm is not required in a prosecution\r\nunder 18 U.S.C.  924(c) for using or carrying a firearm during and\r\nin relation to, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of, a\r\nfederal violent or drug trafficking crime.  See United States v.\r\nHernandez-Albino, 177 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.\r\nMorin, 33 F.3d 1351, 1354 (11th Cir. 1994); United States v.\r\nCorrea-Ventura, 6 F.3d 1070, 1075-87 (5th Cir. 1993).  We have also\r\nheld, in a  922(g)(1) case, that the district court need not give\r\nthe jury a special verdict form when the possession of multiple\r\nfirearms is alleged, even where the particular firearms possessed\r\ncould be relevant to sentencing.  See United States v. Ellis, 168\r\nF.3d 559, 561-62 (1st Cir. 1999).  But cf. United States v. Melvin,\r\n27 F.3d 710, 714-15 (1st Cir. 1994) (jury unanimity on specific\r\nfirearms required in  924(c) case where use of different firearms,\r\nof several alleged, would result in different mandatory minimum\r\nsentences).  \r\nIn sum, the language of the statute and the other\r\nconsiderations examined above convince us that Congress did not\r\nintend the possession of a particular firearm to be an element of\r\na  922(g)(1) violation.  There was thus no error, let alone plain\r\nerror, in the district court's failure to give an instruction\r\nrequiring jury unanimity on any particular firearm that Verrecchia\r\npossessed.\r\n\n                   III.  Closing Argument\r\nVerrecchia objects to a lengthy list of asserted errors\r\nin the government's closing argument.  He claims that the\r\nprosecutor implied a contradiction between the testimony of the\r\nundercover police officer and Verrecchia where there was none.  He\r\nalso alleges that the prosecutor made numerous misstatements of the\r\nevidence, and made improper comments on the credibility of\r\nVerrecchia as a witness.  Finally, Verrecchia contends that the\r\nprosecutor erred in arguing that Verrecchia lied about threats made\r\nto him by Rossi; the government concedes error on this point. \r\nSince Verrecchia did not object to any of these prosecutorial\r\nstatements at trial, the alleged errors are subject to plain error\r\nreview.  See United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nTo establish plain error, a defendant must show that the\r\nalleged error was \"clear under current law\" or \"obvious,\" and that\r\nthe error was prejudicial in that it \"affected the outcome\" of the\r\ntrial; even where that is the case, reversal is discretionary and\r\nwill be warranted only where the plain error \"seriously affects the\r\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\r\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993).  Assuming\r\narguendo that all of Verrecchia's contentions of error in the\r\nclosing argument are correct, we still cannot say that he suffered\r\nprejudice from such errors in the sense that they \"affected the\r\noutcome\" of the trial.  The evidence against Verrecchia on the\r\nfelon-in-possession charges was overwhelming, including\r\nsurveillance evidence documenting the stages of his travel during\r\nthe transaction, his arrest in possession of the guns named in\r\nCount One, and his admission of knowledge that the guns named in\r\nCount Two were in a crate in a barn which he rented.  The fact that\r\nhe was acquitted on Counts Three and Four does not affect our\r\nconclusion that the evidence on Counts One and Two was\r\noverwhelming.  Given the strength of the evidence against\r\nVerrecchia, nothing in the prosecutor's arguments amounted to plain\r\nerror.  See United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 574 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (impact on trial outcome judged, inter alia, by strength of\r\nevidence against defendant).\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Albert Verrecchia, a convicted\r\nfelon, was indicted on two counts of possessing a firearm in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  Each count accused Verrecchia\r\nof possessing multiple firearms.  He was convicted after a jury\r\ntrial.  For the first time on appeal, Verrecchia argues that the\r\ntrial court erred in not instructing the jurors that they had to\r\nagree unanimously on at least one particular firearm that he\r\npossessed out of the two named in Count One and out of the twenty-\r\none named in Count Two.  He also objects -- again, for the first\r\ntime on appeal -- to numerous portions of the prosecutor's closing\r\nargument.  We affirm.\r\n                       I.  Background\r\nIn early 1996, the Rhode Island State Police were\r\nattempting to locate a number of weapons that had been stolen\r\nduring a series of burglaries in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\r\nThe police arrested one Michael Rossi in connection with several\r\nburglaries, and eventually secured his cooperation in the\r\ninvestigation into the location of the stolen weapons.  Rossi\r\nclaimed that Verrecchia, his associate, had hidden the weapons in\r\na location unknown to Rossi.  The police initiated a sting\r\noperation whereby a police officer would pose as a drug dealer\r\nwishing to purchase two of the firearms.  Rossi contacted\r\nVerrecchia and arranged for Verrecchia to meet the officer.  After\r\nmeeting, the undercover officer agreed to purchase a .45 caliber\r\nStar Arms handgun and an AK-47 assault rifle from Verrecchia. \r\nVerrecchia stated that it would take him some time to find the two\r\nguns, which he said he had stored in a coffin-sized crate.\r\nVerrecchia left in his truck, drove to a barn he rented,\r\nand retrieved the two weapons from the crate, all while under\r\npolice airplane surveillance.  After meeting the undercover officer\r\nand displaying the two weapons, which were in a box in the truck,\r\nVerrecchia was arrested.  After his arrest he acknowledged that the\r\ncrate contained guns and gave the police keys to the barn and the\r\ncrate.  Inside the crate the police found, inter alia, twenty-one\r\nadditional firearms, a sawed-off shotgun, and several pipe bombs,\r\nthe latter being separately packaged in a bag.\r\nA four-count federal indictment issued against\r\nVerrecchia.  Count One charged that he was a felon and that he\r\npossessed the Star Arms handgun and the AK-47 that he had\r\ntransported in his truck and attempted to sell to the undercover\r\nofficer, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  Count Two charged\r\nthat he possessed the twenty-one firearms found in the crate in the\r\nbarn, also in violation of  922(g)(1).  Counts Three and Four\r\ncharged that he possessed the sawed-off shotgun and two pipe bombs\r\nin violation of 26 U.S.C.  5861(d) (prohibiting the possession of\r\ncertain types of firearms defined in 26 U.S.C.  5845 if not\r\nregistered to the possessor in the National Firearms Registration\r\nand Transfer Record).\r\nAt trial Verrecchia argued that he was entrapped into the\r\nsale of the guns described in Count One, and that Rossi, acting as\r\nan agent of the government, had threatened him with violence and\r\nthat these threats caused Verrecchia to deliver the guns.\r\nVerrecchia denied possession of the contents of the crate (the guns\r\ndescribed in Counts Two and Three and the pipe bombs described in\r\nCount Four), claiming that Rossi had borrowed the crate and sublet\r\nthe barn space, and that Rossi had the key to the locks on the barn\r\nand the crate.  The jury found Verrecchia guilty on Counts One and\r\nTwo and not guilty on Counts Three and Four. \r\n               II. Jury Unanimity Instruction\r\nCounts One and Two alleged that Verrecchia violated 18\r\nU.S.C.  922(g)(1), which provides: \"It shall be unlawful for any\r\nperson . . . who has been convicted in any court of, a crime\r\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . to\r\n. . . possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition\r\n. . . .\"  The district court gave the following instruction to the\r\njury regarding those counts:\r\n  The government is not required to prove that\r\nthe defendant possessed every firearm\r\ndescribed in every count of the indictment.\r\nThe possession element for a particular count\r\nmay be established if you find that the\r\ndefendant knowingly possessed any firearm\r\ndescribed in that count of the indictment.\r\n\nTowards the end of the charge to the jury, the court instructed the\r\njury that \"to render a verdict, all 12 of you must agree.  That is,\r\nyour verdict must be unanimous.\"  \r\nVerrecchia claims on appeal that the district court erred\r\nin failing to instruct the jurors that they had to agree\r\nunanimously on at least one particular weapon that he possessed out\r\nof the two listed in Count One and out of the twenty-one listed in\r\nCount Two.  Because he did not object to the unanimity\r\ninstructions given before the jury began its deliberations, we\r\nreview for plain error.  See United States v. Bradstreet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197762\"><a href=\"/opinion/197762/united-states-v-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He argues\r\nfirst that Counts One and Two each charged more than one crime --\r\ni.e., that they were duplicitous -- and that a specific unanimity\r\ninstruction was required to cure that duplicity.  He also argues\r\nthat if each count charged only one crime, and hence was not\r\nduplicitous, the possession of a particular weapon is still an\r\nelement of the crime on which the jury must be unanimous.\r\nA.  Duplicity and \"the allowable unit of prosecution\"\r\n\"Duplicity is the joining in a single count of two or\r\nmore distinct and separate offenses.\"  United States v.

Although\r\nan argument that an indictment should be dismissed as duplicitous\r\nis waived if not made before trial, see id.; Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n12(b)(2), a defendant is still entitled on request to an\r\ninstruction requiring jury unanimity on which offense (of the two\r\nor more alleged in the duplicitous count) he committed, see United\r\nStates v.

Verrecchia made\r\nno such request in this case.  He argues nevertheless that it was\r\nplain error to fail to give such an instruction, contending that\r\nthe possession of each firearm is a separate violation of \r\n922(g)(1) that should be charged in a separate count of the\r\nindictment.\r\nVerrecchia's argument raises the question, addressed by\r\nthe Supreme Court in the leading case of Bell v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105299\"><a href=\"/opinion/105299/bell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1955), of \"[w]hat Congress has made the allowable unit of\r\nprosecution under a statute which does not explicitly give the\r\nanswer.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105299\"><a href=\"/opinion/105299/bell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 81 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(citation and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).

The other circuits have found\r\nit particularly appropriate to follow the rule of Bell because of\r\nthe similarity in the statutory language:  922(g)(1), like its\r\npredecessors, forbids possession by a felon of \"any firearm or\r\nammunition,\" while the Mann Act forbade interstate transportation\r\nfor immoral purposes of \"any woman or girl.\"  See, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328586\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kinsley,</span>\r\n<a href=\"/opinion/328586/united-states-v-edwin-kinsley-united-states-of-america-v-michael-guerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">668-69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  \r\n  Significantly, in many of the cases in which\r\nthe courts have found a Bell-type ambiguity,\r\nthe object of the offense has been prefaced by\r\nthe word 'any.'

We thus join our sister circuits in\r\nholding that the simultaneous possession by a felon of multiple\r\nfirearms, that is, possession of multiple firearms in one place at\r\none time, is only one violation of  922(g)(1).\r\nContrary to Verrecchia's contention, therefore, the\r\ngovernment could not have properly charged him with twenty-three\r\nseparate crimes for the twenty-three different guns he allegedly\r\npossessed.  Instead, the indictment here correctly grouped the\r\nfirearms into counts based on the place of possession: the guns\r\nVerrecchia had in his truck during the sting operation were charged\r\ntogether under Count One, and those he possessed in the crate in\r\nthe barn were charged together under Count Two.  Each count charged\r\nonly one offense, despite the references in each to multiple\r\nfirearms.  Verrecchia was not entitled to a specific unanimity\r\ninstruction to cure the alleged duplicity because neither count was\r\nduplicitous.\r\nB.  Possession of a particular firearm as an element of the crime\r\nVerrecchia also argues, albeit somewhat opaquely, that\r\neven if the simultaneous possession of multiple firearms is only\r\none violation of  922(g)(1), the district court still plainly\r\nerred by failing to instruct the jurors that to convict him of such\r\na violation they must unanimously agree on at least one particular\r\nfirearm that he possessed.  The recent Supreme Court case of\r\nRichardson v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The issue in Richardson was whether a\r\njury in a continuing criminal enterprise prosecution under 21\r\nU.S.C.  848, where the charge involves \"a continuing series of\r\nviolations\" of the federal drug laws, must unanimously agree on\r\nthree particular violations that the defendant had committed out of\r\nthe many alleged by the government.  A federal criminal jury must\r\nunanimously agree on each \"element\" of the crime in order to\r\nconvict, but need not agree on all the \"underlying brute facts\r\n[that] make up a particular element.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1710. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> The crucial\r\ndistinction is thus between a fact that is an element of the crime\r\nand one that is \"but the means\" to the commission of an element. \r\nId.; see also United States v.

Section 922(g) states\r\nthat \"It shall be unlawful for any person\" in nine categories \"to\r\n. . . possess in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition .\r\n. . .\"  The plain language of the statute suggests that the element\r\nof the crime is simply the possession of \"any firearm.\"  If so,\r\nthen twelve jurors who agreed that a defendant possessed a firearm,\r\nbut disagreed about which particular one, would be unanimous on the\r\nelement -- that he possessed \"any firearm.\"  Their disagreement\r\nwould be acceptable because it would only concern \"underlying brute\r\nfacts.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Richardson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The categories of persons prohibited from\r\npossessing firearms include not only those, like Verrecchia, \"who\r\nha[ve] been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by\r\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\"  922(g)(1), but also\r\nfugitives, drug addicts, illegal aliens, domestic abusers, and\r\nthose who have renounced their U.S. citizenship, been committed to\r\na mental institution, or dishonorably discharged from the military,\r\nsee  922(g)(2)-(9).   In addition, the category of felons is\r\nmodified by 18 U.S.C.  921(a)(20), which carves out exceptions for\r\ncriminal antitrust convictions, state offenses formally classified\r\nby state law as misdemeanors despite carrying sentences longer than\r\none year, and convictions which have been expunged, set aside,\r\npardoned, or for which civil rights have been restored without\r\nrestriction on the right to possess firearms.  The specific,\r\ntechnical description of the status of the possessor contrasts with\r\nthe general description \"any firearm,\" supporting the conclusion\r\nthat Congress's focus was on the felon and not on the nature or\r\nnumber of firearms possessed.\r\nThe punishment provisions for violations of  922(g)\r\nreveal a similar focus.  Knowing violations of  922(g) are\r\npunishable by imprisonment for up to ten years.  See 18 U.S.C.\r\n924(a)(2).  Violators with three prior violent felony or drug\r\noffenses may be punished by a fine of up to $25,000 and are subject\r\nto a minimum sentence of fifteen years.

Verrecchia does not\r\nidentify, and we are not aware of, any legal tradition that sheds\r\nlight on the question before us.  Cf. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Richardson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at\r\n<span class=\"page\">1710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">-11 (stating that treating each \"violation\" as an element is\r\nsupported by \"a tradition of requiring juror unanimity where the\r\nissue is whether a defendant has engaged in conduct that violates\r\nthe law\").\r\n  Nor does this case present the kind of potential\r\nunfairness noted in Richardson.  The Court saw two risks in\r\ntreating each \"violation\" as a means to the series required for a\r\ncontinuing criminal enterprise conviction rather than as an\r\nelement.  First, it would permit \"wide disagreement\" among jurors\r\nabout what the defendant had done, considering the many types of\r\nconduct \"of varying degrees of seriousness\" that qualify as\r\nviolations of the federal drug laws.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1711. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Second, it\r\nwould aggravate the danger that jurors might fail to focus on\r\nfactual detail and convict a defendant of being a drug kingpin on\r\nthe basis of bad reputation alone.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  Those risks </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">are not\r\npresent here.  Each possession of a firearm by a felon is of equal\r\nseriousness, a fact that mitigates the significance of potential\r\njuror disagreement about which firearms are possessed. \r\nFurthermore, the only issue in a  922(g)(1) case is usually\r\nwhether the defendant possessed the gun or guns in question. \r\nTherefore, a juror in such a case is less likely to ignore the\r\nunderlying factual detail than one presented with the massive and\r\ncomplicated evidence that typically accompanies a continuing\r\ncriminal enterprise prosecution.  We thus see no reason to conclude\r\nthat Congress was moved by any perception of unfairness to treat\r\nthe possession of a particular firearm as an element of a \r\n922(g)(1) violation.\r\nFinally, although there is almost no case law directly on\r\npoint, relevant precedent supports the view that the possession of\r\na particular firearm is not an element.  One court of appeals faced\r\nthe identical issue and held, without extensive discussion, that\r\nfailure to give a specific unanimity instruction was not plain\r\nerror warranting reversal.  See United States v. Sims, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591170\"><a href=\"/opinion/591170/united-states-of-america-cross-appellant-91-1476147814791488-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1240-41 (6th Cir. 1992).  No circuit has come to the opposite\r\nconclusion.  We have held, in accord with other circuits, that jury\r\nunanimity on a particular firearm is not required in a prosecution\r\nunder 18 U.S.C.  924(c) for using or carrying a firearm during and\r\nin relation to, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of, a\r\nfederal violent or drug trafficking crime.

We have also\r\nheld, in a  922(g)(1) case, that the district court need not give\r\nthe jury a special verdict form when the possession of multiple\r\nfirearms is alleged, even where the particular firearms possessed\r\ncould be relevant to sentencing.  See United States v. Ellis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561-62 (1st Cir. 1999).  But cf. United States v. Melvin,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195440\"><a href=\"/opinion/195440/united-states-v-melvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714-15 (1st Cir. 1994) (jury unanimity on specific\r\nfirearms required in  924(c) case where use of different firearms,\r\nof several alleged, would result in different mandatory minimum\r\nsentences).  \r\nIn sum, the language of the statute and the other\r\nconsiderations examined above convince us that Congress did not\r\nintend the possession of a particular firearm to be an element of\r\na  922(g)(1) violation.  There was thus no error, let alone plain\r\nerror, in the district court's failure to give an instruction\r\nrequiring jury unanimity on any particular firearm that Verrecchia\r\npossessed.\r\n\n                   III.  Closing Argument\r\nVerrecchia objects to a lengthy list of asserted errors\r\nin the government's closing argument.  He claims that the\r\nprosecutor implied a contradiction between the testimony of the\r\nundercover police officer and Verrecchia where there was none.  He\r\nalso alleges that the prosecutor made numerous misstatements of the\r\nevidence, and made improper comments on the credibility of\r\nVerrecchia as a witness.  Finally, Verrecchia contends that the\r\nprosecutor erred in arguing that Verrecchia lied about threats made\r\nto him by Rossi; the government concedes error on this point. \r\nSince Verrecchia did not object to any of these prosecutorial\r\nstatements at trial, the alleged errors are subject to plain error\r\nreview.  See United States v. Bey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765731\"><a href=\"/opinion/765731/united-states-v-joseph-bey-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nTo establish plain error, a defendant must show that the\r\nalleged error was \"clear under current law\" or \"obvious,\" and that\r\nthe error was prejudicial in that it \"affected the outcome\" of the\r\ntrial; even where that is the case, reversal is discretionary and\r\nwill be warranted only where the plain error \"seriously affects the\r\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\r\nUnited States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 (1993).  Assuming\r\narguendo that all of Verrecchia's contentions of error in the\r\nclosing argument are correct, we still cannot say that he suffered\r\nprejudice from such errors in the sense that they \"affected the\r\noutcome\" of the trial.  The evidence against Verrecchia on the\r\nfelon-in-possession charges was overwhelming, including\r\nsurveillance evidence documenting the stages of his travel during\r\nthe transaction, his arrest in possession of the guns named in\r\nCount One, and his admission of knowledge that the guns named in\r\nCount Two were in a crate in a barn which he rented.  The fact that\r\nhe was acquitted on Counts Three and Four does not affect our\r\nconclusion that the evidence on Counts One and Two was\r\noverwhelming.  Given the strength of the evidence against\r\nVerrecchia, nothing in the prosecutor's arguments amounted to plain\r\nerror.  See United States v.
