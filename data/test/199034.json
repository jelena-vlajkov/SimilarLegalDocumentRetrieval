Plaintiff-appellant David\n\nEfron, a member of a limited partnership formed to build and\n\noperate an Embassy Suites hotel in Puerto Rico, claims that\n\nseveral of his partners intentionally caused the project to\n\nexperience    financial      difficulties    in    a    scheme    to    extract\n\nadditional money from him and other investors and, ultimately,\n\nto squeeze down the value of Efron’s substantial interest in the\n\npartnership.       Efron brought a civil suit under the Racketeer\n\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1962(c),    (d),    and   Puerto   Rico    law.        Concluding      that   the\n\nallegations in the complaint did not show RICO violations, the\n\ncourt dismissed the federal claims and declined to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the Commonwealth claims.                       See\n\nEfron v. Embassy Suites (Puerto Rico), Inc., 47 F. Supp.2d 200\n\n(D.P.R. 1999).      We affirm, agreeing with the district court that\n\nappellant    has    failed   to    adequately     allege    a    \"pattern      of\n\nracketeering activity,\"        see 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), but adding\n\nelaboration to its rationale.\n\n                          I. Factual Background\n\n    We narrate the allegations contained in the complaint and\n\nRICO case statement in the light most favorable to appellant.\n\nSee Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 37 (lst\n\nCir. 1991).    Efron and his associates formed the ES Hotel Isla\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fVerde, S.E. Partnership (\"the Partnership\") in 1995 to develop\n\nand operate an Embassy Suites hotel and casino in the Carolina\n\nsection       of   San    Juan,       Puerto       Rico.          Efron     contributed\n\napproximately $5 million in property and cash, receiving in\n\nreturn twenty-two percent of the equity in the project.                            Of the\n\nsix other partners, four are defendants in this case: Cleofe\n\nRubi    Gonzalez    (\"Rubi\");         his   wife,      Moraima     Cintron       de   Rubi\n\n(\"Cintron\"); Mora Development Corporation (\"MDC\"), a company\n\nowned by Rubi; and Embassy Suites Isla Verde, Inc. (\"ESIV\"). Two\n\nother partners are described as co-victims, although they did\n\nnot    join    Efron’s        suit:   Corporacion          De   Desarollo        Hotelero\n\n(\"CDH\"), a public corporation that is a subsidiary of Puerto\n\nRico’s Department of Tourism; and Fundacion Segarra Boerman e\n\nHijos     (\"FSBH\").           Also    named       as   defendants         were    several\n\ncorporations affiliated with the defendant partners, including\n\nEmbassy Suites (Puerto Rico), Inc. (\"ESPR\"), a company hired by\n\nthe    Partnership       to    manage   the       hotel,    and    First    Big    Island\n\nSteakhouse, Inc., a Rubi-controlled company that leased space\n\nfrom the Partnership for a restaurant (\"Outback\").                          Emma Cancio\n\nSantos, an attorney for ESIV and Rubi, also was named as a\n\ndefendant.\n\n       Efron alleges that the defendants deliberately caused the\n\nhotel project to lose money by generating excessive construction\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fcosts, engaging in sweetheart leases with the on-site restaurant\n\nand gift shop, overpricing rooms, and performing other acts of\n\nmismanagement.     According to the complaint, ESPR purposefully\n\ncreated artificial cash shortfalls, which under the Partnership\n\nagreement could be covered by capital calls to the limited\n\npartners.   The agreement specified that a partner who did not\n\nprovide the requested capital could have his interest reduced\n\nproportionately.     Efron alleges that, to protect his initial\n\ninvestment and avoid losing his equity, he was forced to invest\n\nan additional $1 million in response to such capital calls.1\n\n      Efron filed suit in October 1997.             The amended complaint\n\nidentified seventeen instances of alleged mail or wire fraud\n\nduring a twenty-one-month period as the unlawful acts supporting\n\na RICO claim, the first of which was a letter sent to the\n\npartners by Rubi on January 11, 1996, stating that the project\n\nwas   experiencing   cost   overruns   of   about    $7   million.   The\n\n\n      1The complaint elaborated on the improper practices as\nfollows: the cost overruns allegedly resulted from (1) payments\nto a Rubi-owned company in excess of the value of goods and\nservices received; (2) subcontractor bills from other Rubi\nprojects that were shifted onto the Partnership, and (3)\nconstruction delays from the late addition to the project of the\nOutback restaurant. Cash shortfalls continued to build after\nthe hotel was completed because the defendants allegedly\noverpriced rooms and failed to adequately market the hotel’s\nservices.   In addition, the lease arrangement with Outback\nallegedly benefited Rubi to the detriment of the Partnership,\nand the lease to the hotel’s gift shop allegedly was below\nmarket value.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsubsequent       letters    fall    into       two   general         categories:    (1)\n\ncommunications that relate to the project’s cost overruns and\n\npossible       solutions,     namely,      capital      contributions       from    the\n\npartners and refinancing, and (2) communications that concern\n\nappellant’s efforts to review the Partnership books and obtain\n\ninformation about the restaurant and other lease arrangements.\n\n       In addition to the substantive RICO claim, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1962 (c), the amended complaint asserted a RICO conspiracy cause\n\nof action, see 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), as well as claims under\n\nCommonwealth      law   for      fraud,    breach       of    contract,    breach    of\n\nfiduciary duty, and violation of the Puerto Rico RICO act.\n\n       The district court rejected defendants’ argument that the\n\namended complaint lacked the particularity required for fraud\n\nclaims    under    Fed.     R.   Civ.     P.    9(b),    but    it    concluded    that\n\nappellant had not adequately alleged a pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity.       It alternatively ruled that Efron lacked standing to\n\nbring the RICO claims either individually or derivatively on\n\nbehalf of the Partnership.              Having dismissed the federal RICO\n\nclaims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\nto hear the Commonwealth law claims.                 On appeal, Efron contends\n\nthat     the    court   improperly         viewed       the    alleged    facts     and\n\ninferences in the defendants’ favor, leading it to conclude\n\nwrongly that he had failed to establish the elements of a RICO\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fviolation and conspiracy.           He further maintains that the amended\n\ncomplaint demonstrates his standing, both individually for his\n\nunique damages and derivatively for the Partnership.\n\n       We turn now to the issue which we deem dispositive – whether\n\nthe amended complaint described a \"pattern\" of racketeering\n\nactivity.       We first sketch the general principles governing RICO\n\nclaims and then evaluate appellant’s specific contentions in\n\nlight of those standards.\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n       To state a RICO claim under section 1962(c), a plaintiff\n\nmust allege each of the four elements required by the statute:\n\n\"'(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of\n\nracketeering activity.’\"            Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 41 (quoting\n\nSedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985)).2              This\n\ncase       centers   on   whether   Efron    alleged   sufficient   facts   to\n\nsupport a jury finding of a \"pattern,\" there being no dispute\n\nthat the complaint adequately alleged the other components of a\n\nRICO violation.           By statute, the \"pattern\" element requires a\n\n\n       2   Section 1962(c) provides, in relevant part:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or\n       associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the\n       activities of which affect, interstate or foreign\n       commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or\n       indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s\n       affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity .\n       . . .\n\n                                       -7-\n\fplaintiff to show at least two predicate acts of \"racketeering\n\nactivity,\" which is defined to include violations of specified\n\nfederal laws, such as the mail and wire fraud statutes,       see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1961(1)(B), (5).    Although showing two predicate acts\n\nis the only statutory requirement, case law establishes that\n\nthis is not sufficient to prove a \"pattern\" – the plaintiff also\n\nmust demonstrate that the \"predicates are related, and that they\n\namount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\"\n\nH.J. Inc. v.   Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239\n\n(1989); see also Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 44.\n\n        We have more than once remarked upon the difficulty of\n\narticulating   concrete   guidelines   for   this   \"continuity   plus\n\nrelationship\" standard for identifying a pattern.        See Schultz\n\nv. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat’l Bank, N.A., 94 F.3d 721, 731\n\n(lst Cir. 1996); Apparel Art Int’l, Inc. v. Jacobson, 967 F.2d\n\n720, 722 (lst Cir. 1992); see also      H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 236\n\n(\"[D]eveloping a meaningful concept of 'pattern' within the\n\nexisting statutory framework has proved to be no easy task.\").3\n\nThe Supreme Court has noted that the \"relationship\" portion of\n\n\n\n    3 The \"continuity plus relationship\" description was quoted\nby the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. from the legislative history\nof the RICO statute.   See 492 U.S. at 239 (quoting 116 Cong.\nRec. 18940 (1970)).   Justice Scalia in a concurrence in H.J.\nInc. termed that formulation \"about as helpful . . . as 'life is\na fountain.'\" Id. at 252 (Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n                                -8-\n\fthe standard is easier to grasp, in part because there exists a\n\nrelevant    statutory    definition       in   another   portion       of    the\n\nlegislation of which RICO was a part.            See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.\n\nat 240.    Under Title X of the partially repealed Organized Crime\n\nControl Act of 1970, the pattern requirement was defined \"solely\n\nin terms of the relationship of the defendant’s criminal acts\n\none   to   another:   '[C]riminal    conduct    forms    a   pattern    if    it\n\nembraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes,\n\nresults, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or\n\notherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and\n\nare not isolated events.’\"      Id.       (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3575(e)).\n\nThe parties do not dispute the relatedness of the communications\n\nat issue here.\n\n      The continuity element, which lacks statutory illumination,\n\nhas proved more puzzling.           Noting that it is \"difficult to\n\nformulate in the abstract any general test for continuity,\" the\n\nSupreme Court in H.J. Inc. nonetheless provided a starting point\n\nfor analysis.     See 492 U.S. at 241-43; Feinstein, 942 F.2d at\n\n45.    We previously have summarized the court’s guidance as\n\nfollows:\n\n      For there to be continuity, the plaintiff must show\n      that the related predicates \"amounted to, or posed a\n      threat of, continued criminal activity.\" . . . Under\n      the \"amount[ing] to\" approach, \"[a] party alleging a\n      RICO violation may demonstrate continuity . . . by\n      proving a series of related predicates extending over\n\n                                    -9-\n\f    a substantial period of time.\" H.J., 492 U.S. at 242.\n    Because RICO was intended by Congress to apply only to\n    enduring criminal conduct, \"[p]redicate acts extending\n    over a few weeks or months . . . do not satisfy this\n    requirement.\"    Id.   Under the \"threat\" approach,\n    however, even where the predicate acts occur in a\n    narrow time frame and suit is brought before the\n    pattern has taken definitive shape, the requirement\n    can still be satisfied by . . . a showing that \"the\n    racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat\n    of repetition extending indefinitely into the future\n    [or] . . . are part of an ongoing entity’s regular way\n    of doing business.\" Id.\n\nFeinstein, 942 F.2d at 45 (some citations omitted).\n\n    The Supreme Court thus described continuity as \"both a\n\nclosed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed\n\nperiod of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its\n\nnature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\"\n\nH.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241.     The Justices also explained in H.J.\n\nInc. that showing a \"pattern\" does not necessarily require proof\n\nof multiple criminal \"schemes.\"         Finding that the \"multiple-\n\nscheme\" prerequisite \"brings a rigidity to the available methods\n\nof proving a pattern that simply is not present in the idea of\n\n'continuity’   itself,\"   id.   at   240-41,   the   Court   emphasized\n\ninstead the temporal focus of the \"continuity\" requirement.\n\nThus, one scheme that extends over a substantial period of time,\n\nor that shows signs of extending indefinitely into the future,\n\ncan establish a pattern.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f       In this case, the district court ruled that the allegations\n\nin appellant’s complaint failed to establish either type of\n\ncontinuity.        After trimming the number of actionable letters and\n\nfaxes to eight,4 it held that \"[t]he acts are simply too few and\n\nthe time period too short\" to establish a closed period of\n\nracketeering        activity,   see   47   F.   Supp.2d   at   206,5   and   it\n\nconcluded that there was no future threat of continuing mail and\n\nwire       fraud   to   establish   open-ended    continuity.      Rejecting\n\nappellant’s contention that the defendants were engaged in a\n\nlong-term, ongoing criminal enterprise, it characterized the\n\nconflict as a \"bitter local law dispute between partners.\"                   Id.\n\nat 210 n.11.\n\n       Before we address the court’s conclusion on the merits, we\n\ndiscuss two preliminary issues.            Efron claims on appeal that the\n\ncourt erred in disregarding the faxes and refusing to consider\n\nall of the specified fraudulent mailings. He claims that, under\n\nNew England Data Servs., Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (lst Cir.\n\n1987), he is entitled to an opportunity to particularize the\n\nalleged predicate acts to remedy their deficiencies regarding\n\n\n       4\n       The court excluded seven faxes because Efron failed to\nallege that they had been transmitted interstate and eliminated\ntwo mailings as not in furtherance of the alleged scheme.\n       5\n      The court pointed out that, of the viable predicate acts,\nall but two occurred during a 90-day period from June to\nSeptember 1997.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fwhen and where the mail or wires were used before his complaint\n\nis dismissed.     He extends this argument as well to his general\n\nallegation     that,   in   addition   to    the     seventeen   specifically\n\npleaded communications, there were \"literally hundreds of acts\"\n\nand a \"myriad of mail and wire frauds.\"               But in this case, the\n\nunderlying rationale for relaxation of pleading requirements –\n\nthat the needed information is likely to be in the exclusive\n\ncontrol of the defendant, see id. at 290 – is absent.                The gist\n\nof Efron’s complaint is that he and his non-conspiring partners\n\nwere defrauded by communications that were sent to them, and\n\nsuch communications would not be in defendants’ sole control.\n\nMoreover, any need to flesh out allegations in the complaint\n\nshould have been raised first through a renewed request to\n\nconduct discovery and a motion in the district court seeking\n\nleave to amend the complaint to cure the infirmities identified\n\nby that court. See Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 43-44.                 Nonetheless,\n\nwhile we consider only those predicate acts specifically alleged\n\nin evaluating the adequacy of appellant’s \"pattern\" allegations,\n\nsee Fleet Credit Corp. v. Sion, 893 F.2d 441, 445 (lst Cir.\n\n1990), we are reluctant in the context of an interstate business\n\nto   exclude    the    faxes   on   the     highly    technical    ground   of\n\nappellant’s failure to plead their interstate quality.                We need\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fnot do so because including them will not change the outcome of\n\nour review.\n\n      A second preliminary issue merits comment.                It is whether\n\nthe pleadings sufficiently indicate that appellant’s injuries\n\nwere caused by the predicate acts of wire and mail fraud.                     That\n\nsuch a causal nexus must exist is well established.                   See Holmes\n\nv. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 266-68 &\n\nn.12 (1992) (to state a RICO claim, plaintiff must show injury\n\nproximately      caused     by   racketeering      activity);         Moore     v.\n\nPainewebber, Inc., 189 F.3d 165, 172 (2d Cir. 1999) (plaintiffs\n\nmust show that the defendants’ misstatements were \"the reason\n\nthe   transaction[s]      turned   out   to   be   .   .   .   losing   one[s]\"\n\n(citation omitted)); Bonilla v. Volvo Car Corp., 150 F.3d 62,\n\n66-67 (lst Cir. 1998) (RICO requires plaintiffs to show that\n\nthey were \"injured in [their] business or property by reason of\"\n\nthe racketeering activity); Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d\n\n41, 44, 47 (lst Cir. 1991) (to avert dismissal under Rule\n\n12(b)(6), civil RICO complaint must state facts showing \"a\n\ncausal   nexus    between    [racketeering     activity]        and    the    harm\n\nalleged\"; the \"injury itself\" must be \"the result of a predicate\n\nact\"); cf. Beck v. Prupis, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 1617 (2000) (holding\n\nthat the injury underlying a RICO conspiracy claim must be\n\ncaused not by any overt act but by conduct that constitutes\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fracketeering activity or is otherwise unlawful under the RICO\n\nstatute).\n\n      On   the    facts,      the       lack   of   causation        seems    to    be    a\n\nsignificant possibility.                Efron entered the partnership before\n\nany of the alleged predicate acts occurred, and thus without\n\nreliance on any misrepresentations.                    He asserts that he was\n\ncoerced into paying $1 million beyond his original contribution\n\nto preserve his equity, but he does not allege that he was\n\ndeceived     by   the    written         requests    for    additional        capital.\n\nInstead, he describes his \"injury-in-fact\" as the prospect of a\n\nsqueezed-down equity position in the partnership, which would\n\nhave been a by-product of his refusal to contribute all of the\n\nrequested     funds     but       not    necessarily    a   loss      occasioned         by\n\nmisrepresentations           or   false     assurances.         In    his    RICO   case\n\nstatement, Efron suggests that he was the only one of the three\n\nvictim     partners     who       was    not   deceived,    asserting        that    the\n\ndefendants \"conducted their misdeeds under unsuspecting eyes,\n\nexcept for Efron.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n      Despite this seeming weakness in appellant’s RICO claim, we\n\nare   disinclined       to    rest      a   judgment   on   a    decision      of    the\n\ncausation issue.        It was alluded to in appellees’ briefs only in\n\na list of pleading requirements, and it was the subject of brief\n\ntreatment by the parties at oral argument.                      It is conceivable\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fthat an extremely generous reading of the complaint might allow\n\nthe inference that Efron contributed $1 million beyond his\n\noriginal    investment    in   response     to   the    defendants’    written\n\nrequests because he initially was deceived into believing there\n\nwas   a   legitimate    need   for   the    funds.      In   any   event,   our\n\ndisposition makes it unnecessary to explore further the question\n\nof whether the mailings caused a loss to appellant.\n\n      We therefore move to the merits and the issue of continuity,\n\naccepting for purposes of our discussion that all seventeen\n\nalleged acts of wire and mail fraud are viable predicate acts\n\nunder the RICO statute.          Although the twenty-one month time\n\nframe     for   these   communications      meets      the   Supreme   Court’s\n\nrequirement for closed continuity of more than \"a few weeks or\n\nmonths,\" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, it is not so long a period\n\nnor are there so many predicate acts that other indicators of\n\ncontinuity – or the lack of them – are without significance.\n\nCf. Fleet Credit Corp., 893 F.2d at 447 (finding that ninety-\n\nfive fraudulent mailings over four and one-half years \"is the\n\ntype of 'long-term criminal conduct’ defined by the [Supreme\n\nCourt] as constituting 'continued criminal activity’\"); United\n\nStates v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 209 (3d Cir. 1992) (\"[M]ost\n\ncourts that have found continuity in a closed period did so in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcases involving periods of several years.\")6; Hindes v. Castle,\n\n937 F.2d 868, 875 (3d Cir. 1991) (collecting cases ranging from\n\na period of four and one-half to seventeen years).\n\n    The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. noted Congress’s \"natural and\n\ncommonsense approach to RICO’s pattern element,\" see 492 U.S. at\n\n237, suggesting that its discussion of temporal factors did not\n\nmean that other considerations were to be entirely ignored.\n\nIndeed, in rejecting the notion that a pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity requires proof of multiple schemes, the Court noted\n\nthat \"proof that a RICO defendant has been involved in multiple\n\ncriminal schemes would certainly be highly relevant to the\n\ninquiry into the continuity of the defendant’s racketeering\n\nactivity.\"   Id.   at   240.   Likewise,   where   the   racketeering\n\nactivity exceeds in duration the \"few weeks or months\" that the\n\nSupreme Court in H.J. Inc. deemed inadequate, but is neither so\n\nextensive in reach nor so far beyond the minimum time period\n\nthat common sense compels a conclusion of continuity, the fact\n\nthat a defendant has been involved in only one scheme with a\n\nsingular objective and a closed group of targeted victims also\n\n\n    6 Although the court in Pelullo concluded that 19 months was\na sufficient period for a finding of continuity, see 964 F.2d at\n209, it expressed some doubt that the facts established either\nopen or closed continuity. See id. at 209 n.15, 210. It\nnonetheless remanded the case for retrial on the RICO count, as\nwell as on multiple wire fraud counts whose reversal was based\non evidentiary error.\n\n                               -16-\n\fstrikes us as \"highly relevant.\"                Cf. Vicom, Inc. v. Harbridge\n\nMerchant Servs., 20 F.3d 771, 780 (7th Cir. 1994) (various\n\nfactors considered in assessing continuity, including the number\n\nof victims, the presence of separate schemes, and the occurrence\n\nof distinct injuries); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d\n\n1534,    1543    (1Oth   Cir.    1993)       (considering,     in    addition     to\n\nduration, \"extensiveness\" of the RICO scheme, including number\n\nof victims, variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries\n\ncaused    were   distinct,      and    the    complexity      and   size    of   the\n\nscheme); Pelullo, 964 F.2d at 208 (\"We have eschewed the notion\n\nthat continuity is solely a temporal concept, though duration\n\nremains the most significant factor.\")7; United States Textiles,\n\nInc. v. Anheuser-Busch Co., 911 F.2d 1261, 1269 (7th Cir. 1990)\n\n(\"'[I]t    is    not     irrelevant,       in     analyzing    the    continuity\n\nrequirement,      that    there       is   only     one   scheme.’\"        (quoting\n\nSutherland v. O’Malley, 882 F.2d 1196, 1204 (7th Cir. 1989)).\n\n    Having considered carefully the various factors here, we\n\nhave concluded that the allegations do not demonstrate the kind\n\nof broad or ongoing criminal behavior at which the RICO statute\n\nwas aimed. In essence, appellant alleges a scheme to diminish\n\n\n    7 The Third Circuit, en banc, later discussed the continuity\nrequirement at length in a series of opinions.     See Tabas v.\nTabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3d Cir. 1995) (en banc).       The majority\nadhered to the view that multiple factors may be relevant in\nevaluating continuity.\n\n                                       -17-\n\fthe value of the project in the short run, pressing plaintiff\n\nand two others to yield up their interests so that the schemers\n\ncould own and control the whole project.                Although multiple\n\nrelated acts of deception were claimed to underlay the faxes and\n\nmailings,    all    allegedly   were     aimed   at   the    single    goal    of\n\ntransforming the ownership of the Partnership during its early\n\nstages.      See Amended Complaint, ¶ 19 (defendants’ goal was \"to\n\ndilute the interests of the Special Partners and to siphon away\n\nPartnership     assets\"    to     gain     \"outright        control    of     the\n\nPartnership\").       The three named victims were not separately\n\ntargeted through repetitions of criminal conduct, which could\n\nhave reflected persistent or broad-based crime; their injury\n\ninstead resulted from a single set of alleged misdeeds and\n\noccurred at the same time.\n\n       This narrow attack on three partners’ participation in a\n\nparticular business venture is qualitatively different from the\n\nsingle scheme underlying H.J. Inc.               The plaintiffs there had\n\nalleged that telephone company officials and others had engaged\n\nin multiple acts of bribery over at least a six-year period to\n\nobtain approval for unfairly and unreasonably high rates.                     492\n\nU.S.    at   250.     Thousands    of     telephone     company       customers\n\npresumably were injured by the ongoing scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f    Although a RICO pattern need not have countless victims, the\n\nfinite    nature    of    the   racketeering       activities       alleged     here,\n\ntogether with their occurrence over a relatively modest period\n\nof time, cannot, in our view, support a jury finding of a RICO\n\npattern    under    the     \"closed\"    continuity         approach.        Our    own\n\nprecedent    firmly       rejects   RICO       liability    where    \"the   alleged\n\nracketeering acts . . . , 'taken together, . . . comprise a\n\nsingle    effort’    to    facilitate      a    single     financial    endeavor,\"\n\nSchultz, 94 F.3d at 732; see also Apparel Art, 967 F.2d at 723\n\n(\"[A] single criminal episode, or event, is not a 'pattern’ . .\n\n. [because] its parts, taken together, do not 'amount to or pose\n\na threat of continued criminal activity.’\") (quoting H.J. Inc.,\n\n492 U.S. at 239).8         And, while the cases in this volatile field\n\nunderstandably cannot all be reconciled, we find ourselves in\n\ngood company.       See, e.g., Edmondson & Gallagher v. Alban Towers\n\nTenants Ass’n, 48 F.3d 1260, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (combination\n\nof \"single scheme, single injury, and few victims . . . makes it\n\nvirtually     impossible        for     plaintiffs         to   state       a     RICO\n\n\n\n\n    8  In Apparel Art, then Chief Judge Breyer noted that the\ncourt deliberately used \"a vague term like 'episode'\" to\ndistinguish the concept of an isolated occurrence from the\ntechnical concept of a scheme, as used by the Supreme Court in\nH.J.

Wasserman, 886 F.2d 681, 684 (4th\n\nCir. 1989) (\"Defendants’ actions were narrowly directed towards\n\na single fraudulent goal.\").\n\n       Nor is it reasonable to infer from the allegations here that\n\nthere is a risk of a broader scheme, or that the fraudulent acts\n\ndirected       at    appellant      would    continue       indefinitely     into    the\n\nfuture, either of which might support a conclusion of \"open-\n\nended\"       continuity.         There     is     nothing    to   suggest    that    the\n\ndefendants          would    seek     to     repeat     their      fraud    in   other\n\npartnerships or similar business settings, or to employ mail and\n\nwire       fraud    indefinitely      in    the    Embassy    Suites   partnership,\n\nthereby showing that racketeering activity might be a \"regular\n\nway of conducting defendant’s ongoing legitimate business . . .\n\n\n       9\n       In Alban Towers, the court noted that \"[t]he number of\nalleged predicate acts (fifteen), and the most generous estimate\nof the length of time the acts continued (three years . . .),\nare not enough to overwhelm the three narrowing factors.\" 48\nF.3d at 1265.\n\n                                            -20-\n\for of conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate\n\nRICO 'enterprise,’\" H.J.

Inc., 492\n\nU.S. at 242.       Almost by definition, the alleged fraud had a\n\nlimited life expectancy.         The scheme’s objective, as reasonably\n\nunderstood from Efron’s not fully consistent allegations,10 was\n\n\n    10 In paragraph 19 of the amended complaint and on page 6 of\nthe RICO case statement, for example, Efron describes the\ndefendants’ goal to be \"gaining outright control of the\nPartnership.\"   In paragraph 22 of the amended complaint, he\nalleges that MDC and Rubi made \"continual capital calls either\nto defraud the Special Partners of more money or, alternatively,\nto try to 'squeeze down’ their interests in the Partnership.\"\n(Emphasis added.) Paragraph 41, section a, described the first\nalleged predicate act as a letter sent by Rubi to the special\npartners concerning cost overruns. Efron alleges: \"This was the\nimplementation, carrying out, and continuation of the previously\ndesigned scheme to defraud Efron out of additional monies or\nalternatively to dilute his interest and to deprive him of the\nfull realization of his investment, or all of these.\"         In\nsection r of that paragraph, at the conclusion of the full list\nof predicate acts, he asserts: \"All of the noted predicate acts\nwere meant to defraud, misrepresent, mislead, and to deprive the\nSpecial Partners, including Efron, of their ownership interest\nin the Partnership.\"\n\n    Thus, although the amended complaint and RICO case statement\n\n                                    -21-\n\fto squeeze appellant and two co-partners out of the partnership\n\nearly in its existence so that the remaining partners could reap\n\ngreater profits through the self-interested operation of this\n\nhotel and their other businesses.        See Vicom, Inc., 20 F.3d at\n\n782 (\"[S]chemes which have a clear and terminable goal have a\n\nnatural ending point . . . [and] therefore cannot support a\n\nfinding   of   any   specific   threat   of    continuity   that   would\n\nconstitute open-ended continuity.\").\n\n    It is true that the scheme as alleged already had spanned\n\ntwenty-one months, and that its exact endpoint could not be\n\nascertained from the pleadings because it depended upon Efron’s\n\nand the other victim partners’ refusal to respond to capital\n\ncalls large enough to result in squeezing down their interests\n\nin the Partnership.     This is far different, however, from the\n\nopen-ended continuity illustrated by the single scheme described\n\nin H.J. Inc., an endeavor that apparently would have gone on\n\nwithout end had it not been detected.         See 492 U.S. at 250.   Had\n\nEfron argued that the defendants planned to operate the hotel\n\n\nrefer to a general goal to defraud Efron and the other victim\npartners of \"more money,\" the amended complaint read as a whole\ndoes not depict this as a long-term objective but simply as a\nnecessary step toward defendants’ specific goal of \"tak[ng]\nunrestricted control of the enterprise.\" See RICO case statement\nat 7. His brief and oral argument were framed similarly. See,\ne.g., Brief at 27 (\"By their nature, the [defendants’] goals\nwill not be reached, at least until such time as plaintiff loses\nhis entire interest in the partnership.\")\n\n                                 -22-\n\findefinitely   at   a   paper    loss    as   a   means   of       perpetually\n\ndefrauding him, rather than asserting the specific objective of\n\nsqueezing him out of the Partnership, he would have a stronger\n\nargument for an open-ended RICO pattern.              His pleadings and\n\nargument,   however,    depict   an   undertaking    with      a    soon-to-be\n\nreached endpoint.       Indeed, Efron’s refusal to contribute any\n\nmore funds and his decision to file suit to protect his interest\n\nsuggest that the objective was virtually accomplished.\n\n    We note that c ourts, including our own, have suggested that\n\nRICO claims premised on mail or wire fraud must be particularly\n\nscrutinized because of the relative ease with which a plaintiff\n\nmay mold a RICO pattern from allegations that, upon closer\n\nscrutiny, do not support it.          See, e.g., Schultz, 94 F.3d at\n\n732; Roeder, 814 F.2d at 31.            The Seventh Circuit has been\n\nexplicit in cautioning against finding continuity too easily in\n\nthe context of a single dishonest undertaking involving mail or\n\nwire fraud:\n\n         Virtually   every    garden-variety    fraud   is\n    accomplished through a series of wire or mail fraud\n    acts that are \"related\" by purpose and spread over a\n    period of at least several months.       Where such a\n    fraudulent scheme inflicts or threatens only a single\n    injury, we continue to doubt that Congress intended to\n    make the availability of treble damages and augmented\n    criminal sanctions [under RICO] dependent solely on\n    whether the fraudulent scheme is well enough conceived\n    to enjoy prompt success or requires pursuit for an\n    extended period of time.      Given its \"natural and\n    common sense approach to RICO’s pattern element,\" we\n\n                                  -23-\n\f    think it unlikely that Congress intended RICO to apply\n    in the absence of a more significant societal threat.\n\nUnited   States    Textiles,      Inc.,    911     F.2d   at     1268    (quoting\n\nMarshall-Silver Constr.

Questions concerning his\n\nstanding obviously are moot.        In addition, his conspiracy claim\n\nis without merit.

Efron brought a civil suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), (d), and Puerto Rico law. Concluding that the allegations in the complaint did not show RICO violations, the court dismissed the federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Commonwealth claims. See Efron v. Embassy Suites (Puerto Rico), Inc., 47 F. Supp.2d 200 (D.P.R. 1999). We affirm, agreeing with the district court that appellant has failed to adequately allege a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), but adding elaboration to its rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We narrate the allegations contained in the complaint and RICO case statement in the light most favorable to appellant. See Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 37 (lst Cir. 1991). Efron and his associates formed the ES Hotel Isla Verde, S.E. Partnership (\"the Partnership\") in 1995 to develop and operate an Embassy Suites hotel and casino in the Carolina section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Efron contributed approximately $5 million in property and cash, receiving in return twenty-two percent of the equity in the project. Of the six other partners, four are defendants in this case: Cleofe Rubi Gonzalez (\"Rubi\"); his wife, Moraima Cintron de Rubi (\"Cintron\"); Mora Development Corporation (\"MDC\"), a company owned by Rubi; and Embassy Suites Isla Verde, Inc. (\"ESIV\"). Two other partners are described as co-victims, although they did not join Efron's suit: Corporacion De Desarollo Hotelero (\"CDH\"), a public corporation that is a subsidiary of Puerto Rico's Department of Tourism; and Fundacion Segarra Boerman e Hijos (\"FSBH\"). Also named as defendants were several corporations affiliated with the defendant partners, including Embassy Suites (Puerto Rico), Inc. (\"ESPR\"), a company hired by the Partnership to manage the hotel, and First Big Island Steakhouse, Inc., a Rubi-controlled company that leased space from the Partnership for a restaurant (\"Outback\"). Emma Cancio Santos, an attorney for ESIV and Rubi, also was named as a defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Efron alleges that the defendants deliberately caused the hotel project to lose money by generating excessive construction costs, engaging in sweetheart leases with the on-site restaurant and gift shop, overpricing rooms, and performing other acts of mismanagement. According to the complaint, ESPR purposefully created artificial cash shortfalls, which under the Partnership agreement could be covered by capital calls to the limited partners. The agreement specified that a partner who did not provide the requested capital could have his interest reduced proportionately. Efron alleges that, to protect his initial investment and avoid losing his equity, he was forced to invest an additional $1 million in response to such capital calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Efron filed suit in October 1997. The amended complaint identified seventeen instances of alleged mail or wire fraud during a twenty-one-month period as the unlawful acts supporting a RICO claim, the first of which was a letter sent to the partners by Rubi on January 11, 1996, stating that the project was experiencing cost overruns of about $7 million. The subsequent letters fall into two general categories: (1) communications that relate to the project's cost overruns and possible solutions, namely, capital contributions from the partners and refinancing, and (2) communications that concern appellant's efforts to review the Partnership books and obtain information about the restaurant and other lease arrangements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the substantive RICO claim, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962 (c), the amended complaint asserted a RICO conspiracy cause of action, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(d), as well as claims under Commonwealth law for fraud, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the Puerto Rico RICO act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected defendants' argument that the amended complaint lacked the particularity required for fraud claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), but it concluded that appellant had not adequately alleged a pattern of racketeering activity. It alternatively ruled that Efron lacked standing to bring the RICO claims either individually or derivatively on behalf of the Partnership. Having dismissed the federal RICO claims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear the Commonwealth law claims. On appeal, Efron contends that the court improperly viewed the alleged facts and inferences in the defendants' favor, leading it to conclude wrongly that he had failed to establish the elements of a RICO violation and conspiracy. He further maintains that the amended complaint demonstrates his standing, both individually for his unique damages and derivatively for the Partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the issue which we deem dispositive - whether the amended complaint described a \"pattern\" of racketeering activity. We first sketch the general principles governing RICO claims and then evaluate appellant's specific contentions in light of those standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a RICO claim under section 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege each of the four elements required by the statute: \"'(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'\" Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 41 (quoting Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This case centers on whether Efron alleged sufficient facts to support a jury finding of a \"pattern,\" there being no dispute that the complaint adequately alleged the other components of a RICO violation. By statute, the \"pattern\" element requires a plaintiff to show at least two predicate acts of \"racketeering activity,\" which is defined to include violations of specified federal laws, such as the mail and wire fraud statutes, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(1)(B), (5). Although showing two predicate acts is the only statutory requirement, case law establishes that this is not sufficient to prove a \"pattern\" - the plaintiff also must demonstrate that the \"predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\" H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989); see also Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have more than once remarked upon the difficulty of articulating concrete guidelines for this \"continuity plus relationship\" standard for identifying a pattern. See Schultz v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank, N.A., 94 F.3d 721, 731 (lst Cir. 1996); Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Jacobson, 967 F.2d 720, 722 (lst Cir. 1992); see also H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 236 (\"[D]eveloping a meaningful concept of 'pattern' within the existing statutory framework has proved to be no easy task.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Supreme Court has noted that the \"relationship\" portion of the standard is easier to grasp, in part because there exists a relevant statutory definition in another portion of the legislation of which RICO was a part. See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240. Under Title X of the partially repealed Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, the pattern requirement was defined \"solely in terms of the relationship of the defendant's criminal acts one to another: '[C]riminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'\" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3575(e)). The parties do not dispute the relatedness of the communications at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The continuity element, which lacks statutory illumination, has proved more puzzling. Noting that it is \"difficult to formulate in the abstract any general test for continuity,\" the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. nonetheless provided a starting point for analysis. See 492 U.S. at 241-43; Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 45. We previously have summarized the court's guidance as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For there to be continuity, the plaintiff must show that the related predicates \"amounted to, or posed a threat of, continued criminal activity.\"... Under the \"amount[ing] to\" approach, \"[a] party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity... by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.\" H.J., 492 U.S. at 242. Because RICO was intended by Congress to apply only to enduring criminal conduct, \"[p]redicate acts extending over a few weeks or months... do not satisfy this requirement.\" Id. Under the \"threat\" approach, however, even where the predicate acts occur in a narrow time frame and suit is brought before the pattern has taken definitive shape, the requirement can still be satisfied by... a showing that \"the racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future [or]... are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 45 (some citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court thus described continuity as \"both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241. The Justices also explained in H.J. Inc. that showing a \"pattern\" does not necessarily require proof of multiple criminal \"schemes.\" Finding that the \"multiple-scheme\" prerequisite \"brings a rigidity to the available methods of proving a pattern that simply is not present in the idea of 'continuity' itself,\" id. at 240-41, the Court emphasized instead the temporal focus of the \"continuity\" requirement. Thus, one scheme that extends over a substantial period of time, or that shows signs of extending indefinitely into the future, can establish a pattern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court ruled that the allegations in appellant's complaint failed to establish either type of continuity. After trimming the number of actionable letters and faxes to eight,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it held that \"[t]he acts are simply too few and the time period too short\" to establish a closed period of racketeering activity, see 47 F. Supp.2d at 206,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and it concluded that there was no future threat of continuing mail and wire fraud to establish open-ended continuity. Rejecting appellant's contention that the defendants were engaged in a long-term, ongoing criminal enterprise, it characterized the conflict as a \"bitter local law dispute between partners.\" Id. at 210 n.11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we address the court's conclusion on the merits, we discuss two preliminary issues. Efron claims on appeal that the court erred in disregarding the faxes and refusing to consider all of the specified fraudulent mailings. He claims that, under New England Data Servs., Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (lst Cir. 1987), he is entitled to an opportunity to particularize the alleged predicate acts to remedy their deficiencies regarding when and where the mail or wires were used before his complaint is dismissed. He extends this argument as well to his general allegation that, in addition to the seventeen specifically pleaded communications, there were \"literally hundreds of acts\" and a \"myriad of mail and wire frauds.\" But in this case, the underlying rationale for relaxation of pleading requirements - that the needed information is likely to be in the exclusive control of the defendant, see id. at 290 - is absent. The gist of Efron's complaint is that he and his non-conspiring partners were defrauded by communications that were sent to them, and such communications would not be in defendants' sole control. Moreover, any need to flesh out allegations in the complaint should have been raised first through a renewed request to conduct discovery and a motion in the district court seeking leave to amend the complaint to cure the infirmities identified by that court. See Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 43-44. Nonetheless, while we consider only those predicate acts specifically alleged in evaluating the adequacy of appellant's \"pattern\" allegations, see Fleet Credit Corp. v. Sion, 893 F.2d 441, 445 (lst Cir. 1990), we are reluctant in the context of an interstate business to exclude the faxes on the highly technical ground of appellant's failure to plead their interstate quality. We need not do so because including them will not change the outcome of our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second preliminary issue merits comment. It is whether the pleadings sufficiently indicate that appellant's injuries were caused by the predicate acts of wire and mail fraud. That such a causal nexus must exist is well established. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 266-68 &amp; n.12 (1992) (to state a RICO claim, plaintiff must show injury proximately caused by racketeering activity); Moore v. Painewebber, Inc., 189 F.3d 165, 172 (2d Cir. 1999) (plaintiffs must show that the defendants' misstatements were \"the reason the transaction[s] turned out to be... losing one[s]\" (citation omitted)); Bonilla v. Volvo Car Corp., 150 F.3d 62, 66-67 (lst Cir. 1998) (RICO requires plaintiffs to show that they were \"injured in [their] business or property by reason of\" the racketeering activity); Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44, 47 (lst Cir. 1991) (to avert dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), civil RICO complaint must state facts showing \"a causal nexus between [racketeering activity] and the harm alleged\"; the \"injury itself\" must be \"the result of a predicate act\"); cf. Beck v. Prupis, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 1617 (2000) (holding that the injury underlying a RICO conspiracy claim must be caused not by any overt act but by conduct that constitutes racketeering activity or is otherwise unlawful under the RICO statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the facts, the lack of causation seems to be a significant possibility. Efron entered the partnership before any of the alleged predicate acts occurred, and thus without reliance on any misrepresentations. He asserts that he was coerced into paying $1 million beyond his original contribution to preserve his equity, but he does not allege that he was deceived by the written requests for additional capital. Instead, he describes his \"injury-in-fact\" as the prospect of a squeezed-down equity position in the partnership, which would have been a by-product of his refusal to contribute all of the requested funds but not necessarily a loss occasioned by misrepresentations or false assurances. In his RICO case statement, Efron suggests that he was the only one of the three victim partners who was not deceived, asserting that the defendants \"conducted their misdeeds under unsuspecting eyes, except for Efron.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this seeming weakness in appellant's RICO claim, we are disinclined to rest a judgment on a decision of the causation issue. It was alluded to in appellees' briefs only in a list of pleading requirements, and it was the subject of brief treatment by the parties at oral argument. It is conceivable that an extremely generous reading of the complaint might allow the inference that Efron contributed $1 million beyond his original investment in response to the defendants' written requests because he initially was deceived into believing there was a legitimate need for the funds. In any event, our disposition makes it unnecessary to explore further the question of whether the mailings caused a loss to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore move to the merits and the issue of continuity, accepting for purposes of our discussion that all seventeen alleged acts of wire and mail fraud are viable predicate acts under the RICO statute. Although the twenty-one month time frame for these communications meets the Supreme Court's requirement for closed continuity of more than \"a few weeks or months,\" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, it is not so long a period nor are there so many predicate acts that other indicators of continuity - or the lack of them - are without significance. Cf. Fleet Credit Corp., 893 F.2d at 447 (finding that ninety-five fraudulent mailings over four and one-half years \"is the type of 'long-term criminal conduct' defined by the [Supreme Court] as constituting 'continued criminal activity'\"); United States v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 209 (3d Cir. 1992) (\"[M]ost courts that have found continuity in a closed period did so in cases involving periods of several years.\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>; Hindes v. Castle, 937 F.2d 868, 875 (3d Cir. 1991) (collecting cases ranging from a period of four and one-half to seventeen years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. noted Congress's \"natural and commonsense approach to RICO's pattern element,\" see 492 U.S. at 237, suggesting that its discussion of temporal factors did not mean that other considerations were to be entirely ignored. Indeed, in rejecting the notion that a pattern of racketeering activity requires proof of multiple schemes, the Court noted that \"proof that a RICO defendant has been involved in multiple criminal schemes would certainly be highly relevant to the inquiry into the continuity of the defendant's racketeering activity.\" Id. at 240. Likewise, where the racketeering activity exceeds in duration the \"few weeks or months\" that the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. deemed inadequate, but is neither so extensive in reach nor so far beyond the minimum time period that common sense compels a conclusion of continuity, the fact that a defendant has been involved in only one scheme with a singular objective and a closed group of targeted victims also strikes us as \"highly relevant.\" Cf. Vicom, Inc. v. Harbridge Merchant Servs., 20 F.3d 771, 780 (7th Cir. 1994) (various factors considered in assessing continuity, including the number of victims, the presence of separate schemes, and the occurrence of distinct injuries); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (1Oth Cir. 1993) (considering, in addition to duration, \"extensiveness\" of the RICO scheme, including number of victims, variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries caused were distinct, and the complexity and size of the scheme); Pelullo, 964 F.2d at 208 (\"We have eschewed the notion that continuity is solely a temporal concept, though duration remains the most significant factor.\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>; United States Textiles, Inc. v. Anheuser-Busch Co., 911 F.2d 1261, 1269 (7th Cir. 1990) (\"'[I]t is not irrelevant, in analyzing the continuity requirement, that there is only one scheme.'\" (quoting Sutherland v. O'Malley, 882 F.2d 1196, 1204 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered carefully the various factors here, we have concluded that the allegations do not demonstrate the kind of broad or ongoing criminal behavior at which the RICO statute was aimed. In essence, appellant alleges a scheme to diminish the value of the project in the short run, pressing plaintiff and two others to yield up their interests so that the schemers could own and control the whole project. Although multiple related acts of deception were claimed to underlay the faxes and mailings, all allegedly were aimed at the single goal of transforming the ownership of the Partnership during its early stages. See Amended Complaint, &#182; 19 (defendants' goal was \"to dilute the interests of the Special Partners and to siphon away Partnership assets\" to gain \"outright control of the Partnership\"). The three named victims were not separately targeted through repetitions of criminal conduct, which could have reflected persistent or broad-based crime; their injury instead resulted from a single set of alleged misdeeds and occurred at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This narrow attack on three partners' participation in a particular business venture is qualitatively different from the single scheme underlying H.J. Inc. The plaintiffs there had alleged that telephone company officials and others had engaged in multiple acts of bribery over at least a six-year period to obtain approval for unfairly and unreasonably high rates. 492 U.S. at 250. Thousands of telephone company customers presumably were injured by the ongoing scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a RICO pattern need not have countless victims, the finite nature of the racketeering activities alleged here, together with their occurrence over a relatively modest period of time, cannot, in our view, support a jury finding of a RICO pattern under the \"closed\" continuity approach. Our own precedent firmly rejects RICO liability where \"the alleged racketeering acts..., 'taken together,... comprise a single effort' to facilitate a single financial endeavor,\" Schultz, 94 F.3d at 732; see also Apparel Art, 967 F.2d at 723 (\"[A] single criminal episode, or event, is not a 'pattern'... [because] its parts, taken together, do not 'amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'\") (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> And, while the cases in this volatile field understandably cannot all be reconciled, we find ourselves in good company. See, e.g., Edmondson &amp; Gallagher v. Alban Towers Tenants Ass'n, 48 F.3d 1260, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (combination of \"single scheme, single injury, and few victims... makes it virtually impossible for plaintiffs to state a RICO claim\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Stone, 998 F.2d at 1545 (\"Where the scheme has a limited purpose, most courts have found no continuity.\"); Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516 (1Oth Cir. 1990) (affirming dismissal of RICO claim where a \"closed-ended series of predicate acts... constituted a single scheme to accomplish 'one discrete goal,' directed at one individual with no potential to extend to other persons or entities\" (citation omitted)); Menasco, Inc. v. Wasserman, 886 F.2d 681, 684 (4th Cir. 1989) (\"Defendants' actions were narrowly directed towards a single fraudulent goal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it reasonable to infer from the allegations here that there is a risk of a broader scheme, or that the fraudulent acts directed at appellant would continue indefinitely into the future, either of which might support a conclusion of \"open-ended\" continuity. There is nothing to suggest that the defendants would seek to repeat their fraud in other partnerships or similar business settings, or to employ mail and wire fraud indefinitely in the Embassy Suites partnership, thereby showing that racketeering activity might be a \"regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate business... or of conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise,'\" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 243; cf. Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc., 814 F.2d 22, 31 (lst Cir. 1987) (\"no suggestion that defendants used similar means to obtain other subcontracts, or that they bribed anyone else\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the Partnership as either the RICO enterprise or defendants' \"ongoing legitimate business,\" the scenario painted by Efron's pleadings does not threaten the \"long-term criminal conduct\" with which Congress was concerned, see H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242. Almost by definition, the alleged fraud had a limited life expectancy. The scheme's objective, as reasonably understood from Efron's not fully consistent allegations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> was to squeeze appellant and two co-partners out of the partnership early in its existence so that the remaining partners could reap greater profits through the self-interested operation of this hotel and their other businesses. See Vicom, Inc., 20 F.3d at 782 (\"[S]chemes which have a clear and terminable goal have a natural ending point... [and] therefore cannot support a finding of any specific threat of continuity that would constitute open-ended continuity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the scheme as alleged already had spanned twenty-one months, and that its exact endpoint could not be ascertained from the pleadings because it depended upon Efron's and the other victim partners' refusal to respond to capital calls large enough to result in squeezing down their interests in the Partnership. This is far different, however, from the open-ended continuity illustrated by the single scheme described in H.J. Inc., an endeavor that apparently would have gone on without end had it not been detected. See 492 U.S. at 250. Had Efron argued that the defendants planned to operate the hotel indefinitely at a paper loss as a means of perpetually defrauding him, rather than asserting the specific objective of squeezing him out of the Partnership, he would have a stronger argument for an open-ended RICO pattern. His pleadings and argument, however, depict an undertaking with a soon-to-be reached endpoint. Indeed, Efron's refusal to contribute any more funds and his decision to file suit to protect his interest suggest that the objective was virtually accomplished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that courts, including our own, have suggested that RICO claims premised on mail or wire fraud must be particularly scrutinized because of the relative ease with which a plaintiff may mold a RICO pattern from allegations that, upon closer scrutiny, do not support it. See, e.g., Schultz, 94 F.3d at 732; Roeder, 814 F.2d at 31.

Where such a fraudulent scheme inflicts or threatens only a single injury, we continue to doubt that Congress intended to make the availability of treble damages and augmented criminal sanctions [under RICO] dependent solely on whether the fraudulent scheme is well enough conceived to enjoy prompt success or requires pursuit for an extended period of time. Given its \"natural and common sense approach to RICO's pattern element,\" we think it unlikely that Congress intended RICO to apply in the absence of a more significant societal threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States Textiles, Inc., 911 F.2d at 1268 (quoting Marshall-Silver Constr.

Paragraph 41, section a, described the first alleged predicate act as a letter sent by Rubi to the special partners concerning cost overruns. Efron alleges: \"This was the implementation, carrying out, and continuation of the previously designed scheme to defraud Efron out of additional monies or alternatively to dilute his interest and to deprive him of the full realization of his investment, or all of these.\" In section r of that paragraph, at the conclusion of the full list of predicate acts, he asserts: \"All of the noted predicate acts were meant to defraud, misrepresent, mislead, and to deprive the Special Partners, including Efron, of their ownership interest in the Partnership.\"</p>\n        <p>Thus, although the amended complaint and RICO case statement refer to a general goal to defraud Efron and the other victim partners of \"more money,\" the amended complaint read as a whole does not depict this as a long-term objective but simply as a necessary step toward defendants' specific goal of \"tak[ng] unrestricted control of the enterprise.\" See RICO case statement at 7.

Efron brought a civil suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), (d), and Puerto Rico law. Concluding that the allegations in the complaint did not show RICO violations, the court dismissed the federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Commonwealth claims.

Efron and his associates formed the ES Hotel Isla Verde, S.E. Partnership (\"the Partnership\") in 1995 to develop and operate an Embassy Suites hotel and casino in the Carolina section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Efron contributed approximately $5 million in property and cash, receiving in return twenty-two percent of the equity in the project. Of the six other partners, four are defendants in this case: Cleofe Rubi Gonzalez (\"Rubi\"); his wife, Moraima Cintron de Rubi (\"Cintron\"); Mora Development Corporation (\"MDC\"), a company owned by Rubi; and Embassy Suites Isla Verde, Inc. (\"ESIV\"). Two other partners are described as co-victims, although they did not join Efron's suit: Corporacion De Desarollo Hotelero (\"CDH\"), a public corporation that is a subsidiary of Puerto Rico's Department of Tourism; and Fundacion Segarra Boerman e Hijos (\"FSBH\"). Also named as defendants were several corporations affiliated with the defendant partners, including Embassy Suites (Puerto Rico), Inc. (\"ESPR\"), a company hired by the Partnership to manage the hotel, and First Big Island Steakhouse, Inc., a Rubi-controlled company that leased space from the Partnership for a restaurant (\"Outback\"). Emma Cancio Santos, an attorney for ESIV and Rubi, also was named as a defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Efron alleges that the defendants deliberately caused the hotel project to lose money by generating excessive construction costs, engaging in sweetheart leases with the on-site restaurant and gift shop, overpricing rooms, and performing other acts of mismanagement. According to the complaint, ESPR purposefully created artificial cash shortfalls, which under the Partnership agreement could be covered by capital calls to the limited partners. The agreement specified that a partner who did not provide the requested capital could have his interest reduced proportionately. Efron alleges that, to protect his initial investment and avoid losing his equity, he was forced to invest an additional $1 million in response to such capital calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Efron filed suit in October 1997. The amended complaint identified seventeen instances of alleged mail or wire fraud during a twenty-one-month period as the unlawful acts supporting a RICO claim, the first of which was a letter sent to the partners by Rubi on January 11, 1996, stating that the project was experiencing cost overruns of about $7 million. The subsequent letters fall into two general categories: (1) communications that relate to the project's cost overruns and possible solutions, namely, capital contributions from the partners and refinancing, and (2) communications that concern appellant's efforts to review the Partnership books and obtain information about the restaurant and other lease arrangements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the substantive RICO claim, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962 (c), the amended complaint asserted a RICO conspiracy cause of action, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(d), as well as claims under Commonwealth law for fraud, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the Puerto Rico RICO act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected defendants' argument that the amended complaint lacked the particularity required for fraud claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), but it concluded that appellant had not adequately alleged a pattern of racketeering activity. It alternatively ruled that Efron lacked standing to bring the RICO claims either individually or derivatively on behalf of the Partnership. Having dismissed the federal RICO claims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear the Commonwealth law claims. On appeal, Efron contends that the court improperly viewed the alleged facts and inferences in the defendants' favor, leading it to conclude wrongly that he had failed to establish the elements of a RICO violation and conspiracy. He further maintains that the amended complaint demonstrates his standing, both individually for his unique damages and derivatively for the Partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the issue which we deem dispositive - whether the amended complaint described a \"pattern\" of racketeering activity.

The Justices also explained in H.J. Inc. that showing a \"pattern\" does not necessarily require proof of multiple criminal \"schemes.\" Finding that the \"multiple-scheme\" prerequisite \"brings a rigidity to the available methods of proving a pattern that simply is not present in the idea of 'continuity' itself,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 240-41, </a></span>the Court emphasized instead the temporal focus of the \"continuity\" requirement.

After trimming the number of actionable letters and faxes to eight,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it held that \"[t]he acts are simply too few and the time period too short\" to establish a closed period of racketeering activity, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2527557\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2527557/efron-v-embassy-suites-puerto-rico-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Rejecting appellant's contention that the defendants were engaged in a long-term, ongoing criminal enterprise, it characterized the conflict as a \"bitter local law dispute between partners.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2527557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2527557/efron-v-embassy-suites-puerto-rico-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 210 </a></span>n.11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we address the court's conclusion on the merits, we discuss two preliminary issues. Efron claims on appeal that the court erred in disregarding the faxes and refusing to consider all of the specified fraudulent mailings. He claims that, under New England Data Servs., Inc. v. Becher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494597\"><a href=\"/opinion/494597/new-england-data-services-inc-v-barry-becher/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span> </a></span>(lst Cir. 1987), he is entitled to an opportunity to particularize the alleged predicate acts to remedy their deficiencies regarding when and where the mail or wires were used before his complaint is dismissed. He extends this argument as well to his general allegation that, in addition to the seventeen specifically pleaded communications, there were \"literally hundreds of acts\" and a \"myriad of mail and wire frauds.\" But in this case, the underlying rationale for relaxation of pleading requirements - that the needed information is likely to be in the exclusive control of the defendant, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494597\"><a href=\"/opinion/494597/new-england-data-services-inc-v-barry-becher/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 290 </a></span>- is absent. The gist of Efron's complaint is that he and his non-conspiring partners were defrauded by communications that were sent to them, and such communications would not be in defendants' sole control. Moreover, any need to flesh out allegations in the complaint should have been raised first through a renewed request to conduct discovery and a motion in the district court seeking leave to amend the complaint to cure the infirmities identified by that court. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566797\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Feinstein,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566797/william-c-feinstein-v-resolution-trust-corporation-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">43-44</span></a></span>. Nonetheless, while we consider only those predicate acts specifically alleged in evaluating the adequacy of appellant's \"pattern\" allegations, see Fleet Credit Corp. v. Sion, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534779\"><a href=\"/opinion/534779/fleet-credit-corporation-v-anthony-sion/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span>, 445 (lst Cir. 1990), we are reluctant in the context of an interstate business to exclude the faxes on the highly technical ground of appellant's failure to plead their interstate quality. We need not do so because including them will not change the outcome of our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second preliminary issue merits comment. It is whether the pleadings sufficiently indicate that appellant's injuries were caused by the predicate acts of wire and mail fraud. That such a causal nexus must exist is well established. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 266-68 &amp; n.12 (1992) (to state a RICO claim, plaintiff must show injury proximately caused by racketeering activity); Moore v.

Efron entered the partnership before any of the alleged predicate acts occurred, and thus without reliance on any misrepresentations. He asserts that he was coerced into paying $1 million beyond his original contribution to preserve his equity, but he does not allege that he was deceived by the written requests for additional capital. Instead, he describes his \"injury-in-fact\" as the prospect of a squeezed-down equity position in the partnership, which would have been a by-product of his refusal to contribute all of the requested funds but not necessarily a loss occasioned by misrepresentations or false assurances. In his RICO case statement, Efron suggests that he was the only one of the three victim partners who was not deceived, asserting that the defendants \"conducted their misdeeds under unsuspecting eyes, except for Efron.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this seeming weakness in appellant's RICO claim, we are disinclined to rest a judgment on a decision of the causation issue. It was alluded to in appellees' briefs only in a list of pleading requirements, and it was the subject of brief treatment by the parties at oral argument. It is conceivable that an extremely generous reading of the complaint might allow the inference that Efron contributed $1 million beyond his original investment in response to the defendants' written requests because he initially was deceived into believing there was a legitimate need for the funds. In any event, our disposition makes it unnecessary to explore further the question of whether the mailings caused a loss to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore move to the merits and the issue of continuity, accepting for purposes of our discussion that all seventeen alleged acts of wire and mail fraud are viable predicate acts under the RICO statute. Although the twenty-one month time frame for these communications meets the Supreme Court's requirement for closed continuity of more than \"a few weeks or months,\" H.J. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, it is not so long a period nor are there so many predicate acts that other indicators of continuity - or the lack of them - are without significance.

Indeed, in rejecting the notion that a pattern of racketeering activity requires proof of multiple schemes, the Court noted that \"proof that a RICO defendant has been involved in multiple criminal schemes would certainly be highly relevant to the inquiry into the continuity of the defendant's racketeering activity.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 240. </a></span>Likewise, where the racketeering activity exceeds in duration the \"few weeks or months\" that the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. deemed inadequate, but is neither so extensive in reach nor so far beyond the minimum time period that common sense compels a conclusion of continuity, the fact that a defendant has been involved in only one scheme with a singular objective and a closed group of targeted victims also strikes us as \"highly relevant.\" Cf.

In essence, appellant alleges a scheme to diminish the value of the project in the short run, pressing plaintiff and two others to yield up their interests so that the schemers could own and control the whole project. Although multiple related acts of deception were claimed to underlay the faxes and mailings, all allegedly were aimed at the single goal of transforming the ownership of the Partnership during its early stages. See Amended Complaint, &#182; 19 (defendants' goal was \"to dilute the interests of the Special Partners and to siphon away Partnership assets\" to gain \"outright control of the Partnership\"). The three named victims were not separately targeted through repetitions of criminal conduct, which could have reflected persistent or broad-based crime; their injury instead resulted from a single set of alleged misdeeds and occurred at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This narrow attack on three partners' participation in a particular business venture is qualitatively different from the single scheme underlying H.J.

Almost by definition, the alleged fraud had a limited life expectancy.

This is far different, however, from the open-ended continuity illustrated by the single scheme described in H.J. Inc., an endeavor that apparently would have gone on without end had it not been detected. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>. Had Efron argued that the defendants planned to operate the hotel indefinitely at a paper loss as a means of perpetually defrauding him, rather than asserting the specific objective of squeezing him out of the Partnership, he would have a stronger argument for an open-ended RICO pattern. His pleadings and argument, however, depict an undertaking with a soon-to-be reached endpoint. Indeed, Efron's refusal to contribute any more funds and his decision to file suit to protect his interest suggest that the objective was virtually accomplished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that courts, including our own, have suggested that RICO claims premised on mail or wire fraud must be particularly scrutinized because of the relative ease with which a plaintiff may mold a RICO pattern from allegations that, upon closer scrutiny, do not support it.

Where such a fraudulent scheme inflicts or threatens only a single injury, we continue to doubt that Congress intended to make the availability of treble damages and augmented criminal sanctions [under RICO] dependent solely on whether the fraudulent scheme is well enough conceived to enjoy prompt success or requires pursuit for an extended period of time. Given its \"natural and common sense approach to RICO's pattern element,\" we think it unlikely that Congress intended RICO to apply in the absence of a more significant societal threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States Textiles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546947\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/546947/united-states-textiles-inc-v-anheuser-busch-companies-inc-and-busch/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1268</span> </a></span>(quoting Marshall-Silver Constr.

Paragraph 41, section a, described the first alleged predicate act as a letter sent by Rubi to the special partners concerning cost overruns.
