This is an appeal from the dismissal\n\nof a wrongful death civil rights action. Because the dismissal was\n\nbased on the plaintiffs' failure to comply with certain orders and\n\nprosecute the action diligently, review is for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1075 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n          The underlying action arose out of the death of Angel Luis\n\nSoler-Rosa who, to paraphrase the complaint, was shot to death by\n\nPolice Officer Alves-Cruz, after Soler-Rosa, with a toy gun in hand,\n\ndemanded money from the cashier at a Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\n          On March 4, 1999, the court dismissed this § 1983 action\n\nagainst defendant Alves-Cruz because of the plaintiffs' failure to\n\nserve the complaint and summons on Alves-Cruz in his individual\n\ncapacity within the 120-day limit and because of the plaintiffs'\n\nfailure to comply with the time limits in a court order that required\n\nthem to submit an amended complaint that specified in which capacity\n\nAlves-Cruz was sued. At the same time, the court also dismissed the\n\naction against the pseudonymous defendants for lack of prosecution.\n\n          There is a great deal of procedural history not relevant to\n\nthe decision of this appeal.    We turn to the issue of whether the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint\n\nagainst Alves-Cruz for failure to comply in a timely fashion with its\n\norder as to the filing of an amended complaint. On August 31, 1998,\n\nthe court ordered the plaintiffs to file the amended complaint within\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffifteen days. The complaint was filed on November 6, 1998. It was\n\nnot, however, given to the defendants until January 29, 1999.\n\n          Plaintiffs say that the filing of the amended complaint was\n\ntimely. As to the fifteen-day limit, they say that the response was\n\ndue September 21, 1998, but the court was closed that day due to\n\nHurricane Georges. Since the District of Puerto Rico, by Amended Order\n\nof October 16, 1998, extended until October 30, 1998, the filing times\n\nfor certain documents originally due to be filed between September 18,\n\n1998, and October 2, 1998, and since, according to the plaintiffs'\n\ncalculations, they had two days left on September 18th to file their\n\namended complaint, they argue that two days should be added to the\n\nOctober 30th date. They say that gave them until November 3, 1998, to\n\nfile the amended complaint and that they in fact did so. (It is not\n\nnecessary to determine whether the amended complaint was \"filed\" on\n\nNovember 3rd, as the plaintiffs contend, or November 6th, as the\n\ndefendants allege and the docket sheet indicates.)        Despite the\n\nplaintiffs' creative counting, the filing was due no later than October\n\n30, 1998. Thus, the filing was not timely and the court was warranted\n\nin dismissing the complaint against Alves-Cruz.\n\n          As to the remaining defendants (Samuel Soe, Thomas Toe, and\n\nVictor Voe), the dismissal order notes that they were never identified\n\nor summoned, because of the \"plaintiffs' lethargic and careless manner\n\nof litigation\" over more than a three-year period. Plaintiffs rejoin\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthat they are not responsible for the delay resulting from an earlier\n\nerroneous dismissal of this action on statute of limitations grounds,\n\nsee Carreras-Rosa v. Alves-Cruz, 127 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 1997), and\n\nthey appear to be correct. As to the considerable period of remaining\n\ntime in which there was inaction, they claim, without pointing to any\n\nsupport, that their efforts to obtain discovery were thwarted.\n\n          While both sides share some blame for the messy and\n\nfrustrating course of this litigation, the plaintiffs have failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing\n\nthe complaint against the unidentified defendants, particularly in\n\nlight of plaintiffs' failure to comply with court orders as to Alves-\n\nCruz, the main defendant.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
