The district court sentenced each defendant to life in\r\nprison on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.  All five\r\ndefendants now appeal.\r\nBecause we hold that appellants Rosario-Daz and\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz did not have the requisite foreknowledge that a\r\ncarjacking crime was to be committed, their convictions must be set\r\naside.  We affirm the convictions of appellants Melndez-Garca,\r\nBez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales, although we remand for resentencing\r\non their conspiracy convictions.\r\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\r\nA.  The Conspiracy and the Carjacking\r\nOn June 9, 1995, defendants Ralph Rosario-Daz and Wilson\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz placed a telephone call to Gregorio Aponte-Laz, who\r\nwould later be a codefendant in this case and ultimately the\r\ngovernment's star cooperating witness.  Rosario-Daz informed\r\nAponte-Laz that Aponte-Laz's brother-in-law, Fonsi, a runner in\r\nRosario-Daz's drug ring, had been killed the preceding day. \r\nRosario-Daz told Aponte-Laz that among Fonsi's belongings had\r\nbeen found a list of persons who they believed to have Fonsi's drug\r\nmoney.  The list included the name of Edna Rivera-Hernndez.\r\nRosario-Daz told Aponte-Laz that he had a job for him--\r\nto find Edna and retrieve the $200,000 she was thought to have.  In\r\nexchange, Aponte-Laz would receive $25,000.  If Edna should refuse\r\nto return the money, Aponte-Laz was to kill her and make it look\r\nlike a robbery.  To facilitate the crime, Rosario-Daz provided\r\nAponte-Laz with several pieces of information, including Edna's\r\naddress, the color and make of her car, as well as some of the\r\nnumbers of the car's license plate.  He also told Aponte-Laz that\r\nEdna studied at the American City College (ACC), where Rosario-Daz\r\nand Montalvo-Ortiz worked.\r\nOn Tuesday, June 13, 1995, Rosario-Daz pointed Edna out\r\nto Aponte-Laz at the ACC.  At that point, Rosario-Daz, Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz, and Aponte-Laz discussed the planned participation of\r\ndefendant Juan Bez-Jurado.  Rosario-Daz explained that Aponte-\r\nLaz was to meet Bez-Jurado the following Friday, June 16, 1995. \r\nMontalvo-Ortiz instructed Aponte-Laz not to rape Edna, but stated\r\nthat he should kill her if necessary.\r\nOn Friday, June 16, 1995, as planned, Aponte-Laz met\r\nBez-Jurado in a local plaza.  With Aponte-Laz was defendant Ada\r\nMelndez-Garca, who also knew Bez-Jurado.  The three agreed that\r\nthey would carry out their contract on Tuesday, June 20, 1995. \r\nBez-Jurado agreed to bring a firearm.\r\nOn the appointed day, Aponte-Laz met in the plaza with\r\nMelndez-Garca, who had her son with her due to a field day at the\r\nelementary school.  Aponte-Laz then went to the ACC, where\r\nRosario-Daz informed him that Edna would be at a doctor's\r\nappointment that day, rather than at the college.  Aponte-Laz\r\nexpressed his feeling that the crime would therefore be easier,\r\nbecause they would not have to go to Edna's house.  Montalvo-Ortiz,\r\nhowever, warned Aponte-Laz to be careful because a law enforcement\r\ndrug division was located near the doctor's office.\r\nAponte-Laz and Melndez-Garca returned to the town\r\nplaza, where Bez-Jurado was waiting with defendant Wilfredo Lpez-\r\nMorales, whom Melndez-Garca said she knew.  Bez-Jurado informed\r\nthem that he had not brought a weapon as they had planned.  The\r\nfive of them, Aponte-Laz, Melndez-Garca, her son Victor, Bez-\r\nJurado, and Lpez-Morales, then walked the streets near the plaza. \r\nThey saw Edna, who got out of her car and entered a pediatrician's\r\noffice with her four-month-old baby.  Aponte-Laz and the others\r\nwent to a nearby supermarket and purchased a knife.\r\nEventually, Edna exited the doctor's office and moved\r\ntowards her car, pushing her baby in a stroller.  Aponte-Laz,\r\nMelndez-Garca, and Vctor approached the car at the same time as\r\nEdna, complimenting and inquiring about her baby.  When Edna had\r\nplaced her car key in the car door, Aponte-Laz put the knife to\r\nher ribs.  Bez-Jurado and Lpez-Morales appeared, and Edna was\r\nforced into the back seat with them and Vctor.\r\nAponte-Laz drove the car away from the plaza.  From\r\nEdna's purse, appellants removed twenty-six dollars in cash and a\r\nbank card, the access code for which Edna divulged before she was\r\nkilled.  Aponte-Laz asked Edna for the $200,000, but she responded\r\nthat she did not have it and that she had returned it to Fonsi\r\nbefore he was killed.  At Aponte-Laz's instruction, Melndez-\r\nGarca then slapped Edna.\r\nAfter leaving the plaza area, Aponte-Laz stopped to\r\npurchase crack, marijuana, and heroin.  Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado,\r\nand Lpez-Morales consumed the drugs in the car as they drove. \r\nMeanwhile, they continued to slap Edna and threatened to kill her\r\nbaby.\r\nNear the Guayanez River, the car became stuck in a sugar\r\ncane bank, and Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado, Lpez-Morales, and Edna\r\nexited the car.  While Melndez-Garca sat in the car with Edna's\r\nbaby, the rest of the group went to a secluded area surrounded by\r\nbamboo trees, and Edna was ordered to sit on a towel.  While Edna\r\nprotested that she had returned all the money, she was asked\r\nintimate questions by Aponte-Laz while Bez-Jurado wielded the\r\nknife.  Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales then each raped\r\nEdna and even placed young Vctor on top of her naked body in a\r\ngrotesque simulation of their acts.\r\nAfter the rapes, Edna was ordered to put her clothes back\r\non.  While threatening to kill her baby, Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado,\r\nand Lpez-Morales beat Edna with their fists and with a bamboo\r\nstick.  Aponte-Laz then ordered Lpez-Morales to drag Edna to the\r\nriver, presumably to drown her.  When Edna resisted, Aponte-Laz\r\ntold Bez-Jurado to help.  Bez-Jurado entered the river and slit\r\nEdna's throat.  They left her body in the river, where it was found\r\ndecapitated on July 7, 1995.\r\nAfter killing Edna, Aponte-Laz and appellants managed to\r\nextract the car from the sugar cane bank and fled the area. \r\nAponte-Laz telephoned Rosario-Daz and informed him that Edna was\r\ndead but that they still had her car and her baby.  Rosario-Daz\r\ninstructed them to leave the car and baby at a safe place.\r\nAponte-Laz and Melndez-Garca attempted unsuccessfully\r\nto use Edna's bank card at a retail store.  Aponte-Laz and\r\nappellants then drove to the city of Gurabo, where Aponte-Laz was\r\nable to withdraw seventy dollars from Edna's account.\r\nAponte-Laz and the appellants next drove to Caguas\r\nCentral, where Edna's baby began to cry.  When Melndez-Garca\r\ntried to feed the baby some juice, it choked.  Aponte-Laz and\r\nappellants drove to the Caguas Municipal Hospital, where the baby\r\nwas examined and released.  When Aponte-Laz and Melndez-Garca\r\nexited the hospital, however, Bez-Jurado had left the group.  The\r\nremaining four proceeded to Melndez-Garca's house, where\r\nMelndez-Garca bathed and fed the baby.\r\nLater that evening, Aponte-Laz and Lpez-Morales drove\r\nthe baby to Luquillo.  On the way, they had a minor accident, but\r\nthey finally arrived in Luquillo, where the baby was abandoned in\r\nfront of a residence.\r\nThat same evening, Edna's husband and his brother began\r\nto search for Edna.  On the highway, they spotted her car, driven\r\nby Aponte-Laz, and gave chase.  Edna's husband was able to turn\r\noff the ignition of Edna's car using a spare remote control for the\r\ncar's alarm system.  When Edna's car stopped, Aponte-Laz ran away\r\nbut was apprehended by the husband and his brother.  Edna's ring\r\nand bracelet were found on Aponte-Laz's person.  When the police\r\narrived, the knife and a photo of Aponte-Laz were found in Edna's\r\ncar.\r\nB.  The Investigation and Trial\r\nOn June 15, 1995, after being apprehended by Edna's\r\nhusband, Aponte-Laz gave the first of several inconsistent\r\nstatements to law enforcement.  Among those statements was the\r\nassertion that Lpez-Morales had had nothing to do with the crime,\r\nwhich the government claimed at trial was made in an attempt to\r\ngain the release of Lpez-Morales so that Lpez-Morales could\r\nmurder the government's witnesses.  Subsequent to his guilty plea\r\nin July of 1995, Aponte-Laz began to divulge the details of the\r\ncrime to investigators.\r\nOn June 25, 1995, FBI agents conducted a consent search\r\nof Melndez-Garca's residence and found various items tied to the\r\nabduction of Edna.  After waiving her rights, Melndez-Garca made\r\na statement admitting some knowledge of the crime but in general\r\ndenying direct involvement.  The following day Melndez-Garca gave\r\na second statement detailing the crime and admitting her\r\ninvolvement.  She attempted to lead the police to the body but\r\ncould not find the scene.\r\nOn June 28, 1995, the FBI interviewed Bez-Jurado, who\r\nclaimed that Melndez-Garca had told him what had happened to Edna\r\nand where her body had been left.  Bez-Jurado also attempted to\r\nlead the police to the crime scene but could not locate it.\r\nOn June 28, 1995, Lpez-Morales was also interviewed.  He\r\ndenied knowing Melndez-Garca or anything about Edna or her\r\ndisappearance.\r\nOn May 6, 1996, a grand jury returned a two-count\r\nindictment charging Aponte-Laz, Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado,\r\nLpez-Morales, Rosario-Daz, and Montalvo-Ortiz with (1) aiding and\r\nabetting each other in the commission of a carjacking in violation\r\nof 18 U.S.C.  2 &amp; 2119(3), and (2) conspiracy to commit that\r\ncarjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  All defendants\r\ninitially pled not guilty, although Aponte-Laz subsequently\r\nchanged his plea and agreed to cooperate with the United States.\r\nBefore trial, appellants Melndez-Garca, Montalvo-Ortiz,\r\nBez-Jurado, and Rosario-Daz filed motions to suppress evidence. \r\nHearings were held on two of the motions, and all of the motions\r\nwere denied.\r\nAt trial, the prosecution's star witness was Aponte-Laz,\r\nwho testified extensively about the details of the crime and the\r\nparticipation of each defendant.  Immediately after the testimony\r\nof Aponte-Laz, the United States put FBI agent Daryl Huff on the\r\nwitness stand.  Over the objection of defense counsel, Agent Huff\r\ntestified at length about his interactions with Aponte-Laz during\r\nthe investigation of the carjacking and murder of Edna.  Agent Huff\r\ntestified as to the interrogation techniques used with Aponte-Laz,\r\nas to the statements made by Aponte-Laz, and even as to how law\r\nenforcement evaluated the veracity and reliability of Aponte-Laz's\r\nstatements.  For example, Agent Huff identified omissions and\r\nfalsities in Aponte-Laz's statements:\r\n         A:     Specifically with regards to why he\r\n       traveled to Caguas, one of the lies. \r\n       And also specifically about the rape. \r\n       He had not mentioned that.  And he also\r\n       omitted the fact that Wilson Montalvo\r\n       Ortiz and Ralph Rosario Daz were\r\n       involved in the carjacking or\r\n       conspiracy of the carjacking fully. \r\n       So, those were three of the lies.\r\n         Q:     Okay.  Now, how were those omissions\r\n       discovered?\r\n         A:     Again through interview and through\r\n       seeing the discrepancies,\r\n       inconsistencies and just things that\r\n       didn't make sense in the statement.  It\r\n       became pretty obvious in most cases.\r\n\n                        . . . .\r\n\n         Q:     And did you use or need a\r\n       polygraph in order to do\r\n       that?\r\n         A:     No, a polygraph is a last resort\r\n       technique.  There was no need for a\r\n       polygraph in the particular situation. \r\n       We were pinning him down without a\r\n       polygraph.  We could tell when he was\r\n       lying.\r\n\nTr. of Nov. 25, 1995, at 22.  Other trial testimony included expert\r\ntestimony on the mental capacity of Melndez-Garca.\r\nOn December 12, 1997, after twenty-three days of trial,\r\na jury found each defendant guilty on both counts of the\r\nindictment.  Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz filed a motion for a\r\nnew trial, which all appellants joined; a hearing was held, and the\r\ndistrict court denied the motion.\r\nOn August 27, 1998, appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz were given life sentences on each count, to be served\r\nconcurrently.  Bez-Jurado was given the same sentence the\r\nfollowing day, and Lpez-Morales and Melndez-Garca received the\r\nsame sentences on October 30, 1998 and November 13, 1998,\r\nrespectively.  All appellants filed timely notices of appeal.\r\n                   II.  LAW AND APPLICATION\r\nAppellants now challenge their convictions and sentences\r\non a number of grounds.  We begin with the joint arguments of\r\nappellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz.\r\nA.  Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz\r\nAlthough appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz raise\r\nseveral issues on appeal, we find it necessary to reach only one--\r\nwhether the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to\r\nsupport guilty verdicts on Counts One and Two.  We review a\r\ndistrict court's Rule 29 determinations de novo.  See United States\r\nv. Hernndez, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).  Because we find\r\nthat there was not sufficient evidence that Rosario-Daz and\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz had the knowledge required to support a conviction\r\nfor aiding and abetting a carjacking, we reverse their convictions\r\non Count One.  Similarly, we reverse their convictions on Count Two\r\nbecause the government failed to introduce evidence sufficient to\r\nestablish that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz conspired to\r\ncarjack.\r\n1.  Count One\r\nRosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz claim that the evidence\r\nsubmitted at trial failed to prove that they had \"foreknowledge\"\r\nthat Aponte-Laz would carjack Edna's vehicle.  They argue that\r\ntheir aiding and abetting convictions must therefore be reversed. \r\nAfter carefully reviewing the record and the relevant law, we\r\nagree.\r\nTo support a conviction for aiding and abetting, the\r\ngovernment must prove, in addition to the commission of the offense\r\nby the principal, that the defendant \"'consciously shared the\r\nprincipal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended\r\nto help the principal.'\"   United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231,\r\n235 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967,\r\n975 (1st Cir. 1995)).  We have stated that the defendant's\r\nknowledge must be more than merely a \"'general suspicion that an\r\nunlawful act may occur.'\"  United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 591\r\n(1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Labat, 905 F.2d 18, 23\r\n(2d Cir. 1990)).  However, we have also recognized the difficulty\r\nof precisely articulating the degree of knowledge required to\r\nsupport a conviction for aiding and abetting particular offenses. \r\nSee, e.g., Spinney, 65 F.3d at 236-40 (discussing the \"continuum\"\r\nof mens rea requirements for aiding and abetting).\r\nIn Spinney, for example, we held that a conviction for\r\naiding and abetting an armed bank robbery must be supported by\r\nevidence that the defendant was \"on notice of the likelihood\" that\r\nthe principal would use a dangerous weapon in the commission of the\r\nbank robbery.  See id. at 240.  By contrast, we held that a\r\nconviction under 18 U.S.C.  2 &amp; 924(c) for aiding and abetting\r\nthe use of a firearm in a crime of violence required proof that the\r\ndefendant knew \"to a practical certainty\" that the principal would\r\nbe using a gun.  See id. at 238-39.  Although we were not explicit,\r\na fair reading of Spinney supports the proposition that the level\r\nof knowledge required to support an aiding and abetting conviction\r\nis related to the specificity of the principal offense, as to both\r\nmens rea and actus reus.\r\nNot surprisingly, appellants urge us to adopt the higher\r\n\"practical certainty\" standard referred to in Spinney.  However, we\r\nneed not decide that issue today.  Even under a less exacting\r\n\"notice of likelihood\" standard, we conclude that no reasonable\r\njury could have found appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt of aiding and abetting the\r\ncarjacking of Edna Rivera-Hernndez.\r\nThe United States argues that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz should have known that Aponte-Laz and his cohorts might\r\nchoose a carjacking as a way to execute their contract on Edna,\r\nbecause Rosario-Daz (in the presence of Montalvo-Ortiz) gave\r\nAponte-Laz the make and model of Edna's car, as well as some of\r\nthe numbers from her license plate.  The government also argues\r\nthat, at the very least, Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz had\r\nknowledge that a carjacking was likely when they directed Aponte-\r\nLaz to the doctor's office and Aponte-Laz opined that such\r\ncircumstance would facilitate the crime because it would avoid the\r\nneed to go to Edna's house.\r\nBefore directly addressing the sufficiency of the factual\r\nevidence in this case, we would note that carjacking is a\r\nspecialized offense, requiring a specific criminal act and a narrow\r\nmens rea.  Rather than criminalizing any offense that involves a\r\nvehicle, Congress chose in 18 U.S.C.  2119 to create federal crime\r\nonly where the vehicle is \"taken\" by force and violence or by\r\nintimidation.  As the Supreme Court held last term in  Holloway v.\r\nUnited States, 119 S. Ct. 966, 970 (1999), the mental state\r\nrequired by the statute (\"intent to cause death or serious bodily\r\nharm\") is measured at the moment that the defendant demands or\r\ntakes control of the vehicle.  The focus of the statute is narrow.\r\nWhen viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nprosecution (as indeed we must view all evidence for these\r\npurposes), the evidence pointed to by the United States might\r\nfairly be deemed to raise a possibility that Aponte-Laz would\r\ncommit a carjacking.  However, viewed in any light, we simply do\r\nnot find that evidence to raise such a possibility to the level of\r\na probability or a likelihood.  Based on the instructions and\r\ninformation that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz provided to\r\nAponte-Laz, any of several scenarios were within the realm of\r\npossible means of confronting Edna and attempting to retrieve the\r\n$200,000--burglary, confronting her near her home, confronting her\r\non the street, confronting her at her car without attempting to\r\n\"take\" the vehicle, confronting her in connection with a\r\ncarjacking, et cetera.  It is noteworthy that, in addition to\r\ninformation about Edna's car, Rosario-Daz gave Aponte-Laz her\r\nhome address as well as the location of her school.  In other\r\nwords, Aponte-Laz was given information by which he might locate\r\nEdna at any time during the morning, day, or night, at any of the\r\nplaces that she could be foreseen to be--at home, at school, or\r\nelsewhere with her car.  Significantly, the jury was not presented\r\nwith a single discussion or instruction in which Rosario-Daz or\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz mentioned or even alluded to a carjacking.   In sum,\r\nwe find no evidence whatsoever in the record that could reasonably\r\nbe considered by the jury to make carjacking more likely than any\r\nof the other possible ways in which Aponte-Laz could have carried\r\nout Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz's instructions.  Where the\r\noffense actually committed by the principal is merely one of many\r\n(in this case, practically innumerable) possibilities, we see no\r\ndifference between such \"knowledge\" and a \"general suspicion\" that\r\na criminal act is underway or contemplated.\r\nBecause there was insufficient evidence in the record for\r\nthe jury to reasonably find that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz\r\nhad the requisite foreknowledge that a carjacking would be\r\ncommitted, we must reverse their conviction on Count One of the\r\nindictment.\r\n2.  Count Two\r\nAppellants argue that their lack of foreknowledge should\r\nalso defeat their convictions on Count Two.  We agree.\r\nAs we have held many times, \"[t]o prove the elements of\r\na conspiracy, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat the 'defendant and one or more coconspirators intended to\r\nagree and . . . to commit the substantive criminal offense which\r\nwas the object of their unlawful agreement.'\"  United States v.\r\nEscobar-de-Jess, 187 F.3d 148, 175 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting prior\r\ncases from this Circuit); see also Salinas v. United States, 118 S.\r\nCt. 469, 477 (1997) (\"A conspirator must intend to further an\r\nendeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of\r\na substantive criminal offense . . . .\").  Viewing the evidence\r\npresented at trial in the light most favorable to the government,\r\nthat evidence is insufficient to prove that Rosario-Daz and\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz agreed to commit or intended to further a\r\ncarjacking.  No reasonable jury could have convicted them of such\r\na conspiracy, and we reverse their convictions on Count Two of the\r\nindictment.\r\nWe take no pleasure in reversing the convictions of two\r\nappellants who were proven at trial to be the instigators of a\r\nnefarious criminal scheme that led to the brutal rape and murder of\r\na young woman.  The evidence produced at trial left no reasonable\r\ndoubt that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz conspired with Aponte-\r\nLaz to rob and, if necessary, to murder Edna.  Appellants were\r\nnever charged with such a conspiracy, however, and we are powerless\r\nto undo that prosecutorial judgment.  It is not unusual in this day\r\nand age for the federal government to prosecute narrow parts of\r\ncriminal enterprises that would more logically (when viewed as a\r\nwhole) be adjudicated in local courts.  Indeed, the greater\r\nresources available to the federal government, at the investigatory\r\nand prosecutorial stages, often counsel in favor of such an\r\napproach.  Nevertheless, and irrespective of the hideous nature of\r\nthe crimes committed, a court of law is required to make its\r\nrulings on principled grounds.  There are no such grounds for a\r\nruling in the United States's favor on this issue, given the facts\r\nproven by the prosecution, and therefore cannot sustain appellants\r\nRosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz's convictions on Counts One and\r\nTwo.\r\nB.  Melndez-Garca and Bez-Jurado\r\nThe joint brief filed by appellants Melndez-Garca and\r\nBez-Jurado raises several issues on appeal, several of which are\r\napplicable to and joined by more than one appellant in this case. \r\nWe will address the broadly applicable issues first, and then\r\nproceed to the appellant-specific issues.\r\n1.  Improper Bolstering by Agent Huff\r\nAppellants argue that the testimony of FBI Agent Daryl\r\nHuff constituted improper bolstering of the testimony of\r\ncooperating witness Aponte-Laz.  We review the district court's\r\nadmission of the challenged testimony under a harmless error\r\nstandard.  See United States v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1198 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  Although we are troubled by Huff's testimony, we hold\r\nthat its admission was harmless error.\r\nThe case law is clear, and the parties agree, that\r\nprosecutors may not place the prestige of the United States behind\r\na witness by making personal assurances about the credibility of a\r\nwitness or by indicating that facts not before the jury support the\r\nwitness's testimony.  See, e.g., United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d\r\n1190, 1207-08 (1st Cir. 1994).  It is also undisputed that the\r\nprosecution cannot accomplish such improper bolstering of a witness\r\nthrough the testimony of other government witnesses.  See United\r\nStates v. Mazza, 792 F.2d 1210, 1214-16 (1st Cir. 1986). \r\nGovernment witnesses may of course testify to facts within their\r\npersonal knowledge that support or corroborate another witness's\r\ntestimony.  Indeed, in a case such as this one, where the bulk of\r\ncritical testimony comes from a single cooperating coconspirator,\r\nthe prosecution's principal task is often to convince the jury that\r\nthe witness's account is credible.  The prosecution simply must do\r\nso through competent and reliable evidence and not through improper\r\nvouching that could invite the jury to find guilt on the basis of\r\nsomething other than the evidence presented at trial.\r\nWe have no difficulty concluding that the testimony of\r\nAgent Huff was improper.  Although Huff could properly have\r\ntestified as to the actions he took to corroborate Aponte-Laz's\r\ntestimony, we think it obvious that he could not properly opine on\r\nwhether particular statements by Aponte-Laz were \"lies,\" nor could\r\nhe represent that the statements not singled out as lies had been\r\n\"tested\" and verified through interrogation techniques. \r\nParticularly in light of Huff's testimony concerning his training\r\nand experience in interrogation and investigation, the clear\r\npurpose and effect of his testimony was to put the prestige of his\r\nprofessional knowledge as a federal agent behind the testimony of\r\nAponte-Laz.  That is the very definition of improper bolstering,\r\nand it is impermissible.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that this case is\r\nindistinguishable from United States v. Piva, 870 F.2d 753 (1st\r\nCir. 1989), in which we held that it was not reversible error to\r\nadmit the testimony of a law enforcement officer detailing out-of-\r\ncourt statements by the defendant.  The Piva panel distinguished\r\nour decision in Mazza using words that are equally applicable to\r\nthe case presently under consideration:\r\n  [T]he testimony of [the officer] was admitted\r\nafter [defendant's] testimony, whereas in\r\nMazza the agents' testimony came at the\r\nopening of trial.  Thus we are not faced here\r\nwith the Mazza danger that the agent would\r\ntestify as to items that would never come into\r\nevidence, nor would [defendant's] testimony be\r\nbolstered by the law enforcement officer\r\nbefore the jury could evaluate it\r\nindependently.  Furthermore, the government\r\nwas justified in seeking admission of this\r\ntestimony because of the defense's attacks on\r\nthe informant's credibility.\r\n\nId. at 760.  In this case, Aponte-Laz testified extensively before\r\nAgent Huff took the stand, and Aponte-Laz was subject to vigorous\r\ncross-examination.  Furthermore, the district court took pains to\r\ninstruct the jury that they were to judge Aponte-Laz's credibility\r\non the basis of his testimony alone, and not that of Agent Huff. \r\nOn these facts, and in light of the other probative evidence\r\nadmitted in this case, we hold that the improper bolstering\r\nsolicited by the prosecution from Agent Huff was harmless error not\r\nwarranting reversal.  We nevertheless take this occasion to issue\r\na strong warning against the use of this procedure by government\r\nprosecutors and advise that they will tread on thin ice indeed if\r\nthey continue to practice this technique in the future.\r\n2.  Denial of Motion for New Trial\r\nAppellants next argue that the district court erred in\r\ndenying a motion for a new trial submitted by appellants after\r\ntheir convictions.  We affirm the district court's ruling.\r\nThe day after the guilty verdict was returned in this\r\ncase, the victim's father gave an interview on local television. \r\nIn that interview, Edna's father stated that an FBI agent had told\r\nhim that the FBI had investigated and found no link between Edna\r\nand the defendants or the $200,000 of alleged drug money.  Because\r\nthis assertion ran directly contrary to the government's theory at\r\ntrial and apparently contradicted the testimony of Aponte-Laz that\r\nEdna had admitted having the money but claimed to have returned it,\r\nappellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz filed a motion for a new\r\ntrial alleging Brady violations and the discovery of new evidence. \r\nAll appellants joined the motion.\r\nAfter receiving briefs, conducting a hearing, and\r\nreviewing the statement of Edna's father, the trial court denied\r\nthe motion for a new trial on August 6, 1998.  See Opinion and\r\nOrder of August 6, 1998.  After examining the relevant law, the\r\ntrial court determined that the agent's statement to Edna's father\r\nwould be inadmissible (and in any event immaterial) lay opinion and\r\nthus was neither discoverable under Brady nor \"newly discovered\r\nevidence\" warranting a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal\r\nProcedure 33.  See id. at  18-21.\r\nWe review the denial of a motion for a new trial for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Montilla, 115 F.3d 1060,\r\n1064 (1st Cir. 1997).  We also note that a new trial is generally\r\nwarranted only in the rare circumstance where retrial is necessary\r\nto prevent a miscarriage of justice.  See United States v.\r\nGonzlez-Gonzlez, 136 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1998).  After carefully\r\nreviewing the record and the law, we hold that the district court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.\r\nFirst, the agent's statement to the victim's father\r\ncannot itself warrant a new trial.  Because it was made after\r\ntrial, the prosecution cannot be faulted for failing to produce it\r\nas Brady material.  Even if a new trial were granted, the agent's\r\nstatement might very well be excluded as inadmissible hearsay or,\r\nas the district court opined, inadmissible lay opinion testimony. \r\nMoreover, even if admitted, the testimony is to a lack of evidence,\r\nnot to some talismanic piece of evidence affirmatively proving or\r\ndisproving a connection.  Its probative value, therefore, would be\r\nquestionable.\r\nSecond, we do not agree with appellants' implicit\r\ncontention that the agent's statement necessarily indicates that\r\nthe prosecution possessed other exculpatory evidence at the time of\r\ntrial.  Again, the agent's alleged statement was that the FBI had\r\nfailed to establish a connection between Edna and the drug\r\noperation.  We decline to speculate that the government had\r\naffirmatively disproved any connection, and we certainly should not\r\nand will not require the prosecution to report back to the defense\r\nevery time an investigation fails to produce the results that the\r\ngovernment intended.  \r\nThird, we agree with the district court that appellants'\r\nmotion for a new trial failed to demonstrate a sufficient\r\nlikelihood that the \"evidence\" derived from the statement would\r\nchange the outcome of the trial.  At best, the information would\r\nallow the defense to (1) impeach Aponte-Laz's testimony that Edna\r\nhad admitted having and returning the drug money and (2) dispute\r\nthe alleged motive for carjacking Edna--to retrieve the $200,000. \r\nAs the United States points out, Edna's connection to the\r\ndefendants or to the money is not an element of any crime charged\r\nnor an alleged overt act of the conspiracy.  Furthermore, whether\r\nor not Edna was in fact involved with the drug operations is\r\nultimately irrelevant to appellants' guilt for carjacking and\r\nkilling her.\r\nUnder the circumstances, we conclude that the district\r\ncourt did not err in denying the motion for a new trial.\r\n3.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nAppellants argue that the evidence submitted at trial was\r\ninsufficient to sustain the jury's guilty verdicts against them,\r\nbecause the inculpatory evidence presented at trial consisted\r\nalmost exclusively of the testimony of cooperating witness Aponte-\r\nLaz.  Appellants argue that Aponte-Laz's testimony is\r\nunbelievable because Aponte-Laz admitted to lying to agents and\r\nothers at various times and because of Aponte-Laz's history of\r\ncriminal behavior.  Again, we review a district court's Rule 29\r\ndeterminations de novo.  See United States v. Hernndez, 146 F.3d\r\n30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nAppellants correctly note that we have held the\r\nuncorroborated testimony of a cooperating accomplice sufficient to\r\nsustain a conviction, unless that testimony is facially incredible. \r\nSee United States v. Andjar, 49 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nAponte-Laz's testimony in this case was not facially incredible. \r\nIt is true that, given the circumstances surrounding the crimes\r\ncommitted, Aponte-Laz's participation therein, and his obvious\r\nmotive to testify favorably for the government, Aponte-Laz's\r\ncredibility was subject to challenge.  This, however, was\r\nvigorously done by appellants at every opportunity during trial,\r\nbefore those charged with weighing credibility--the jury. \r\nAppellants offer us no basis for determining that the jury's\r\ncredibility determination is unsupportable other than the evidence\r\nthat the jury itself considered and rejected.  Because Aponte-\r\nLaz's testimony is not facially unbelievable, we hold that his\r\ntestimony alone provided the jury with enough evidence to support\r\nthe convictions of Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales. \r\nFurthermore, the evidence against Melndez-Garca and Bez-Jurado\r\nincluded their own inculpatory statements to law enforcement. \r\nConsequently, we decline to reverse the convictions of Melndez-\r\nGarca, Bez-Jurado, or Lpez-Morales on sufficiency-of-the-\r\nevidence grounds.\r\n4.  Improper Sentence Imposed for Conspiracy Conviction\r\nNext, appellants have joined the argument, best\r\narticulated in the brief of appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz, that the district court erred in imposing life sentences for\r\nappellants' convictions on Count Two, which charged them with\r\nconspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  The United States\r\nconcedes that 18 U.S.C.  371 provides for imprisonment of \"not\r\nmore than five years.\"  The district court clearly erred in\r\nimposing life sentences on Count Two, and we vacate the sentences\r\nof Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales on Count Two and\r\nremand for resentencing.\r\n5.  Unfair Prejudice from Evidence Against Other    \r\n     Defendants\r\n\nFinally, appellants jointly argue that the substantial\r\nevidence admitted against other defendants, particularly Rosario-\r\nDaz and Montalvo-Ortiz, unfairly prejudiced them by allowing the\r\njury to convict them on the basis of evidence relating to other\r\ndefendants' conduct.  In essence, appellants challenge the district\r\ncourt's denial of their requests for severance.  We conclude that\r\nthere was no reversible error.\r\nAt trial, the United States offered a great deal of\r\ntestimony detailing the drug trafficking activities of defendants\r\nRosario-Daz and, to a lesser extent, Montalvo-Ortiz.  The\r\ngovernment did not allege nor prove that the other defendants were\r\ninvolved in those illegal activities.  Appellants now argue that\r\nthe evidence against Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz improperly\r\naffected the jury's verdicts, and they request that we reverse\r\ntheir convictions.\r\nWe have recognized this kind of \"spillover\" claim before. \r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 18-19 (1st Cir.\r\n1984).  In Drougas we stated that, \"[i]n a case involving several\r\ndefendants, the court must take care that evidence against one\r\ndefendant is not misinterpreted by the jury and used as a basis for\r\nconvicting another defendant not connected to that evidence.\"  Id.\r\n(citing United States v. Flaherty, 668 F.2d 566, 582 (1st Cir.\r\n1981).  After stating that the district court's severance\r\ndeterminations should be overturned only upon a showing of strong\r\nprejudice, see id., we nevertheless concluded that the trial\r\ncourt's careful instructions to the jury and the ample evidence\r\nagainst the defendant eliminated any possibility of unfair\r\nprejudice.\r\nWe likewise conclude that the admission of the drug-\r\nrelated evidence in this case was not an abuse of discretion.  The\r\nevidence of Rosario-Daz's drug trafficking was clearly relevant in\r\nthat it connected Rosario-Daz to Edna, supported the government's\r\ntheory on motive, and corroborated the critical testimony of\r\nAponte-Laz.  The drug trafficking evidence can also be viewed as\r\nnecessary to complete the story of the conspiracy and carjacking\r\ncharged in this case, in that drugs are the common denominator\r\nlinking the various characters.\r\nMoreover, there was ample evidence admitted against each\r\nappellant to reduce the risk of an unfounded guilty verdict.  As\r\ndiscussed above, the government presented substantial evidence of\r\nguilt, primarily through the testimony of Aponte-Laz but also, at\r\nleast in the cases of Melndez-Garca and Bez-Jurado, through the\r\nappellants' own inculpatory statements to investigators.  Although\r\nthe record does not reflect the extensive corrective instructions\r\ngiven to the jury in Drougas, we nevertheless hold that the\r\nevidence of drug trafficking in this case did not create a\r\nsufficient risk of unfair prejudice to warrant reversal and\r\nseverance.\r\n6.  Melndez-Garca's Waiver of Rights and Consent to \r\n     Search\r\n\nTurning now to the appellant-specific arguments raised in\r\nappellants' joint brief, we consider first the issues raised by\r\nappellant Melndez-Garca.  Melndez-Garca first argues that her\r\nstatements to the FBI and the evidence recovered in the search of\r\nher residence should have been suppressed because her waivers were\r\nnot \"knowing and intelligent\" and because her statements and\r\nconsent to search were not voluntary.  After reviewing the record,\r\nwe conclude that there was no error in the admission of this\r\nevidence.\r\nWe review the district court's rulings on these issues\r\nfor clear error.  See United States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 13 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (Fourth Amendment challenge); United States v. Santos,\r\n131 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1997) (Fifth Amendment challenge).\r\nThe question before the district court was whether the\r\ngovernment demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence, see\r\nColorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 168 (1986), that Melndez-Garca's\r\nwaiver and consent were both \"voluntary in that [they] were the\r\nproduct of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,\r\ncoercion and deception\" and also made with \"full awareness of both\r\nthe nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the\r\ndecision to abandon,\" Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 420 (1986). \r\nThe court's determination must be made in light of \"the totality of\r\nthe circumstances and the facts surrounding the particular case\r\nincluding the background experience and conduct of the accused.\" \r\nUnited States v. Garca, 983 F.2d 1160, 1169 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nMelndez-Garca admits to signing a written waiver of her\r\nMiranda rights and a written consent to search her residence.\r\nHowever, she claims that the district court could not have properly\r\nfound her waiver of her Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights to be\r\nknowing and intelligent and voluntary, based on the evidence that\r\nshe has a very low I.Q. and that she was interviewed by law\r\nenforcement over a period of some six hours.\r\nThe trial court received a substantial amount of evidence\r\nregarding Melndez-Garca's mental capacity, including expert\r\ntestimony from both sides.  Although the court received evidence\r\nthat Melndez-Garca's I.Q. was in the middle 70s and that she had\r\nno prior involvement with the criminal justice system, the court\r\nalso heard testimony from an arresting officer and the government's\r\nexpert witness that Melndez-Garca understood what was happening\r\nwhen she waived her Fifth Amendment rights and consented to the\r\nsearch.\r\nThe district court also received evidence relating to the\r\nvoluntariness of Melndez-Garca's decisions.  Although Melndez-\r\nGarca herself testified that she felt very scared and physically\r\nill, there was no evidence whatsoever of physical coercion or\r\nintimidation, nor was there any indication of conduct by the law\r\nenforcement agents that would amount to psychological coercion or\r\nintimidation.\r\nViewing the totality of the circumstances particular to\r\nthis case, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred\r\nin its determination that Melndez-Garca's waiver and consent were\r\nknowing and intelligent and made voluntarily.  We therefore affirm\r\nthe district court's decision on this issue.\r\n7.  Denial of Downward Departure\r\nAppellant Melndez-Garca also argues that the district\r\ncourt should have awarded her a downward departure under  5K2.13\r\nof the Sentencing Guidelines.  On appeal, she suggests that the\r\ncourt should have taken into consideration both her diminished\r\nmental capacity and her role in caring for Edna's baby after the\r\ncrime.\r\nWe first note that a district court's decision not to\r\ndepart from the Sentencing Guidelines is ordinarily not appealable\r\nunless the record indicates some error of law such as a\r\nmisapprehension of the applicable guideline or a miscalculation of\r\nthe sentencing court's authority.  See United States v.\r\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560 (1st Cir. 1996).  Appellant points to\r\nno such legal error in the record, arguing instead that the\r\ndistrict court simply denied her a departure to which she was\r\nentitled.  We are therefore without jurisdiction to review the\r\ndistrict court's refusal to grant a departure.\r\n8.  Voluntariness of Bez-Jurado's Statements to \r\n  Investigators\r\n\nThe final issue raised by appellant Bez-Jurado is a\r\nchallenge to the admission into evidence of his inculpatory\r\nstatements to investigators the day following his detention. \r\nAlthough the trial court's determination of voluntariness is\r\nsubject to de novo review, its factual findings are reviewed for\r\nclear error.  See United States v. Santos, 131 F.3d 16, 18-19 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  Because we conclude that the statements were\r\nvoluntary, we affirm the admission of the statements at trial.\r\nBez-Jurado's principal contention is that he was\r\ndetained for twenty-eight hours before being brought before a\r\nmagistrate, and that the government's proffered reasons of\r\nadministrative delay and unavailability of a magistrate are not\r\ncredible.  However, Bez-Jurado does not point to any evidence of\r\nphysical or psychological coercion by law enforcement, nor does he\r\nspecify how the delay in his initial appearance rendered his\r\nconfession involuntary.  Furthermore, delay in appearing before a\r\nmagistrate is only one of several factors to be considered in\r\ndetermining voluntariness.  See 18 U.S.C.  3501(b) (listing\r\nseveral illustrative and nonconclusive factors).  None of the other\r\nfactors suggesting involuntariness have been shown.  Consequently,\r\nwe find no error in the district court's determination that the\r\nstatements were admissible.\r\nC.  Lpez-Morales\r\nIn addition to the arguments addressed above, appellant\r\nLpez-Morales challenges the district court's admission of two\r\ntypes of evidence.\r\n1.  Evidence of Plan to Kill Government Witnesses\r\nAt trial, the government presented evidence, through the\r\ntestimony of Aponte-Laz, that Aponte-Laz and Lpez-Morales agreed\r\nto a plan by which Aponte-Laz would exonerate Lpez-Morales to the\r\nauthorities so that Lpez-Morales would be released and then murder\r\nwitnesses expected to testify for the government.  Lpez-Morales\r\nnow argues that this evidence was irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial,\r\nand that its admission implicitly amended the indictment in\r\nviolation of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  We\r\ngenerally will reverse a district court's admissibility\r\ndeterminations under Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 403 only in\r\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances, see United States v.\r\nBrandon, 17 F.3d 409, 443 (1st Cir. 1994), although we consider\r\nLpez-Morales's constitutional challenge de novo.\r\nFirst, we find the evidence of the plot to be plainly\r\nrelevant to Lpez-Morales's guilt in the carjacking, insofar as it\r\nevinces a consciousness of guilt.  See United States v. Gonsalves,\r\n668 F.2d 73, 75 (1st Cir. 1982).  Likewise, we cannot find that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence\r\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  Although we agree with\r\nappellant that the evidence is prejudicial to his defense in a\r\ngeneric sense (as is all probative evidence of guilt), we are not\r\npersuaded that it was unfairly so.  The jury had every opportunity\r\nto weigh Aponte-Laz's testimony, and, once accepted, that\r\ntestimony was properly held against Lpez-Morales.\r\nLpez-Morales's Fifth Amendment argument is more\r\nsubstantial.  As we recognized in United States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d\r\n30, 35 (1st Cir. 1985), the admission of evidence of an offense not\r\ncharged in the indictment can, in some circumstances, constitute\r\ngrounds for reversal of a conviction.  See also Stirone v. United\r\nStates, 361 U.S. 212 (1960).  The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth\r\nAmendment guarantees that no person shall be tried and convicted of\r\na crime in federal court lest his fellow citizens have seen fit to\r\ncharge him with such crime.  If the court permits the jury to\r\nconvict a defendant on evidence of a crime not included in the\r\nindictment, that constitutional right is violated.  See id. at 273\r\n(quoting Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 10 (1887)).\r\nThis important rule, however, is not as broad as\r\nappellant would have us proclaim.  Although an indictment may not\r\nbe constructively amended by presenting evidence of uncharged\r\noffenses, there are many instances in which evidence of uncharged\r\nconduct is properly admitted in a criminal trial.  Rule 404(b) of\r\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence, for instance, states that evidence\r\nof uncharged crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted to prove\r\n\"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\" etc. \r\nSuch evidence, because ultimately offered to prove guilt of the\r\ncharged offense, effects no constructive amendment of the\r\nindictment and therefore does not infringe on a defendant's Fifth\r\nAmendment rights.  Likewise, in this case the United States offered\r\nevidence of the plan to kill government witnesses for a number of\r\nlegitimate reasons aimed ultimately at proving the charged\r\noffenses, including to prove consciousness of guilt and to explain\r\nthe inconsistency between Aponte-Laz's initial exoneration of\r\nLpez-Morales and his subsequent change in testimony.  We find no\r\nconstructive amendment of the indictment and no reversible error.\r\n2.  Evidence of Rape\r\nThe United States also presented the jury with evidence\r\nthat Lpez-Morales participated in the rape of Edna before she was\r\nmurdered.  Lpez-Morales argues that this evidence should have been\r\nexcluded as irrelevant or, at least, as unfairly prejudicial,\r\nbecause rape was not an element of the offense charged--carjacking\r\nthat resulted in death, under 18 U.S.C.  2119(3).  Again, we\r\nreverse a district court's Rule 402 and 403 determinations only\r\nrarely and only upon demonstration of extraordinary circumstances. \r\nSee Brandon, 17 F.3d at 443.\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting\r\nthe evidence of rape in this case.  There can be no reasonable\r\ndispute that the rape evidence was inseparably intertwined with the\r\ncarjacking and murder, and the evidence presented to the jury was\r\nnecessary to complete the story of the crime charged in the\r\nindictment, even though that indictment charged appellant with a\r\ncarjacking that resulted in death rather than the lesser crime of\r\na carjacking resulting in bodily injury.  Although the evidence was\r\ncertainly powerful, there was no error in the trial judge's\r\ndetermination that its probative value was not substantially\r\noutweighed by any possibility of unfair prejudice.  Cf. Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 403.\r\n                       III.  CONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, the convictions of appellants Rosario-Daz\r\nand Montalvo-Ortiz must be reversed for insufficiency of evidence. \r\nThe convictions of appellants Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado, and\r\nLpez-Morales are affirmed, although we must vacate their sentences\r\non Count Two of the indictment and remand to the district court for\r\nresentencing.\r\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part.\n",

Ralph Rosario-Daz, Wilson\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz, Ada Melndez-Garca, Juan Bez-Jurado, and \r\nWilfredo Lpez-Morales were each convicted on both counts of a\r\ngrand jury indictment charging them with (1) aiding and abetting\r\neach other in a carjacking that resulted in the death of the\r\nvictim, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2 &amp; 2119(3); and (2)\r\nconspiring to commit that carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n371.  The district court sentenced each defendant to life in\r\nprison on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.  All five\r\ndefendants now appeal.\r\nBecause we hold that appellants Rosario-Daz and\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz did not have the requisite foreknowledge that a\r\ncarjacking crime was to be committed, their convictions must be set\r\naside.  We affirm the convictions of appellants Melndez-Garca,\r\nBez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales, although we remand for resentencing\r\non their conspiracy convictions.\r\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\r\nA.  The Conspiracy and the Carjacking\r\nOn June 9, 1995, defendants Ralph Rosario-Daz and Wilson\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz placed a telephone call to Gregorio Aponte-Laz, who\r\nwould later be a codefendant in this case and ultimately the\r\ngovernment's star cooperating witness.  Rosario-Daz informed\r\nAponte-Laz that Aponte-Laz's brother-in-law, Fonsi, a runner in\r\nRosario-Daz's drug ring, had been killed the preceding day. \r\nRosario-Daz told Aponte-Laz that among Fonsi's belongings had\r\nbeen found a list of persons who they believed to have Fonsi's drug\r\nmoney.  The list included the name of Edna Rivera-Hernndez.\r\nRosario-Daz told Aponte-Laz that he had a job for him--\r\nto find Edna and retrieve the $200,000 she was thought to have.  In\r\nexchange, Aponte-Laz would receive $25,000.  If Edna should refuse\r\nto return the money, Aponte-Laz was to kill her and make it look\r\nlike a robbery.  To facilitate the crime, Rosario-Daz provided\r\nAponte-Laz with several pieces of information, including Edna's\r\naddress, the color and make of her car, as well as some of the\r\nnumbers of the car's license plate.  He also told Aponte-Laz that\r\nEdna studied at the American City College (ACC), where Rosario-Daz\r\nand Montalvo-Ortiz worked.\r\nOn Tuesday, June 13, 1995, Rosario-Daz pointed Edna out\r\nto Aponte-Laz at the ACC.  At that point, Rosario-Daz, Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz, and Aponte-Laz discussed the planned participation of\r\ndefendant Juan Bez-Jurado.  Rosario-Daz explained that Aponte-\r\nLaz was to meet Bez-Jurado the following Friday, June 16, 1995. \r\nMontalvo-Ortiz instructed Aponte-Laz not to rape Edna, but stated\r\nthat he should kill her if necessary.\r\nOn Friday, June 16, 1995, as planned, Aponte-Laz met\r\nBez-Jurado in a local plaza.  With Aponte-Laz was defendant Ada\r\nMelndez-Garca, who also knew Bez-Jurado.  The three agreed that\r\nthey would carry out their contract on Tuesday, June 20, 1995. \r\nBez-Jurado agreed to bring a firearm.\r\nOn the appointed day, Aponte-Laz met in the plaza with\r\nMelndez-Garca, who had her son with her due to a field day at the\r\nelementary school.  Aponte-Laz then went to the ACC, where\r\nRosario-Daz informed him that Edna would be at a doctor's\r\nappointment that day, rather than at the college.  Aponte-Laz\r\nexpressed his feeling that the crime would therefore be easier,\r\nbecause they would not have to go to Edna's house.  Montalvo-Ortiz,\r\nhowever, warned Aponte-Laz to be careful because a law enforcement\r\ndrug division was located near the doctor's office.\r\nAponte-Laz and Melndez-Garca returned to the town\r\nplaza, where Bez-Jurado was waiting with defendant Wilfredo Lpez-\r\nMorales, whom Melndez-Garca said she knew.  Bez-Jurado informed\r\nthem that he had not brought a weapon as they had planned.  The\r\nfive of them, Aponte-Laz, Melndez-Garca, her son Victor, Bez-\r\nJurado, and Lpez-Morales, then walked the streets near the plaza. \r\nThey saw Edna, who got out of her car and entered a pediatrician's\r\noffice with her four-month-old baby.  Aponte-Laz and the others\r\nwent to a nearby supermarket and purchased a knife.\r\nEventually, Edna exited the doctor's office and moved\r\ntowards her car, pushing her baby in a stroller.  Aponte-Laz,\r\nMelndez-Garca, and Vctor approached the car at the same time as\r\nEdna, complimenting and inquiring about her baby.  When Edna had\r\nplaced her car key in the car door, Aponte-Laz put the knife to\r\nher ribs.  Bez-Jurado and Lpez-Morales appeared, and Edna was\r\nforced into the back seat with them and Vctor.\r\nAponte-Laz drove the car away from the plaza.  From\r\nEdna's purse, appellants removed twenty-six dollars in cash and a\r\nbank card, the access code for which Edna divulged before she was\r\nkilled.  Aponte-Laz asked Edna for the $200,000, but she responded\r\nthat she did not have it and that she had returned it to Fonsi\r\nbefore he was killed.  At Aponte-Laz's instruction, Melndez-\r\nGarca then slapped Edna.\r\nAfter leaving the plaza area, Aponte-Laz stopped to\r\npurchase crack, marijuana, and heroin.  Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado,\r\nand Lpez-Morales consumed the drugs in the car as they drove. \r\nMeanwhile, they continued to slap Edna and threatened to kill her\r\nbaby.\r\nNear the Guayanez River, the car became stuck in a sugar\r\ncane bank, and Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado, Lpez-Morales, and Edna\r\nexited the car.  While Melndez-Garca sat in the car with Edna's\r\nbaby, the rest of the group went to a secluded area surrounded by\r\nbamboo trees, and Edna was ordered to sit on a towel.  While Edna\r\nprotested that she had returned all the money, she was asked\r\nintimate questions by Aponte-Laz while Bez-Jurado wielded the\r\nknife.  Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales then each raped\r\nEdna and even placed young Vctor on top of her naked body in a\r\ngrotesque simulation of their acts.\r\nAfter the rapes, Edna was ordered to put her clothes back\r\non.  While threatening to kill her baby, Aponte-Laz, Bez-Jurado,\r\nand Lpez-Morales beat Edna with their fists and with a bamboo\r\nstick.  Aponte-Laz then ordered Lpez-Morales to drag Edna to the\r\nriver, presumably to drown her.  When Edna resisted, Aponte-Laz\r\ntold Bez-Jurado to help.  Bez-Jurado entered the river and slit\r\nEdna's throat.  They left her body in the river, where it was found\r\ndecapitated on July 7, 1995.\r\nAfter killing Edna, Aponte-Laz and appellants managed to\r\nextract the car from the sugar cane bank and fled the area. \r\nAponte-Laz telephoned Rosario-Daz and informed him that Edna was\r\ndead but that they still had her car and her baby.  Rosario-Daz\r\ninstructed them to leave the car and baby at a safe place.\r\nAponte-Laz and Melndez-Garca attempted unsuccessfully\r\nto use Edna's bank card at a retail store.  Aponte-Laz and\r\nappellants then drove to the city of Gurabo, where Aponte-Laz was\r\nable to withdraw seventy dollars from Edna's account.\r\nAponte-Laz and the appellants next drove to Caguas\r\nCentral, where Edna's baby began to cry.  When Melndez-Garca\r\ntried to feed the baby some juice, it choked.  Aponte-Laz and\r\nappellants drove to the Caguas Municipal Hospital, where the baby\r\nwas examined and released.  When Aponte-Laz and Melndez-Garca\r\nexited the hospital, however, Bez-Jurado had left the group.  The\r\nremaining four proceeded to Melndez-Garca's house, where\r\nMelndez-Garca bathed and fed the baby.\r\nLater that evening, Aponte-Laz and Lpez-Morales drove\r\nthe baby to Luquillo.  On the way, they had a minor accident, but\r\nthey finally arrived in Luquillo, where the baby was abandoned in\r\nfront of a residence.\r\nThat same evening, Edna's husband and his brother began\r\nto search for Edna.  On the highway, they spotted her car, driven\r\nby Aponte-Laz, and gave chase.  Edna's husband was able to turn\r\noff the ignition of Edna's car using a spare remote control for the\r\ncar's alarm system.  When Edna's car stopped, Aponte-Laz ran away\r\nbut was apprehended by the husband and his brother.  Edna's ring\r\nand bracelet were found on Aponte-Laz's person.  When the police\r\narrived, the knife and a photo of Aponte-Laz were found in Edna's\r\ncar.\r\nB.  The Investigation and Trial\r\nOn June 15, 1995, after being apprehended by Edna's\r\nhusband, Aponte-Laz gave the first of several inconsistent\r\nstatements to law enforcement.  Among those statements was the\r\nassertion that Lpez-Morales had had nothing to do with the crime,\r\nwhich the government claimed at trial was made in an attempt to\r\ngain the release of Lpez-Morales so that Lpez-Morales could\r\nmurder the government's witnesses.  Subsequent to his guilty plea\r\nin July of 1995, Aponte-Laz began to divulge the details of the\r\ncrime to investigators.\r\nOn June 25, 1995, FBI agents conducted a consent search\r\nof Melndez-Garca's residence and found various items tied to the\r\nabduction of Edna.  After waiving her rights, Melndez-Garca made\r\na statement admitting some knowledge of the crime but in general\r\ndenying direct involvement.  The following day Melndez-Garca gave\r\na second statement detailing the crime and admitting her\r\ninvolvement.  She attempted to lead the police to the body but\r\ncould not find the scene.\r\nOn June 28, 1995, the FBI interviewed Bez-Jurado, who\r\nclaimed that Melndez-Garca had told him what had happened to Edna\r\nand where her body had been left.  Bez-Jurado also attempted to\r\nlead the police to the crime scene but could not locate it.\r\nOn June 28, 1995, Lpez-Morales was also interviewed.  He\r\ndenied knowing Melndez-Garca or anything about Edna or her\r\ndisappearance.\r\nOn May 6, 1996, a grand jury returned a two-count\r\nindictment charging Aponte-Laz, Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado,\r\nLpez-Morales, Rosario-Daz, and Montalvo-Ortiz with (1) aiding and\r\nabetting each other in the commission of a carjacking in violation\r\nof 18 U.S.C.  2 &amp; 2119(3), and (2) conspiracy to commit that\r\ncarjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  All defendants\r\ninitially pled not guilty, although Aponte-Laz subsequently\r\nchanged his plea and agreed to cooperate with the United States.\r\nBefore trial, appellants Melndez-Garca, Montalvo-Ortiz,\r\nBez-Jurado, and Rosario-Daz filed motions to suppress evidence. \r\nHearings were held on two of the motions, and all of the motions\r\nwere denied.\r\nAt trial, the prosecution's star witness was Aponte-Laz,\r\nwho testified extensively about the details of the crime and the\r\nparticipation of each defendant.  Immediately after the testimony\r\nof Aponte-Laz, the United States put FBI agent Daryl Huff on the\r\nwitness stand.  Over the objection of defense counsel, Agent Huff\r\ntestified at length about his interactions with Aponte-Laz during\r\nthe investigation of the carjacking and murder of Edna.  Agent Huff\r\ntestified as to the interrogation techniques used with Aponte-Laz,\r\nas to the statements made by Aponte-Laz, and even as to how law\r\nenforcement evaluated the veracity and reliability of Aponte-Laz's\r\nstatements.  For example, Agent Huff identified omissions and\r\nfalsities in Aponte-Laz's statements:\r\n         A:     Specifically with regards to why he\r\n       traveled to Caguas, one of the lies. \r\n       And also specifically about the rape. \r\n       He had not mentioned that.  And he also\r\n       omitted the fact that Wilson Montalvo\r\n       Ortiz and Ralph Rosario Daz were\r\n       involved in the carjacking or\r\n       conspiracy of the carjacking fully. \r\n       So, those were three of the lies.\r\n         Q:     Okay.  Now, how were those omissions\r\n       discovered?\r\n         A:     Again through interview and through\r\n       seeing the discrepancies,\r\n       inconsistencies and just things that\r\n       didn't make sense in the statement.  It\r\n       became pretty obvious in most cases.\r\n\n                        . . . .\r\n\n         Q:     And did you use or need a\r\n       polygraph in order to do\r\n       that?\r\n         A:     No, a polygraph is a last resort\r\n       technique.  There was no need for a\r\n       polygraph in the particular situation. \r\n       We were pinning him down without a\r\n       polygraph.  We could tell when he was\r\n       lying.\r\n\nTr. of Nov. 25, 1995, at 22.  Other trial testimony included expert\r\ntestimony on the mental capacity of Melndez-Garca.\r\nOn December 12, 1997, after twenty-three days of trial,\r\na jury found each defendant guilty on both counts of the\r\nindictment.  Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz filed a motion for a\r\nnew trial, which all appellants joined; a hearing was held, and the\r\ndistrict court denied the motion.\r\nOn August 27, 1998, appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz were given life sentences on each count, to be served\r\nconcurrently.  Bez-Jurado was given the same sentence the\r\nfollowing day, and Lpez-Morales and Melndez-Garca received the\r\nsame sentences on October 30, 1998 and November 13, 1998,\r\nrespectively.  All appellants filed timely notices of appeal.\r\n                   II.  LAW AND APPLICATION\r\nAppellants now challenge their convictions and sentences\r\non a number of grounds.  We begin with the joint arguments of\r\nappellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz.\r\nA.  Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz\r\nAlthough appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz raise\r\nseveral issues on appeal, we find it necessary to reach only one--\r\nwhether the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to\r\nsupport guilty verdicts on Counts One and Two.  We review a\r\ndistrict court's Rule 29 determinations de novo.  See United States\r\nv. Hernndez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198013\"><a href=\"/opinion/198013/united-states-v-hernandez-favale/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).  Because we find\r\nthat there was not sufficient evidence that Rosario-Daz and\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz had the knowledge required to support a conviction\r\nfor aiding and abetting a carjacking, we reverse their convictions\r\non Count One.  Similarly, we reverse their convictions on Count Two\r\nbecause the government failed to introduce evidence sufficient to\r\nestablish that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz conspired to\r\ncarjack.\r\n1.  Count One\r\nRosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz claim that the evidence\r\nsubmitted at trial failed to prove that they had \"foreknowledge\"\r\nthat Aponte-Laz would carjack Edna's vehicle.  They argue that\r\ntheir aiding and abetting convictions must therefore be reversed. \r\nAfter carefully reviewing the record and the relevant law, we\r\nagree.\r\nTo support a conviction for aiding and abetting, the\r\ngovernment must prove, in addition to the commission of the offense\r\nby the principal, that the defendant \"'consciously shared the\r\nprincipal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended\r\nto help the principal.'\"   United States v. Spinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n235 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v.

We have stated that the defendant's\r\nknowledge must be more than merely a \"'general suspicion that an\r\nunlawful act may occur.'\"  United States v. Loder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195365\"><a href=\"/opinion/195365/united-states-v-loder/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591\r\n(1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v.

However, we have also recognized the difficulty\r\nof precisely articulating the degree of knowledge required to\r\nsupport a conviction for aiding and abetting particular offenses. \r\nSee, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Spinney,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">236-40</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(discussing the \"continuum\"\r\nof mens rea requirements for aiding and abetting).\r\nIn Spinney, for example, we held that a conviction for\r\naiding and abetting an armed bank robbery must be supported by\r\nevidence that the defendant was \"on notice of the likelihood\" that\r\nthe principal would use a dangerous weapon in the commission of the\r\nbank robbery.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 240. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> By contrast, we held that a\r\nconviction under 18 U.S.C.  2 &amp; 924(c) for aiding and abetting\r\nthe use of a firearm in a crime of violence required proof that the\r\ndefendant knew \"to a practical certainty\" that the principal would\r\nbe using a gun.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 238-39. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Although we were not explicit,\r\na fair reading of Spinney supports the proposition that the level\r\nof knowledge required to support an aiding and abetting conviction\r\nis related to the specificity of the principal offense, as to both\r\nmens rea and actus reus.\r\nNot surprisingly, appellants urge us to adopt the higher\r\n\"practical certainty\" standard referred to in Spinney.  However, we\r\nneed not decide that issue today.  Even under a less exacting\r\n\"notice of likelihood\" standard, we conclude that no reasonable\r\njury could have found appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt of aiding and abetting the\r\ncarjacking of Edna Rivera-Hernndez.\r\nThe United States argues that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz should have known that Aponte-Laz and his cohorts might\r\nchoose a carjacking as a way to execute their contract on Edna,\r\nbecause Rosario-Daz (in the presence of Montalvo-Ortiz) gave\r\nAponte-Laz the make and model of Edna's car, as well as some of\r\nthe numbers from her license plate.  The government also argues\r\nthat, at the very least, Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz had\r\nknowledge that a carjacking was likely when they directed Aponte-\r\nLaz to the doctor's office and Aponte-Laz opined that such\r\ncircumstance would facilitate the crime because it would avoid the\r\nneed to go to Edna's house.\r\nBefore directly addressing the sufficiency of the factual\r\nevidence in this case, we would note that carjacking is a\r\nspecialized offense, requiring a specific criminal act and a narrow\r\nmens rea.  Rather than criminalizing any offense that involves a\r\nvehicle, Congress chose in 18 U.S.C.  2119 to create federal crime\r\nonly where the vehicle is \"taken\" by force and violence or by\r\nintimidation.  As the Supreme Court held last term in  Holloway v.\r\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118265\"><a href=\"/opinion/118265/holloway-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970 (1999), the mental state\r\nrequired by the statute (\"intent to cause death or serious bodily\r\nharm\") is measured at the moment that the defendant demands or\r\ntakes control of the vehicle.  The focus of the statute is narrow.\r\nWhen viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nprosecution (as indeed we must view all evidence for these\r\npurposes), the evidence pointed to by the United States might\r\nfairly be deemed to raise a possibility that Aponte-Laz would\r\ncommit a carjacking.  However, viewed in any light, we simply do\r\nnot find that evidence to raise such a possibility to the level of\r\na probability or a likelihood.  Based on the instructions and\r\ninformation that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz provided to\r\nAponte-Laz, any of several scenarios were within the realm of\r\npossible means of confronting Edna and attempting to retrieve the\r\n$200,000--burglary, confronting her near her home, confronting her\r\non the street, confronting her at her car without attempting to\r\n\"take\" the vehicle, confronting her in connection with a\r\ncarjacking, et cetera.  It is noteworthy that, in addition to\r\ninformation about Edna's car, Rosario-Daz gave Aponte-Laz her\r\nhome address as well as the location of her school.  In other\r\nwords, Aponte-Laz was given information by which he might locate\r\nEdna at any time during the morning, day, or night, at any of the\r\nplaces that she could be foreseen to be--at home, at school, or\r\nelsewhere with her car.  Significantly, the jury was not presented\r\nwith a single discussion or instruction in which Rosario-Daz or\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz mentioned or even alluded to a carjacking.   In sum,\r\nwe find no evidence whatsoever in the record that could reasonably\r\nbe considered by the jury to make carjacking more likely than any\r\nof the other possible ways in which Aponte-Laz could have carried\r\nout Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz's instructions.  Where the\r\noffense actually committed by the principal is merely one of many\r\n(in this case, practically innumerable) possibilities, we see no\r\ndifference between such \"knowledge\" and a \"general suspicion\" that\r\na criminal act is underway or contemplated.\r\nBecause there was insufficient evidence in the record for\r\nthe jury to reasonably find that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz\r\nhad the requisite foreknowledge that a carjacking would be\r\ncommitted, we must reverse their conviction on Count One of the\r\nindictment.\r\n2.  Count Two\r\nAppellants argue that their lack of foreknowledge should\r\nalso defeat their convictions on Count Two.  We agree.\r\nAs we have held many times, \"[t]o prove the elements of\r\na conspiracy, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat the 'defendant and one or more coconspirators intended to\r\nagree and . . . to commit the substantive criminal offense which\r\nwas the object of their unlawful agreement.'\"  United States v.\r\nEscobar-de-Jess, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765611\"><a href=\"/opinion/765611/united-states-v-eusebio-escobar-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting prior\r\ncases from this Circuit); see also Salinas v. United States, 118 S.\r\nCt. 469, 477 (1997) (\"A conspirator must intend to further an\r\nendeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of\r\na substantive criminal offense . . . .\").  Viewing the evidence\r\npresented at trial in the light most favorable to the government,\r\nthat evidence is insufficient to prove that Rosario-Daz and\r\nMontalvo-Ortiz agreed to commit or intended to further a\r\ncarjacking.  No reasonable jury could have convicted them of such\r\na conspiracy, and we reverse their convictions on Count Two of the\r\nindictment.\r\nWe take no pleasure in reversing the convictions of two\r\nappellants who were proven at trial to be the instigators of a\r\nnefarious criminal scheme that led to the brutal rape and murder of\r\na young woman.  The evidence produced at trial left no reasonable\r\ndoubt that Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz conspired with Aponte-\r\nLaz to rob and, if necessary, to murder Edna.  Appellants were\r\nnever charged with such a conspiracy, however, and we are powerless\r\nto undo that prosecutorial judgment.  It is not unusual in this day\r\nand age for the federal government to prosecute narrow parts of\r\ncriminal enterprises that would more logically (when viewed as a\r\nwhole) be adjudicated in local courts.  Indeed, the greater\r\nresources available to the federal government, at the investigatory\r\nand prosecutorial stages, often counsel in favor of such an\r\napproach.  Nevertheless, and irrespective of the hideous nature of\r\nthe crimes committed, a court of law is required to make its\r\nrulings on principled grounds.  There are no such grounds for a\r\nruling in the United States's favor on this issue, given the facts\r\nproven by the prosecution, and therefore cannot sustain appellants\r\nRosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz's convictions on Counts One and\r\nTwo.\r\nB.  Melndez-Garca and Bez-Jurado\r\nThe joint brief filed by appellants Melndez-Garca and\r\nBez-Jurado raises several issues on appeal, several of which are\r\napplicable to and joined by more than one appellant in this case. \r\nWe will address the broadly applicable issues first, and then\r\nproceed to the appellant-specific issues.\r\n1.  Improper Bolstering by Agent Huff\r\nAppellants argue that the testimony of FBI Agent Daryl\r\nHuff constituted improper bolstering of the testimony of\r\ncooperating witness Aponte-Laz.  We review the district court's\r\nadmission of the challenged testimony under a harmless error\r\nstandard.  See United States v. Josleyn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197023\"><a href=\"/opinion/197023/united-states-v-josleyn/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1198 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  Although we are troubled by Huff's testimony, we hold\r\nthat its admission was harmless error.\r\nThe case law is clear, and the parties agree, that\r\nprosecutors may not place the prestige of the United States behind\r\na witness by making personal assurances about the credibility of a\r\nwitness or by indicating that facts not before the jury support the\r\nwitness's testimony.  See, e.g., United States v. Neal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679500\"><a href=\"/opinion/679500/united-states-v-gary-p-neal-united-states-v-william-f-kenney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207-08 (1st Cir. 1994).  It is also undisputed that the\r\nprosecution cannot accomplish such improper bolstering of a witness\r\nthrough the testimony of other government witnesses.  See United\r\nStates v. Mazza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471592\"><a href=\"/opinion/471592/united-states-v-antonio-j-mazza-united-states-of-america-v-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1214-16 (1st Cir. 1986). \r\nGovernment witnesses may of course testify to facts within their\r\npersonal knowledge that support or corroborate another witness's\r\ntestimony.  Indeed, in a case such as this one, where the bulk of\r\ncritical testimony comes from a single cooperating coconspirator,\r\nthe prosecution's principal task is often to convince the jury that\r\nthe witness's account is credible.  The prosecution simply must do\r\nso through competent and reliable evidence and not through improper\r\nvouching that could invite the jury to find guilt on the basis of\r\nsomething other than the evidence presented at trial.\r\nWe have no difficulty concluding that the testimony of\r\nAgent Huff was improper.  Although Huff could properly have\r\ntestified as to the actions he took to corroborate Aponte-Laz's\r\ntestimony, we think it obvious that he could not properly opine on\r\nwhether particular statements by Aponte-Laz were \"lies,\" nor could\r\nhe represent that the statements not singled out as lies had been\r\n\"tested\" and verified through interrogation techniques. \r\nParticularly in light of Huff's testimony concerning his training\r\nand experience in interrogation and investigation, the clear\r\npurpose and effect of his testimony was to put the prestige of his\r\nprofessional knowledge as a federal agent behind the testimony of\r\nAponte-Laz.  That is the very definition of improper bolstering,\r\nand it is impermissible.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that this case is\r\nindistinguishable from United States v. Piva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520291\"><a href=\"/opinion/520291/united-states-v-joseph-piva/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st\r\nCir. 1989), in which we held that it was not reversible error to\r\nadmit the testimony of a law enforcement officer detailing out-of-\r\ncourt statements by the defendant.  The Piva panel distinguished\r\nour decision in Mazza using words that are equally applicable to\r\nthe case presently under consideration:\r\n  [T]he testimony of [the officer] was admitted\r\nafter [defendant's] testimony, whereas in\r\nMazza the agents' testimony came at the\r\nopening of trial.  Thus we are not faced here\r\nwith the Mazza danger that the agent would\r\ntestify as to items that would never come into\r\nevidence, nor would [defendant's] testimony be\r\nbolstered by the law enforcement officer\r\nbefore the jury could evaluate it\r\nindependently.  Furthermore, the government\r\nwas justified in seeking admission of this\r\ntestimony because of the defense's attacks on\r\nthe informant's credibility.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520291\"><a href=\"/opinion/520291/united-states-v-joseph-piva/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 760. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> In this case, Aponte-Laz testified extensively before\r\nAgent Huff took the stand, and Aponte-Laz was subject to vigorous\r\ncross-examination.  Furthermore, the district court took pains to\r\ninstruct the jury that they were to judge Aponte-Laz's credibility\r\non the basis of his testimony alone, and not that of Agent Huff. \r\nOn these facts, and in light of the other probative evidence\r\nadmitted in this case, we hold that the improper bolstering\r\nsolicited by the prosecution from Agent Huff was harmless error not\r\nwarranting reversal.  We nevertheless take this occasion to issue\r\na strong warning against the use of this procedure by government\r\nprosecutors and advise that they will tread on thin ice indeed if\r\nthey continue to practice this technique in the future.\r\n2.  Denial of Motion for New Trial\r\nAppellants next argue that the district court erred in\r\ndenying a motion for a new trial submitted by appellants after\r\ntheir convictions.  We affirm the district court's ruling.\r\nThe day after the guilty verdict was returned in this\r\ncase, the victim's father gave an interview on local television. \r\nIn that interview, Edna's father stated that an FBI agent had told\r\nhim that the FBI had investigated and found no link between Edna\r\nand the defendants or the $200,000 of alleged drug money.  Because\r\nthis assertion ran directly contrary to the government's theory at\r\ntrial and apparently contradicted the testimony of Aponte-Laz that\r\nEdna had admitted having the money but claimed to have returned it,\r\nappellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz filed a motion for a new\r\ntrial alleging Brady violations and the discovery of new evidence. \r\nAll appellants joined the motion.\r\nAfter receiving briefs, conducting a hearing, and\r\nreviewing the statement of Edna's father, the trial court denied\r\nthe motion for a new trial on August 6, 1998.  See Opinion and\r\nOrder of August 6, 1998.  After examining the relevant law, the\r\ntrial court determined that the agent's statement to Edna's father\r\nwould be inadmissible (and in any event immaterial) lay opinion and\r\nthus was neither discoverable under Brady nor \"newly discovered\r\nevidence\" warranting a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal\r\nProcedure 33.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520291\"><a href=\"/opinion/520291/united-states-v-joseph-piva/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at  18-21.\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nWe review the denial of a motion for a new trial for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Montilla, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197423\"><a href=\"/opinion/197423/united-states-v-montilla-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n1064 (1st Cir. 1997).  We also note that a new trial is generally\r\nwarranted only in the rare circumstance where retrial is necessary\r\nto prevent a miscarriage of justice.  See United States v.\r\nGonzlez-Gonzlez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir. 1998).  After carefully\r\nreviewing the record and the law, we hold that the district court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.\r\nFirst, the agent's statement to the victim's father\r\ncannot itself warrant a new trial.  Because it was made after\r\ntrial, the prosecution cannot be faulted for failing to produce it\r\nas Brady material.  Even if a new trial were granted, the agent's\r\nstatement might very well be excluded as inadmissible hearsay or,\r\nas the district court opined, inadmissible lay opinion testimony. \r\nMoreover, even if admitted, the testimony is to a lack of evidence,\r\nnot to some talismanic piece of evidence affirmatively proving or\r\ndisproving a connection.  Its probative value, therefore, would be\r\nquestionable.\r\nSecond, we do not agree with appellants' implicit\r\ncontention that the agent's statement necessarily indicates that\r\nthe prosecution possessed other exculpatory evidence at the time of\r\ntrial.  Again, the agent's alleged statement was that the FBI had\r\nfailed to establish a connection between Edna and the drug\r\noperation.  We decline to speculate that the government had\r\naffirmatively disproved any connection, and we certainly should not\r\nand will not require the prosecution to report back to the defense\r\nevery time an investigation fails to produce the results that the\r\ngovernment intended.  \r\nThird, we agree with the district court that appellants'\r\nmotion for a new trial failed to demonstrate a sufficient\r\nlikelihood that the \"evidence\" derived from the statement would\r\nchange the outcome of the trial.  At best, the information would\r\nallow the defense to (1) impeach Aponte-Laz's testimony that Edna\r\nhad admitted having and returning the drug money and (2) dispute\r\nthe alleged motive for carjacking Edna--to retrieve the $200,000. \r\nAs the United States points out, Edna's connection to the\r\ndefendants or to the money is not an element of any crime charged\r\nnor an alleged overt act of the conspiracy.  Furthermore, whether\r\nor not Edna was in fact involved with the drug operations is\r\nultimately irrelevant to appellants' guilt for carjacking and\r\nkilling her.\r\nUnder the circumstances, we conclude that the district\r\ncourt did not err in denying the motion for a new trial.\r\n3.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nAppellants argue that the evidence submitted at trial was\r\ninsufficient to sustain the jury's guilty verdicts against them,\r\nbecause the inculpatory evidence presented at trial consisted\r\nalmost exclusively of the testimony of cooperating witness Aponte-\r\nLaz.  Appellants argue that Aponte-Laz's testimony is\r\nunbelievable because Aponte-Laz admitted to lying to agents and\r\nothers at various times and because of Aponte-Laz's history of\r\ncriminal behavior.  Again, we review a district court's Rule 29\r\ndeterminations de novo.  See United States v. Hernndez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198013\"><a href=\"/opinion/198013/united-states-v-hernandez-favale/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nAppellants correctly note that we have held the\r\nuncorroborated testimony of a cooperating accomplice sufficient to\r\nsustain a conviction, unless that testimony is facially incredible. \r\nSee United States v. Andjar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nAponte-Laz's testimony in this case was not facially incredible. \r\nIt is true that, given the circumstances surrounding the crimes\r\ncommitted, Aponte-Laz's participation therein, and his obvious\r\nmotive to testify favorably for the government, Aponte-Laz's\r\ncredibility was subject to challenge.  This, however, was\r\nvigorously done by appellants at every opportunity during trial,\r\nbefore those charged with weighing credibility--the jury. \r\nAppellants offer us no basis for determining that the jury's\r\ncredibility determination is unsupportable other than the evidence\r\nthat the jury itself considered and rejected.  Because Aponte-\r\nLaz's testimony is not facially unbelievable, we hold that his\r\ntestimony alone provided the jury with enough evidence to support\r\nthe convictions of Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales. \r\nFurthermore, the evidence against Melndez-Garca and Bez-Jurado\r\nincluded their own inculpatory statements to law enforcement. \r\nConsequently, we decline to reverse the convictions of Melndez-\r\nGarca, Bez-Jurado, or Lpez-Morales on sufficiency-of-the-\r\nevidence grounds.\r\n4.  Improper Sentence Imposed for Conspiracy Conviction\r\nNext, appellants have joined the argument, best\r\narticulated in the brief of appellants Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-\r\nOrtiz, that the district court erred in imposing life sentences for\r\nappellants' convictions on Count Two, which charged them with\r\nconspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  The United States\r\nconcedes that 18 U.S.C.  371 provides for imprisonment of \"not\r\nmore than five years.\"  The district court clearly erred in\r\nimposing life sentences on Count Two, and we vacate the sentences\r\nof Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado, and Lpez-Morales on Count Two and\r\nremand for resentencing.\r\n5.  Unfair Prejudice from Evidence Against Other    \r\n     Defendants\r\n\nFinally, appellants jointly argue that the substantial\r\nevidence admitted against other defendants, particularly Rosario-\r\nDaz and Montalvo-Ortiz, unfairly prejudiced them by allowing the\r\njury to convict them on the basis of evidence relating to other\r\ndefendants' conduct.  In essence, appellants challenge the district\r\ncourt's denial of their requests for severance.  We conclude that\r\nthere was no reversible error.\r\nAt trial, the United States offered a great deal of\r\ntestimony detailing the drug trafficking activities of defendants\r\nRosario-Daz and, to a lesser extent, Montalvo-Ortiz.  The\r\ngovernment did not allege nor prove that the other defendants were\r\ninvolved in those illegal activities.  Appellants now argue that\r\nthe evidence against Rosario-Daz and Montalvo-Ortiz improperly\r\naffected the jury's verdicts, and they request that we reverse\r\ntheir convictions.\r\nWe have recognized this kind of \"spillover\" claim before. \r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Drougas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18-19 (1st Cir.\r\n1984).  In Drougas we stated that, \"[i]n a case involving several\r\ndefendants, the court must take care that evidence against one\r\ndefendant is not misinterpreted by the jury and used as a basis for\r\nconvicting another defendant not connected to that evidence.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r\n(citing United </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">States v. Flaherty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398781\"><a href=\"/opinion/398781/united-states-v-thomas-e-flaherty-united-states-of-america-v-james-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582 (1st Cir.\r\n1981).  After stating that the district court's severance\r\ndeterminations should be overturned only upon a showing of strong\r\nprejudice, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398781\"><a href=\"/opinion/398781/united-states-v-thomas-e-flaherty-united-states-of-america-v-james-r/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> we nevertheless </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">concluded that the trial\r\ncourt's careful instructions to the jury and the ample evidence\r\nagainst the defendant eliminated any possibility of unfair\r\nprejudice.\r\nWe likewise conclude that the admission of the drug-\r\nrelated evidence in this case was not an abuse of discretion.  The\r\nevidence of Rosario-Daz's drug trafficking was clearly relevant in\r\nthat it connected Rosario-Daz to Edna, supported the government's\r\ntheory on motive, and corroborated the critical testimony of\r\nAponte-Laz.  The drug trafficking evidence can also be viewed as\r\nnecessary to complete the story of the conspiracy and carjacking\r\ncharged in this case, in that drugs are the common denominator\r\nlinking the various characters.\r\nMoreover, there was ample evidence admitted against each\r\nappellant to reduce the risk of an unfounded guilty verdict.  As\r\ndiscussed above, the government presented substantial evidence of\r\nguilt, primarily through the testimony of Aponte-Laz but also, at\r\nleast in the cases of Melndez-Garca and Bez-Jurado, through the\r\nappellants' own inculpatory statements to investigators.  Although\r\nthe record does not reflect the extensive corrective instructions\r\ngiven to the jury in Drougas, we nevertheless hold that the\r\nevidence of drug trafficking in this case did not create a\r\nsufficient risk of unfair prejudice to warrant reversal and\r\nseverance.\r\n6.  Melndez-Garca's Waiver of Rights and Consent to \r\n     Search\r\n\nTurning now to the appellant-specific arguments raised in\r\nappellants' joint brief, we consider first the issues raised by\r\nappellant Melndez-Garca.  Melndez-Garca first argues that her\r\nstatements to the FBI and the evidence recovered in the search of\r\nher residence should have been suppressed because her waivers were\r\nnot \"knowing and intelligent\" and because her statements and\r\nconsent to search were not voluntary.  After reviewing the record,\r\nwe conclude that there was no error in the admission of this\r\nevidence.\r\nWe review the district court's rulings on these issues\r\nfor clear error.

Garca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598972\"><a href=\"/opinion/598972/united-states-v-jose-a-garcia-united-states-v-pablo-h-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1169 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nMelndez-Garca admits to signing a written waiver of her\r\nMiranda rights and a written consent to search her residence.\r\nHowever, she claims that the district court could not have properly\r\nfound her waiver of her Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights to be\r\nknowing and intelligent and voluntary, based on the evidence that\r\nshe has a very low I.Q. and that she was interviewed by law\r\nenforcement over a period of some six hours.\r\nThe trial court received a substantial amount of evidence\r\nregarding Melndez-Garca's mental capacity, including expert\r\ntestimony from both sides.  Although the court received evidence\r\nthat Melndez-Garca's I.Q. was in the middle 70s and that she had\r\nno prior involvement with the criminal justice system, the court\r\nalso heard testimony from an arresting officer and the government's\r\nexpert witness that Melndez-Garca understood what was happening\r\nwhen she waived her Fifth Amendment rights and consented to the\r\nsearch.\r\nThe district court also received evidence relating to the\r\nvoluntariness of Melndez-Garca's decisions.  Although Melndez-\r\nGarca herself testified that she felt very scared and physically\r\nill, there was no evidence whatsoever of physical coercion or\r\nintimidation, nor was there any indication of conduct by the law\r\nenforcement agents that would amount to psychological coercion or\r\nintimidation.\r\nViewing the totality of the circumstances particular to\r\nthis case, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred\r\nin its determination that Melndez-Garca's waiver and consent were\r\nknowing and intelligent and made voluntarily.  We therefore affirm\r\nthe district court's decision on this issue.\r\n7.  Denial of Downward Departure\r\nAppellant Melndez-Garca also argues that the district\r\ncourt should have awarded her a downward departure under  5K2.13\r\nof the Sentencing Guidelines.  On appeal, she suggests that the\r\ncourt should have taken into consideration both her diminished\r\nmental capacity and her role in caring for Edna's baby after the\r\ncrime.\r\nWe first note that a district court's decision not to\r\ndepart from the Sentencing Guidelines is ordinarily not appealable\r\nunless the record indicates some error of law such as a\r\nmisapprehension of the applicable guideline or a miscalculation of\r\nthe sentencing court's authority.  See United States v.\r\nGrandmaison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196611\"><a href=\"/opinion/196611/united-states-v-grandmaison/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 (1st Cir. 1996).  Appellant points to\r\nno such legal error in the record, arguing instead that the\r\ndistrict court simply denied her a departure to which she was\r\nentitled.  We are therefore without jurisdiction to review the\r\ndistrict court's refusal to grant a departure.\r\n8.  Voluntariness of Bez-Jurado's Statements to \r\n  Investigators\r\n\nThe final issue raised by appellant Bez-Jurado is a\r\nchallenge to the admission into evidence of his inculpatory\r\nstatements to investigators the day following his detention. \r\nAlthough the trial court's determination of voluntariness is\r\nsubject to de novo review, its factual findings are reviewed for\r\nclear error.  See United States v. Santos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197680\"><a href=\"/opinion/197680/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18-19 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  Because we conclude that the statements were\r\nvoluntary, we affirm the admission of the statements at trial.\r\nBez-Jurado's principal contention is that he was\r\ndetained for twenty-eight hours before being brought before a\r\nmagistrate, and that the government's proffered reasons of\r\nadministrative delay and unavailability of a magistrate are not\r\ncredible.  However, Bez-Jurado does not point to any evidence of\r\nphysical or psychological coercion by law enforcement, nor does he\r\nspecify how the delay in his initial appearance rendered his\r\nconfession involuntary.  Furthermore, delay in appearing before a\r\nmagistrate is only one of several factors to be considered in\r\ndetermining voluntariness.  See 18 U.S.C.  3501(b) (listing\r\nseveral illustrative and nonconclusive factors).  None of the other\r\nfactors suggesting involuntariness have been shown.  Consequently,\r\nwe find no error in the district court's determination that the\r\nstatements were admissible.\r\nC.  Lpez-Morales\r\nIn addition to the arguments addressed above, appellant\r\nLpez-Morales challenges the district court's admission of two\r\ntypes of evidence.\r\n1.  Evidence of Plan to Kill Government Witnesses\r\nAt trial, the government presented evidence, through the\r\ntestimony of Aponte-Laz, that Aponte-Laz and Lpez-Morales agreed\r\nto a plan by which Aponte-Laz would exonerate Lpez-Morales to the\r\nauthorities so that Lpez-Morales would be released and then murder\r\nwitnesses expected to testify for the government.  Lpez-Morales\r\nnow argues that this evidence was irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial,\r\nand that its admission implicitly amended the indictment in\r\nviolation of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  We\r\ngenerally will reverse a district court's admissibility\r\ndeterminations under Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 403 only in\r\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances, see United States v.\r\nBrandon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443 (1st Cir. 1994), although we consider\r\nLpez-Morales's constitutional challenge de novo.\r\nFirst, we find the evidence of the plot to be plainly\r\nrelevant to Lpez-Morales's guilt in the carjacking, insofar as it\r\nevinces a consciousness of guilt.  See United States v. Gonsalves,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398645\"><a href=\"/opinion/398645/united-states-v-john-gonsalves/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1st Cir. 1982).  Likewise, we cannot find that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence\r\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  Although we agree with\r\nappellant that the evidence is prejudicial to his defense in a\r\ngeneric sense (as is all probative evidence of guilt), we are not\r\npersuaded that it was unfairly so.  The jury had every opportunity\r\nto weigh Aponte-Laz's testimony, and, once accepted, that\r\ntestimony was properly held against Lpez-Morales.\r\nLpez-Morales's Fifth Amendment argument is more\r\nsubstantial.  As we recognized in United States v. Dunn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449678\"><a href=\"/opinion/449678/united-states-v-john-f-dunn-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1st Cir. 1985), the admission of evidence of an offense not\r\ncharged in the indictment can, in some circumstances, constitute\r\ngrounds for reversal of a conviction.  See also Stirone v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105978\"><a href=\"/opinion/105978/stirone-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1960).  The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth\r\nAmendment guarantees that no person shall be tried and convicted of\r\na crime in federal court lest his fellow citizens have seen fit to\r\ncharge him with such crime.  If the court permits the jury to\r\nconvict a defendant on evidence of a crime not included in the\r\nindictment, that constitutional right is violated.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105978\"><a href=\"/opinion/105978/stirone-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 273\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(quoting Ex parte Bain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91894\"><a href=\"/opinion/91894/ex-parte-bain/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1887)).\r\nThis important rule, however, is not as broad as\r\nappellant would have us proclaim.  Although an indictment may not\r\nbe constructively amended by presenting evidence of uncharged\r\noffenses, there are many instances in which evidence of uncharged\r\nconduct is properly admitted in a criminal trial.  Rule 404(b) of\r\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence, for instance, states that evidence\r\nof uncharged crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted to prove\r\n\"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\" etc. \r\nSuch evidence, because ultimately offered to prove guilt of the\r\ncharged offense, effects no constructive amendment of the\r\nindictment and therefore does not infringe on a defendant's Fifth\r\nAmendment rights.  Likewise, in this case the United States offered\r\nevidence of the plan to kill government witnesses for a number of\r\nlegitimate reasons aimed ultimately at proving the charged\r\noffenses, including to prove consciousness of guilt and to explain\r\nthe inconsistency between Aponte-Laz's initial exoneration of\r\nLpez-Morales and his subsequent change in testimony.  We find no\r\nconstructive amendment of the indictment and no reversible error.\r\n2.  Evidence of Rape\r\nThe United States also presented the jury with evidence\r\nthat Lpez-Morales participated in the rape of Edna before she was\r\nmurdered.  Lpez-Morales argues that this evidence should have been\r\nexcluded as irrelevant or, at least, as unfairly prejudicial,\r\nbecause rape was not an element of the offense charged--carjacking\r\nthat resulted in death, under 18 U.S.C.  2119(3).  Again, we\r\nreverse a district court's Rule 402 and 403 determinations only\r\nrarely and only upon demonstration of extraordinary circumstances. \r\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brandon,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting\r\nthe evidence of rape in this case.  There can be no reasonable\r\ndispute that the rape evidence was inseparably intertwined with the\r\ncarjacking and murder, and the evidence presented to the jury was\r\nnecessary to complete the story of the crime charged in the\r\nindictment, even though that indictment charged appellant with a\r\ncarjacking that resulted in death rather than the lesser crime of\r\na carjacking resulting in bodily injury.  Although the evidence was\r\ncertainly powerful, there was no error in the trial judge's\r\ndetermination that its probative value was not substantially\r\noutweighed by any possibility of unfair prejudice.  Cf. Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 403.\r\n                       III.  CONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, the convictions of appellants Rosario-Daz\r\nand Montalvo-Ortiz must be reversed for insufficiency of evidence. \r\nThe convictions of appellants Melndez-Garca, Bez-Jurado, and\r\nLpez-Morales are affirmed, although we must vacate their sentences\r\non Count Two of the indictment and remand to the district court for\r\nresentencing.\r\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part.\n</pre>",
