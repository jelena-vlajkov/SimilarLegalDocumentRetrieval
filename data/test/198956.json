West for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Stephanie S. Browne,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                            June 2, 2000\n\f\f          STAHL, Circuit Judge. Defendant-appellant Vincent Mann\n\nappeals an order denying his motion to suppress crack cocaine police\n\nseized from him at the time of his arrest. Finding no Fourth Amendment\n\nviolation, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Detective Joseph Colanduono first heard about Vincent Mann\n\nwhen he arrested several individuals on drug charges in February 1998.\n\nAfter their arrest, some of these individuals, as well as some tenants\n\nof the housing project in which they were arrested, told Colanduono\n\nabout “Vincent,” who they claimed was supplying drugs to dealers in the\n\nLockwood Plaza area of Providence, Rhode Island. They also provided\n\nColanduono with a physical description of Vincent and told him Vincent\n\ndrove a white Buick Century.       Subsequently, Colanduono sought\n\ninformation about Vincent from a Lockwood Plaza housing project\n\nsecurity guard. The guard said he was familiar with Vincent and agreed\n\nto call Colanduono if and when he saw Vincent in the area. Sometime\n\nlater the guard saw the Buick, called Colanduono, who came to the\n\nproject, and pointed out Vincent to him.\n\n          Colanduono then began surveilling Lockwood Plaza. On two\n\noccasions, he observed Vincent speaking with others in another area\n\nknown to the Providence police as a frequent site of drug trafficking.\n\nColanduono also observed Vincent driving a white Buick Century. At\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fsome point, he identified Vincent for his partner, Detective Gregory\n\nSion.\n\n          On February 16, 1998, a confidential informant1 phoned\n\nColanduono and told him that Vincent would be dropping off a large\n\nsupply of cocaine in the Loungo Square area of Providence later that\n\nevening. The informant described Vincent's white Buick Century and\n\ngave Colanduono its license plate number. Colanduono considered this\n\ninformant to be a good source because on several prior occasions he had\n\nprovided Colanduono with reliable information. Moreover, at least one\n\nof the informant's prior tips had led to the arrest and conviction of\n\na drug dealer.\n\n          As a result of this call, Colanduono and Sion set up\n\nsurveillance in the Loungo Square area. At around 10:30 p.m., they\n\nobserved a white Buick Century with a license plate number matching the\n\none the informant had provided. Colanduono and Sion recognized Mann,\n\nthe driver, as the person previously identified as Vincent.        The\n\nvehicle made a U-turn and came to a stop in front of a residence. Mann\n\nthen honked the vehicle's horn, which the officers, based on their\n\nexperience, believed was a signal of his arrival to his buyer.\n\n\n     1Mann makes much of the fact that the police report listed this\ninformant as “anonymous” and argues that the district court erred “in\ndetermining that the police were in fact relying on a confidential\ninformant.” The district court's inquiry into whether the informant\nwas anonymous or not was sufficiently thorough. Given the record, its\ndecision to regard the informant as a confidential source known to the\npolice was not clearly erroneous.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Two other detectives and one uniformed officer were parked\n\nin two cars near Colanduono and Sion. When Colanduono gave a signal,\n\nthe three police cars converged to block-in Mann's car. While Mann\n\nremained in the driver's seat, Colanduono approached him on the\n\npassenger's side, and Sion approached him on the driver's side. As\n\nSion approached, he observed Mann stuff a large object into his pants.\n\nSion immediately drew his gun and warned Colanduono of Mann's actions.\n\nSion told Mann to place his hands in the air. Mann complied, and Sion\n\nholstered his weapon.\n\n          Sion opened the car door and removed Mann from the car. He\n\nplaced one hand on Mann's shoulder to prevent his flight and placed the\n\nother on Mann's pants where he had seen Mann hide the object. Sion\n\nfelt “a hard, rock-like substance all together in one big ball,” which\n\nhe believed, based on his training and experience, to be crack cocaine.\n\nSion reached into Mann's pants and pulled out the object, which turned\n\nout to be a large quantity of crack cocaine wrapped in a plastic bag.\n\nUpon discovering the crack, the police placed Mann under arrest and\n\nhandcuffed him.\n\n          A federal grand jury indicted Mann for possession of cocaine\n\nwith intent to sell, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Mann filed\n\na motion to suppress the cocaine the police seized from his pants. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, ruling that the police were justified\n\nin stopping Mann because they had a reasonable suspicion that he was\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fabout to engage in criminal activity. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1,\n\n30 (1968). In the district court's view, the nature of the criminal\n\nconduct under investigation, as well as the time of night, justified a\n\npolice frisk for weapons. And the frisk, which revealed the hard lump,\n\ngave Sion probable cause to believe that Mann was in possession of\n\ncrack cocaine. In the alternative, the district court reasoned that\n\nSion had probable cause to arrest Mann when he frisked him and felt\n\nwhat he believed to be crack. The seizure of the cocaine thus was\n\nentirely the proper product of a search incident to arrest.\n\n          Mann pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in which he\n\nreserved the right to challenge the denial of the suppression motion on\n\nappeal.   He does so here.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review de novo the district court's probable cause\n\ndeterminations, but “take care both to review findings of historical\n\nfact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn\n\nfrom those facts.” Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996);\n\nsee also United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 525 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nWhere the district court did not make specific findings, “we view the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the ruling.” McCarthy, 77 F.3d\n\nat 525.\n\n          Mann contends that when the police surrounded his car and\n\napproached him, he was under de facto arrest, which would be improper\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fabsent a showing of probable cause. He also argues that the police did\n\nnot have the requisite probable cause to support such an arrest.\n\nDespite circuit precedent suggesting that a stop such as this is not a\n\nde facto arrest, see, e.g., United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 157\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1987), we will assume arguendo that Mann was under arrest\n\nand determine whether the police had the requisite probable cause to\n\nmake such an arrest.   In so doing, we affirm the district court's\n\ndecision, but on somewhat different grounds. See United States v.\n\nPaulino, 13 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that appellate courts\n\nmay affirm a judgement based on any grounds manifest in the record).\n\n          The police do not need a warrant to arrest a person in public\n\nif there is “probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed\n\nor is committing a crime.” United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d\n\n719, 726 (1st Cir. 1995). The relevant inquiry is “not whether there\n\nwas a warrant or whether there was time to get one, but whether there\n\nwas probable cause for the arrest.” United States v. Watson, 423 U.S.\n\n411, 417 (1976).\n\n          To establish probable cause, the government must demonstrate\n\nthat “at the time of the arrest, the facts and circumstances known to\n\nthe arresting officers were sufficient to warrant a prudent person in\n\nbelieving that the defendant had committed or was committing an\n\noffense.” United States v. Cleveland, 106 F.3d 1056, 1060 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), aff'd sub nom. Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125 (1998).\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f“The probable cause standard does not require the officers' conclusion\n\nto be ironclad, or even highly probable.       Their conclusion that\n\nprobable cause exists need only be reasonable.” United States v.\n\nWinchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 555-56 (1st Cir. 1999). Probable cause is\n\ndetermined by looking to the totality of the circumstances.        See\n\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 230 (1983). In this sense, “probable\n\ncause is a fluid concept” that cannot be reduced to a specific set of\n\nlegal rules. Id. at 232. The government, however, may not rely on\n\nevidence recovered from the suspect during or after the arrest to\n\nestablish probable cause for that arrest. See United States v. Bizier,\n\n111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          The government had probable cause to arrest Mann.        The\n\narrestees who spoke with Colanduono identified “Vincent” as a mid-level\n\ndrug dealer.   The tenants in the Lockwood Plaza housing project\n\nsupplied Colanduono with the same information about Vincent. Their\n\nparticipation weighs heavily in our analysis. See United States v.\n\nSchaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 566 (1st Cir. 1996) (“[I]nformation provided by\n\nordinary citizens has particular value in the probable cause\n\nequation.”). Colanduono spoke with a security guard who pointed out\n\nVincent and gave details about his car. The police twice had viewed\n\nVincent consorting with known drug dealers. A confidential informant,\n\nwho in the past had provided Colanduono with reliable information,\n\nreported that Vincent would arrive in Loungo Square to sell cocaine.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fThe officers watched Vincent arrive in the Loungo Square area in the\n\ncar identified by both the informant and the security guard. The\n\nofficers witnessed Vincent honk his horn, which they suspected, given\n\ntheir experience in such matters, was a signal to a drug buyer that\n\nVincent had arrived. Because under the totality of the circumstances\n\nthe police reasonably could have believed that Vincent was about to\n\ncommit an offense, they had probable cause to arrest him. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Diallo, 29 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding\n\nprobable cause was supported by an uncorroborated but accurate tip from\n\nan informant known to be reliable).\n\n          Mann suggests that the officers improperly relied on the\n\ninformant because they failed to corroborate the information the\n\ntipster provided. But the police already had observed activities and\n\nreceived information that corroborated the tipster's information.\n\nMoreover, complete corroboration is not always necessary for an\n\ninformant's tip to support probable cause. See id. (“[U]nder the\n\nstandard enunciated in Gates, the police do not have to corroborate\n\nevery detail of the informant's tip.”). In Gates, the Supreme Court\n\nabandoned the stringent “two-pronged test” that it previously had\n\nestablished to evaluate an informant's veracity or reliability and the\n\nbasis of his knowledge. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238 (rejecting the\n\nmechanical formula specified in Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S.\n\n410, 415-16 (1969), and Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114 (1964)).\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fNow, “an informant's tales need not invariably be buttressed by\n\nextensive encomia to his veracity or detailed discussions of the source\n\nof his knowledge.” Schaefer, 87 F.3d at 566. Colanduono testified\n\nthat his confidential informant had been a reliable source in the past\n\nwith one prior tip leading to a conviction. In addition, the tip was\n\nreplete with details that indicated a basis of knowledge. See Diallo,\n\n29 F.3d at 26 (finding sufficient detail when a tipster “correctly\n\nreported the location of the three men, the type of car that [they]\n\nwould be driving and that the three men would be traveling together\n\nthat night” even though the tipster incorrectly “stated that there\n\nwould be three men in a red Toyota when in actuality there were four\n\nmen in two cars”).\n\n          It is well settled that once police are authorized to make\n\na lawful arrest, they may conduct a warrantless search of the arrestee.\n\nSee United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 234 (1973); Bizier, 111\n\nF.3d at 217. “The justification or reason for the authority to search\n\nincident to a lawful arrest rests [both] on the need to disarm the\n\nsuspect in order to take him into custody [and] on the need to preserve\n\nevidence on his person for later use at trial.” Robinson, 414 U.S. at\n\n234.\n\n          Mann contends the officers had no justification for their\n\nsearch incident to his arrest because they were in no appreciable fear\n\nfor their safety. Mann argues that because Sion grabbed his pants as\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fhe pulled Mann from the car, he conducted an illegal warrantless\n\nsearch.   We do not agree.    As long as the arrest is supported by\n\nprobable cause, the search incident to that arrest is reasonable. See\n\nNew York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 461 (1981) (“A custodial arrest of a\n\nsuspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the\n\nFourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the\n\narrest requires no additional justification.”); see also United\n\nStates v. Doward, 41 F.3d 789, 793 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that “ Belton\n\nleaves no doubt that post hoc analyses like those presently urged by\n\n[the defendant] are precluded”).\n\n                                 III.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f",

The\n\narrestees who spoke with Colanduono identified “Vincent” as a mid-level\n\ndrug dealer.   The tenants in the Lockwood Plaza housing project\n\nsupplied Colanduono with the same information about Vincent. Their\n\nparticipation weighs heavily in our analysis. See United States v.\n\nSchaefer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196839\"><a href=\"/opinion/196839/united-states-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (1st Cir. 1996) (“[I]nformation provided by\n\nordinary citizens has particular value in the probable cause\n\nequation.”). Colanduono spoke with a security guard who pointed out\n\nVincent and gave details about his car. The police twice had viewed\n\nVincent consorting with known drug dealers. A confidential informant,\n\nwho in the past had provided Colanduono with reliable information,\n\nreported that Vincent would arrive in Loungo Square to sell cocaine.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fThe officers watched Vincent arrive in the Loungo Square area in the\n\ncar identified by both the informant and the security guard. The\n\nofficers witnessed Vincent honk his horn, which they suspected, given\n\ntheir experience in such matters, was a signal to a drug buyer that\n\nVincent had arrived. Because under the totality of the circumstances\n\nthe police reasonably could have believed that Vincent was about to\n\ncommit an offense, they had probable cause to arrest him.

But the police already had observed activities and\n\nreceived information that corroborated the tipster's information.\n\nMoreover, complete corroboration is not always necessary for an\n\ninformant's tip to support probable cause.
