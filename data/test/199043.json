Appellant Zuleida Berbere was indicted on three\n\ncounts of violations of the narcotics laws (Counts One, Five, and\n\nSeven) and one count of money laundering (Count Nine). Count Nine\n\nstemmed from the same factual predicate, i.e., the same drug\n\ntransaction, as Count Seven. Following a jury trial, appellant was\n\nacquitted of Counts One, Five, and Seven but was convicted on the money\n\nlaundering count. Appellant appeals the verdict and the district\n\ncourt's denial of her Rule 29 motion for acquittal on the grounds that\n\n(1) the verdicts were inconsistent and (2) there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support her conviction. Having thoroughly reviewed the\n\nbriefs and the record, we affirm for substantially the reasons\n\nexpressed in the district court's opinion, see United States v. Zuleida\n\nBerbere, No. 97-173 (D.P.R. April 27, 1998), which we briefly summarize\n\nbelow.\n\n          First, as the district court indicated, the verdicts are not\n\ninconsistent. The elements of the charges in Counts Seven (importation\n\nof cocaine) and Nine (money laundering) are different: one is a drug\n\ntrafficking charge and the other is a money laundering charge. It is\n\nwell settled that verdicts are not inconsistent if the elements of the\n\ntwo charged counts are not identical. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nCrochiere, 129 F.3d 233, 239 (1st Cir. 1997). Further, even if we were\n\nto hold that the two verdicts are inconsistent, \"the Supreme Court has\n\nmade it clear that verdict inconsistency in itself is not a sufficient\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fbasis for vacating a conviction,\" United States v. López, 944 F.2d 33,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57\n\n(1984)), \"as long as the appellate court is satisfied that there was\n\nsufficient evidence to sustain the counts of conviction,\" United States\n\nv. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          In this case, the record contains ample evidence to support\n\nappellant's conviction. Specifically, the prosecution presented three\n\nwitnesses who testified as to appellant's money laundering activities.\n\nIt scarcely needs repeating that:\n\n          An appellate court plays a very circumscribed\n          role in gauging the sufficiency of the\n          evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal\n          conviction rests. The court of appeals neither\n          weighs the credibility of the witnesses nor\n          attempts to assess whether the prosecution\n          succeeded in eliminating every possible theory\n          consistent with the defendant's innocence.\n\nUnited States v. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir. 1997). Here, the\n\njury chose to believe the testimony of the witnesses for the\n\nprosecution, which is clearly sufficient on its face to uphold\n\nappellant's conviction.\n\n          Appellant's arguments require no further discussion.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons given, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
