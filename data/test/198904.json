Appellants Maritza Cruz-Erazo, Juan\n\nR. Gascot-Vázquez, Koral Gascot-Cruz, Juan R. Gascot-Cruz, and\n\nKassandra Jaanai Gascot-Cruz allege that appellees police officers\n\nCarlos Javier Rivera-Montañez, Cari Ruiz-Mcanallen, Humberto Thillet-\n\nGuzmán, Héctor Quiñones, Héctor Morales-Silva, and John Doe, in their\n\nindividual and official capacities, engaged in ongoing harassment and\n\nintimidation of appellants in violation of their rights to due process\n\nof law.   The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that\n\nappellants had failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nAlthough we find appellees' alleged conduct disgraceful, it does not\n\nsufficiently \"shock the conscience\" so as to state a claim under §\n\n1983. Because this is the only argument advanced on appeal, we affirm\n\nthe decision of the district court.\n\nI.   FACTS\n\n             The following is a summary of the facts alleged in\n\nappellants' complaint, presented in the light most favorable to the\n\nappellants. Our summary largely tracks that of the district court.\n\nSee Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montañez, Civ. No. 97-1758, slip op. at 3\n\n(D.P.R. Mar. 31, 1999) (hereinafter \"Opinion\").\n\n             On September 3, 1995, appellant Cruz-Erazo was approached by\n\nappellees Ruiz-Mcanallen and her husband Rivera-Montañez. Stating that\n\nthey were concerned about the oncoming Hurricane Luis, Ruiz-Mcanallen\n\nand Rivera-Montañez asked Cruz-Erazo whether they could store some\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fpersonal property at an unoccupied house owned by Cruz-Erazo and her\n\nhusband, appellant Gascot-Vázquez. Cruz-Erazo agreed and gave Ruiz-\n\nMcanallen and Rivera-Montañez a key to the house, which was located on\n\nSan Gregorio Street in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\n          For approximately four months following Hurricane Luis, Cruz-\n\nErazo tried on several occasions to retrieve the key to the house from\n\nappellees, without success. She eventually learned that Ruiz-Mcanallen\n\nand Rivera-Montañez were not merely storing items at the house but\n\nactually residing there with a third person. When Cruz-Erazo went to\n\nthe house to confront appellees, Ruiz-Mcanallen told her that if she\n\n\"did not like the situation[,] she could call the police, but Officer\n\nRivera[-Montañez] told her to remember that he was a member of the\n\nforce.\"\n\n          Cruz-Erazo sought the assistance of a local district\n\nattorney, who advised her to file a complaint for damages. However,\n\nwhen she went to the police station, the officers there refused to\n\naccept the complaint when they learned that it was against fellow\n\npolice officers.\n\n          Cruz-Erazo next sought the advice of a local judge, who\n\ninformed her that nothing prevented her, as the legitimate owner of the\n\nhouse, from retaking possession and changing the locks, etc. When\n\nCruz-Erazo then returned to the district attorney's office, she was\n\ntold that the office would not involve itself in civil matters and that\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fshe should retain counsel to help her resolve the situation. Cruz-\n\nErazo then went to another courthouse, where she spoke with a marshal\n\non duty and with yet another judge, who confirmed that, as rightful\n\nowner of the property, she could lawfully enter the house and change\n\nthe locks.\n\n          On the morning of January 5, 1996, appellant Cruz-Erazo\n\ncalled the Bayamón South police precinct and requested that the police\n\nwitness her entrance into the house on San Gregorio Street. She was\n\ntold that a Sergeant Díaz would meet her at her home.        Instead,\n\nhowever, appellees Thillet-Guzmán and Quiñones, from the Bayamón North\n\nprecinct, appeared at appellants' home. This raised suspicions with\n\nCruz-Erazo, who asked her husband to accompany her to the house and to\n\nbring a camera.\n\n          Once at the San Gregorio Street residence, Officers\n\nThillet-Guzmán and Quiñones refused to accompany Cruz-Erazo into the\n\nhouse. Cruz-Erazo tried to phone Sergeant Díaz, but she was unable to\n\nreach him and decided to enter the house anyway. Once inside, she\n\nremoved some blinds and other items belonging to her and her husband,\n\nand she changed the locks. When Cruz-Erazo and her husband tried to\n\ndrive away from the house, appellee Ruiz-Mcanallen and her son stood in\n\nthe road to block their way and began to insult and threaten them.\n\nDuring this exchange, Officer Thillet-Guzmán approached Cruz-Erazo and\n\ntold her \"this won't end here.\"\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          That same day Cruz-Erazo received a citation for disturbing\n\nthe peace from appellee Rivera-Montañez, apparently in response to the\n\nday's events on San Gregorio Street. Cruz-Erazo and her husband also\n\nfiled a complaint against Ruiz-Mcanallen's son for disturbing the\n\npeace, but no action was ever taken on it.\n\n          Two days later, on January 7, 1996, appellants were informed\n\nthat the new locks on the San Gregorio Street house had been broken.\n\nCruz-Erazo drove to the house and photographed the broken padlocks and\n\nthen proceeded to the police station to file a complaint for burglary.\n\nOnce there, she was told by a supervising officer that her complaint\n\ncould not be accepted \"because that house belongs to Officer Carlos J.\n\nRivera Montañez.\" Cruz-Erazo was then informed that an assistant\n\ndistrict attorney had apparently ordered that the locks be broken to\n\nreturn possession of the house to Rivera-Montañez. When Cruz-Erazo\n\nwent to the district attorney's office to file a complaint, she was\n\nordered to leave the office. Cruz-Erazo then went to the Bayamón South\n\nprecinct, where she waited for several hours before she was informed\n\nthat charges of burglary and disturbing the peace had been filed\n\nagainst her for entering the San Gregorio Street residence.\n\n          On February 1, 1996, Cruz-Erazo was informed by a neighbor\n\nthat there was a strange car parked in front of the San Gregorio Street\n\nresidence and that the porch door was open. Cruz-Erazo called 911 and\n\naccompanied the responding officers to the house. While the officers\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fwere inspecting the property, appellee Ruiz-Mcanallen and her son\n\narrived. Ruiz-Mcanallen claimed that she was renting the house, but\n\nwhen pressed for the name of the person to whom she paid rent, she told\n\nCruz-Erazo to talk to Officer Quiñones if she wanted to collect rent.\n\n           The following day an individual claiming to be an off-duty\n\npolice officer arrived at Cruz-Erazo's home and ordered her to appear\n\nin the Bayamón North precinct (without giving more reasons). She\n\nrefused.\n\n           During the following weeks, appellants allege that they\n\nsuffered continuing harassment by appellees. They received a number of\n\nthreatening phone calls, many of which threatened physical violence\n\nagainst Cruz-Erazo. Patrol cars passed the house frequently, at least\n\nonce a night, and on one occasion Officer Rivera-Montañez appeared at\n\nthe door and threateningly asked Gascot-Vázquez if his daughter was\n\n\"the light of his life.\" At one point, Cruz-Erazo went to the FBI in\n\nsearch of assistance, and a call from an agent to the local police\n\nsucceeded in temporarily halting the harassment.\n\n           On February 14, 1996, appellee Morales-Silva served Cruz-\n\nErazo with a citation to appear in court on February 20, 1996 to face\n\nthe burglary charges against her.\n\n           On February 19, 1996, appellee Rivera-Montañez was served\n\nwith notice of an eviction action initiated against him by Cruz-Erazo\n\nand Gascot-Vázquez. Rivera-Montañez called Cruz-Erazo at home and\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthreatened that \"she would pay for having him served.\" The next day,\n\nFebruary 20, 1996, Officer Rivera-Montañez appeared at Cruz-Erazo's\n\nhome and insulted her and \"called into question her honor.\" Although\n\nCruz-Erazo ignored his comments and went inside, her pregnant daughter,\n\nKoral Gascot-Cruz objected to Rivera-Montañez's comments and asked him\n\nto leave. The officer insulted her and pushed her out of the way as he\n\nleft. Appellants allege that \"two days later, Mrs. Gascot Cruz lost\n\nher baby, apparently because the placenta was detached from the womb.\"\n\nThe eviction suit was heard that same day and resolved in favor of\n\nCruz-Erazo and Gascot-Vázquez.\n\n          Also on February 20, 1996, Cruz-Erazo appeared at the Bayamón\n\ncourthouse to face the burglary charges against her. She was told that\n\nthe judge was at lunch, and she left the courthouse for a short period.\n\nIn her absence, the judge heard testimony from Officers Rivera-Montañez\n\nand Ruiz-Mcanallen and received sworn statements from Officers\n\nThillet-Guzmán and Quiñones.     On the basis of such evidence, and\n\nwithout hearing from Cruz-Erazo, the judge ordered her arrest and\n\nposted bail at $50,000. When Cruz-Erazo was informed of this, she\n\ninitially refused to post bail, but she reconsidered when a friend\n\noverheard appellee Officer Morales-Silva on the telephone saying that\n\nthey had finally gotten \"the troublemaker\" and suggesting that she\n\nwould be murdered on her way to the jail. Cruz-Erazo was booked and\n\nfingerprinted, although at least one officer assigned to the task\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\frefused to fingerprint her, saying that he did not want to participate\n\nin such a miscarriage of justice.\n\n          A preliminary hearing was held in the burglary action on May\n\n14, 1996. Officer Thillet-Guzmán testified that he had seen Cruz-Erazo\n\nremove property from the San Gregorio Street residence, although he did\n\nnot explain why he did not arrest her if he considered it a burglary in\n\nprogress. Officer Rivera-Montañez also testified, but he was unable to\n\nprovide any evidence whatsoever of a right to occupy the San Gregorio\n\nStreet house. When the court asked Rivera-Montañez why he should be\n\nbelieved, he responded simply that he was a police officer and that the\n\npolice always tell the truth.     Cruz-Erazo presented substantial\n\nevidence that she and her husband owned the property, including the\n\ndeed and an appraisal, and the judge ordered the burglary charges\n\ndismissed.\n\n          After this ordeal, appellants moved for a time to South\n\nCarolina, but they eventually returned to Puerto Rico and filed this\n\naction. Since their return, appellants allege that appellees Rivera-\n\nMontañez and Ruiz-Mcanallen have intentionally driven past their home,\n\npossibly as an attempt to intimidate appellants.\n\nII.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          Appellants' complaint, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nasserted two causes of action. The first claimed that appellees had\n\nviolated appellants' \"Fourteenth Amendment right to due process when\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthey deliberately lied in official documents and perjured themselves in\n\nofficial court proceedings with the intention of causing plaintiffs\n\nharm.\" The second cause of action stated a claim under the Civil Code\n\nand Constitution of Puerto Rico, essentially for malicious prosecution.\n\n          Appellees Morales-Silva, Quiñones, and Thillet-Guzmán moved\n\nfor dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), claiming\n\nthat appellants had failed to \"prove\" a claim under § 1983, that they\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity, and that the action was barred by\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment. Although the court noted that appellees had\n\nnot explicitly argued that the complaint failed to state a cause of\n\naction (as opposed to proving a claim), it nevertheless accepted the\n\nappellees' position and dismissed the complaint as against all\n\ndefendants.1\n\n          The district court first stated that appellants' complaint\n\ncould be construed as presenting a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nfor malicious prosecution. The court rejected such claim, however,\n\ncorrectly noting that \"[t]here is no substantive due process right\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from malicious prosecution.\"\n\nOpinion at 7 (citing Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d\n\n\n1 Oddly enough, appellees Rivera-Montañez and Ruiz-Mcanallen have filed\nno documents with this Court, nor has any counsel made an appearance on\ntheir behalf (nor does the Appendix filed on appeal bear any indication\nof their participation before the trial court). However, because we\naffirm the district court's determination that appellants have failed\nto state a claim, the nonparticipation of appellees Rivera-Montañez and\nRuiz-Mcanallen makes no difference to our consideration of the case.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f249, 256 (1st Cir. 1996)). The court noted that a constitutional\n\nmalicious prosecution claim might arise under the Fourth Amendment, but\n\nheld that such a Fourth Amendment claim had not been raised by\n\nappellants. See id. (citing Meehan v. Town of Plymouth, 167 F.3d 85,\n\n88 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n           The court then proceeded to a more general § 1983 analysis.\n\nThe court found that appellants had not alleged sufficient causation\n\nbetween appellant Gascot-Cruz's miscarriage and the appellees' alleged\n\nactions.   The court also found that the other allegations of\n\nintimidation and harassment did not rise to the level of a\n\nconstitutional deprivation actionable under § 1983, because they did\n\nnot \"amount to a deprivation of [appellants'] liberty interest\" nor\n\n\"rise to a level of intrusion that would 'shock the conscience.'\" See\n\nid. at 11. The court therefore dismissed appellants' federal claims,\n\nas well as their supplemental state law claims. Appellants timely\n\nappealed, and we now affirm the decision of the district court.\n\nIII.   LAW AND APPLICATION\n\n           We review the district court's dismissal for failure to state\n\na claim de novo. See, e.g., Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 424 (1st Cir.\n\n1995). The question before us is whether, when viewing the allegations\n\nin appellants' complaint in the light most favorable to appellants,\n\ntheir complaint states a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. As is well\n\nestablished, § 1983 creates no independent substantive rights, but\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\frather provides a cause of action by which individuals may seek money\n\ndamages for governmental violations of rights protected by federal law.\n\nSee, e.g., Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 811 (1994). Hence the\n\nrequirement that, to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must\n\nallege (1) the violation of a right protected by the Constitution or\n\nlaws of the United States and (2) that the perpetrator of the violation\n\nwas acting under color of law. See, e.g., Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d\n\n3, 6 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535\n\n(1981)).\n\n           Appellants' complaint alleges that \"Defendants violated\n\nPlaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law when they\n\ndeliberately lied in official documents and perjured themselves in\n\nofficial court proceedings with the intention of causing Plaintiffs\n\nharm.\" Counsel clarified at oral argument that appellants' claim is\n\nthat their substantive (rather than procedural) due process rights were\n\nviolated.2   As we have previously stated:\n\n           There are two theories under which a plaintiff\n           may bring a substantive due process claim. Under\n           the first, a plaintiff must demonstrate a\n\n\n2 Although the district court mentioned the possibility of a Fourth\nAmendment claim on the facts alleged in the complaint, and although\nthis possibility was raised by the Court at oral argument, we need not\nventure into this subject because the appellants failed to raise any\nFourth Amendment theory of recovery before the district court or in\ntheir brief on appeal, and have therefore waived any such claim. See,\ne.g., Rivera-Gómez, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"[A] litigant\nhas an obligation 'to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly'\nor else forever hold its peace.\" (citation omitted)).\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          deprivation of an identified liberty or property\n          interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n          Under the second, a plaintiff is not required to\n          prove the deprivation of a specific liberty or\n          property interest, but, rather, he must prove\n          that the state's conduct \"shocks the conscience.\"\n\nBrown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Productions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 531 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (citations omitted); see Pittsley, 927 F.3d at 6. Because\n\nappellants have not specified any particular constitutionally protected\n\ninterest of which they were deprived by appellees' actions,3 we will\n\nfollow the parties' lead and focus our inquiry on the second theory.\n\n          We have used various phrases to describe when state action\n\n\"shocks the conscience\" in the context of substantive due process.\n\n          It has been said, for instance, that substantive\n          due process protects individuals against state\n          actions which are \"arbitrary and capricious,\" or\n          those that run counter to \"the concept of ordered\n          liberty,\" or those which, in context, appear\n          \"shocking or violative of universal standards of\n          decency.\"\n\nAmsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 753-54 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations\n\nomitted). We have insisted that \"before a constitutional infringement\n\n\n\n3 As the Court mentioned at oral argument, the facts alleged in the\ncomplaint might appear to support an argument that appellants were\ndeprived of a property interest, insofar as Ruiz-Mcanallen and Rivera-\nMontañez took possession of the San Gregorio Street residence and\nretained such possession with the aid of other appellees. However,\nhere again, appellants have entirely failed to articulate such a claim.\nThis \"property interest\" theory was not raised by the appellants in\ntheir memoranda before the district court nor in their briefs submitted\nto this Court; we think neither court is obliged to dream up and\narticulate appellants' arguments for them. See Rivera-Gómez, 843 F.2d\nat 635 (cited in footnote 2, supra).\n\n                                 -13-\n\foccurs, state action must in and of itself be egregiously unacceptable,\n\noutrageous, or conscience-shocking,\" id. at 754, and noted the Supreme\n\nCourt's admonition that \"the activities complained of must 'do more\n\nthan offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism,'\"\n\nPittsley, 927 F.2d at 7 (quoting Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165,\n\n172 (1952)). Although the cases in which we have found governmental\n\nconduct to shock the conscience have often involved state action that\n\nwas highly physically intrusive, see Hot, Sexy & Safer Productions, 68\n\nF.3d at 531 (and cases cited therein), we have pointedly left open the\n\npossibility that verbal or other less physical harassment such as that\n\nalleged by appellants might rise to a conscience-shocking level, see\n\nid. at 532; Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 427 (1st Cir. 1995); Pittsley,\n\n927 F.2d at 7 n.3.\n\n          The question now before the Court is whether the particular\n\nconduct alleged by appellants in this case was so egregious that it can\n\nproperly be said, under these circumstances, to shock the conscience.\n\nWe find the question to be a close one,4 as the alleged facts seem to\n\nfall in between the extremes of conduct which have previously been\n\nfound to shock or not to shock the judicial conscience. See County of\n\n\n4 We might add that our task is made more difficult by the substandard\nlegal memoranda filed before this Court and the district court.\nAppellants' briefs are long on rhetoric but woefully short on legal\nsubstance. Although appellants allege an ongoing scheme of disgraceful\nconduct by appellees, the Court has been left largely to its own\ndevices to try and connect these factual allegations to any viable\nlegal theory of recovery.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 883, 848 (1998) (\"[T]he constitutional\n\nconcept of conscience-shocking . . . points clearly away from\n\nliability, or clearly toward it, only at the ends of the tort law's\n\nspectrum of culpability.\"). For instance, conscience-shocking state\n\naction has been found where a suspect's stomach was forcibly pumped to\n\nobtain evidence, see Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952), and\n\nwhere a suspended police officer was required to undergo a penile\n\nplethysmograph as a condition of reinstatement, see Harrington v. Almy,\n\n977 F.2d 37, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1992). On the other hand, we have found\n\nno constitutional violation where public school students were required\n\nto attend a sexually explicit AIDS awareness assembly, see Hot, Sexy\n\nand Safer Productions, 68 F.3d at 532, or where an inmate was injured\n\nafter slipping on a pillow negligently left in a stairwell by a deputy\n\nsheriff, see Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986).\n\n          Some cases, of course, have addressed the hazier middle\n\nground, such as Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423 (1st Cir. 1995), in which we\n\nfound no due process violation when a murder suspect committed suicide\n\nafter prosecutors encouraged the media to link him to a series of\n\nmurders. While we lamented the conduct of the prosecutors in that\n\ncase, we held that the facts alleged simply did not rise to the level\n\nof conscience-shocking conduct. See id. at 427. In another case,\n\nGrendell v. Gilway, 974 F. Supp. 46 (D. Me. 1997), the district court\n\nfound that the behavior of the police \"shocked the conscience\" when an\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fofficer lied to and threatened an eleven-year-old girl in order to\n\nextract incriminating information about the suspected drug use of her\n\nparents. The court noted our decisions in Souza and Pittsley and\n\ndetermined that, although we had never found a constitutional violation\n\nunder similar circumstances, neither had we foreclosed the possibility\n\nthat verbal harassment and intimidation could violate due process. See\n\nid. at 51. Emphasizing that the officer's behavior struck at \"the\n\nbasic fabric of all parent-child relations: love, trust, and faith,\"\n\nthe district court determined that the alleged misconduct, if proven,\n\nwould violate a right protected by the Due Process Clause. See id. at\n\n52.\n\n          Perhaps the case with facts most similar to those alleged by\n\nplaintiffs is Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3 (1st Cir. 1991). In that\n\ncase, the defendant police officers allegedly threatened to kill Ms.\n\nPittsley on more than one occasion, told Ms. Pittsley's four- and ten-\n\nyear-old children that if the police caught their father the children\n\nwould never see him again, and also refused to allow the children to\n\ngive the father a goodbye hug when he was arrested. Although the Court\n\nrefused to condone such \"despicable and wrongful\" harassment, it held\n\nthat the conduct did not rise to the level of a constitutional\n\nviolation.   See id. at 7.\n\n          Although each determination of whether state conduct \"shocks\n\nthe conscience\" is necessarily fact-specific and unique to the\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fparticular circumstances in which the conduct occurred, we think that\n\nour precedents steer us toward the conclusion that appellants have\n\nfailed to articulate a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. The\n\nmajority of the conduct alleged by appellants was not physically\n\nintrusive or violent, nor did it \"strike at the basic fabric\" of any\n\nprotected relationship, such as the parent-child relationship in\n\nGrendell. In fact, we find appellants' allegations largely comparable\n\nto those presented in Pittsley, and appellants have offered us no basis\n\nwhatsoever for finding that precedent distinguishable, nor have they\n\noffered any substantive argument or explanation to justify the unusual\n\nstep of finding a violation of substantive due process. As in previous\n\ndecisions, we expressly leave open the question of whether verbal\n\nharassment and intimidation of this general type might, under\n\nappropriate circumstances, be found to violate due process. We simply\n\nhold that appellants have failed to state such a claim in this case.\n\n          Given our conclusion that the conduct alleged by appellants\n\ndoes not sufficiently shock the conscience so as to violate substantive\n\ndue process, we need not reach the question of whether such conduct was\n\n\"under color of law.\" Nor do we reach the appellees' assertion of\n\nqualified immunity, although we note that the defense seems, at least\n\nat first glance, inappropriate in a case such as this where the conduct\n\nis alleged to be an intentional abuse of official power. We also agree\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fwith the district court that, absent a federal claim, appellants' state\n\nlaw claims are properly left for the consideration of the local courts.5\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of appellants' complaint for failure to state a claim\n\nfor which relief could be granted.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n5 We are not deaf to appellants' counsel's plea that the conduct\nalleged in this case warrants some form of judicial reprimand. Today\nwe hold only that the alleged conduct does not sufficiently \"shock the\nconscience\" so as to violate substantive due process. Because this is\nthe only argument that appellants have advanced on appeal, we affirm\nthe order of the district court. However, counsel offered at argument\nthat, in the event of an unsuccessful appeal, appellants \"can and will\"\nproceed with their case in the local courts. We do not suggest that\nappellants have no viable claims under state law (or perhaps even under\nthe Fourth Amendment), and we trust that the local courts will ably\njudge those claims if they are, in fact, brought.\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

Appellants Maritza Cruz-Erazo, Juan\n\nR. Gascot-Vázquez, Koral Gascot-Cruz, Juan R. Gascot-Cruz, and\n\nKassandra Jaanai Gascot-Cruz allege that appellees police officers\n\nCarlos Javier Rivera-Montañez, Cari Ruiz-Mcanallen, Humberto Thillet-\n\nGuzmán, Héctor Quiñones, Héctor Morales-Silva, and John Doe, in their\n\nindividual and official capacities, engaged in ongoing harassment and\n\nintimidation of appellants in violation of their rights to due process\n\nof law.   The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that\n\nappellants had failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nAlthough we find appellees' alleged conduct disgraceful, it does not\n\nsufficiently \"shock the conscience\" so as to state a claim under §\n\n1983. Because this is the only argument advanced on appeal, we affirm\n\nthe decision of the district court.\n\nI.   FACTS\n\n             The following is a summary of the facts alleged in\n\nappellants' complaint, presented in the light most favorable to the\n\nappellants. Our summary largely tracks that of the district court.\n\nSee Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montañez, Civ. No. 97-1758, slip op. at 3\n\n(D.P.R. Mar. 31, 1999) (hereinafter \"Opinion\").\n\n             On September 3, 1995, appellant Cruz-Erazo was approached by\n\nappellees Ruiz-Mcanallen and her husband Rivera-Montañez. Stating that\n\nthey were concerned about the oncoming Hurricane Luis, Ruiz-Mcanallen\n\nand Rivera-Montañez asked Cruz-Erazo whether they could store some\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fpersonal property at an unoccupied house owned by Cruz-Erazo and her\n\nhusband, appellant Gascot-Vázquez. Cruz-Erazo agreed and gave Ruiz-\n\nMcanallen and Rivera-Montañez a key to the house, which was located on\n\nSan Gregorio Street in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\n          For approximately four months following Hurricane Luis, Cruz-\n\nErazo tried on several occasions to retrieve the key to the house from\n\nappellees, without success. She eventually learned that Ruiz-Mcanallen\n\nand Rivera-Montañez were not merely storing items at the house but\n\nactually residing there with a third person. When Cruz-Erazo went to\n\nthe house to confront appellees, Ruiz-Mcanallen told her that if she\n\n\"did not like the situation[,] she could call the police, but Officer\n\nRivera[-Montañez] told her to remember that he was a member of the\n\nforce.\"\n\n          Cruz-Erazo sought the assistance of a local district\n\nattorney, who advised her to file a complaint for damages. However,\n\nwhen she went to the police station, the officers there refused to\n\naccept the complaint when they learned that it was against fellow\n\npolice officers.\n\n          Cruz-Erazo next sought the advice of a local judge, who\n\ninformed her that nothing prevented her, as the legitimate owner of the\n\nhouse, from retaking possession and changing the locks, etc. When\n\nCruz-Erazo then returned to the district attorney's office, she was\n\ntold that the office would not involve itself in civil matters and that\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fshe should retain counsel to help her resolve the situation. Cruz-\n\nErazo then went to another courthouse, where she spoke with a marshal\n\non duty and with yet another judge, who confirmed that, as rightful\n\nowner of the property, she could lawfully enter the house and change\n\nthe locks.\n\n          On the morning of January 5, 1996, appellant Cruz-Erazo\n\ncalled the Bayamón South police precinct and requested that the police\n\nwitness her entrance into the house on San Gregorio Street. She was\n\ntold that a Sergeant Díaz would meet her at her home.        Instead,\n\nhowever, appellees Thillet-Guzmán and Quiñones, from the Bayamón North\n\nprecinct, appeared at appellants' home. This raised suspicions with\n\nCruz-Erazo, who asked her husband to accompany her to the house and to\n\nbring a camera.\n\n          Once at the San Gregorio Street residence, Officers\n\nThillet-Guzmán and Quiñones refused to accompany Cruz-Erazo into the\n\nhouse. Cruz-Erazo tried to phone Sergeant Díaz, but she was unable to\n\nreach him and decided to enter the house anyway. Once inside, she\n\nremoved some blinds and other items belonging to her and her husband,\n\nand she changed the locks. When Cruz-Erazo and her husband tried to\n\ndrive away from the house, appellee Ruiz-Mcanallen and her son stood in\n\nthe road to block their way and began to insult and threaten them.\n\nDuring this exchange, Officer Thillet-Guzmán approached Cruz-Erazo and\n\ntold her \"this won't end here.\"\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          That same day Cruz-Erazo received a citation for disturbing\n\nthe peace from appellee Rivera-Montañez, apparently in response to the\n\nday's events on San Gregorio Street. Cruz-Erazo and her husband also\n\nfiled a complaint against Ruiz-Mcanallen's son for disturbing the\n\npeace, but no action was ever taken on it.\n\n          Two days later, on January 7, 1996, appellants were informed\n\nthat the new locks on the San Gregorio Street house had been broken.\n\nCruz-Erazo drove to the house and photographed the broken padlocks and\n\nthen proceeded to the police station to file a complaint for burglary.\n\nOnce there, she was told by a supervising officer that her complaint\n\ncould not be accepted \"because that house belongs to Officer Carlos J.\n\nRivera Montañez.\" Cruz-Erazo was then informed that an assistant\n\ndistrict attorney had apparently ordered that the locks be broken to\n\nreturn possession of the house to Rivera-Montañez. When Cruz-Erazo\n\nwent to the district attorney's office to file a complaint, she was\n\nordered to leave the office. Cruz-Erazo then went to the Bayamón South\n\nprecinct, where she waited for several hours before she was informed\n\nthat charges of burglary and disturbing the peace had been filed\n\nagainst her for entering the San Gregorio Street residence.\n\n          On February 1, 1996, Cruz-Erazo was informed by a neighbor\n\nthat there was a strange car parked in front of the San Gregorio Street\n\nresidence and that the porch door was open. Cruz-Erazo called 911 and\n\naccompanied the responding officers to the house. While the officers\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fwere inspecting the property, appellee Ruiz-Mcanallen and her son\n\narrived. Ruiz-Mcanallen claimed that she was renting the house, but\n\nwhen pressed for the name of the person to whom she paid rent, she told\n\nCruz-Erazo to talk to Officer Quiñones if she wanted to collect rent.\n\n           The following day an individual claiming to be an off-duty\n\npolice officer arrived at Cruz-Erazo's home and ordered her to appear\n\nin the Bayamón North precinct (without giving more reasons). She\n\nrefused.\n\n           During the following weeks, appellants allege that they\n\nsuffered continuing harassment by appellees. They received a number of\n\nthreatening phone calls, many of which threatened physical violence\n\nagainst Cruz-Erazo. Patrol cars passed the house frequently, at least\n\nonce a night, and on one occasion Officer Rivera-Montañez appeared at\n\nthe door and threateningly asked Gascot-Vázquez if his daughter was\n\n\"the light of his life.\" At one point, Cruz-Erazo went to the FBI in\n\nsearch of assistance, and a call from an agent to the local police\n\nsucceeded in temporarily halting the harassment.\n\n           On February 14, 1996, appellee Morales-Silva served Cruz-\n\nErazo with a citation to appear in court on February 20, 1996 to face\n\nthe burglary charges against her.\n\n           On February 19, 1996, appellee Rivera-Montañez was served\n\nwith notice of an eviction action initiated against him by Cruz-Erazo\n\nand Gascot-Vázquez. Rivera-Montañez called Cruz-Erazo at home and\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthreatened that \"she would pay for having him served.\" The next day,\n\nFebruary 20, 1996, Officer Rivera-Montañez appeared at Cruz-Erazo's\n\nhome and insulted her and \"called into question her honor.\" Although\n\nCruz-Erazo ignored his comments and went inside, her pregnant daughter,\n\nKoral Gascot-Cruz objected to Rivera-Montañez's comments and asked him\n\nto leave. The officer insulted her and pushed her out of the way as he\n\nleft. Appellants allege that \"two days later, Mrs. Gascot Cruz lost\n\nher baby, apparently because the placenta was detached from the womb.\"\n\nThe eviction suit was heard that same day and resolved in favor of\n\nCruz-Erazo and Gascot-Vázquez.\n\n          Also on February 20, 1996, Cruz-Erazo appeared at the Bayamón\n\ncourthouse to face the burglary charges against her. She was told that\n\nthe judge was at lunch, and she left the courthouse for a short period.\n\nIn her absence, the judge heard testimony from Officers Rivera-Montañez\n\nand Ruiz-Mcanallen and received sworn statements from Officers\n\nThillet-Guzmán and Quiñones.     On the basis of such evidence, and\n\nwithout hearing from Cruz-Erazo, the judge ordered her arrest and\n\nposted bail at $50,000. When Cruz-Erazo was informed of this, she\n\ninitially refused to post bail, but she reconsidered when a friend\n\noverheard appellee Officer Morales-Silva on the telephone saying that\n\nthey had finally gotten \"the troublemaker\" and suggesting that she\n\nwould be murdered on her way to the jail. Cruz-Erazo was booked and\n\nfingerprinted, although at least one officer assigned to the task\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\frefused to fingerprint her, saying that he did not want to participate\n\nin such a miscarriage of justice.\n\n          A preliminary hearing was held in the burglary action on May\n\n14, 1996. Officer Thillet-Guzmán testified that he had seen Cruz-Erazo\n\nremove property from the San Gregorio Street residence, although he did\n\nnot explain why he did not arrest her if he considered it a burglary in\n\nprogress. Officer Rivera-Montañez also testified, but he was unable to\n\nprovide any evidence whatsoever of a right to occupy the San Gregorio\n\nStreet house. When the court asked Rivera-Montañez why he should be\n\nbelieved, he responded simply that he was a police officer and that the\n\npolice always tell the truth.     Cruz-Erazo presented substantial\n\nevidence that she and her husband owned the property, including the\n\ndeed and an appraisal, and the judge ordered the burglary charges\n\ndismissed.\n\n          After this ordeal, appellants moved for a time to South\n\nCarolina, but they eventually returned to Puerto Rico and filed this\n\naction. Since their return, appellants allege that appellees Rivera-\n\nMontañez and Ruiz-Mcanallen have intentionally driven past their home,\n\npossibly as an attempt to intimidate appellants.\n\nII.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          Appellants' complaint, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nasserted two causes of action. The first claimed that appellees had\n\nviolated appellants' \"Fourteenth Amendment right to due process when\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthey deliberately lied in official documents and perjured themselves in\n\nofficial court proceedings with the intention of causing plaintiffs\n\nharm.\" The second cause of action stated a claim under the Civil Code\n\nand Constitution of Puerto Rico, essentially for malicious prosecution.\n\n          Appellees Morales-Silva, Quiñones, and Thillet-Guzmán moved\n\nfor dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), claiming\n\nthat appellants had failed to \"prove\" a claim under § 1983, that they\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity, and that the action was barred by\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment. Although the court noted that appellees had\n\nnot explicitly argued that the complaint failed to state a cause of\n\naction (as opposed to proving a claim), it nevertheless accepted the\n\nappellees' position and dismissed the complaint as against all\n\ndefendants.1\n\n          The district court first stated that appellants' complaint\n\ncould be construed as presenting a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nfor malicious prosecution. The court rejected such claim, however,\n\ncorrectly noting that \"[t]here is no substantive due process right\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from malicious prosecution.\"\n\nOpinion at 7 (citing Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196677\"><a href=\"/opinion/196677/robson-v-hallenbeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"page\">1</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Oddly enough, appellees Rivera-Montañez and Ruiz-Mcanallen have filed\nno documents with this Court, nor has any counsel made an appearance on\ntheir behalf (nor does the Appendix filed on appeal bear any indication\nof their participation before the trial court). However, because we\naffirm the district court's determination that appellants have failed\nto state a claim, the nonparticipation of appellees Rivera-Montañez and\nRuiz-Mcanallen makes no difference to our consideration of the case.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f249, 256 (1st Cir. 1996)). The court noted that a constitutional\n\nmalicious prosecution claim might arise under the Fourth Amendment, but\n\nheld that such a Fourth Amendment claim had not been raised by\n\nappellants. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196677\"><a href=\"/opinion/196677/robson-v-hallenbeck/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> (citing Meehan </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">v. Town of Plymouth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761518\"><a href=\"/opinion/761518/joseph-a-meehan-v-town-of-plymouth/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n88 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n           The court then proceeded to a more general § 1983 analysis.\n\nThe court found that appellants had not alleged sufficient causation\n\nbetween appellant Gascot-Cruz's miscarriage and the appellees' alleged\n\nactions.   The court also found that the other allegations of\n\nintimidation and harassment did not rise to the level of a\n\nconstitutional deprivation actionable under § 1983, because they did\n\nnot \"amount to a deprivation of [appellants'] liberty interest\" nor\n\n\"rise to a level of intrusion that would 'shock the conscience.'\" See\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 11. </span><pre class=\"inline\">The court therefore dismissed appellants' federal claims,\n\nas well as their supplemental state law claims. Appellants timely\n\nappealed, and we now affirm the decision of the district court.\n\nIII.   LAW AND APPLICATION\n\n           We review the district court's dismissal for failure to state\n\na claim de novo. See, e.g., Souza v. Pina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196042\"><a href=\"/opinion/196042/souza-v-pina/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (1st Cir.\n\n1995). The question before us is whether, when viewing the allegations\n\nin appellants' complaint in the light most favorable to appellants,\n\ntheir complaint states a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. As is well\n\nestablished, § 1983 creates no independent substantive rights, but\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\frather provides a cause of action by which individuals may seek money\n\ndamages for governmental violations of rights protected by federal law.\n\nSee, e.g., Albright v. Oliver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112924\"><a href=\"/opinion/112924/albright-v-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (1994). Hence the\n\nrequirement that, to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must\n\nallege (1) the violation of a right protected by the Constitution or\n\nlaws of the United States and (2) that the perpetrator of the violation\n\nwas acting under color of law. See, e.g., Pittsley v.

The\n\nmajority of the conduct alleged by appellants was not physically\n\nintrusive or violent, nor did it \"strike at the basic fabric\" of any\n\nprotected relationship, such as the parent-child relationship in\n\nGrendell. In fact, we find appellants' allegations largely comparable\n\nto those presented in Pittsley, and appellants have offered us no basis\n\nwhatsoever for finding that precedent distinguishable, nor have they\n\noffered any substantive argument or explanation to justify the unusual\n\nstep of finding a violation of substantive due process. As in previous\n\ndecisions, we expressly leave open the question of whether verbal\n\nharassment and intimidation of this general type might, under\n\nappropriate circumstances, be found to violate due process. We simply\n\nhold that appellants have failed to state such a claim in this case.\n\n          Given our conclusion that the conduct alleged by appellants\n\ndoes not sufficiently shock the conscience so as to violate substantive\n\ndue process, we need not reach the question of whether such conduct was\n\n\"under color of law.\" Nor do we reach the appellees' assertion of\n\nqualified immunity, although we note that the defense seems, at least\n\nat first glance, inappropriate in a case such as this where the conduct\n\nis alleged to be an intentional abuse of official power. We also agree\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fwith the district court that, absent a federal claim, appellants' state\n\nlaw claims are properly left for the consideration of the local courts.5\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of appellants' complaint for failure to state a claim\n\nfor which relief could be granted.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n5 We are not deaf to appellants' counsel's plea that the conduct\nalleged in this case warrants some form of judicial reprimand. Today\nwe hold only that the alleged conduct does not sufficiently \"shock the\nconscience\" so as to violate substantive due process. Because this is\nthe only argument that appellants have advanced on appeal, we affirm\nthe order of the district court. However, counsel offered at argument\nthat, in the event of an unsuccessful appeal, appellants \"can and will\"\nproceed with their case in the local courts. We do not suggest that\nappellants have no viable claims under state law (or perhaps even under\nthe Fourth Amendment), and we trust that the local courts will ably\njudge those claims if they are, in fact, brought.\n\n                                 -18-\n\f</pre>",
