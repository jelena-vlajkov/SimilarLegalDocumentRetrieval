Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   John F. Sullivan on brief for appellant.\r\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C. Lockhart\r\nand Stephanie S. Browne, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 18, 2000\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   After a careful review of the record\r\nand the submissions of the parties, we affirm.\r\n          Appellant Cesar Cabrera (\"Cabrera\") contends his\r\nattorney below should have argued that Cabrera was subjected to\r\na de facto arrest unsupported by probable cause, so the\r\nevidence subsequently seized from his car should have been\r\nsuppressed (the record shows Cabrera's attorney did in fact\r\nadvance this argument, so we will assume he means his attorney\r\nshould have more fully developed the argument).  He also\r\ncontends that his attorney should have argued that a statement\r\nCabrera made during a consensual search of his car, in which he\r\nadmitted to ownership of the bag containing heroin, should have\r\nbeen suppressed because he had not yet been advised of his\r\nrights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).  Since\r\nthe district court held an evidentiary hearing, the factual\r\nrecord is fully developed and the only question presented is\r\nwhether counsel should have presented (or better developed)\r\nthese alternative legal theories.  In such a case, we may\r\nconsider ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct\r\nappeal.  United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.\r\n1991) (appellate court may elect to consider ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel claim on direct appeal \"where the\r\ncritical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is\r\nsufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an\r\neffective assistance claim\").\r\n          Cabrera's first ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nclaim fails because the substantive argument clearly would not\r\nhave succeeded.  See Vieux v. Pepe, 184 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.\r\n1999) (\"Obviously, counsel's performance was not deficient if\r\nhe declined to pursue a futile tactic.\").  At the point when\r\nthe officer removed Cabrera's keys from the ignition, he was,\r\naccording to the lower court's supportable factual findings,\r\nconducting a search to which Cabrera had consented.  Cabrera\r\ndoes not directly challenge those factual findings, but even if\r\nhe were to do so, we cannot see how he could establish clear\r\nerror.  See United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir.\r\n1999) (\"Where evaluations of witnesses' credibility are\r\nconcerned, we are especially deferential to the district\r\ncourt's judgment . . . .\").  Further, even if Cabrera had not\r\nconsented to a search at that point, the officer would have\r\nbeen entitled to continue detaining Cabrera under Terry v.\r\nOhio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), given Cabrera's evasive and\r\ninconsistent answers to the officer's questions and his\r\nexcessively disproportionate nervous response.\r\n          Cabrera's contention that his attorney should have\r\nargued for suppression of the statement made during the search\r\nalso fails.  Cabrera was not in custody at the time, so the\r\nargument would have been futile.  See Jones, 187 F.3d at 217-\r\n18.\r\n          Cabrera makes other vague allegations that his\r\ncounsel failed to communicate effectively, failed to brief\r\nfully the suppression motion, and failed to investigate.  To\r\nthe extent these claims are understandable, the factual record\r\ndoes not support any of them to the extent necessary to show\r\nineffective assistance.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n",
