On April 5, 2000 a complaint was filed in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by eleven\n\nindividuals alleging that as citizens of the United States residing in\n\nPuerto Rico they are being deprived of the right to vote for the\n\ncandidates to the offices of President and Vice-President of the United\n\nStates, a condition which they view to be a \"violation of their\n\nconstitutional rights to the same privileges and immunities, treaty\n\nrights, due process and equal protection of the laws\" enjoyed by United\n\nStates citizens residing in the States.\n\n          Plaintiffs, in effect, comprise two separate groups. The\n\nfirst includes individuals who have always resided in Puerto Rico and\n\nwhose claim is based on their alleged right to vote for the national\n\noffices in question because they consider it a right inherent in United\n\nStates citizenship. The second group is comprised of former residents\n\nof states who were eligible to vote during such residence in the States\n\nbut became ineligible to do so upon taking residency in Puerto Rico.\n\nBoth groups claim entitlement to vote pursuant to the Constitution of\n\nthe United States and pursuant to treaty obligations assumed by the\n\nUnited States under the International Covenant on Civil and Political\n\nRights, U.N.T.S. No. 14668, Vol. 999 (1976) p. 171, ratified, 138 Cong.\n\nRec. S-4781 (April 2, 1992) (\"ICCPR\"). In addition, the second group\n\nalso calls into question the constitutionality of the Uniformed and\n\nOverseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (NOCAVA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973ff-\n\n1973ff-6, which allows United States citizens residing outside the\n\nUnited States to vote in federal elections as absentee voters in their\n\nlast state of residence. Because Puerto Rico is included within the\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdefinition of \"United States,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff-6(8), residents of\n\nPuerto Rico who would otherwise qualify to vote pursuant to this\n\nstatute are disqualified. This is claimed to be a violation of various\n\nconstitutional provisions.\n\n          Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment against the United\n\nStates affirming the invalidity of the denial of their alleged right to\n\nvote for the national offices in question. In addition, they sought an\n\norder requiring the United States \"to take all the necessary steps\" to\n\nimplement their alleged right to vote for President and Vice-President.\n\n          On June 5, 2000 the United States moved to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint claiming, in substance, that the allegations contained in the\n\ncomplaint \"are virtually identical to those previously brought by\n\neleven individuals, including [Plaintiff] Igartua in the case of\n\nIgartua de la Rosa, et al. v. United States, C. 91-2506,\" in which the\n\nDistrict Court (Acosta, J.) dismissed plaintiffs' request for\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief for failure to state a claim upon\n\nwhich relief could be granted. See Igartua v. United States, 842\n\nF. Supp. 607 (D. P.R. 1994), aff'd, 32 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1994),\n\n(Igartua I), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1049 (1995). The United States\n\nalleged that Igartua I required dismissal of the present action under\n\nthe principles of res judicata and stare decisis.\n\n          This motion was denied by the District Court on July 19, 2000\n\nin an extensive opinion, see Igartua v. United States, 107 F. Supp. 2d\n\n140 (D. P.R. 2000) ( Igartua II), in which it ruled that the provisions\n\nof the ICCPR were not self-executing and thus did not give rise to\n\nprivately enforceable rights under United States law, and further that\n\n                                 -4-\n\fNOCAVA did not violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. It ruled,\n\nhowever, that preventing plaintiffs from voting in presidential and\n\nvice-presidential elections was unconstitutional.\n\n          Thereafter, on July 27, 2000 the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nand its governor, Pedro Rosselló, moved to intervene in this action, in\n\neffect supporting the claims of Plaintiffs. This intervention was\n\nallowed by the district court on July 28, 2000.\n\n          On August 1, 2000 the United States filed its Answer,\n\nalleging in defense substantially the same grounds as claimed in its\n\nMotion to Dismiss, and in addition contending that the issues presented\n\nby plaintiffs raised \"political questions outside the jurisdiction of\n\nthe federal courts.\"\n\n          After several intervening procedural events, on August 29,\n\n2000 the district court entered a Final Opinion and Order, essentially\n\nconfirming its July 29 opinion, and entering a Final Judgment:\n\n(1) Declaring \"that the United States Citizens residing in Puerto Rico\n\nhave the right to vote in Presidential elections and that its electoral\n\nvotes must be counted in Congress\";\n\n(2) Concluding \"that the Government of Puerto Rico has the obligation\n\nto organize the means by which the United States citizens residing in\n\nPuerto Rico will vote in the upcoming and subsequent Presidential\n\nelections and to provide for the appointment of Presidential electors,\"\n\nand ordering \"the Government of Puerto Rico to act with all possible\n\nexpediency to create such mechanism;\" and\n\n(3) Ordering \"the Government of Puerto Rico to inform the Court of all\n\ndevelopments related to its implementation of the Presidential vote\n\n                                 -5-\n\funtil the votes are counted pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment to the\n\nConstitution.\"\n\n          On September 10, 2000 the Legislature of Puerto Rico enacted\n\nLaw No. 403 for the purpose of allowing the citizens of the United\n\nStates of America domiciled in Puerto Rico to vote in the election for\n\nthe offices of President and Vice-President of the United States, and\n\nto establish the procedures and mechanisms to effectuate said vote.\n\nThis bill was signed into law on September 10, 2000 and became\n\neffective immediately.     See Law No. 403 of September 10, 2000, § 4.6.\n\n          On September 11, 2000 the United States filed its Notice of\n\nAppeal from this Final Judgment and from the Final Opinion and Order\n\nalso entered by the district court on August 29, 2000, which contained\n\nprovisions substantially the same as those in the Final Judgment.\n\nNeither the Plaintiffs nor the Intervenor Government of Puerto Rico and\n\nGovernor appealed.\n\n          For the reasons stated herein, we reverse and vacate the\n\nFinal Judgment and Final Opinion and Order and remand with instructions\n\nto dismiss the action.    See Toren v. Toren, 191 F.3d 23 (1st Cir.\n\n1999). This court, of course, expresses no opinion with regard to the\n\nvalidity under Puerto Rican law of Law No. 403.\n\n                                  I\n\n          In Igartua I , a case brought by the same lead plaintiff and\n\nlawyer who appears currently before us, this court held with undeniable\n\nclarity that the Constitution of the United States does not confer upon\n\nUnited States citizens residing in Puerto Rico a right to participate\n\nin the national election for President and Vice-President. Addressing\n\n                                 -6-\n\fprecisely the argument presented to the district court in this case,\n\nthis court recognized that Article II of the Constitution explicitly\n\nprovides that the President of the United States shall be elected by\n\nelectors who are chosen by the States, in such manner as each state's\n\nlegislature may direct. See id. at 9 (citing U.S. Const. Art. II, § 1,\n\ncl. 2). We concluded that Puerto Rico, which is not a State, may not\n\ndesignate electors to the electoral college, and therefore that the\n\nresidents of Puerto Rico have no constitutional right to participate in\n\nthe national election of the President and Vice-President. See id. at\n\n9-10.\n\n          Since our decision in Igartua I in 1994, Puerto Rico has not\n\nbecome a State, nor has the United States amended the Constitution to\n\nallow United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico to vote for\n\nPresident, as it did for United States citizens residing in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia with the Twenty-Third Amendment to the\n\nConstitution. See id. at 10. Absent such a change in the status of\n\nPuerto Rico or an amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\n\nour decision in Igartua I controls this case, unless there has been\n\nintervening controlling or compelling authority.        See Gately v.\n\nMassachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The doctrine of\n\nstare decisis renders the ruling of law in a case binding in future\n\ncases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the\n\ndecision.\");1 see also Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592\n\n\n     1     The Commonwealth argues that stare decisis is not \"an\ninexorable command,\" particularly in constitutional cases. But Igartua\nI is based on Supreme Court opinions which that court has not\nreconsidered and we are not free to do so.            And \"[e]ven in\n\n                                 -7-\n\f(1st Cir. 1995) (\"In a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels\n\nare, for the most part, bound by prior panel decisions closely on\n\npoint.\").\n\n                                   II\n\n            The district court attempted to distinguish Igartua I in its\n\nJuly 19 opinion (but not in its Final Opinion and Order) on reasoning\n\nthat \"while Igartua I centered on Plaintiff's inability to vote for the\n\nPresident and Vice President, the instant case revolves around their\n\ninability to elect delegates to the electoral college.\" Igartua II,\n\n107 F. Supp.2d at 145.      This effort at distinguishing Igartua I\n\nobviously fails. Under the Constitution, the appointment of electors\n\n(through the popular vote) is the means by which the President and Vice\n\nPresident are chosen. U.S. Const., Art. II, § 1, cl. 2; Amend. XII.\n\nThis court held in Igartua I that the citizens resident in Puerto Rico\n\ndo not have a right to vote in presidential elections because Puerto\n\nRico \"is not entitled under Article II to choose electors for the\n\nPresident.\"    Igartua I, 32 F.3d at 9-10.\n\n            There are two exceptions to the rule that earlier decisions\n\nare binding. First, an earlier panel decision \"may be undermined by\n\ncontrolling authority, subsequently announced, such as an opinion of\n\nthe Supreme Court.\" Williams, 45 F.3d at 592. The second exception is\n\nfor \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates\n\nthe original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless\n\n\nconstitutional cases, stare decisis carries such persuasive force that\n[even the Supreme Court has] always required a departure from precedent\nto be supported by some 'special justification.'\" Dickerson v. United\nStates, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 2336 (2000).\n\n                                  -8-\n\foffers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of\n\nfresh development, would change its collective mind.\"         Id.   The\n\nCommonwealth argues that those exceptions are met here in light of two\n\nSupreme Court decisions: Rice v. Cayetano, 120 S. Ct. 1044 (Feb. 23,\n\n2000), and U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 770 (1995). Neither\n\ncase support the Commonwealth's argument.\n\n           The Court in Rice struck down a Hawaii statute that imposed\n\nrace-based voting qualifications based on the Fifteenth Amendment's\n\nmandate that neither the National Government nor the states may deny or\n\nabridge the right to vote on account of race. See Rice, 120 S. Ct. at\n\n1056-57.    This Fifteenth Amendment ruling on racial voting\n\nclassifications does not impact the reasoning in Igartua I that Article\n\nII governs the right to vote in presidential elections. The reliance\n\non the Court's holding in U.S. Term Limits similarly is inapt. The\n\nCourt ruled that States lack the power to impose qualifications for\n\noffices of the United States Congress in addition to those set forth in\n\nthe Constitution.    See 514 U.S. at 818-20.    The Court's language\n\ndescribing the \"fundamental principle of our representative democracy,\"\n\nwhich appellees cite in their brief, serves to amplify the Court's\n\nholding that the states cannot impose restrictions on federal\n\nelections, but also does not alter the Article II analysis in Igartua\n\nI. Thus, neither case stands for the proposition that the right to\n\nvote in the presidential election is derived from any source other than\n\nArticle II of the Constitution.\n\n           Because Igartua I is binding authority, the district court\n\nerred in not dismissing the action.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          The judgment and order of the District Court is reversed and\n\nvacated and the case is remanded with instructions that the action be\n\ndismissed with prejudice.\n\n                       Concurrence follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring). As I did in Igartúa\n\nI, I join the Court's opinion in this appeal because I believe it to be\n\ntechnically and, as the law now stands, legally correct in its\n\nconclusion that the Constitution does not guarantee United States\n\ncitizens residing in Puerto Rico the right to vote in the national\n\nPresidential election. I also agree with the Court's indication that\n\ntoday's decision expresses no opinion with regard to the validity under\n\nPuerto Rico law of Law 403 of September 10, 2000, which is the subject\n\nof separate litigation and which I conclude is not properly before us.\n\nI am, however, compelled to write separately because I can no longer\n\nremain silent to the subjacent question, because from my perspective,\n\nthere are larger issues at stake.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          More than 100 years ago, at the conclusion of the Spanish-\n\nAmerican War of 1898, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States by\n\nSpain.2 Despite lofty rhetoric at the time extolling the virtues of\n\nAmerican democracy,3 the United States has since exercised almost\n\n\n     2      See Treaty of Paris, Dec. 10, 1898, United States-Spain,\n30 Stat. 1754. Article IX of the treaty reads: \"The civil rights and\npolitical status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby\nceded to the United States shall be determined by the Congress.\"\n     3      For example, on July 28, 1898, three days after the landing\nof American troops at Guánica, General Nelson A. Miles, who commanded\nthe expeditionary force, proclaimed:\n\n          In the prosecution of war against the kingdom of Spain\n     by the people of the United States, in the cause of liberty,\n\n                                 -11-\n\funfettered power over Puerto Rico and the nearly 4,000,000 United\n\nStates citizens who currently reside there.4 Although persons born in\n\nPuerto Rico are citizens of the United States at birth,5 and thereby\n\n\n     justice and humanity, its military forces have come to\n     occupy the island of Porto Rico. They come bearing the\n     banner of freedom, inspired by noble purposes, . . . .\n\n          They bring you the fostering arms of a free people,\n     whose greatest power is justice and humanity to all living\n     within their fold. . . .\n\n          They have come not to make war on the people of the\n     country, who for centuries have been oppressed; but, on the\n     contrary, to bring protection, not only to yourselves, but\n     to your property, promote your prosperity and bestow the\n     immunities and blessings of our enlightenment and liberal\n     institutions and government . . . .\n\nAnnual Report of the Major General Commanding the Army, Nelson A.\nMiles, Nov. 5, 1898, Messages, 1898-1899, at 31-32.\n\n     It should be noted that, at the time of General Miles' arrival,\nand since the enactment of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, Puerto\nRicans enjoyed Spanish citizenship and voting representation in the\nSpanish Parliament, rights which were confirmed in the Constitution of\n1876 and in the Autonomic Charter of 1897. See 1 José Trías Monge,\nHistoria Constitucional de Puerto Rico 34-35 (1983).\n     4      See U.S. Census Bureau, Population Div., PR-99-1 Estimates\nof the Population of Puerto Rico Municipios, July 1, 1999, (July 21,\n2000) <http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/puerto\n-rico.html>. This is a larger population than 26 of the States and\nmore than the combined population of Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode\nIsland, which together with Massachusetts and Puerto Rico constitute\nthe First Circuit. See U.S. Census Bureau, Population Div., ST-99-3\nState Population Estimates: Annual Time Series, (December 29, 1999)\n<http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/\nstate/st-99-3.txt>.\n     5      8 U.S.C. § 1402 (1999) (governing the citizenship of\npersons born in Puerto Rico on or after April 11, 1899). The residents\nof Puerto Rico were first granted citizenship in 1917. See Jones Act\n\n                                -12-\n\f\"owe[] allegiance to the United States,\" Kawakita v. United States, 343\n\nU.S. 717, 736 (1952), while residing in Puerto Rico they enjoy fewer\n\nrights than citizens of the United States that reside in the fifty\n\nStates, see United States v. Verdugo-Urquídez, 494 U.S. 259, 268 (1990)\n\n(and cases cited therein), or even in foreign countries, see Reid v.\n\nCovert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957). Undoubtedly the most glaring evidence of\n\nthis egregious disparity is the fact that they do not elect a single\n\nvoting representative6 to a federal government that exercises almost\n\nabsolute power over them.\n\n          This anomalous situation arises primarily as a result of the\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court in the Insular Cases,7 which established\n\nas early as 1901 the plenary power of Congress over Puerto Rico under\n\nthe so-called \"territorial\" clause of the Constitution.8 In a series\n\nof narrowly divided decisions, the Court held that Puerto Rico was an\n\n\n(Puerto Rico), § 5, ch. 145, 39 Stat. 951 (1917).\n     6      The residents of Puerto Rico do elect a Resident\nCommissioner to represent their interests before Congress, but that\nofficial's lack of a vote obviously diminishes his ability to\neffectively represent them.\n     7      Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298 (1922); Ocampo v. United\nStates, 234 U.S. 91 (1914); Dorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138 (1904);\nHawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U.S. 197 (1903); Downes v.

United States, 182 U.S. 222 (1901); DeLima v.\nBidwell, 182 U.S. 1 (1901).\n     8      Article 4, section 3, clause 2, of the Constitution states:\n\"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules\nand Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to\nthe United States . . . .\"\n\n                                 -13-\n\f\"unincorporated territory,\" see Insular Cases, supra note 6, and as a\n\nresult part of the United States for some purposes9 and not for\n\nothers.10 As such, Congress was held to have plenary power over the\n\ninternal and external affairs of the Island, subject not even to the\n\nBill of Rights except insofar as those guarantees might be explicitly\n\nextended to the Island by Congress.       See Downes, 182 U.S. at 286.\n\n           Between 1898 and 1917, persons residing in Puerto Rico were\n\nconsidered to be citizens of Puerto Rico11 and \"nationals\" of the United\n\nStates.12 This condition was changed in 1917, however, when Congress\n\ngranted United States citizenship en masse to the residents of Puerto\n\nRico.13 Notwithstanding this apparent upgrading of the personal status\n\n\n     9     See, e.g., De Lima, 182 U.S. 1, 200 (1901) (Puerto Rico\npart of the United States for customs purposes).\n     10     See, e.g., Downes, 182 U.S. 244, 287 (1901) (\"[T]he Island\nof Porto Rico is a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United\nStates, but not a part of the United States\" for revenue purposes).\n     11    See Foraker Act, § 7, 31 Stat. 77 (1900) (codified as\namended at 48 U.S.C. § 733 (1987)).\n     12     The term \"national of the United States\" is defined at 8\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(22) to mean \"(A) a citizen of the United States, or\n(B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes\npermanent allegiance to the United States.\" The only persons currently\nholding such status are residents of American Samoa and Swains Island.\n\n     13      See Jones Act (Puerto Rico), § 5, ch. 145, 39 Stat. 951\n(1917). This status was reiterated in the Nationality Act of 1940, §\n202, ch. 876, 54 Stat. 1139 (1940), in which Congress explicitly stated\nthat all persons born in Puerto Rico automatically became citizens of\nthe United States, a situation analogous to that existing within the\nthen contiguous States under the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision\n\n                                 -14-\n\fof Puerto Rico's residents, the Supreme Court in 1922 in Balzac v.\n\nPorto Rico, 258 U.S. 298 (1922), established the inferior nature of the\n\nUnited States citizenship held by residents of Puerto Rico by\n\nconcluding that the Constitution's protection of these new citizens was\n\nlimited to those rights deemed by the Court to be \"fundamental.\"14 Cf.\n\nYick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886) (voting is \"a fundamental\n\npolitical right, because [it is] preservative of all rights\"); see also\n\n\n\nwas repealed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of June 27, 1952,\n§403, ch. 477, 66 Stat. 280, and replaced by the provision now codified\nat 8 U.S.C. § 1402 (1999) (governing the citizenship of all persons\nborn in Puerto Rico on or after April 11, 1899).\n     14      Balzac involved a claim to trial by jury in a criminal\nprosecution, which the Court concluded was unavailable in Puerto Rico\nbecause trial by jury was not a \"fundamental\" right. Balzac, 258 U.S.\nat 312-13; cf. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968) (holding\nthat \"trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American\nscheme of justice\"). Balzac has never been reversed and has been cited\napprovingly by the Court as recently as 1990. See United States v.\nVerdugo-Urquídez, 494 U.S. 259, 268 (1990). In comparison, in Reid v.\nCovert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), the Court refused to extend the reasoning of\nthe Insular Cases to American civilians abroad who had been convicted\nby a court martial for a felony offense without being afforded the\nright to a jury trial. Justice Black, writing for a four-Justice\nplurality (no opinion of any Justices garnered a majority, and only\neight Justices participated in the case), stated: \"[I]n view of our\nheritage and the history of the adoption of the Constitution and the\nBill of Rights, it seems peculiarly anomalous to say that trial before\na civilian judge and by an independent jury picked from the common\ncitizenry is not a fundamental right.\" Justice Black went further,\nrejecting Balzac and the other Insular Cases as outdated, see id. at\n14, but concurring Justices Frankfurter and Harlan refused to go so\nfar, see id. at 54, 66. Ironically, because the holding of the Court\nextends the protection of United States citizenship to a proceeding\nthat took place in England qua the condition of United States\ncitizenship, this case seems to stand for the proposition that certain\nconstitutional rights are inherent in United States citizenship.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562 (1964).\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Since Balzac the civil rights of United States citizens\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico, particularly their national political rights,\n\nhave remained dormant at best, subject to the vagaries of Congress, and\n\nthe conspicuous inattention of the judiciary. The granting of so-\n\ncalled \"Commonwealth\" status in 1952,15 itself an enigmatic condition16\n\n\n     15    See Public Law 600, ch. 446, 64 Stat. 319 (1950) (codified\nat 48 U.S.C. § 731(b) (1994)).\n     16     Even the term \"Commonwealth,\" as applied to Puerto Rico,\nis meaningless. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia are all\nentitled \"commonwealths,\" yet Puerto Rico is certainly not equivalent\nto them as a political entity. Puerto Rico and the United States\ncertainly do not form a \"Commonwealth of Nations\" nor is their\nrelationship in anyway similar to that of the nations forming the\n\"British Commonwealth.\" In fact, the official title of \"Commonwealth\nof Puerto Rico\" is also officially in Spanish \"Estado Libre Asociado,\"\nwhich literally translated means \"Free Associated State.\" Puerto Rico\nis neither free nor a state, and as to being \"associated\" with the\nUnited States, the Supreme Court ruled long ago that \"the Island of\nPorto Rico is a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United\nStates, but not a part of the United States\" for some purposes.\nDownes, 182 U.S. at 287 (Puerto Rico not part of the U.S. for revenue\npurposes). But see De Lima, 182 U.S. at 199-200 (Puerto Rico part of\nthe U.S. for tariff purposes) (stating, ironically, \"We are unable to\nacquiesce in this assumption that a territory may be at the same time\nboth foreign and domestic\"). The confusion does not end with the name,\nas the various courts, including of course the Supreme Court and our\nown, have contributed much to this condition. See Rodríguez v. Popular\nDemocratic Party, 457 U.S. 1 (1982); Harris v. Rosario, 446 U.S. 651\n(1980); Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1 (1978); Examining Bd. of Eng'rs\nv. Flores, 426 U.S. 572 (1976); Calero Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing\nCo., 416 U.S. 663 (1974); Mercado v. Puerto Rico, 214 F.3d 34, 40, 44\n(1st Cir. 2000); Dávila-Pérez v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 202 F.3d 464\n(1st Cir. 2000); Moreno v. United States, 38 F.3d 1204 (Fed. Cir.\n1994); United States v. Sánchez, 992 F.2d 1143 (11th Cir. 1993);\nTrailer Marine Trans. Corp. v.

The United States citizens residing in\n\nPuerto Rico to this day continue to have no real say in the choice of\n\nthose who, from afar, really govern them, nor as to the enactment,\n\napplication, and administration of the myriad of federal laws and\n\nregulations that control almost every aspect of their daily affairs.\n\n          On numerous occasions since 1952 Congress has turned a blind\n\neye and a deaf ear to the continuing inequality to which United States\n\ncitizens in Puerto Rico are subjected, and a perusal of the\n\nCongressional Record demonstrates the jealousy with which Congress has\n\nguarded its plenary power over the Island.17 The courts have supported\n\nthis view. See Harris v. Rosario, 446 U.S. 651 (1980); Califano v.\n\nTorres, 389 U.S. 1 (1978).\n\n          This is not a totally unpredicted scenario. As far back as\n\n1901, in the first of the Insular Cases, De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S.\n\n\n1992); United States v. López-Andino, 831 F.2d 1164 (1st Cir. 1987);\nCórdova v. Simonpietri Ins.

To hold that this can be done as matter\n          of law we deem to be pure judicial legislation.\n          We find no warrant for it in the Constitution or\n          in the powers conferred upon this court . . . .\n          (Emphasis provided).\n\nSee also Downes, 182 U.S. at 379-80 (Harlan, J. dissenting).\n\n          The present conundrum cannot be justified or perpetuated\n\nfurther under the subterfuge of labeling it a \"political question.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, this situation is \"political\" in the sense that it\n\ninvolves the political rights of a substantial number of United States\n\ncitizens. It is also \"political\" because it is one that should, in the\n\nnormal course of things, be resolved by the political process and the\n\npolitical branches of government. But in the final analysis, this\n\nproblem is no more \"political\" than that presented to and resolved by\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fthe Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),\n\none that required corrective judicial action even in the face of\n\nlongstanding legal precedent.18 In Brown, the Court recognized that,\n\nas the ultimate interpreter and protector of the Constitution, it must\n\nat times fill the vacuum created by the failure or refusal of the\n\npolitical branches to protect the civil rights of a distinct and\n\npolitically powerless group of United States citizens. See also United\n\nStates v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938) (famously\n\nsuggesting that \"prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may\n\nbe a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation\n\nof those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect\n\nminorities, and . . . may call for a correspondingly more searching\n\njudicial inquiry\").\n\n          The United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico are caught\n\nin an untenable Catch-22. The national disenfranchisement of these\n\ncitizens ensures that they will never be able, through the political\n\nprocesses, to rectify the denial of their civil rights in those very\n\npolitical processes. This uninterrupted condition clearly provides\n\nsolid basis for judicial intervention at some point, one for which\n\nthere is resounding precedent. See Brown v. Board of Education, supra.\n\n                                III.\n\n          In this 211th year of the United States Constitution, and\n\n     18      See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).\n\n                                -19-\n\f102nd year of United States presence in Puerto Rico, United States\n\ncitizenship must mean more than merely the freedom to travel to and\n\nfrom the United States. See Balzac, 258 U.S. at 308. This citizenship\n\nshould not, cannot, be devalued to such a low scale.\n\n          After more than a century of United States possession of\n\nPuerto Rico, there continues to be tremendous debate over the status of\n\nthe Island and the nature of its relationship with the United States.\n\nCertainly the citizens of Puerto Rico are divided on the issue, a\n\ncondition which has permitted the federal government to externalize\n\nthis question. What is established, for the time being at least, is\n\nthat the federal courts continue to recognize the almost absolute power\n\nof Congress to unilaterally dictate the affairs of Puerto Rico and her\n\npeople. So long as that is the case, the practicality of the matter is\n\nthat Puerto Rico remains a colony with little prospect of exerting\n\neffective political pressure on the elected branches of government to\n\ntake corrective action.\n\n          The contemporary society of United States citizens residing\n\nin Puerto Rico hardly deserves colonial treatment by the United States,\n\nassuming that such treatment is ever justified. Puerto Rico is home to\n\na vibrant intellectual and cultural community which includes many\n\ninstitutions of higher education and other indicia of modern society,\n\nas well as a solid economic foundation which is wholly integrated into\n\nthe National framework.      Most importantly, its citizens have\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fcontributed in full measure, and at times beyond, to the defense of our\n\nCountry.19\n\n             The perpetuation of this colonial condition runs against the\n\nvery principles upon which this Nation was founded.          Indefinite\n\ncolonial rule by the United States is not something that was\n\ncontemplated by the Founding Fathers nor authorized per secula\n\nseculorum by the Constitution. See Downes, 182 U.S. at 380 (Harlan,\n\nJ., dissenting) (\"The idea that this country may acquire territories\n\nanywhere upon the earth, by conquest or treaty, and hold them as mere\n\ncolonies or provinces,--the people inhabiting them to enjoy only those\n\nrights as Congress chooses to accord to them,--is wholly inconsistent\n\nwith the spirit and genius, as well as with the words, of the\n\nConstitution.\"). And far from being a matter of local concern to the\n\nUnited States citizens in Puerto Rico only, the inequality to which\n\nthese citizens are subjected is an injury to every American, because as\n\nsurely as the current situation causes irreparable harm to United\n\nStates citizens residing in Puerto Rico, it just as powerfully\n\n\n\n     19     For example, more than 62,000 Puerto Ricans served in World\nWar II. In Korea, over 43,000 Puerto Ricans served, including almost\n40,000 volunteers, and approximately 3,540 of them lost their lives in\ndefense of the United States, the second highest rate per capita of any\njurisdiction in the Nation. Some 48,000 Puerto Ricans served in\nVietnam; approximately 270 were killed and more than 3,000 wounded.\nPuerto Ricans also served in World War I and in every significant\nUnited States conflict since Vietnam, including the Persian Gulf War.\nSee Lance Oliver, Puerto Rico's Overlooked Veterans, P. R. Herald (Nov.\n11, 1999), available online at <http://www.puertorico-herald.org>.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fdenigrates the entire Nation and the Constitution.\n\n          Although this is not the case, nor perhaps the time, for a\n\nfederal court to take remedial action to correct what is a patently\n\nintolerable situation, it is time to serve notice upon the political\n\nbranches of government that it is incumbent upon them, in the first\n\ninstance, to take appropriate steps to correct what amounts to an\n\noutrageous disregard for the rights of a substantial segment of its\n\ncitizenry. A failure to do so countenances corrective judicial action.\n\nSee Brown v. Board of Education, supra. It may be that the federal\n\ncourts will be required to take extraordinary measures as necessary to\n\nprotect discrete groups \"completely under the sovereignty and dominion\n\nof the United States.\"   Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 30 U.S. 1, 17\n\n(1831) (Marshall, C.J.).\n\n          My concurrence in today's decision, of course, indicates that\n\nI do not consider this the appropriate case for such intervention,\n\nlargely because the particular issue of the presidential vote is\n\ngoverned by explicit language in the Constitution providing for the\n\nelection of the President and Vice-President by the States, rather than\n\nby individual citizens. But I, for one, am of the view that my vote\n\ntoday is not equivalent to a carte blanche.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f",

Addressing precisely the argument presented to the district court in this case, this court recognized that Article II of the Constitution explicitly provides that the President of the United States shall be elected by electors who are chosen by the States, in such manner as each state's legislature may direct. See id. at 9 (citing U.S. Const. Art. II, &#167; 1, cl. 2). We concluded that Puerto Rico, which is not a State, may not designate electors to the electoral college, and therefore that the residents of Puerto Rico have no constitutional right to participate in the national election of the President and Vice-President.

See id. at 10. Absent such a change in the status of Puerto Rico or an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, our decision in Igartua I controls this case, unless there has been intervening controlling or compelling authority. See Gately v. Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The doctrine of stare decisis renders the ruling of law in a case binding in future cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision.\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> see also Williams v.

Supp.2d at 145. This effort at distinguishing Igartua I obviously fails. Under the Constitution, the appointment of electors (through the popular vote) is the means by which the President and Vice President are chosen. U.S. Const., Art. II, &#167; 1, cl. 2; Amend. XII. This court held in Igartua I that the citizens resident in Puerto Rico do not have a right to vote in presidential elections because Puerto Rico \"is not entitled under Article II to choose electors for the President.\" Igartua I, 32 F.3d at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two exceptions to the rule that earlier decisions are binding. First, an earlier panel decision \"may be undermined by controlling authority, subsequently announced, such as an opinion of the Supreme Court.\" Williams, 45 F.3d at 592. The second exception is for \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh development, would change its collective mind.\" Id. The Commonwealth argues that those exceptions are met here in light of two Supreme Court decisions: Rice v. Cayetano, 120 S. Ct. 1044 (Feb. 23, 2000), and U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 770 (1995). Neither case support the Commonwealth's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in Rice struck down a Hawaii statute that imposed race-based voting qualifications based on the Fifteenth Amendment's mandate that neither the National Government nor the states may deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race. See Rice, 120 S. Ct. at 1056-57. This Fifteenth Amendment ruling on racial voting classifications does not impact the reasoning in Igartua I that Article II governs the right to vote in presidential elections. The reliance on the Court's holding in U.S. Term Limits similarly is inapt. The Court ruled that States lack the power to impose qualifications for offices of the United States Congress in addition to those set forth in the Constitution. See 514 U.S. at 818-20. The Court's language describing the \"fundamental principle of our representative democracy,\" which appellees cite in their brief, serves to amplify the Court's holding that the states cannot impose restrictions on federal elections, but also does not alter the Article II analysis in Igartua I. Thus, neither case stands for the proposition that the right to vote in the presidential election is derived from any source other than Article II of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Igartua I is binding authority, the district court erred in not dismissing the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment and order of the District Court is reversed and vacated and the case is remanded with instructions that the action be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTE:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The Commonwealth argues that stare decisis is not \"an inexorable command,\" particularly in constitutional cases.

The United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico to this day continue to have no real say in the choice of those who, from afar, really govern them, nor as to the enactment, application, and administration of the myriad of federal laws and regulations that control almost every aspect of their daily affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On numerous occasions since 1952 Congress has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the continuing inequality to which United States citizens in Puerto Rico are subjected, and a perusal of the Congressional Record demonstrates the jealousy with which Congress has guarded its plenary power over the Island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The courts have supported this view.

That this state of things may continue for years, for a century even, but that until Congress enacts otherwise, it still remains a foreign country. To hold that this can be done as matter of law we deem to be pure judicial legislation. We find no warrant for it in the Constitution or in the powers conferred upon this court....

It is also \"political\" because it is one that should, in the normal course of things, be resolved by the political process and the political branches of government. But in the final analysis, this problem is no more \"political\" than that presented to and resolved by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), one that required corrective judicial action even in the face of longstanding legal precedent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> In Brown, the Court recognized that, as the ultimate interpreter and protector of the Constitution, it must at times fill the vacuum created by the failure or refusal of the political branches to protect the civil rights of a distinct and politically powerless group of United States citizens. See also United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938) (famously suggesting that \"prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and... may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico are caught in an untenable Catch-22. The national disenfranchisement of these citizens ensures that they will never be able, through the political processes, to rectify the denial of their civil rights in those very political processes. This uninterrupted condition clearly provides solid basis for judicial intervention at some point, one for which there is resounding precedent. See Brown v.

See Balzac, 258 U.S. at 308. This citizenship should not, cannot, be devalued to such a low scale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After more than a century of United States possession of Puerto Rico, there continues to be tremendous debate over the status of the Island and the nature of its relationship with the United States. Certainly the citizens of Puerto Rico are divided on the issue, a condition which has permitted the federal government to externalize this question. What is established, for the time being at least, is that the federal courts continue to recognize the almost absolute power of Congress to unilaterally dictate the affairs of Puerto Rico and her people. So long as that is the case, the practicality of the matter is that Puerto Rico remains a colony with little prospect of exerting effective political pressure on the elected branches of government to take corrective action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contemporary society of United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico hardly deserves colonial treatment by the United States, assuming that such treatment is ever justified. Puerto Rico is home to a vibrant intellectual and cultural community which includes many institutions of higher education and other indicia of modern society, as well as a solid economic foundation which is wholly integrated into the National framework. Most importantly, its citizens have contributed in full measure, and at times beyond, to the defense of our Country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The perpetuation of this colonial condition runs against the very principles upon which this Nation was founded. Indefinite colonial rule by the United States is not something that was contemplated by the Founding Fathers nor authorized per secula seculorum by the Constitution. See Downes, 182 U.S. at 380 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\"The idea that this country may acquire territories anywhere upon the earth, by conquest or treaty, and hold them as mere colonies or provinces,--the people inhabiting them to enjoy only those rights as Congress chooses to accord to them,--is wholly inconsistent with the spirit and genius, as well as with the words, of the Constitution.\"). And far from being a matter of local concern to the United States citizens in Puerto Rico only, the inequality to which these citizens are subjected is an injury to every American, because as surely as the current situation causes irreparable harm to United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico, it just as powerfully denigrates the entire Nation and the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is not the case, nor perhaps the time, for a federal court to take remedial action to correct what is a patently intolerable situation, it is time to serve notice upon the political branches of government that it is incumbent upon them, in the first instance, to take appropriate steps to correct what amounts to an outrageous disregard for the rights of a substantial segment of its citizenry. A failure to do so countenances corrective judicial action. See Brown v. Board of Education, supra. It may be that the federal courts will be required to take extraordinary measures as necessary to protect discrete groups \"completely under the sovereignty and dominion of the United States.\" Cherokee Nation v.

Balzac, 258 U.S. at 312-13; cf. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968) (holding that \"trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice\"). Balzac has never been reversed and has been cited approvingly by the Court as recently as 1990. See United States v. Verdugo-Urqudez, 494 U.S. 259, 268 (1990). In comparison, in Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), the Court refused to extend the reasoning of the Insular Cases to American civilians abroad who had been convicted by a court martial for a felony offense without being afforded the right to a jury trial. Justice Black, writing for a four-Justice plurality (no opinion of any Justices garnered a majority, and only eight Justices participated in the case), stated: \"[I]n view of our heritage and the history of the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, it seems peculiarly anomalous to say that trial before a civilian judge and by an independent jury picked from the common citizenry is not a fundamental right.\" Justice Black went further, rejecting Balzac and the other Insular Cases as outdated, see id. at 14, but concurring Justices Frankfurter and Harlan refused to go so far, see id. at 54, 66. Ironically, because the holding of the Court extends the protection of United States citizenship to a proceeding that took place in England qua the condition of United States citizenship, this case seems to stand for the proposition that certain constitutional rights are inherent in United States citizenship.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p>  See Public Law 600, ch. 446, 64 Stat. 319 (1950) (codified at 48 U.S.C. &#167; 731(b) (1994)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p>  Even the term \"Commonwealth,\" as applied to Puerto Rico, is meaningless.

Puerto Rico and the United States certainly do not form a \"Commonwealth of Nations\" nor is their relationship in anyway similar to that of the nations forming the \"British Commonwealth.\" In fact, the official title of \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" is also officially in Spanish \"Estado Libre Asociado,\" which literally translated means \"Free Associated State.\" Puerto Rico is neither free nor a state, and as to being \"associated\" with the United States, the Supreme Court ruled long ago that \"the Island of Porto Rico is a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States\" for some purposes. Downes, 182 U.S. at 287 (Puerto Rico not part of the U.S. for revenue purposes). But see De Lima, 182 U.S. at 199-200 (Puerto Rico part of the U.S. for tariff purposes) (stating, ironically, \"We are unable to acquiesce in this assumption that a territory may be at the same time both foreign and domestic\").

The first includes individuals who have always resided in Puerto Rico and whose claim is based on their alleged right to vote for the national offices in question because they consider it a right inherent in United States citizenship. The second group is comprised of former residents of states who were eligible to vote during such residence in the States but became ineligible to do so upon taking residency in Puerto Rico. Both groups claim entitlement to vote pursuant to the Constitution of the United States and pursuant to treaty obligations assumed by the United States under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, U.N.T.S. No. 14668, Vol. 999 (1976) p. 171, ratified, 138 Cong. Rec. S-4781 (April 2, 1992) (\"ICCPR\"). In addition, the second group also calls into question the constitutionality of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (NOCAVA), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1973ff-1973ff-6, which allows United States citizens residing outside the United States to vote in federal elections as absentee voters in their last state of residence. Because Puerto Rico is included within the definition of \"United States,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1973ff-6(8), residents of Puerto Rico who would otherwise qualify to vote pursuant to this statute are disqualified.

This Fifteenth Amendment ruling on racial voting classifications does not impact the reasoning in Igartua I that Article II governs the right to vote in presidential elections.

And far from being a matter of local concern to the United States citizens in Puerto Rico only, the inequality to which these citizens are subjected is an injury to every American, because as surely as the current situation causes irreparable harm to United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico, it just as powerfully denigrates the entire Nation and the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is not the case, nor perhaps the time, for a federal court to take remedial action to correct what is a patently intolerable situation, it is time to serve notice upon the political branches of government that it is incumbent upon them, in the first instance, to take appropriate steps to correct what amounts to an outrageous disregard for the rights of a substantial segment of its citizenry.

That provision was repealed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of June 27, 1952, &#167;403, ch. 477, 66 Stat. 280, and replaced by the provision now codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1402 (1999) (governing the citizenship of all persons born in Puerto Rico on or after April 11, 1899).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p>  Balzac involved a claim to trial by jury in a criminal prosecution, which the Court concluded was unavailable in Puerto Rico because trial by jury was not a \"fundamental\" right. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99954\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Balzac,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/99954/balzac-v-porto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">312-13</span></a></span>; cf.

Balzac has never been reversed and has been cited approvingly by the Court as recently as 1990. See United States v.

Justice Black, writing for a four-Justice plurality (no opinion of any Justices garnered a majority, and only eight Justices participated in the case), stated: \"[I]n view of our heritage and the history of the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, it seems peculiarly anomalous to say that trial before a civilian judge and by an independent jury picked from the common citizenry is not a fundamental right.\" Justice Black went further, rejecting Balzac and the other Insular Cases as outdated, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105525\"><a href=\"/opinion/105525/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 14, </a></span>but concurring Justices Frankfurter and Harlan refused to go so far, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105525\"><a href=\"/opinion/105525/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 54, </a></span>66. Ironically, because the holding of the Court extends the protection of United States citizenship to a proceeding that took place in England qua the condition of United States citizenship, this case seems to stand for the proposition that certain constitutional rights are inherent in United States citizenship.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p>  See Public Law 600, ch. 446, 64 Stat. 319 (1950) (codified at 48 U.S.C. &#167; 731(b) (1994)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p>  Even the term \"Commonwealth,\" as applied to Puerto Rico, is meaningless.

Puerto Rico and the United States certainly do not form a \"Commonwealth of Nations\" nor is their relationship in anyway similar to that of the nations forming the \"British Commonwealth.\" In fact, the official title of \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" is also officially in Spanish \"Estado Libre Asociado,\" which literally translated means \"Free Associated State.\" Puerto Rico is neither free nor a state, and as to being \"associated\" with the United States, the Supreme Court ruled long ago that \"the Island of Porto Rico is a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States\" for some purposes. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95504\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Downes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/95504/downes-v-bidwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">287</span> </a></span>(Puerto Rico not part of the U.S. for revenue purposes).
