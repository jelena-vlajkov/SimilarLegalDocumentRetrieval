Hector Hernández-Negrón and\n\nWaldemar     González-Vázquez              appeal    from      their    convictions\n\nfollowing    a    trial      for    conspiracy       to   distribute     controlled\n\nsubstances       and   aiding        and    abetting      the    distribution      of\n\ncontrolled substances within one thousand feet of a school.\n\nHernández claims that he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel when his trial attorney failed to accept a plea bargain\n\nas   instructed,       and    that    the     government       then    violated   his\n\nconstitutional rights by withdrawing the original plea offer and\n\noffering a new \"package deal\" plea bargain that Hernández could\n\nonly accept if his two remaining co-defendants also pled guilty.\n\nHernández    also      argues       that    the     district    court    misapplied\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 in finding him to be a \"manager or supervisor\"\n\nof the criminal activity.             González challenges the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence, arguing that it was based solely on testimony\n\nfrom the government's confidential informant.                     We reject these\n\narguments (as well as several arguments concerning evidentiary\n\nerrors) and affirm the convictions and sentence of Hernández and\n\nthe convictions of González.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n            We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njury's verdict, consistent with record support.                          See United\n\nStates v. Hughes, 211 F.3d 676, 679 (1st Cir. 2000).                     In January\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f1995, FBI Agent Michael Anderson learned that an individual\n\nnamed Angel González-Ortiz, a.k.a. \"Pichi,\" headed a gang that\n\ndistributed      illegal   drugs   at    the   Luis       Palés    Matos    housing\n\nproject in Guayama, Puerto Rico.               The distribution point was\n\nwithin 1000 feet of the Palés Matos Public School.                         Anderson\n\nopened an investigation, assisted by Agent José Tirado, a Puerto\n\nRico Police officer who had performed some initial investigation\n\nof the drug ring.         Anderson met with a confidential informant\n\n(\"CI\"), Ramonita Massó-Nieves, who had assisted Agent Tirado in\n\nhis   initial     investigation.      To    corroborate          the    information\n\nprovided    by   Massó,    Anderson     set    up    two   video       surveillance\n\ncameras at the drug point, recording numerous drug deals.\n\n            In February 1996 a Grand Jury returned a two-count\n\nindictment against twenty-two individuals, charging a conspiracy\n\nto distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C\n\n§§ 841(a)(1) & 846 and aiding and abetting the distribution of\n\ncontrolled substances within 1,000 feet of a school in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 860 and 18 U.S.C. § 2.                          Shortly\n\nafter the indictments, the government offered plea bargains to\n\nall   of   the   co-defendants.         Nineteen     of    the    twenty-two    co-\n\ndefendants accepted a plea bargain;                 Hernández, González, and\n\nLouis Bonano-Serrano went to trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           The jury trial lasted seven days. Through surveillance\n\nvideotapes, the jury saw drug transactions involving many of the\n\nindividuals who had pled guilty.                 Hernández, González, and\n\nBonano, however, did not appear in these videos.                  The government\n\nattempted to link the defendants to the conspiracy through the\n\ntestimony of Massó and Agent Tirado.             Massó testified that, from\n\nher   experience      working   at    the   drug       point,    she   knew     that\n\nHernández,     González,    and      Bonano     were     the     \"guilterro\"      or\n\n\"triggermen\"    for    Pichi,   insuring        that    the     kingpin   and   his\n\ninterests were protected.          She further testified that González\n\nhad provided drugs to the distribution point and that Hernández\n\nwas second in command, after Pichi himself.                   She also testified\n\nthat on one occasion Hernández had used her apartment to package\n\ndrugs, and that she called Agent Tirado to inform him.                        Agent\n\nTirado confirmed this, testifying that upon arriving at Massó's\n\napartment, he found Hernández and two others sitting around a\n\ntable   packaging     a   powder     that   a   field     test    indicated      was\n\ncocaine.     A chemist testified that later laboratory tests also\n\nindicated that the substance was cocaine.               Tirado also testified\n\nthat when he stopped González for a traffic violation he found\n\na bag containing drug packaging paraphernalia.\n\n           González and Bonano did not offer defense witnesses.\n\nHernández offered one witness: a co-conspirator who had pled\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fguilty, and who testified that Hernández had been with him when\n\nAgent Tirado came to Massó's apartment and found them packaging\n\ndrugs.     The jury found Hernández and González guilty on both\n\ncounts.    Bonano was acquitted.          Hernández was sentenced to 450\n\nmonths and González was sentenced to 360 months.\n\n            We evaluate Hernández's claims first, turn then to the\n\nissues raised by González, and finally address an issue raised\n\nby both appellants.\n\n                                 II. Hernández\n\nA. The Plea Bargain\n\n            Hernández      raises       two    arguments     related    to    his\n\nunsuccessful    efforts     to    obtain       a   plea   agreement    from   the\n\ngovernment.    Like all of the twenty-two original co-defendants,\n\nHernández was offered a plea agreement after he was indicted in\n\n1996.     Nineteen of the co-defendants accepted the plea bargain\n\nand were sentenced to between eighteen and forty-six months.\n\nHernández, however, deferred a decision on the plea offer while\n\npreparing a motion to dismiss.                After that motion was denied,\n\nHernández moved to compel the government to honor the initial\n\nplea agreement. The government responded that there had been no\n\nagreement.    Rather, there had only been an offer that Hernández\n\nhad not accepted and that was now withdrawn.                   The government\n\nfurther    stated   that    it    had    advised     Hernández   that    \"trial\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpreparation in this case would be the same against one or\n\nagainst any of the three co-defendants.\"\n\n           1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n           Hernández     argues    that        he     received        ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel because his trial counsel mishandled the\n\nplea bargaining process by grossly underestimating Hernández's\n\npotential sentence if the case were taken to trial, having\n\nstated that Hernández could face a maximum of a ten year prison\n\nterm when in reality he faced a life sentence (and in fact\n\nreceived   thirty-seven     and    a    half        years).      Additionally,\n\nHernández asserts that his trial counsel failed to accept the\n\nplea   offer    as   instructed,       allowing       the     offer    to   lapse.\n\nHernández asserts that he went so far as to call his sisters in\n\nthe United States to enlist their help in bypassing his attorney\n\nand communicating to the government that he wanted to accept the\n\nplea bargain.\n\n           If true, Hernández's claims would present a serious\n\nineffective assistance question.           See Boria v. Keane, 99 F.3d\n\n492, 496 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A defense lawyer in a criminal case\n\nhas the duty to advise his client fully on whether a particular\n\nplea to a charge appears to be desirable.\"); id. at 496-97 (\"The\n\ndecision whether to plead guilty or contest a criminal charge .\n\n. . must ultimately be left to the client's wishes.\"). However,\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f\"[w]e have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous\n\nthat fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make\n\ntheir debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but,\n\nrather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the\n\ntrial court.\"        United States v. Berríos, 132 F.3d 834, 841 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (quoting United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1062-63\n\n(1st Cir. 1993)); see also United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16,\n\n19 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955,\n\n956 (1st Cir. 1989);           United States v.          Costa, 890 F.2d 480,\n\n482-83 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           While there is an exception to this bar in cases \"where\n\nthe critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record\n\nis sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the\n\nineffective assistance claim,\" United States v. Soldevila-López,\n\n17 F.3d 480, 485 (1st Cir. 1994), Hernández's claims require the\n\nresolution      of   factual    disputes.        We   thus   follow    our   usual\n\npractice   of    dismissing      this   portion       of   the    appeal   without\n\nprejudice to Hernández raising the ineffective assistance claim\n\nin a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 petition.               See id.\n\n           We note, though, that this seems to be one of the \"rare\n\nsection 2255 cases in which the appointment of counsel [would\n\nbe]   warranted.\"      Mala,    7   F.3d   at    1064.       As   in   Mala,   the\n\nallegation of ineffectiveness is serious and the record provides\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fsome support for the defendant's claim.                      Under the initial plea\n\nagreement that Hernández's trial counsel allegedly refused to\n\naccept, Hernández would have likely received forty-six months,\n\ngiven a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and the\n\ngovernment's willingness to drop the aiding and abetting count\n\nand stipulate that Hernández was only responsible for a fraction\n\nof   the    drugs.        Both    at   the    sentencing       hearing    and     in   an\n\naffidavit         filed   on     appeal,     Hernández        stated   that     he     had\n\ninstructed his trial attorney to accept the plea bargain because\n\nit was much less severe than the twenty years he was serving on\n\nPuerto      Rico     charges      relating       to    his    involvement       in     the\n\nconspiracy.1         After trial, Hernández received a sentence of\n\nthirty-seven and half years--almost ten times the sentence he\n\nwould      have    likely      received      pursuant    to     the    proposed      plea\n\nagreement.         Moreover, the court ruled that the federal sentence\n\ncould not be served concurrently with the related twenty year\n\nPuerto      Rico    sentence       because       the   local    courts    were       \"too\n\nlenient.\"     We therefore \"direct the district court, if appellant\n\npetitions for section 2255 relief and demonstrates continued\n\n\n\n\n      1Three of Hernández's relatives have also filed affidavits\nstating that Hernández telephoned two of his sisters (who lived\nin Ohio) to enlist their help in bypassing his attorney and\ntelling the government directly that he wanted to accept the\noffer.\n\n                                           -9-\n\ffinancial eligibility, to appoint counsel for him under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3006A(a)(2)(B).\"        Id.\n\n            2.    The \"Package Deal\" Objection\n\n            Hernández   argues   that     the   government   violated   his\n\nconstitutional rights by withdrawing the original plea offer and\n\nreplacing it with a \"package deal\" plea that Hernández could\n\nonly accept if his two remaining co-defendants also pled guilty.\n\nBecause his co-defendants wanted a jury trial, Hernández says he\n\nwas unable to accept the agreement and was thus \"forced\" to go\n\nto trial.\n\n            Hernández's objections have no merit.              First, the\n\ngovernment was under no obligation to leave its original plea\n\noffer open.       At the sentencing hearing, Hernández's counsel\n\nconceded that he had never accepted the initial plea offer,\n\ninstead hoping for success on a motion to dismiss.             He further\n\nconceded that \"while we were waiting for disposition of those\n\nmotions . . . at that point, between all that, the government\n\nwithdrew.\"       It is axiomatic that a prosecutor may withdraw a\n\nplea offer before a defendant accepts it.           See United States v.\n\nPapaleo, 853 F.2d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mabry v.\n\nJohnson, 467 U.S. 504, 507 (1984).\n\n            Given that the government was entitled to withdraw the\n\ninitial plea offer, the question becomes whether the government\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fcould offer a new \"package deal\" plea bargain that would be\n\navailable to Hernández only if his two co-defendants also gave\n\nup their right to a jury trial.                   Assuming that a \"package deal\"\n\noffer was made2, it would not violate Hernández's constitutional\n\nrights.         Although we have expressed concerns with package deal\n\nplea agreements, those concerns have no application here.                              The\n\ndifficulty with \"package deal\" plea offers is not the fear that\n\na defendant, like Hernández, will be \"forced\" to go to trial.\n\nRather,         it    is    the    opposite      fear   that       the   defendant    will\n\ninvoluntarily              waive   his   right    to    a   jury    trial   because    his\n\ncodefendants will coerce him to accept the plea agreement.                             See\n\nUnited States v. Martínez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 732 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).      We have held that \"[p]ackage plea deals therefore impose\n\nspecial obligations: the prosecutor must alert the district\n\ncourt to the fact that codefendants are entering a package deal,\n\nand       the        district      court      must      carefully        ascertain     the\n\n\n\n      2\n      While the record is not entirely clear, it suggests that\nthe government did offer Hernández a \"package deal.\" In response\nto Hernández's motion to compel the government to accept its\noriginal plea offer, the government stated that \"[Hernández's]\n[c]ounsel was advised in no uncertain terms that . . . trial\npreparation in this case would be the same against one or\nagainst any of the three co-defendants.\"         Moreover, when\nHernández informed the trial court that the government had\noffered a \"package deal\" arrangement, the trial court seems to\nhave accepted this characterization in deciding that such an\narrangement was unproblematic, and the government did nothing to\nchallenge this characterization.\n\n                                            -11-\n\fvoluntariness of each defendant's plea.\"            Id. at 733 (internal\n\ncitations    omitted)   (vacating      package   deal   guilty   plea   when\n\ndistrict court did not determine if it was voluntary); see also\n\nUnited States v. Daniels, 821 F.2d 76, 78-79 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(vacating package deal guilty plea when government did not\n\ninform trial court about nature of agreement).\n\n            The \"voluntariness\" concern that the defendant may have\n\nbeen coerced into giving up his right to go to trial obviously\n\ndoes not apply when the defendant           does go to trial. It is\n\ndifficult, then, to understand the constitutional right at stake\n\nhere.    While the \"package deal\" did limit Hernández's ability to\n\nobtain a plea bargain (since the other defendants would also be\n\nrequired to plead guilty), the fact remains that \"there is no\n\nconstitutional right to plea bargain; the prosecutor need not do\n\nso if he prefers to go to trial. It is a novel argument that\n\nconstitutional rights are infringed by trying the defendant\n\nrather than accepting his plea of guilty.\"                Weatherford v.\n\nBursey, 429 U.S. 545, 561 (1977); see also United States v.\n\nWheat,    813   F.2d    1399,   1405    (9th     Cir.   1987)    (rejecting\n\ndefendant's claim that package deal plea was unconstitutional\n\nbecause it \"forced\" him to go to trial).\n\nB. Upward Adjustment for Supervisor / Manager Role\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f           Section    3B1.1(b)     of   the     United   States   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines calls for a three point increase to the base offense\n\nlevel \"[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not\n\nan organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five\n\nor more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"                 U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1(b); see also United States v. Joyce, 70 F.3d 679, 682 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).    Hernández claims that the district court erred in\n\nordering a two level upward adjustment pursuant to §3B1.1(b)\n\nbecause   he   was   not   a   \"manager    or   supervisor.\"       Since   the\n\ndetermination of whether a defendant played this aggravated role\n\nis fact intensive, we will reverse a trial court's determination\n\nonly if it is clearly erroneous.           See United States v. Shrader,\n\n56 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Morillo, 8\n\nF.3d 864, 871 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           As the district court noted at the sentencing hearing,\n\nMassó testified that Hernández was second in command at the drug\n\npoint.     Moreover,       Hernández    played    a   leadership    role    in\n\narranging with Massó to use her apartment for drug packaging.\n\nThus, there was sufficient evidence for the district court to\n\nconclude that the \"defendant, in committing the crime, exercised\n\ncontrol over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the\n\nactivities of, at least one other person.\"                United States v.\n\nCali, 87 F.3d 571, 578 (1st Cir. 1996)(quoting United States v.\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fSavoie,    985    F.2d    612,      616   (1st    Cir.       1993)).    As       such,   the\n\nimposition of supervisory liability under § 3B1.1(b) was not\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n               There is one other issue related to the § 3B1.1(b)\n\ndetermination.           Although        the   court     found    that       §    3B1.1(b)\n\napplied, it decided to \"give [Hernández] a break on this one\"\n\nand increase the offense by only two levels rather than the\n\nthree called for by the guideline.                This was error.            As we noted\n\nin   United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 412-14 (1st Cir.\n\n1995), § 3 B1.1 sets forth a precise adjustment scheme 3 that\n\ncannot    be    modified      by   the    district      court.         The   Sentencing\n\nCommission did not provide for a partial upward adjustment under\n\n§ 3B1.1, in contrast to other provisions where the Commission\n\nauthorized       the    sentencing        judge   to    select     an    intermediate\n\nadjustment.            See,   e.g.,       U.S.S.G.       §    2A2.2(b)(3)(D),            (E)\n\n(intermediate adjustment allowed for injuries considered to be\n\n\"between\"        specified         categories      of        injuries);          §   3B1.2\n\n(intermediate adjustment allowed for mitigating role \"falling\n\n\n\n     3\n     If a crime involves \"five or more participants or was\notherwise extensive,\" the Guidelines provide for a four level\nenhancement for an \"organizer or leader,\" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a),\nand three levels for a \"manager or supervisor,\" U.S.S.G §\n3B1.1(b).   For criminal activity on a smaller scale, the\nGuidelines provide for a two level upward adjustment for all\nfour roles--organizers, leaders, managers or supervisors. See\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c).\n\n                                          -14-\n\fbetween\" minimal and minor participation).            Therefore, a court\n\nmay not \"forgo the three-level increase called for by U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1(b) and instead impose a two-level increase\" when it\n\nfinds mitigating circumstances.           United States v. Cotto, 979\n\nF.2d 921, 922 (2d Cir. 1992); see also United States v. Kirkeby,\n\n11 F.3d 777, 778-79 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"A trial court's only\n\noptions in cases involving a criminal activity with five or more\n\nparticipants are, therefore, a four-level enhancement under §\n\n3B1.1(a), a three-level enhancement under § 3B1.1(b), or no\n\nenhancement at all . . . .\").\n\n         Although   the      district     court   erred   in    adjusting\n\nHernández's   offense   by   two    levels   rather    than    three,   the\n\ngovernment did not cross-appeal.          We therefore deem the issue\n\nwaived and affirm the sentence.       See generally United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nC. Limits on Hernández's Cross-Examination of Tirado\n\n         Hernández objects that the district court improperly\n\nlimited his cross-examination of José Tirado, a Puerto Rico\n\nPolice officer working (at the time of the conspiracy) for the\n\nDrugs and Narcotics Division in the Guayama area.             Agent Tirado\n\ntestified that acting on a tip from Massó, he obtained a warrant\n\nand entered her apartment with Guayama officers Laboy Rólon and\n\nJuan Rodríguez.   Tirado stated that he found Hernández and two\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fof his co-conspirators packaging a white powder, which field\n\ntests indicated was cocaine.                 The drugs were seized and stored\n\nin Rodriguez's locker.\n\n            Hernández          wanted        to     cross-examine       Tirado     about\n\nallegations that Rodríguez and other Guayama area officers were\n\ncorrupt.     The district court ruled that while questions on the\n\nchain of custody of the drugs would be allowed, \"you cannot\n\nbenefit from somebody else's corruption, and it is immaterial to\n\nthis   case.\"     The          court    reasoned       that    the    corruption      was\n\n\"immaterial\" because Tirado himself had never been accused of\n\ncorruption and because the corruption of other officers at the\n\nlocal level did not implicate the federal prosecution.\n\n            The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment secures\n\na right to cross-examination in order to test \"the believability\n\nof a witness and the truth of his testimony.\"                        United States v.\n\nCarty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1009 (1st Cir. 1993).                             The right to\n\ncross-examine, however, is not unlimited.                         When a witness's\n\ncredibility     is        at     issue,       the      trial    court        may   limit\n\ncross-examination as long as the court allows \"sufficient leeway\n\nto establish a reasonably complete picture of the witness'\n\nveracity,     bias,        and         motivation.\"            United        States    v.\n\nLaboy-Delgado,       84    F.3d        22,    28    (1st   Cir.      1996)    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).               \"Confrontation clause challenges are\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\freviewed    de    novo    to    determine        whether      defense   counsel    was\n\nafforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses;\n\nonce that threshold is reached, the trial court's restrictions\n\non the extent and manner of cross-examination are reviewed only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.\"           United States v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72,\n\n87 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Gomes, 177 F.3d 76,\n\n80 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n            The district court's unwillingness to allow Hernández\n\nto question Tirado about the corruption of other police officers\n\ndid not prevent the jury from obtaining \"a reasonably complete\n\npicture    of    the     witness'       veracity,       bias,    and    motivation.\"\n\nLaboy-Delgado,      84     F.3d    at     28    (emphasis       added).        While   a\n\nmagistrate judge's pre-trial report adopted by the district\n\ncourt contained evidence that some police officers (including\n\nRodríguez) had behaved corruptly in other drug cases, there was\n\nno allegation that Tirado was himself corrupt.                       Indeed, Tirado\n\nprovided    the     United       States    with        information      that    helped\n\nimplicate other corrupt officers.                 Thus, any testimony tending\n\nto show that these other officers were dishonest would not\n\nimplicate       Tirado's       veracity,       bias,    and    motivation.        More\n\nconcretely,       cross-examination              that      attacked       Rodríguez's\n\nintegrity would do nothing to cast doubt on Tirado's claims that\n\n(1) he personally saw Hernández packaging a white powder, (2) he\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fpersonally observed a field test indicating that the white\n\npowder was cocaine, and (3) he recognized the drugs from the\n\nlaboratory as those seized from Hernández.\n\n           Moreover, the district court did not completely bar\n\nHernández from questioning Tirado about Rodríguez.              Rather, the\n\ncourt allowed extensive questioning as to how Rodríguez handled\n\nthe evidence in this case, including the unusually lengthy\n\nstorage in Rodríguez's locker and the miscounting of the bags of\n\ndrugs.     The district court \"retains wide latitude to impose\n\nreasonable   limits\"    on    cross-examination     in    order    to      avoid\n\nconfusion of the issues or extended discussion of marginally\n\nrelevant material. United States v. Twomey, 806 F.2d 1136, 1139\n\n(1st Cir. 1986).        Since Hernández was unable to offer any\n\nevidence   that   Rodríguez    corruptly     handled     the   case    against\n\nHernández,   it   was   not   unreasonable    for   the    court      to   limit\n\nHernández to questioning Tirado about these concrete factors\n\nrelating to storage and quantification rather than allowing a\n\nbroad inquiry into the corruption of third party police officers\n\nwho were not appearing as witnesses.\n\n                              III. González\n\nA. Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n           González was convicted of conspiracy to distribute\n\ncontrolled substances, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 846, and of\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\faiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances\n\nwithin one thousand feet of a school, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) &\n\n860 and 18 U.S.C. § 2.          The evidence tying him to the drug\n\noperation    came       primarily   from    Massó,   a   paid   government\n\ninformant.       González does not argue that the evidence, taken as\n\na whole, was insufficient.          Rather, González claims that \"[t]he\n\nevidence, excluding Ramonita Massó, is legally insufficient to\n\nsupport appellant's conviction.\" (emphasis added).              We reject\n\nGonzález's sufficiency challenge.             His premise that Massó's\n\ntestimony must be disregarded as \"not trustworthy\" because of\n\nher informant status is unsupportable.\n\n            It     is   well-established     that    \"the   testimony   of\n\ninterested informants is not so inherently unreliable that it\n\nmust be excluded.\"        United States v. Cresta, 825 F.2d 538, 546\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).          A conviction may be based solely on the\n\nuncorroborated testimony of a confidential informant \"so long as\n\nthe testimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.\"\n\nUnited States v. Ciocca, 106 F.3d 1079, 1084 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting United States v. Andújar, 49 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1995)).   While the credibility of an interested informant can be\n\nchallenged, the challenge should ordinarily be directed to the\n\njury, not the appellate court.          Thus, when an informant is paid\n\na contingent fee, \"the jury must be informed of the exact nature\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fof   the   contingency   agreement;     the   defense   counsel    must    be\n\npermitted to cross-examine the witness about the agreement; and\n\nthe jury must be specifically instructed to weigh the witness'\n\ntestimony with care.\" Cresta, 825 F.2d at 546; see also United\n\nStates v. Fernández, 145 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 1998) (plain\n\nerror review when defendant does not request the \"special care\"\n\ninstruction).     When these \"established safeguards,\" id., are\n\nmet, we will not disturb a conviction based on the testimony of\n\nan interested informant.\n\n            Massó's testimony was certainly not \"incredible or\n\ninsubstantial on its face.\"           Ciocca, 106 F.3d at 1084.           She\n\nprovided detailed descriptions of González's participation in\n\nthe drug distribution operation.         González was allowed to--and\n\ndid--vigorously       cross-examine     Massó,     suggesting     that    her\n\ntestimony was untruthful.       Massó admitted that she had started\n\nworking at the drug point before she made a decision to serve as\n\nan informant.    González also brought out inconsistencies between\n\nMassó's trial testimony--where she identified González as a\n\n\"triggerman\" and recalled an incident when he delivered drugs to\n\nthe distribution point--and her investigative interviews with\n\nAgent Tirado and Agent Anderson.         During the closing, González\n\nargued that Massó was now lying about González's role due to\n\ncompensation    she    had   acknowledged     on   direct:   $10,000      for\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fexpenses, $10,000 for her availability, and the promise of a\n\n\"bonus\" upon completion of the trial, regardless of its result.\n\nFinally, the trial court instructed the jury to weigh Massó's\n\ntestimony with care.4 Despite this admonition, the jury rejected\n\nGonzález's defense that Massó was lying and voted to convict.\n\nWe have no reason to disturb the verdict on sufficiency grounds.\n\n\n\nB. The Traffic Stop\n\n          González     argues     that   the     district     court   erred    in\n\nfailing to strike Agent Tirado's testimony that he saw González\n\nwith drug paraphernalia as he left the distribution point.\n\nTirado testified that on March 4, 1994, he stopped González for\n\ntraffic   violations    as   he   left     the      housing   project   on    his\n\nmotorcycle.    A   consensual      search      of    González's   sports      bag\n\nrevealed a scale, a sieve, plastic containers, and pieces of\n\naluminum--items Tirado recognized as frequently used to process\n\n\n\n\n    4In addition to receiving a general instruction on witness\ncredibility, the jury was advised that it should consider\nwhether Massó's pre-trial statements were consistent with her\ntestimony at trial and that the testimony of \"an informer for\npay\" must \"always be examined and weighed with greater care and\ncaution than the testimony of an ordinary witness.\" We assume\nfor the sake of argument that González properly requested these\ninstructions, though the record is unclear. See Fernández, 145\nF.3d at 62 (plain error review if \"special care\" instructions\nnot requested).\n\n                                    -21-\n\fcontrolled substances.         When Tirado told the other officers,\n\n\"Look what this guy has in here,\" González began to run.\n\n              After cross-examination of Agent Tirado was complete,\n\nGonzález moved to strike the testimony concerning the traffic\n\nstop on the grounds that the evidence was irrelevant to the\n\nconspiracy charges and, even if relevant, unduly prejudicial\n\nunder    Fed. R. Evid. 403.      The trial court denied the motion to\n\nstrike, stating, inter alia, that the evidence was relevant (and\n\nmore probative than prejudicial) because \"he was at the drug\n\npoint within the time frame of the conspiracy and carrying\n\nparaphernalia is consistent with drug trafficking.\"                  We review\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.              United States v.\n\nRodríguez, 162 F.3d 135, 142 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              The   evidence   was   plainly   admissible       as   relevant\n\nevidence of the conspiracy: combined with the testimony of\n\nMassó, it suggested that González was a member of the drug ring\n\nat the housing project.        Likewise, \"it is only unfair prejudice,\n\nnot prejudice per se, against which Rule 403 guards.\"                   United\n\nStates   v.    Rivera-Gómez,    67   F.3d   993,   997   (1st   Cir.    1995).\n\n\"Unfairly prejudicial evidence is evidence having some quality\n\nthat moves the jury to attribute to it excessive probative\n\nvalue. It is evidence that 'triggers [the] mainsprings of human\n\naction [in such a way as to] cause a jury to base its decision\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fon something other than the established proposition in the\n\ncase.'\" United States v. Currier, 836 F.2d 11, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (quoting 1 Weinstein's Evidence § 403[03], 36-39 (1986)).\n\nThe items González was carrying did not create a danger of such\n\nunfair prejudice.      Rather, a reasonable jury could consider the\n\ntestimony concerning these items as circumstantial evidence of\n\nGonzález's involvement in the conspiracy.\n\n                    IV. Hernández and González\n\n           Hernández and González argue that the district court\n\nerred in admitting the testimony of Puerto Rico Police Officer\n\nGregorio Durán regarding investigations and surveillance at the\n\nLuis Palés Matos housing project.          Durán testified that while\n\ninvestigating   drug    distribution    at    the     housing   project   he\n\nobserved   Hernández,    González,   and     Bonano    acting   as   Pichi's\n\nbodyguards.   Cross-examination, however, revealed that Durán was\n\nunsure precisely when he saw the co-defendants.             Since some of\n\nDurán's observations were made before the charged conspiracy, he\n\ncould not be certain that he had seen the defendants within the\n\ntime frame of the conspiracy.        Surveillance reports that could\n\nhave been used to clarify when Durán saw the defendants, or to\n\nimpeach his testimony if the defendants were not mentioned in\n\nthem, could not be obtained because they were stored in a Puerto\n\nRico facility that OSHA had declared highly contaminated.\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f            In   response,      Hernández    and   González    requested    a\n\nmistrial.    Although arguing that no mistrial was necessary, the\n\ngovernment suggested to the district court that it might strike\n\nAgent Durán's testimony and issue a curative instruction.                 The\n\ntrial court reasoned that there was no basis for a mistrial--or\n\neven for striking the testimony--because 1) the reports were\n\nunavailable to the government, 2) there had been no misconduct,\n\nand 3) the defendants \"have had the chance to cross-examine this\n\nwitness and really attack his credibility on the grounds that he\n\ndid   not    observe     the     matters     within     the   time   frame.\"\n\nNonetheless, the court agreed to strike the testimony and issue\n\nthe cautionary instruction because \"the Government wants to do\n\nthat.\"      On appeal, González and Hernández claim that Agent\n\nDurán's testimony impermissibly bolstered Massó's testimony.\n\nGiven that Durán's testimony was struck, the only possible legal\n\nargument    is   that   the    remedy   of   striking   the   testimony   and\n\nissuing a cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the\n\nharms caused by the allegedly inadmissible testimony and that\n\nthe mistrial the defendants sought should have been granted.\n\n            We find no error in the trial court's denial of a\n\nmistrial, much less the manifest abuse of discretion required\n\nfor reversal.     See United States v. Rullán-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16,\n\n18 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Mistrial is a last resort, to be employed\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fonly if the demonstrated harm can be cured by no less drastic\n\nmeans, such as a contemporaneous jury instruction.\").                      Even\n\nassuming    that   Agent   Durán's    testimony     was   inadmissible      (an\n\nassumption    we   make    solely    for    the   sake   of   argument),    the\n\ndistrict court's response--striking the testimony and issuing a\n\ncurative instruction--was certainly adequate.                 The court told\n\nthe jury:\n\n                   Now, the testimony of Agent Gregorio\n            Durán Malavé concerning his observations\n            that he saw the three defendants providing\n            security service, body guarding 'Pichi',\n            well I am ordering that testimony to be\n            stricken   from   the  record,   and  I   am\n            instructing you to erase it from your mind\n            entirely, the way I told you, the way you\n            swore to obey my instructions and follow the\n            law.   So again, I repeat, disregard that\n            testimony , that portion of the testimony,\n            that portion, entirely from your minds.\n\n\n            We presume that juries follow instructions. See United\n\nStates v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 73 (1st Cir. 1998).              While this\n\npresumption may be rebutted \"on a sufficient showing that the\n\noffending testimony reasonably could not have been ignored and\n\nthat serious prejudice likely resulted,\"            Rullán-Rivera, 60 F.3d\n\nat 18, no such showing has been made here.                     Indeed, Agent\n\nDurán's stricken testimony also implicated co-defendant Bonano\n\nas a bodyguard for Pichi.

Hernandez claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to accept a plea bargain as instructed, and that the government then violated his constitutional rights by withdrawing the original plea offer and offering a new \"package deal\" plea bargain that Hernandez could only accept if his two remaining co-defendants also pled guilty.  Hernandez also argues that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 in finding him to be a \"manager or supervisor\" of the criminal activity.  Gonzalez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, arguing that it was based solely on testimony from the government's confidential informant.  We reject these arguments (as well as several arguments concerning evidentiary errors) and affirm the convictions and sentence of Hernandez and the convictions of Gonzalez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, consistent with record support.  See United Statesv. Hughes, 211 F.3d 676, 679 (1st Cir. 2000).  In January 1995, FBI Agent Michael Anderson learned that an individual named Angel Gonzalez-Ortiz, a.k.a. \"Pichi,\" headed a gang that distributed illegal drugs at the Luis Pales Matos housing project in Guayama, Puerto Rico.  The distribution point was within 1000 feet of the Pales Matos Public School.  Anderson opened an investigation, assisted by Agent Jose Tirado, a Puerto Rico Police officer who had performed some initial investigation of the drug ring.  Anderson met with a confidential informant (\"CI\"), Ramonita Masso-Nieves, who had assisted Agent Tirado in his initial investigation. To corroborate the information provided by Masso, Anderson set up two video surveillance cameras at the drug point, recording numerous drug deals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1996 a Grand Jury returned a two-count indictment against twenty-two individuals, charging a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846 and aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 860 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.  Shortly after the indictments, the government offered plea bargains to all of the co-defendants.  Nineteen of the twenty-two co-defendants accepted a plea bargain;  Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Louis Bonano-Serrano went to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury trial lasted seven days.  Through surveillance videotapes, the jury saw drug transactions involving many of the individuals who had pled guilty. Hernandez,Gonzalez, and Bonano, however, did not appear in these videos.  The government attempted to link the defendants to the conspiracy through the testimony of Masso and Agent Tirado.  Masso testified that, from her experience working at the drug point, she knew that Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Bonano were the \"guilterro\" or \"triggermen\" for Pichi, insuring that the kingpin and his interests were protected.  She further testified that Gonzalez had provided drugs to the distribution point and that Hernandez was second in command, after Pichi himself.  She also testified that on one occasion Hernandez had used her apartment to package drugs, and that she called Agent Tirado to inform him.  Agent Tirado confirmed this, testifying that upon arriving at Masso's apartment, he found Hernandez and two others sitting around a table packaging a powder that a feld test indicated was cocaine.  A chemist testified that later laboratory tests also indicated that the substance was cocaine.  Tirado also testified thatwhen he stopped Gonzalez for a traffic violation he found a bag containing drug packaging paraphernalia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez and Bonano did not offer defense witnesses. Hernandez offered one witness: a co-conspirator who had pled guilty, and who testified that Hernandez had been with him when Agent Tirado came to Masso's apartment and found them packaging drugs.  The jury found Hernandez and Gonzalez guilty on both counts.  Bonano was acquitted.  Hernandez was sentenced to 450 months and Gonzalez was sentenced to 360 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate Hernandez's claims first, turn then to the issues raised by Gonzalez, and finally address an issue raised by both appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Hernandez</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Plea Bargain</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez raises two arguments related to his unsuccessful efforts to obtain a plea agreement from the government.  Like all of the twenty-two original co-defendants, Hernandez was offered a plea agreement after he was indicted in 1996.  Nineteen of the co-defendants accepted the plea bargain and were sentenced to between eighteen and forty-six months. Hernandez, however, deferred a decision on the plea offer while preparing a motion to dismiss.  After that motion was denied, Hernandez moved to compel the government to honor the initial plea agreement. The government responded that there had been no agreement.  Rather, there had only been an offer that Hernandez had not accepted and that was now withdrawn.  The government further stated that it had advised Hernandez that \"trial preparation in this case would be the same against one or against any of the three co-defendants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel mishandled the plea bargaining process by grossly underestimating Hernandez's potential sentence if the case were taken to trial, having stated that Hernandez could face a maximum of a ten year prison term when in reality he faced a life sentence (and in fact received thirty-seven and a half years).  Additionally, Hernandez asserts that his trial counsel failed to accept the plea offer as instructed, allowing the offer to lapse.  Hernandez asserts that he went so far as to call his sisters in the United States to enlist their help in bypassing his attorney and communicating to the government that he wanted to accept the plea bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If true, Hernandez's claims would present a serious ineffective assistance question.  See Boria v. Keane, 99 F.3d 492, 496 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A defense lawyer in a criminal case has the duty to advise his client fully on whether a particular plea to a charge appears to be desirable.\"); id. at 496-97 (\"The decision whether to plead guilty or contest a criminal charge . . . must ultimately be left to the client's wishes.\"). However, \"[w]e have held witha regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" United States v. Berros, 132 F.3d 834, 841 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1062-63 (1st Cir. 1993)); see also United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Costa, 890 F.2d 480, 482-83 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there is an exception to this bar in cases \"where the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the ineffective assistance claim,\" United States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d 480, 485 (1st Cir. 1994), Hernandez's claims require the resolution of factual disputes.  We thus follow our usual practice of dismissing this portion of the appeal without prejudice to Hernandez raising the ineffective assistance claim in a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 petition.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, though, that this seems to be one of the \"rare section 2255 cases in which the appointment of counsel [would be] warranted.\" Mala, 7 F.3d at 1064.  As in Mala, the allegation of ineffectiveness is serious and the record provides some support for the defendant's claim.  Under the initial plea agreement that Hernandez's trial counsel allegedly refused to accept, Hernandez would have likely received forty-six months, given a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and the government's willingness to drop the aiding and abetting count and stipulate that Hernandez was only responsible for a fraction of the drugs.  Both at the sentencing hearing and in an affidavit filed on appeal, Hernandez stated that he had instructed his trial attorney to accept the plea bargain because it was much less severe than the twenty years he was serving on Puerto Rico charges relating to his involvement in the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After trial, Hernandez received a sentence of thirty-seven and half years--almost ten times the sentence he would have likely received pursuant to the proposed plea agreement.  Moreover, the court ruled that the federal sentence could not be served concurrently with the related twenty year Puerto Rico sentence because the local courts were \"too lenient.\"  We therefore \"direct the district court, if appellant petitions for section 2255 relief and demonstrates continued financial eligibility, to appoint counsel for him under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(a)(2)(B).\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.  The \"Package Deal\" Objection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that the government violated his constitutional rights by withdrawing the original plea offer and replacing it with a \"package deal\" plea that Hernandez could only accept if his two remaining co-defendants also pled guilty. Because his co-defendants wanted a jury trial, Hernandez says he was unable to accept the agreement and was thus \"forced\" to go to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez's objections have no merit.  First, the government was under no obligation to leave its original plea offer open.  At the sentencing hearing, Hernandez's counsel conceded that he had never accepted the initial plea offer, instead hoping for success on a motion to dismiss.  He further conceded that \"while we were waiting for disposition of those motions . . . at that point, between all that, the government withdrew.\"  It is axiomatic that a prosecutor may withdraw a plea offer before a defendant accepts it.  See United States v. Papaleo, 853 F.2d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 504, 507 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the government was entitled to withdraw the initial plea offer, the question becomes whether the government could offer a new \"package deal\" plea bargain that would be available to Hernandez only if his two co-defendants also gave up their right to a jury trial.  Assuming that a \"package deal\" offer was made<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>, it would not violate Hernandez's constitutional rights. Although we have expressed concerns with package deal plea agreements, those concerns have no application here.  The difficulty with \"package deal\" plea offers is not the fear that a defendant, like Hernandez, will be \"forced\" to go to trial. Rather, it is the opposite fear that the defendant will involuntarily waive his right to a jury trial because his codefendants will coerce him to accept the plea agreement.  SeeUnited States v. Martnez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 732 (1st Cir. 1995). We have held that \"[p]ackage plea deals therefore impose special obligations: the prosecutor must alert the district court to the fact that codefendants are entering a package deal, and the district court must carefully ascertain the voluntariness of each defendant's plea.\"  Id. at 733 (internal citations omitted) (vacating package deal guilty plea when district court did not determine if it was voluntary); see also United States v. Daniels, 821 F.2d 76, 78-79 (1st Cir. 1987) (vacating package deal guilty plea when government did not inform trial court about nature of agreement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"voluntariness\" concern that the defendant may have been coerced into giving up his right to go to trial obviously does not apply when the defendant does go to trial. It is difficult, then, to understand the constitutional right at stake here.  While the \"package deal\" did limit Hernandez's ability to obtain a plea bargain (since the other defendants would also be required to plead guilty), the fact remains that \"there is no constitutional right to plea bargain; the prosecutor need not do so if he prefers to go to trial. It is a novel argument that constitutional rights are infringed by trying the defendant rather than accepting his plea of guilty.\"  Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 561 (1977); see also United States v. Wheat, 813 F.2d 1399, 1405 (9th Cir. 1987) (rejecting defendant's claim that package deal plea was unconstitutional because it \"forced\" him to go to trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Upward Adjustment for Supervisor / Manager Role</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.1(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines calls for a three point increase to the base offense level \"[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b); see also United States v. Joyce, 70 F.3d 679, 682 (1st Cir. 1995).  Hernandez claims that the district court erred in ordering a two level upward adjustment pursuant to &#167;3B1.1(b) because he was not a \"manager or supervisor.\"  Since the determination of whether a defendant played this aggravated role is fact intensive, we will reverse a trial court's determination only if it is clearly erroneous.  See United States v. Shrader, 56 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 871 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted at the sentencing hearing, Masso testified thatHernandez was second in command at the drug point.  Moreover, Hernandez played a leadership role in arranging with Masso to use her apartment for drug packaging.  Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the district court to conclude that the \"defendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at least one other person.\" United States v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 578 (1st Cir. 1996)(quoting United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 616 (1st Cir. 1993)). As such, the imposition of supervisory liability under &#167; 3B1.1(b) was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one other issue related to the &#167; 3B1.1(b) determination.  Although the court found that &#167; 3B1.1(b) applied, it decided to \"give [Hernandez] a break on this one\" and increase the offense by only two levels rather than the three called for by the guideline.  This was error.  As we noted in  United States v.Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 412-14 (1st Cir. 1995), &#167; 3 B1.1 sets forth a precise adjustment scheme<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that cannot be modified by the district court.  The Sentencing Commission did not provide for a partial upward adjustment under &#167; 3B1.1, in contrast to other provisions where the Commission authorized the sentencing judge to select an intermediate adjustment.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(D), (E) (intermediate adjustment allowed for injuries considered to be \"between\" specified categories of injuries); &#167; 3B1.2 (intermediate adjustment allowed for mitigating role \"falling between\" minimal and minor participation).  Therefore, a court may not \"forgo the three-level increase called for by U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) and instead impose a two-level increase\" when it finds mitigating circumstances.  United States v. Cotto, 979 F.2d 921, 922 (2d Cir. 1992); see also United States v. Kirkeby, 11 F.3d 777, 778-79 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"A trial court's only options in cases involving a criminal activity with five or more participants are, therefore, a four-level enhancement under &#167; 3B1.1(a), a three-level enhancement under &#167; 3B1.1(b), or no enhancement at all . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court erred in adjusting Hernandez's offense by two levels rather than three, the government did not cross-appeal.  We therefore deem the issue waived and affirm the sentence.  See generally United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Limits on Hernandez's Cross-Examination of Tirado</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez objects that the district court improperly limited his cross-examination of Jose Tirado, a Puerto Rico Police officer working (at the time of the conspiracy) for the Drugs and Narcotics Division in the Guayama area.  Agent Tirado testified that acting on a tip from Masso, he obtained a warrant and entered her apartment with Guayama officers Laboy Rolon and Juan Rodrguez. Tirado stated that he found Hernandez and two of his co-conspirators packaging a white powder, which field tests indicated was cocaine.  The drugs were seized and stored in Rodriguez's locker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez wanted to cross-examine Tirado about allegations that Rodrguez and other Guayama area officers were corrupt.   The district court ruled that while questions on the chain of custody of the drugs would be allowed, \"you cannot benefit from somebody else's corruption, and it is immaterial to this case.\"  The court reasoned that the corruption was \"immaterial\" because Tirado himself had never been accused of corruption and because the corruption of other officers at the local level did not implicate the federal prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment secures a right to cross-examination in order to test \"the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony.\"  United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1009 (1st Cir. 1993).  The right to cross-examine, however, is not unlimited.  When a witness's credibility is at issue, the trial court may limit cross-examination as long as the court allows \"sufficient leeway to establish a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation.\"  United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \"Confrontation clause challenges are reviewed de novo to determine whether defense counsel was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses; once that threshold is reached, the trial court's restrictions on the extent and manner of cross-examination are reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72, 87 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Gomes, 177 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 1999)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's unwillingness to allow Hernandez to question Tirado about the corruption of other police officers did not prevent the jury from obtaining \"a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation.\"  Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d at 28 (emphasis added).  While a magistrate judge's pre-trial report adopted by the district court contained evidence that some police officers (including Rodrguez) had behaved corruptly in other drug cases, there was no allegation that Tirado was himself corrupt.  Indeed, Tirado provided the United States with information that helped implicate other corrupt officers.  Thus, any testimony tending to show that these other officers were dishonest would not implicate Tirado's veracity, bias, and motivation.  More concretely, cross-examination that attacked Rodrguez's integrity would do nothing to cast doubt on Tirado's claims that (1) he personally saw Hernandez packaging a white powder, (2) he personally observed a field test indicating that the white powder was cocaine, and (3) he recognized the drugs from the laboratory as those seized from Hernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court did not completely bar Hernandez from questioning Tirado about Rodrguez.  Rather, the court allowed extensive questioning as to how Rodrguez handled the evidence in this case, including the unusually lengthy storage in Rodrguez's locker and the miscounting of the bags of drugs.  The district court \"retains wide latitude to impose reasonable limits\" on cross-examination in order to avoid confusion of the issues or extended discussion of marginally relevant material. United Statesv. Twomey, 806 F.2d 1136, 1139 (1st Cir. 1986).  Since Hernandez was unable to offer any evidence that Rodrguez corruptly handled the case against Hernandez, it was not unreasonable for the court to limit Hernandez to questioning Tirado about these concrete factors relating to storage and quantification rather than allowing a broad inquiry into the corruption of third party police officers who were not appearing as witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Gonzalez</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez was convicted of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846, and of aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances within one thousand feet of a school, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 860 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.  The evidence tying him to the drug operation came primarily from Masso, a paid government informant.  Gonzalez does not argue that the evidence, taken as a whole, was insufficient. Rather, Gonzalez claims that \"[t]he evidence, excluding Ramonita Masso, is legally insufficient to support appellant's conviction.\" (emphasis added).  We reject Gonzalez's sufficiency challenge.  His premise that Masso's testimony must be disregarded as\"not trustworthy\" because of her informant status is unsupportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that \"the testimony of interested informants is not so inherently unreliable that it must be excluded.\"  United States v. Cresta, 825 F.2d 538, 546 (1st Cir. 1987).  A conviction may be based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of a confidential informant \"so long as the testimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.\"  United States v.Ciocca, 106 F.3d 1079, 1084 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting United Statesv. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 1995)).  While the credibility of an interested informant can be challenged, the challenge should ordinarily be directed to the jury, not the appellate court.  Thus, when an informant is paid a contingent fee, \"the jury must be informed of the exact nature of the contingency agreement; the defense counsel must be permitted to cross-examine the witness about the agreement; and the jury must be specifically instructed to weigh the witness' testimony with care.\" Cresta, 825 F.2d at 546; see also United States v. Fernandez, 145 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 1998) (plain error review when defendant does not request the \"special care\" instruction).  When these \"established safeguards,\"id., are met, we will not disturb a conviction based on the testimony of an interested informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Masso's testimony was certainly not \"incredible or insubstantial on its face.\"  Ciocca, 106 F.3d at 1084.  She provided detailed descriptions of Gonzalez's participation in the drug distribution operation.  Gonzalez was allowed to--and did--vigorously cross-examine Masso, suggesting that her testimony was untruthful.  Masso admitted that she had started working at the drug point before she made a decision to serve as an informant. Gonzalez also brought out inconsistencies between Masso's trial testimony--where she identified Gonzalez as a \"triggerman\" and recalled an incident when he delivered drugs to the distribution point--and her investigative interviews with Agent Tirado and Agent Anderson.  During the closing, Gonzalez argued that Masso was now lying about Gonzalez's role due to compensation she had acknowledged on direct: $10,000 for expenses, $10,000 for her availability, and the promise of a \"bonus\" upon completion of the trial, regardless of its result.  Finally, the trial court instructed the jury to weigh Masso's testimony with care.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Despite this admonition, the jury rejected Gonzalez's defense that Masso was lying and voted to convict.  We have no reason to disturb the verdict on sufficiency grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Traffic Stop</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez argues that the district court erred in failing to strike Agent Tirado's testimony that he saw Gonzalez with drug paraphernalia as he left the distribution point.  Tirado testified that on March 4, 1994, he stopped Gonzalez for traffic violations as he left the housing project on his motorcycle.  A consensual search of Gonzalez's sports bag revealed a scale, a sieve, plastic containers, and pieces of aluminum--items Tirado recognized as frequently used to process controlled substances.  When Tirado told the other officers, \"Look what this guy has in here,\" Gonzalez began to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After cross-examination of Agent Tirado was complete, Gonzalez moved to strike the testimony concerning the traffic stop on the grounds that the evidence was irrelevant to the conspiracy charges and, even if relevant, unduly prejudicial underFed. R. Evid. 403.  The trial court denied the motion to strike, stating,inter alia, that the evidence was relevant (and more probative than prejudicial) because \"he was at the drug point within the time frame of the conspiracy and carrying paraphernalia is consistent with drug trafficking.\"  We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Rodrguez, 162 F.3d 135, 142 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence was plainly admissible as relevant evidence of the conspiracy: combined with the testimony of Masso, it suggested that Gonzalez was a member of the drug ring at the housing project.  Likewise, \"it is only unfair prejudice, not prejudice per se, against which Rule 403 guards.\"  United States v.Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 997 (1st Cir. 1995). \"Unfairly prejudicial evidence is evidence having some quality that moves the jury to attribute to it excessive probative value. It is evidence that 'triggers [the] mainsprings of human action [in such a way as to] cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established proposition in the case.'\" United States v. Currier, 836 F.2d 11, 18 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting 1 Weinstein's Evidence &#167; 403[03], 36-39 (1986)).  The items Gonzalez was carrying did not create a danger of such unfair prejudice.  Rather, a reasonable jury could consider the testimony concerning these items as circumstantial evidence of Gonzalez's involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Hernandez and Gonzalez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez and Gonzalez argue that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of Puerto Rico Police Officer Gregorio Duran regarding investigations and surveillance at the Luis Pales Matos housing project.  Duran testified that while investigating drug distribution at the housing project he observed Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Bonano acting as Pichi's bodyguards. Cross-examination, however, revealed that Duran was unsure precisely when he saw the co-defendants.  Since some of Duran's observations were made before the charged conspiracy, he could not be certain that he had seen the defendants within the time frame of the conspiracy.  Surveillance reports that could have been used to clarify when Duran saw the defendants, or to impeach his testimony if the defendants were not mentioned in them, could not be obtained because they were stored in a Puerto Rico facility that OSHA had declared highly contaminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Hernandez and Gonzalez requested a mistrial. Although arguing that no mistrial was necessary, the government suggested to the district court that it might strike Agent Duran's testimony and issue a curative instruction.  The trial court reasoned that there was no basis for a mistrial--or even for striking the testimony--because 1) the reports were unavailable to the government, 2) there had been no misconduct, and 3) the defendants \"have had the chance to cross-examine this witness and really attack his credibility on the grounds that he did not observe the matters within the time frame.\"  Nonetheless, the court agreed to strike the testimony and issue the cautionary instruction because \"the Government wants to do that.\"  On appeal, Gonzalez and Hernandez claim that Agent Duran's testimony impermissibly bolstered Masso's testimony.  Given that Duran's testimony was struck, the only possible legal argument is that the remedy of striking the testimony and issuing a cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the harms caused by the allegedly inadmissible testimony and that the mistrial the defendants sought should have been granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the trial court's denial of a mistrial, much less the manifest abuse of discretion required for reversal.  See United States v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Mistrial is a last resort, to be employed only if the demonstrated harm can be cured by no less drastic means, such as a contemporaneous jury instruction.\").  Even assuming that Agent Duran's testimony was inadmissible(an assumption we make solely for the sake of argument), the district court's response--striking the testimony and issuing a curative instruction--was certainly adequate.  The court told the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the testimony of Agent Gregorio Duran Malave concerning his observations that he saw the three defendants providing security service, body guarding 'Pichi', well I am ordering that testimony to be stricken from the record, and I am instructing you to erase it from your mind entirely, the way I told you, the way you swore to obey my instructions and follow the law.  So again, I repeat, disregard that testimony , that portion of the testimony, that portion, entirely from your minds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We presume that juries follow instructions. See United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 73 (1st Cir. 1998).  While this presumption may be rebutted \"on a sufficient showing that the offending testimony reasonably could not have been ignored and that serious prejudice likely resulted,\"  Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d at 18, no such showing has been made here.  Indeed, Agent Duran's stricken testimony also implicated co-defendant Bonano as a bodyguard for Pichi.  The jury, however, acquitted Bonano, indicating that they were not unduly influenced by the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.

Hernandez claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to accept a plea bargain as instructed, and that the government then violated his constitutional rights by withdrawing the original plea offer and offering a new \"package deal\" plea bargain that Hernandez could only accept if his two remaining co-defendants also pled guilty.  Hernandez also argues that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 in finding him to be a \"manager or supervisor\" of the criminal activity.  Gonzalez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, arguing that it was based solely on testimony from the government's confidential informant.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, consistent with record support.

In January 1995, FBI Agent Michael Anderson learned that an individual named Angel Gonzalez-Ortiz, a.k.a. \"Pichi,\" headed a gang that distributed illegal drugs at the Luis Pales Matos housing project in Guayama, Puerto Rico.  The distribution point was within 1000 feet of the Pales Matos Public School.  Anderson opened an investigation, assisted by Agent Jose Tirado, a Puerto Rico Police officer who had performed some initial investigation of the drug ring.  Anderson met with a confidential informant (\"CI\"), Ramonita Masso-Nieves, who had assisted Agent Tirado in his initial investigation. To corroborate the information provided by Masso, Anderson set up two video surveillance cameras at the drug point, recording numerous drug deals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1996 a Grand Jury returned a two-count indictment against twenty-two individuals, charging a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846 and aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 860 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.  Shortly after the indictments, the government offered plea bargains to all of the co-defendants.  Nineteen of the twenty-two co-defendants accepted a plea bargain;  Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Louis Bonano-Serrano went to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury trial lasted seven days.  Through surveillance videotapes, the jury saw drug transactions involving many of the individuals who had pled guilty. Hernandez,Gonzalez, and Bonano, however, did not appear in these videos.  The government attempted to link the defendants to the conspiracy through the testimony of Masso and Agent Tirado.  Masso testified that, from her experience working at the drug point, she knew that Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Bonano were the \"guilterro\" or \"triggermen\" for Pichi, insuring that the kingpin and his interests were protected.  She further testified that Gonzalez had provided drugs to the distribution point and that Hernandez was second in command, after Pichi himself.  She also testified that on one occasion Hernandez had used her apartment to package drugs, and that she called Agent Tirado to inform him.  Agent Tirado confirmed this, testifying that upon arriving at Masso's apartment, he found Hernandez and two others sitting around a table packaging a powder that a feld test indicated was cocaine.  A chemist testified that later laboratory tests also indicated that the substance was cocaine.  Tirado also testified thatwhen he stopped Gonzalez for a traffic violation he found a bag containing drug packaging paraphernalia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez and Bonano did not offer defense witnesses. Hernandez offered one witness: a co-conspirator who had pled guilty, and who testified that Hernandez had been with him when Agent Tirado came to Masso's apartment and found them packaging drugs.  The jury found Hernandez and Gonzalez guilty on both counts.  Bonano was acquitted.  Hernandez was sentenced to 450 months and Gonzalez was sentenced to 360 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate Hernandez's claims first, turn then to the issues raised by Gonzalez, and finally address an issue raised by both appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Hernandez</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Plea Bargain</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez raises two arguments related to his unsuccessful efforts to obtain a plea agreement from the government.  Like all of the twenty-two original co-defendants, Hernandez was offered a plea agreement after he was indicted in 1996.  Nineteen of the co-defendants accepted the plea bargain and were sentenced to between eighteen and forty-six months. Hernandez, however, deferred a decision on the plea offer while preparing a motion to dismiss.  After that motion was denied, Hernandez moved to compel the government to honor the initial plea agreement. The government responded that there had been no agreement.  Rather, there had only been an offer that Hernandez had not accepted and that was now withdrawn.  The government further stated that it had advised Hernandez that \"trial preparation in this case would be the same against one or against any of the three co-defendants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel mishandled the plea bargaining process by grossly underestimating Hernandez's potential sentence if the case were taken to trial, having stated that Hernandez could face a maximum of a ten year prison term when in reality he faced a life sentence (and in fact received thirty-seven and a half years).  Additionally, Hernandez asserts that his trial counsel failed to accept the plea offer as instructed, allowing the offer to lapse.  Hernandez asserts that he went so far as to call his sisters in the United States to enlist their help in bypassing his attorney and communicating to the government that he wanted to accept the plea bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If true, Hernandez's claims would present a serious ineffective assistance question.  See Boria v. Keane, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></span>, 496 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A defense lawyer in a criminal case has the duty to advise his client fully on whether a particular plea to a charge appears to be desirable.\"); <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 496-97 </span>(\"The decision whether to plead guilty or contest a criminal charge . . . must ultimately be left to the client's wishes.\").

Soldevila-Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664046\"><a href=\"/opinion/664046/united-states-v-angel-a-soldevila-lopez-aka-angelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 485 (1st Cir. 1994), Hernandez's claims require the resolution of factual disputes.  We thus follow our usual practice of dismissing this portion of the appeal without prejudice to Hernandez raising the ineffective assistance claim in a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 petition.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, though, that this seems to be one of the \"rare section 2255 cases in which the appointment of counsel [would be] warranted.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mala,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span>.  As in Mala, the allegation of ineffectiveness is serious and the record provides some support for the defendant's claim.  Under the initial plea agreement that Hernandez's trial counsel allegedly refused to accept, Hernandez would have likely received forty-six months, given a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and the government's willingness to drop the aiding and abetting count and stipulate that Hernandez was only responsible for a fraction of the drugs.  Both at the sentencing hearing and in an affidavit filed on appeal, Hernandez stated that he had instructed his trial attorney to accept the plea bargain because it was much less severe than the twenty years he was serving on Puerto Rico charges relating to his involvement in the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After trial, Hernandez received a sentence of thirty-seven and half years--almost ten times the sentence he would have likely received pursuant to the proposed plea agreement.  Moreover, the court ruled that the federal sentence could not be served concurrently with the related twenty year Puerto Rico sentence because the local courts were \"too lenient.\"  We therefore \"direct the district court, if appellant petitions for section 2255 relief and demonstrates continued financial eligibility, to appoint counsel for him under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(a)(2)(B).\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.  The \"Package Deal\" Objection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that the government violated his constitutional rights by withdrawing the original plea offer and replacing it with a \"package deal\" plea that Hernandez could only accept if his two remaining co-defendants also pled guilty. Because his co-defendants wanted a jury trial, Hernandez says he was unable to accept the agreement and was thus \"forced\" to go to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez's objections have no merit.  First, the government was under no obligation to leave its original plea offer open.  At the sentencing hearing, Hernandez's counsel conceded that he had never accepted the initial plea offer, instead hoping for success on a motion to dismiss.  He further conceded that \"while we were waiting for disposition of those motions . . . at that point, between all that, the government withdrew.\"  It is axiomatic that a prosecutor may withdraw a plea offer before a defendant accepts it.  See United States v. Papaleo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509521\"><a href=\"/opinion/509521/united-states-v-antonio-papaleo/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mabry v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111208\"><a href=\"/opinion/111208/mabry-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 507 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the government was entitled to withdraw the initial plea offer, the question becomes whether the government could offer a new \"package deal\" plea bargain that would be available to Hernandez only if his two co-defendants also gave up their right to a jury trial.  Assuming that a \"package deal\" offer was made<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>, it would not violate Hernandez's constitutional rights. Although we have expressed concerns with package deal plea agreements, those concerns have no application here.  The difficulty with \"package deal\" plea offers is not the fear that a defendant, like Hernandez, will be \"forced\" to go to trial.

While a magistrate judge's pre-trial report adopted by the district court contained evidence that some police officers (including Rodrguez) had behaved corruptly in other drug cases, there was no allegation that Tirado was himself corrupt.  Indeed, Tirado provided the United States with information that helped implicate other corrupt officers.  Thus, any testimony tending to show that these other officers were dishonest would not implicate Tirado's veracity, bias, and motivation.  More concretely, cross-examination that attacked Rodrguez's integrity would do nothing to cast doubt on Tirado's claims that (1) he personally saw Hernandez packaging a white powder, (2) he personally observed a field test indicating that the white powder was cocaine, and (3) he recognized the drugs from the laboratory as those seized from Hernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court did not completely bar Hernandez from questioning Tirado about Rodrguez.

The district court \"retains wide latitude to impose reasonable limits\" on cross-examination in order to avoid confusion of the issues or extended discussion of marginally relevant material.

Since Hernandez was unable to offer any evidence that Rodrguez corruptly handled the case against Hernandez, it was not unreasonable for the court to limit Hernandez to questioning Tirado about these concrete factors relating to storage and quantification rather than allowing a broad inquiry into the corruption of third party police officers who were not appearing as witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

Gonzalez also brought out inconsistencies between Masso's trial testimony--where she identified Gonzalez as a \"triggerman\" and recalled an incident when he delivered drugs to the distribution point--and her investigative interviews with Agent Tirado and Agent Anderson.  During the closing, Gonzalez argued that Masso was now lying about Gonzalez's role due to compensation she had acknowledged on direct: $10,000 for expenses, $10,000 for her availability, and the promise of a \"bonus\" upon completion of the trial, regardless of its result.

Tirado testified that on March 4, 1994, he stopped Gonzalez for traffic violations as he left the housing project on his motorcycle.  A consensual search of Gonzalez's sports bag revealed a scale, a sieve, plastic containers, and pieces of aluminum--items Tirado recognized as frequently used to process controlled substances.

The trial court denied the motion to strike, stating,inter alia, that the evidence was relevant (and more probative than prejudicial) because \"he was at the drug point within the time frame of the conspiracy and carrying paraphernalia is consistent with drug trafficking.\"  We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.

Hernandez and Gonzalez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez and Gonzalez argue that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of Puerto Rico Police Officer Gregorio Duran regarding investigations and surveillance at the Luis Pales Matos housing project.  Duran testified that while investigating drug distribution at the housing project he observed Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Bonano acting as Pichi's bodyguards. Cross-examination, however, revealed that Duran was unsure precisely when he saw the co-defendants.  Since some of Duran's observations were made before the charged conspiracy, he could not be certain that he had seen the defendants within the time frame of the conspiracy.  Surveillance reports that could have been used to clarify when Duran saw the defendants, or to impeach his testimony if the defendants were not mentioned in them, could not be obtained because they were stored in a Puerto Rico facility that OSHA had declared highly contaminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Hernandez and Gonzalez requested a mistrial. Although arguing that no mistrial was necessary, the government suggested to the district court that it might strike Agent Duran's testimony and issue a curative instruction.  The trial court reasoned that there was no basis for a mistrial--or even for striking the testimony--because 1) the reports were unavailable to the government, 2) there had been no misconduct, and 3) the defendants \"have had the chance to cross-examine this witness and really attack his credibility on the grounds that he did not observe the matters within the time frame.\"  Nonetheless, the court agreed to strike the testimony and issue the cautionary instruction because \"the Government wants to do that.\"  On appeal, Gonzalez and Hernandez claim that Agent Duran's testimony impermissibly bolstered Masso's testimony.  Given that Duran's testimony was struck, the only possible legal argument is that the remedy of striking the testimony and issuing a cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the harms caused by the allegedly inadmissible testimony and that the mistrial the defendants sought should have been granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the trial court's denial of a mistrial, much less the manifest abuse of discretion required for reversal.

Even assuming that Agent Duran's testimony was inadmissible(an assumption we make solely for the sake of argument), the district court's response--striking the testimony and issuing a curative instruction--was certainly adequate.
