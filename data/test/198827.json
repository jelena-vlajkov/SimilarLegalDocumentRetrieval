Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nAnita Hill-Adames, Assistant Federal Public Defender, and\r\nJoseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nCamille Vlez-Riv, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Guillermo\r\nGil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant\r\nU.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                     February 16, 2000\r\n\n                                LYNCH, Circuit Judge.  Rubn Rodrguez-De Jess (Rodrguez)\r\nappeals the denial of his motion for a new trial, which alleged\r\nprosecutorial misconduct.  Rodrguez argues that the prosecutor's\r\nstatement that \"he [Rodrguez] also lied\" was sufficiently\r\nprejudicial to warrant a new trial, and that the district court\r\nabused its discretion in denying his motion.  Given the\r\ncircumstances in which the statement was made, we affirm the\r\ndistrict court's decision.\r\n                             I\r\nIn September 1996, Rodrguez submitted a claim to the\r\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for damage caused by\r\nHurricane Hortense to a house that he stated was his principal\r\nplace of residence.  Rodrguez received a $4,915 grant for repairs\r\nto the house and a $1,671 grant for rental assistance.  On April\r\n22, 1998, Rodrguez was indicted on two counts of fraud against the\r\nUnited States.  The first count was for making a false statement in\r\na matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, 18 U.S.C.\r\n1001; the second count was for making a false claim to a federal\r\nagency, 18 U.S.C.  287.  The indictment alleged that the house for\r\nwhich Rodrguez had received FEMA assistance had not actually been\r\nhis principal place of residence at the time of the hurricane.  If\r\nthe house that was destroyed had not been Rodrguez's principal\r\nplace of residence, he would not have qualified for the grants he\r\nreceived from FEMA; at best, he would have only qualified to\r\nreceive a loan.\r\nDuring the trial, Juanita Carrin Vasquez (Carrin), the\r\ngovernment's chief witness, testified that she rented the house in\r\nquestion from Rodrguez, and that the house was not Rodrguez's\r\nprincipal residence.  Carrin herself requested and received from\r\nFEMA rental assistance and compensation for property in the house\r\nthat was destroyed by the hurricane.\r\nOn August 6, 1998, a jury convicted Rodrguez on the\r\nfirst count and acquitted him on the second.  Rodrguez was ordered\r\nto serve one hour of imprisonment at the U.S. Marshals' office, pay\r\na $100 special monetary assessment, and make restitution of $6,586. \r\nRodrguez made timely motions for judgment of acquittal, Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 29(c), or, in the alternative, for a new trial, Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 33, which the district court denied.  Rodrguez appealed\r\nthe denial of his motion for a new trial.\r\n                             II\r\nThis appeal focuses on one statement by the prosecutor. \r\nProsecution witness Carrin testified that she had been renting the\r\nhouse from Rodrguez for more than three years before the hurricane\r\nstruck, and that Rodrguez did not live there himself.  In his\r\ntestimony, Rodrguez stated that he had never agreed to rent the\r\nhouse to Carrin, but that he had been letting her and her children\r\nstay there for free as a favor.  He testified that shortly before\r\nthe hurricane he had separated from his wife and moved into one of\r\nthe rooms in the house in which Carrin was living.  Carrin denied\r\nthat Rodrguez had moved into the house.\r\nRodrguez said that after the hurricane, in an effort to\r\nhelp Carrin get housing assistance, he had lied to Sylvia Guzman,\r\na representative of the Housing Department, by telling her that\r\nCarrin had been paying him $300 rent each month.  He also\r\ntestified that he called Guzman back later and confessed to having\r\nlied to her about Carrin's having paid rent.\r\nAfter the defense had rested, the government informed the \r\ncourt that it intended to call Guzman as a rebuttal witness.  Out\r\nof the presence of the jury, the prosecutor said that Guzman would\r\ntestify that Rodrguez had admitted lying to her but had not\r\noffered any reason for telling the lie.  The court suggested that\r\na stipulation could make Guzman's testimony unnecessary, and\r\ndefense counsel agreed to stipulate that Rodrguez never mentioned\r\nto Guzman why he had lied to her.  The judge then addressed the\r\njury:\r\n  THE COURT: . . . .  The stipulation is as follows: \r\nWhen the defendant called back Sylvia Guzman [of] the\r\nHousing Department, he informed her he had lied about the\r\n$300 rent.  He did not mention why he lied, but he did\r\ncall and told her he lied about the $300 rent.\r\n  Is that satisfactory, counsel?\r\n  PROSECUTOR:  Yes, and he also lied.\r\n  DEFENSE COUNSEL:  I object.  It should have been\r\ndone outside of the presence of the jury.\r\n  THE COURT:  Exactly.  Approach the bench.\r\nIn the sidebar that followed, the prosecutor explained\r\nthat she disagreed with the inclusion of \"about the $300 rent\" in\r\nthe stipulation.  The judge then addressed the jury again:\r\n  THE COURT: Let me correct the stipulation . . . .\r\n  The parties have agreed that when the defendant,\r\nMr. Rodriguez, called back Sylvia Guzman of the Housing\r\nDepartment and said he had lied in the earlier interview\r\nhe did not give any reasons to her why he lied.\r\n  Okay, that is the stipulation.  Is that\r\nsatisfactory?\r\n  PROSECUTOR:  Yes, it is.\r\n  DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes.\r\n                             III\r\nRodrguez contends that the statement by the prosecutor,\r\n\"and he also lied,\" affected the trial's outcome, and that\r\ntherefore the district judge should have granted his motion for a\r\nnew trial.  We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for\r\nmanifest abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Gonzalez-\r\nGonzalez, 136 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1998).  The determination of\r\nwhether prosecutorial misconduct \"has so poisoned the well that a\r\nnew trial is required,\" United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 574\r\n(1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),\r\ninvolves the weighing of several factors: \"(1) the severity of the\r\nmisconduct; (2) the context in which it occurred; (3) whether the\r\njudge gave any curative instructions and the likely effect of such\r\ninstructions; and (4) the strength of the evidence against the\r\ndefendant,\"  id.; see also United States v. Auch, 187 F.3d 125, 129\r\n(1st Cir. 1999) (similar factors).\r\nWe examine each of the Manning factors in turn.  When\r\nreviewing a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, we take a balanced\r\nview of the evidence in the record.  See United States v. Roberts,\r\n119 F.3d 1006, 1008 (1st Cir. 1997); Arrieta-Agressot v. United\r\nStates, 3 F.3d 525, 528 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nA. Severity of the Misconduct\r\nRodrguez argues that the prosecutor's statement \"and he\r\nalso lied\" misled the jury into thinking Rodrguez had stipulated\r\nto one of the elements of the first count, making a false statement\r\nto a federal agency, when in fact the lie to which he stipulated\r\n(that the government's chief witness had been paying him rent) was\r\nnot the lie he was charged with in the first count (that the\r\ndwelling for which he made a claim for emergency assistance was his\r\nprimary residence at the time of the hurricane).\r\nAlthough it is conceivable that the jury might have\r\nunderstood the prosecutor's remark to refer to the lie charged in\r\nthe first count, that is not a likely interpretation.  First, we\r\nnote that in this context the exact meaning of the statement \"he\r\nalso lied\" is far from self-evident.  \"[A] court should not lightly\r\ninfer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its\r\nmost damaging meaning . . . .\"  United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d\r\n300, 307 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416\r\nU.S. 637, 647 (1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here,\r\nthe prosecutor made the statement immediately after the judge\r\npresented to the jury the stipulation that Rodrguez had called\r\nSylvia Guzman to admit that he had lied to her in an earlier\r\nconversation.  Under these circumstances, the most plausible\r\nconclusion is that the prosecutor's remark (\"he also lied\")\r\nreferred to some aspect of Rodrguez's conversations with Guzman. \r\nThat conversation did not have to do with the lie Rodrguez was\r\ncharged with in the first count.\r\nSecond, this is not a case in which the prosecutor's\r\nalleged misconduct was \"pervasive,\" see Manning, 23 F.3d at 575, or\r\n\"repeated,\" see Auch, 187 F.3d at 129.  The fact that the\r\nchallenged statement was an isolated remark made during a four-day\r\ntrial weighs heavily against a finding that the alleged misconduct\r\nwas severe.  See United States v. Palmer, No. 99-1260, 2000 WL\r\n126615, at *2 (1st Cir. Jan. 14, 2000) (\"As a one-time misstatement\r\nat the end of a four-day trial, the prosecution's comment was\r\nneither so egregious nor so pervasive as to poison the well.\")\r\nB. Context\r\nThe context of the prosecutor's statement also weighs\r\nagainst a conclusion that a new trial is required.  Challenged\r\ncomments are considered in their broader context, not in isolation. \r\nSee Auch, 187 F.3d at 129.  As the government points out in its\r\nbrief, the context here is one in which the defendant himself\r\nrepeatedly said in front of the jury that he had lied.  While being\r\nquestioned by his own attorney, Rodrguez stated three times that\r\nhe had lied to Guzman in order to help Carrin.  During cross-\r\nexamination, he acknowledged again that he had lied to Guzman.  \r\nFurthermore, the prosecutor's statement was made between the\r\njudge's presentation of two versions of the stipulation, both of\r\nwhich stated that Rodrguez had told Guzman that he had lied to\r\nher.  In a context in which the defendant repeatedly stated that he\r\nhad lied, and even stipulated to the fact, the cumulative impact of\r\nthe prosecutor's remark is negligible.\r\nC. Curative Instructions and Strength of the Evidence Against the\r\nDefendant\r\nIn light of the limited severity of the misconduct and\r\nthe context in which it occurred, the last two factors can be dealt\r\nwith briefly.  First, while in some circumstances the lack of a\r\ncurative instruction may weigh in favor of a new trial, see, e.g.,\r\nManning, 23 F.3d at 575, we do not believe it does here.  Although\r\nthe judge gave no curative instructions per se, he expressed his\r\nagreement with defense counsel's objection at the time the\r\nprosecutor made the challenged remark, and later instructed the\r\njury that statements by counsel were not to be considered as\r\nevidence.  Second, while the evidence against Rodrguez was not\r\noverwhelming, cf. Auch, 187 F.3d at 130, it was not so slight that\r\nthe single remark being challenged could have tipped the balance.\r\n                             IV\r\n\"The remedy of a new trial is rarely used; it is\r\nwarranted only where there would be a miscarriage of justice or\r\nwhere the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.\"\r\nGonzalez-Gonzalez, 136 F.3d at 12 (internal quotation marks and \r\ncitation omitted).  We do not condone the prosecutor's remark; as\r\nthis court has stated, it is highly improper for a prosecutor to\r\ncall a defendant a liar.  See United States v. Rodrguez-Estrada,\r\n877 F.2d 153, 158-59 (1st Cir. 1989).  Our review of the record,\r\nhowever, convinces us that the prosecutor's statement did not\r\naffect the outcome of the trial.  The district court's denial of\r\nRodrguez's motion for a new trial is affirmed.\n",

Under these circumstances, the most plausible\r\nconclusion is that the prosecutor's remark (\"he also lied\")\r\nreferred to some aspect of Rodrguez's conversations with Guzman. \r\nThat conversation did not have to do with the lie Rodrguez was\r\ncharged with in the first count.\r\nSecond, this is not a case in which the prosecutor's\r\nalleged misconduct was \"pervasive,\" see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Manning,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, or\r\n\"repeated,\" see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765610\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Auch,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/765610/united-states-v-enrique-auch-aka-rickie-auch/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  The fact that the\r\nchallenged statement was an isolated remark made during a four-day\r\ntrial weighs heavily against a finding that the alleged misconduct\r\nwas severe.  See United States v. Palmer, No. 99-1260, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">126615</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (1st Cir. Jan. 14, 2000) (\"As a one-time misstatement\r\nat the end of a four-day trial, the prosecution's comment was\r\nneither so egregious nor so pervasive as to poison the well.\")\r\nB. Context\r\nThe context of the prosecutor's statement also weighs\r\nagainst a conclusion that a new trial is required.  Challenged\r\ncomments are considered in their broader context, not in isolation. \r\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765610\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Auch,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/765610/united-states-v-enrique-auch-aka-rickie-auch/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  As the government points out in its\r\nbrief, the context here is one in which the defendant himself\r\nrepeatedly said in front of the jury that he had lied.  While being\r\nquestioned by his own attorney, Rodrguez stated three times that\r\nhe had lied to Guzman in order to help Carrin.  During cross-\r\nexamination, he acknowledged again that he had lied to Guzman.  \r\nFurthermore, the prosecutor's statement was made between the\r\njudge's presentation of two versions of the stipulation, both of\r\nwhich stated that Rodrguez had told Guzman that he had lied to\r\nher.  In a context in which the defendant repeatedly stated that he\r\nhad lied, and even stipulated to the fact, the cumulative impact of\r\nthe prosecutor's remark is negligible.\r\nC. Curative Instructions and Strength of the Evidence Against the\r\nDefendant\r\nIn light of the limited severity of the misconduct and\r\nthe context in which it occurred, the last two factors can be dealt\r\nwith briefly.  First, while in some circumstances the lack of a\r\ncurative instruction may weigh in favor of a new trial, see, e.g.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Manning,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we do not believe it does here.  Although\r\nthe judge gave no curative instructions per se, he expressed his\r\nagreement with defense counsel's objection at the time the\r\nprosecutor made the challenged remark, and later instructed the\r\njury that statements by counsel were not to be considered as\r\nevidence.  Second, while the evidence against Rodrguez was not\r\noverwhelming, cf. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765610\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Auch,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/765610/united-states-v-enrique-auch-aka-rickie-auch/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, it was not so slight that\r\nthe single remark being challenged could have tipped the balance.\r\n                             IV\r\n\"The remedy of a new trial is rarely used; it is\r\nwarranted only where there would be a miscarriage of justice or\r\nwhere the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.\"\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(internal quotation marks and \r\ncitation omitted).  We do not condone the prosecutor's remark; as\r\nthis court has stated, it is highly improper for a prosecutor to\r\ncall a defendant a liar.  See United States v. Rodrguez-Estrada,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158-59 (1st Cir. 1989).  Our review of the record,\r\nhowever, convinces us that the prosecutor's statement did not\r\naffect the outcome of the trial.  The district court's denial of\r\nRodrguez's motion for a new trial is affirmed.\n</pre>",
