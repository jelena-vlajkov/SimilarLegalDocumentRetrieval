This convoluted dispute arises\n\nout   of    Rene   Hernández-Arencibia's    efforts     to   collect   on    a\n\npromissory note signed by Claudio González-Morales and Isabel\n\nMateo-González to finance their hardware concern, La Americana\n\nHome Center & Distributing Co., Inc (\"La Americana\").1                      To\n\nrecover the allegedly outstanding debt, Hernández filed suit in\n\nthe San Juan Superior Court for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nand obtained an ex parte attachment order.            With these Puerto\n\nRico proceedings ongoing, the Gonzálezes sued Hernández, his\n\nwife \"Jane Doe,\" and their conjugal partnership 2 in federal\n\ncourt, claiming that the attachment of their property violated\n\nthe   due    process   clause   of   the   Fourteenth    Amendment,     the\n\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1961 et seq. (RICO), and Puerto Rico law.             The district court\n\ndismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for\n\n\"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"                We\n\nnow affirm.\n\n\n\n      1\n     The Gonzálezes, their conjugal partnership, and La\nAmericana (which the Gonzálezes own) are all plaintiffs in this\nsuit. For ease of reference, we refer to the plaintiffs\ncollectively as the Gonzálezes.\n      2\n     The complaint alleges on information and belief that\nHernández is married to a \"Jane Doe . . . who is presumptively\nthe co-administrator of the conjugal partnership.\" Complaint ¶\n5.     As the complaint exclusively challenges Hernández's\nconduct, we simply refer to Hernández.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                                        I.\n\n           We recite the facts as alleged in the complaint.                         See\n\nLangadinos v.       American Airlines, 199 F.3d 68, 69 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).     Claudio      and    Isabel    González        purchased      a   hardware\n\nbusiness from Maderera Hato Rey, Inc. (\"Maderera\"), a retailer\n\nof lumber and construction materials owned by Hernández.                             As\n\npart of the purchase, the Gonzálezes personally guaranteed a\n\n$400,000 promissory note, with requirements of monthly payments\n\nand payment of the balance due on July 31, 1995.                     Unable to make\n\nall payments, the Gonzálezes owed about $50,000 at the time the\n\nnote was due.       As a result, Hernández filed several suits in the\n\nPuerto Rico courts, including suits to evict La Americana from\n\nits   rented   premises       (filed    by    Pego   Realty     Corp.,      owned    by\n\nHernández),     a    suit     for    rent,    and    a   suit   to    recover       the\n\npromissory note debt (filed by Hernández personally).\n\n           When Hernández filed suit to collect on the promissory\n\nnote, he simultaneously moved for an ex parte attachment of the\n\nGonzálezes' property.          The    Puerto Rico court ordered Hernández\n\n\"to show by authentic means the existence of indebtedness [and]\n\nthat it is for an amount certain, payable on demand, and due\"\n\nand also to show \"the extraordinary circumstances that would\n\nwarrant the attachment writ be granted without a hearing.\"\n\nHernández filed a motion in compliance, offering the contract\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\ffor the sale of the hardware business (which included the terms\n\nof   the   promissory       note),    a   document        allegedly     establishing\n\nHernández's        rights    to    collect      on    the    note,     and    a   sworn\n\naffidavit.        The court granted a writ of attachment and Hernández\n\nseized various equipment from La Americana.                           Following the\n\nattachment, the court evaluated motions and heard argument as to\n\nwhether Hernández could personally collect on a promissory note\n\nissued     to    his    company,   Maderera,         an   issue     which    turned    on\n\nwhether the note had properly been assigned to Hernández.                             The\n\ncourt eventually determined that Hernández had made a sufficient\n\nshowing to move forward and that the attachment would remain in\n\neffect     until       \"testimonial   proof      is       heard.\"      Although       the\n\ncomplaint is unclear, at some point Hernández apparently posted\n\na bond in connection with the attachment.\n\n                The Gonzálezes then brought the instant suit in federal\n\ncourt, arguing that Hernández had violated their constitutional\n\nrights (a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), RICO, and a\n\nnumber of Puerto Rico laws.               The district court dismissed the\n\nsuit for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), because the Gonzálezes had\n\nnot demonstrated state action as required by § 1983 and because\n\nthey had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a RICO\n\nviolation.        As no federal claims had been properly pled, the\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdistrict   court      dismissed   the   Puerto   Rico   law    counts.      See\n\nCamelio v. American Fed'n, 137 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nThe Gonzálezes filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,\n\narguing, inter alia, that Hernández was a \"state actor\" because\n\nhe used attachment procedures that the Supreme Court of Puerto\n\nRico had declared unconstitutional in             Rivera v.         Stowell, 93\n\nJ.T.S. 111 (1993).       Rejecting this view, the trial court denied\n\nthe motion.      On appeal, the Gonzálezes argue that the district\n\ncourt    erred   in   dismissing   their   claim    that      the    attachment\n\nviolated due process and their RICO claim.3\n\n           Our    review   under   Rule    12(b)(6)     is    plenary.      See\n\nLangadinos, 199 F.3d at 69. \"[W]e may affirm a dismissal for\n\nfailure to state a claim only if it clearly appears, according\n\nto the facts alleged, that the plaintiff cannot recover on any\n\nviable      theory.\"        Id.     (quoting       Correa-Martinez           v.\n\nArrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                                    II.\n\n           The Gonzálezes allege that Hernández violated their due\n\nprocess rights by attaching their property.                   They invoke 42\n\n\n    3 The Gonzálezes' brief focuses exclusively on the attachment\nand RICO issues. While the Gonzálezes' assert that \"the amended\ncomplaint contains other distinct actionable claims under §\n1983,\"   they fail to develop any argument in favor of these\nsupposed other claims. See United States v. Hughes, 211 F.3d\n676, 684 n.6 (1st Cir. 2000) (party waives issue by failing to\ndevelop argument).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fU.S.C. § 1983, which provides a cause of action for \"deprivation\n\nof   any   rights,       privileges,         or    immunities    secured       by    the\n\nConstitution and laws.\"              Section 1983, however, does not provide\n\nrelief against most private individuals: the deprivation must be\n\ncaused     by    a    person    acting       \"under     color   of     any    statute,\n\nordinance,       regulation,         custom,      or   usage,   of   any     State    or\n\nTerritory or the District of Columbia.\" Id.                     As the \"color of\"\n\nlaw requirement restricts § 1983 to \"state action,\" Lugar v.\n\nEdmondson       Oil    Co.,    457    U.S.   922,      935   (1982),    the    alleged\n\ndeprivation must be \"fairly attributable to the State,\" id. at\n\n937.\n\n            The \"fair attribution\" test requires both a state\n\npolicy and a state actor. The state policy component requires\n\nthat the deprivation \"be caused by the exercise of some right or\n\nprivilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed\n\nby the state or by a person for whom the State is responsible.\"\n\nId. at 940.          The state actor component requires that \"the party\n\ncharged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be\n\nsaid to be a state actor.\"              Id. 940-41; accord Casa Marie, Inc.\n\nv. Superior Court of Puerto Rico, 988 F.2d 252, 258 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     A defendant may be a state actor because he is a state\n\nofficial, because he acted together with a state official, or\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fbecause his conduct is       otherwise chargeable to the State.      See\n\nCasa Marie, 988 F.2d at 258.\n\n               Citing Lugar, the Gonzálezes argue that Hernández can\n\nbe sued under § 1983 because he used the state courts to attach\n\ntheir property unconstitutionally.          Although \"something more\n\nthan mere resort to a state court is required\" to transform a §\n\n1983 defendant into a state actor, Casa Marie, 988 F.2d at 259,\n\nLugar makes clear that in some circumstances the private use of\n\na state's attachment proceedings can give rise to a § 1983\n\nclaim.    See 457 U.S. at 941. The Supreme Court stated:\n\n                      While private misuse of a state\n               statute does not describe conduct that can\n               be attributed to the State, the procedural\n               scheme created by that statute obviously is\n               the product of state action.        This is\n               subject to constitutional restraints and may\n               be properly addressed in a § 1983 action, if\n               the second element of the state-action\n               requirement [a \"state actor\"] is met as\n               well.\n\nId.     Applying this dichotomy, the Supreme Court held that the\n\ncount     of    the   petitioner's    complaint   which   attacked   the\n\nattachment as \"malicious, wanton, willful, opressive [sic],\n\n[and] unlawful\", did not state a constitutional claim since it\n\nonly alleged the private misuse of the state procedures.         Id. at\n\n940.     A second count of the complaint, however, challenged the\n\nstate statute as procedurally defective under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. See id. at 940-41. The fact that the challenged\n\n                                     -8-\n\fscheme allowed a private party to invoke the state power of\n\nattachment upon ex parte application created a sufficient nexus\n\nbetween state and individual to demonstrate state action and\n\npermit a § 1983 suit against the individual who sought the\n\nattachment.       See id. at 942.\n\n            The    Gonzálezes   claim      that   they   too   have   alleged\n\nreliance    by    the   defendants    on    unconstitutional     attachment\n\nprocedures    because      Puerto   Rico   Civil    Procedure    Rule   56.4,\n\ngoverning    ex    parte   attachments,     is    unconstitutional.      Rule\n\n56.4's language does not explicitly require a showing of either\n\nexigent circumstances or documentary proof that a debt is due.\n\nSee Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 18 (1991) (holding that\n\nattachment statute allowing tort plaintiff to attach property ex\n\nparte without a showing of exigent circumstances violated due\n\nprocess); Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co.,             416 U.S. 600, 609 (1974)\n\n(noting that ex parte procedure requiring documentary proof of\n\ndebt due provides due process).            In Rivera v. Stowell, 93 JTS\n\n111 (1993), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico recognized the\n\ndifficulties with Rule 56.4's language:\n\n                   Rule 56.4 currently in force is\n            unconstitutional inasmuch as it permits that\n            a court issue an attachment order, without\n            holding   a  previous   hearing,   in   those\n            situations in which the claimant: has not\n            alleged or demonstrated having a previous\n            proprietary interest in the attached object,\n            Mitchell,   ante;   has   not    alleged   or\n\n                                     -9-\n\f          demonstrated the existence of extraordinary\n          circumstances, Doehr, ante; nor has alleged\n          or   demonstrated    the   possibility   of\n          prevailing by means of documentary proof\n          whereby it may be established the debt is\n          determinate, due and payable on demand.\n          Only in these three situations may a Court\n          defer holding such a hearing after the\n          attachment has been effected.4\n\n          While Rivera makes plain that some applications of Rule\n\n56.4 are constitutionally deficient, the Gonzálezes cannot state\n\na § 1983 claim by citing those deficiencies.         Instead, they must\n\nallege constitutional deficiencies in the ex parte procedures\n\nused to attach their property.          The Gonzálezes' complaint makes\n\nclear   that   in   this   case   the    court   required   Hernández   to\n\ndemonstrate both proof of debt and exigent circumstances before\n\nauthorizing the ex parte attachment.          The complaint states that\n\nthe Court issued the following order:\n\n                In 15 days the party plaintiff (that\n          is: Hernández) shall strictly comply with\n\n\n    4We note that the parties failed to provide a translation of\nRivera as we require.     See Local Rule 30(d) (\"Whenever an\nopinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is cited in a brief\nor oral argument which does not appear in the bound volumes in\nEnglish, an official, certified or stipulated translation\nthereof . . . shall be filed.\").      While \"we may commission\nunofficial translations and impose on the offending parties the\ncosts incurred and, where appropriate, sanctions,\" Lama v.\nBorras, 16 F.3d 473, 478 n.6 (1st Cir. 1994), in this case we\nsimply rely on the quotations in the parties' briefs. To the\nextent that the Gonzálezes would offer additional arguments\nbased on portions of the Rivera opinion that they did not\ntranslate, they waive those arguments by failing to provide the\ntranslation.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f            Rivera v. Stowell, 93 J.T.S. 111 and show by\n            authentic    means   (fehacientemente)    the\n            existence of the indebtedness, that is for\n            an amount certain, payable on demand, and\n            due, etc.   See 93 JTS page 10934.    In the\n            same fashion [Hernández] must show by his\n            sworn     statement    the     extraordinary\n            circumstances that would warrant that the\n            attachment   writ   be  granted   without   a\n            hearing.\n\nComplaint    ¶    14.   In     order   to     establish    state   action,    the\n\ncomplaint must at least allege that these attachment procedures\n\nwere unconstitutional.5\n\n            The Gonzálezes do not argue that the trial court's\n\ndecision     to    require     proof     of     indebtedness       and   exigent\n\ncircumstances violated their constitutional rights.                      Instead,\n\nthe adjective-laden and often repetitive allegations of the\n\nthirty-six page complaint challenge the attachment proceedings\n\non three other grounds that are not actionable under § 1983.\n\nFirst,   the      Gonzálezes    challenge       Hernández's    allegedly      bad\n\nmotives in moving for the attachment, arguing that Hernández\n\nsought     the    attachment     to     \"vex,     annoy,    and     harass    the\n\n\n    5Of course, \"[t]he court is not required to accept legal\nconclusions as true when considering a motion to dismiss.\" New\nEngland Cleaning Servs., Inc. v. American Arbitration Assoc.,\n199 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir. 1999). Thus, a court could still\ndismiss the Gonzálezes' complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) on the\nground that the procedures described in the complaint did not,\nas a matter of law, violate due process. We need not explore\nthis issue, as the Gonzálezes fail even to allege that the\nprocedures actually used by the Puerto Rico court were\nconstitutionally defective.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fplaintiffs,\" Complaint ¶ 6, and to \"cause economic harm . . .\n\nand humiliate\" them, id. ¶ 7.        Second, the Gonzálezes allege\n\nthat Hernández lied to the court to obtain the attachment.       The\n\ncomplaint accuses Hernández of \"false representations, spurious\n\ndocuments, and brazen trickery,\" id. ¶ 89, and states that \"the\n\ndefendant at all times knew, willfully ignored, and kept from\n\nthe Court\" the fact that the attachment was inappropriate, id.\n\n¶ 7.       Third, the Gonzálezes challenge the evidentiary basis for\n\nthe court's decision, pointing to supposed deficiencies in the\n\nproof on exigent circumstances and the existence of a debt, see\n\nid. ¶¶ 8, 79-81, 86-88, 96-97.6\n\n              At bottom, then, the Gonzálezes allege nothing more\n\nthan improper motives and misrepresentations on the part of\n\nHernández and an incorrect assessment of evidence by the Puerto\n\nRico court.       While the Gonzálezes point to problems with Puerto\n\nRico Civil Procedure Rule 56.4, they do not challenge the Rivera\n\nprocedures actually employed by the trial court.7       As a result,\n\n\n       6\n     Challenges to the Puerto Rico court's evaluation of\nevidence, as the district court noted, are \"obviously\ninappropriate.\" See generally Hill v. Town of Conway, 193 F.3d\n33, 41 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[F]ederal courts do not have\njurisdiction pursuant to § 1983 to review the judgments and\ndecisions of state courts.\" (quoting Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal\nJurisdiction 423 (1994))).\n       7\n     Although the Gonzálezes imply that the court's post-\nattachment   hearings  were   inadequate,   the  constitutional\nchallenge in the complaint is not directed at this issue and the\n\n                                  -12-\n\fthe § 1983 complaint against Hernández was properly dismissed\n\nfor a lack of state action.     See Gene Thompson Lumber Co. v.\n\nDavis Parmer   Lumber Co., 984 F.2d 401, 404 (11th Cir. 1993) (no\n\n§ 1983 claim for mere misuse of attachment procedures); Jones v.\n\nPoindexter, 903 F.2d 1006, 1011 (4th Cir. 1990) (same, regarding\n\nmisuse of state process); Hassett v.

See 18 U.S.C. 1962(c).   In\n\npertinent part, § 1962(c) reads as follows:\n\n         It shall be unlawful for any person employed\n         by or associated with any enterprise engaged\n         in, or the activities of which affect,\n         interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct\n         or participate, directly or indirectly, in\n         the conduct of such enterprises's affairs\n         through a pattern of racketeering activity\n         or collection of unlawful debt.\n\n\n\n\nGonzálezes fail to offer developed argument on this point. See\nComplaint ¶¶ 95-97; see also Doyle v. Hasbro, 103 F.3d 186, 190\n(1st Cir. 1996) (\"In conducting our review of the case, we are\nlimited to those allegations contained in the amended\ncomplaint.\"); United States v. Hughes, 211 F.3d 676, 684 n.6\n(1st Cir. 2000) (arguments not developed are waived).\n\n                              -13-\n\fTo establish a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" the RICO\n\nplaintiff must point to at least two predicate acts enumerated\n\nin 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).      See Feinstein v.        Resolution Trust\n\nCorp.,   942   F.2d   34,   41     (1st    Cir.   1991).     However,\n\n\"[r]acketeering acts . . .       do not constitute a pattern simply\n\nbecause they number two or more.\"        Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc.,\n\n814 F.2d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1987); see Fleet Credit Corp. v. Sion,\n\n893 F.2d 441, 444 (1st Cir. 1990).        The plaintiff must also show\n\nthat the acts are related and that they demonstrate a threat of\n\ncontinued criminal activity.      See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell\n\nTel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).\n\n          The Gonzálezes allege that the pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity consisted of \"extortion\" and \"attempted extortion\"\n\nthrough the filing of various suits in response to the non-\n\npayment of the promissory note.      See § 1961(1)(A) (racketeering\n\nactivity includes \"any act or threat involving . . . extortion\n\n. . . which is chargeable under State law and punishable by\n\nimprisonment for more than one year\").8       Although we will assume\n\nthat the filing of frivolous suits may constitute RICO extortion\n\n\n\n    8The Gonzálezes also point to \"predicate acts\" of assault,\nillegal eviction from their property, and fraud under Puerto\nRico law in obtaining the attachment.        These violations,\nhowever, are not enumerated as predicate acts under § 1961(1)\n(listing criminal activity that can be considered predicate act\nfor RICO purposes).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fin some instances, see, e.g., Lemelson v. Wang Labs., Inc., 874\n\nF. Supp 430, 433 (D. Mass. 1994), in this case the Gonzálezes do\n\nnot make out the kind of pattern that poses \"a threat of\n\ncontinued criminal activity.\"              H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239.\n\nCourts \"have consistently held that a single episode does not\n\nconstitute a 'pattern,' even if that single episode involves\n\nbehavior that amounts to several crimes (for example, several\n\nunlawful mailings).\"        Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Jacobson, 967\n\nF.2d 720, 723 (1st Cir. 1992) (Breyer, C.J.).            \"Instead, courts\n\nhave tended to find RICO 'patterns' only where the defendant's\n\nconduct    consists   of    'multiple   criminal    episodes'      over   long\n\nperiods of time.\"       Schultz v Rhode Island Hospital Trust Nat'l\n\nBank, N.A., 94 F.3d 721, 731-32 (1st Cir. 1996); see also H.J.\n\nInc., 492 U.S. at 242 (\"Congress was concerned in RICO with\n\nlong-term criminal conduct.\").\n\n           As the Gonzálezes acknowledge in the complaint, all of\n\nthe \"predicate acts . . . have their origin in the forementioned\n\n[sic] Contract for Purchase of Assets.\"            Complaint ¶ 103.        The\n\nmere fact that separate proceedings were instituted (one to\n\nevict La Americana from the rental property, another to collect\n\non   the   promissory      note,   etc.)    does   not   convert    what    is\n\nessentially a single episode into the kind of pattern that\n\ndemonstrates a threat of continued activity.             See J.D. Marshall\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fInt'l Inc., v. Redstart, Inc., 935 F.2d 815, 820-21 (7th Cir.\n\n1991) (no pattern in \"a single scheme . . . involv[ing] a single\n\nvictim . . . predicated upon a single transaction--the Purchase\n\nAgreement.\"); SIL-SLO Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516\n\n(10th Cir. 1990) (\"At most, what has been alleged is a business\n\ndeal    gone   sour   .    .    .     constitut[ing]       a   single   scheme   to\n\naccomplish one discrete goal, directed at one individual with no\n\npotential to extend to other persons or entities.\").                    Similarly,\n\nthe fact that some of the local court suits are still pending\n\ndoes not constitute long-term conduct demonstrating a threat of\n\nfuture activity.      See Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926\n\nF.2d 1406, 1417-19 (3d Cir. 1991) (\"[I]t is of little importance\n\nthat a particular injury was inflicted over an extended period\n\nof time, rather than all at once.\"); United States Textiles,\n\nInc. v.

Thus, we need not address whether the\n\nother    elements     of       RICO    (such    as   the       allegation   of   an\n\n\"enterprise\") were pled appropriately.                     The RICO claim was\n\nproperly dismissed.\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -17-\n\f",

With these Puerto Rico proceedings ongoing, the Gonzalezes sued Hernandez, his wife \"Jane Doe,\" and their conjugal partnership<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in federal court, claiming that the attachment of their property violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961 et seq. (RICO), and Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" We now affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts as alleged in the complaint. See Langadinos v. American Airlines, 199 F.3d 68, 69 (1st Cir. 2000). Claudio and Isabel Gonzalez purchased a hardware business from Maderera Hato Rey, Inc. (\"Maderera\"), a retailer of lumber and construction materials owned by Hernandez. As part of the purchase, the Gonzalezes personally guaranteed a $400,000 promissory note, with requirements of monthly payments and payment of the balance due on July 31, 1995. Unable to make all payments, the Gonzalezes owed about $50,000 at the time the note was due. As a result, Hernandez filed several suits in the Puerto Rico courts, including suits to evict La Americana from its rented premises (filed by Pego Realty Corp., owned by Hernandez), a suit for rent, and a suit to recover the promissory note debt (filed by Hernandez personally).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Hernandez filed suit to collect on the promissory note, he simultaneously moved for an ex parte attachment of the Gonzalezes' property. The Puerto Rico court ordered Hernandez \"to show by authentic means the existence of indebtedness [and] that it is for an amount certain, payable on demand, and due\" and also to show \"the extraordinary circumstances that would warrant the attachment writ be granted without a hearing.\" Hernandez filed a motion in compliance, offering the contract for the sale of the hardware business (which included the terms of the promissory note), a document allegedly establishing Hernandez's rights to collect on the note, and a sworn affidavit. The court granted a writ of attachment and Hernandez seized various equipment from La Americana. Following the attachment, the court evaluated motions and heard argument as to whether Hernandez could personally collect on a promissory note issued to his company, Maderera, an issue which turned on whether the note had properly been assigned to Hernandez. The court eventually determined that Hernandez had made a sufficient showing to move forward and that the attachment would remain in effect until \"testimonial proof is heard.\" Although the complaint is unclear, at some point Hernandez apparently posted a bond in connection with the attachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gonzalezes then brought the instant suit in federal court, arguing that Hernandez had violated their constitutional rights (a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983), RICO, and a number of Puerto Rico laws. The district court dismissed the suit for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), because the Gonzalezes had not demonstrated state action as required by &#167; 1983 and because they had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a RICO violation. As no federal claims had been properly pled, the district court dismissed the Puerto Rico law counts. See Camelio v. American Fed'n, 137 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir. 1998). The Gonzalezes filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, arguing, inter alia, that Hernandez was a \"state actor\" because he used attachment procedures that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico had declared unconstitutional in Rivera v. Stowell, 93 J.T.S. 111 (1993). Rejecting this view, the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the Gonzalezes argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claim that the attachment violated due process and their RICO claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review under Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary. See Langadinos, 199 F.3d at 69. \"[W]e may affirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim only if it clearly appears, according to the facts alleged, that the plaintiff cannot recover on any viable theory.\" Id. (quoting Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gonzalezes allege that Hernandez violated their due process rights by attaching their property. They invoke 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which provides a cause of action for \"deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\" Section 1983, however, does not provide relief against most private individuals: the deprivation must be caused by a person acting \"under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia.\" Id. As the \"color of\" law requirement restricts &#167; 1983 to \"state action,\" Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 935 (1982), the alleged deprivation must be \"fairly attributable to the State,\" id. at 937.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"fair attribution\" test requires both a state policy and a state actor. The state policy component requires that the deprivation \"be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the State is responsible.\" Id. at 940. The state actor component requires that \"the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\" Id. 940-41; accord Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of Puerto Rico, 988 F.2d 252, 258 (1st Cir. 1992). A defendant may be a state actor because he is a state official, because he acted together with a state official, or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the State. See Casa Marie, 988 F.2d at 258.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing Lugar, the Gonzalezes argue that Hernandez can be sued under &#167; 1983 because he used the state courts to attach their property unconstitutionally. Although \"something more than mere resort to a state court is required\" to transform a &#167; 1983 defendant into a state actor, Casa Marie, 988 F.2d at 259, Lugar makes clear that in some circumstances the private use of a state's attachment proceedings can give rise to a &#167; 1983 claim. See 457 U.S. at 941. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While private misuse of a state statute does not describe conduct that can be attributed to the State, the procedural scheme created by that statute obviously is the product of state action. This is subject to constitutional restraints and may be properly addressed in a &#167; 1983 action, if the second element of the state-action requirement [a \"state actor\"] is met as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. Applying this dichotomy, the Supreme Court held that the count of the petitioner's complaint which attacked the attachment as \"malicious, wanton, willful, opressive [sic], [and] unlawful\", did not state a constitutional claim since it only alleged the private misuse of the state procedures. Id. at 940. A second count of the complaint, however, challenged the state statute as procedurally defective under the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. at 940-41. The fact that the challenged scheme allowed a private party to invoke the state power of attachment upon ex parte application created a sufficient nexus between state and individual to demonstrate state action and permit a &#167; 1983 suit against the individual who sought the attachment. See id. at 942.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gonzalezes claim that they too have alleged reliance by the defendants on unconstitutional attachment procedures because Puerto Rico Civil Procedure Rule 56.4, governing ex parte attachments, is unconstitutional. Rule 56.4's language does not explicitly require a showing of either exigent circumstances or documentary proof that a debt is due. See Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 18 (1991) (holding that attachment statute allowing tort plaintiff to attach property ex parte without a showing of exigent circumstances violated due process); Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 609 (1974) (noting that ex parte procedure requiring documentary proof of debt due provides due process). In Rivera v. Stowell, 93 JTS 111, (1993) the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico recognized the difficulties with Rule 56.4's language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56.4 currently in force is unconstitutional inasmuch as it permits that a court issue an attachment order, without holding a previous hearing, in those situations in which the claimant: has not alleged or demonstrated having a previous proprietary interest in the attached object, Mitchell, ante; has not alleged or demonstrated the existence of extraordinary circumstances, Doehr, ante; nor has alleged or demonstrated the possibility of prevailing by means of documentary proof whereby it may be established the debt is determinate, due and payable on demand. Only in these three situations may a Court defer holding such a hearing after the attachment has been effected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Rivera makes plain that some applications of Rule 56.4 are constitutionally deficient, the Gonzalezes cannot state a &#167; 1983 claim by citing those deficiencies. Instead, they must allege constitutional deficiencies in the ex parte procedures used to attach their property. The Gonzalezes' complaint makes clear that in this case the court required Hernandez to demonstrate both proof of debt and exigent circumstances before authorizing the ex parte attachment. The complaint states that the Court issued the following order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 15 days the party plaintiff (that is: Hernandez) shall strictly comply with Rivera v. Stowell, 93 J.T.S. 111 and show by authentic means (fehacientemente) the existence of the indebtedness, that is for an amount certain, payable on demand, and due, etc. See 93 JTS page 10934. In the same fashion [Hernandez] must show by his sworn statement the extraordinary circumstances that would warrant that the attachment writ be granted without a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complaint &#182; 14. In order to establish state action, the complaint must at least allege that these attachment procedures were unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gonzalezes do not argue that the trial court's decision to require proof of indebtedness and exigent circumstances violated their constitutional rights. Instead, the adjective-laden and often repetitive allegations of the thirty-six page complaint challenge the attachment proceedings on three other grounds that are not actionable under &#167; 1983. First, the Gonzalezes challenge Hernandez's allegedly bad motives in moving for the attachment, arguing that Hernandez sought the attachment to \"vex, annoy, and harass the plaintiffs,\" Complaint &#182; 6, and to \"cause economic harm... and humiliate\" them, id. &#182; 7. Second, the Gonzalezes allege that Hernandez lied to the court to obtain the attachment. The complaint accuses Hernandez of \"false representations, spurious documents, and brazen trickery,\" id. &#182; 89, and states that \"the defendant at all times knew, willfully ignored, and kept from the Court\" the fact that the attachment was inappropriate, id. &#182; 7. Third, the Gonzalezes challenge the evidentiary basis for the court's decision, pointing to supposed deficiencies in the proof on exigent circumstances and the existence of a debt, see id. &#182;&#182; 8, 79-81, 86-88, 96-97.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, then, the Gonzalezes allege nothing more than improper motives and misrepresentations on the part of Hernandez and an incorrect assessment of evidence by the Puerto Rico court. While the Gonzalezes point to problems with Puerto Rico Civil Procedure Rule 56.4, they do not challenge the Rivera procedures actually employed by the trial court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As a result, the &#167; 1983 complaint against Hernandez was properly dismissed for a lack of state action. See Gene Thompson Lumber Co. v. Davis Parmer Lumber Co., 984 F.2d 401, 404 (11th Cir. 1993) (no &#167; 1983 claim for mere misuse of attachment procedures); Jones v. Poindexter, 903 F.2d 1006, 1011 (4th Cir. 1990) (same, regarding misuse of state process); Hassett v. LeMay Bank &amp; Trust Co., 851 F.2d 1127, 1130 (8th Cir. 1988) (same, regarding misuse of replevin).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gonzalezes also argue that the district court erred in dismissing their RICO claim. See 18 U.S.C. 1962(c). In pertinent part, &#167; 1962(c) reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprises's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" the RICO plaintiff must point to at least two predicate acts enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(1). See Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 1991). However, \"[r]acketeering acts... do not constitute a pattern simply because they number two or more.\" Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc., 814 F.2d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1987); see Fleet Credit Corp. v. Sion, 893 F.2d 441, 444 (1st Cir. 1990). The plaintiff must also show that the acts are related and that they demonstrate a threat of continued criminal activity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gonzalezes allege that the pattern of racketeering activity consisted of \"extortion\" and \"attempted extortion\" through the filing of various suits in response to the non-payment of the promissory note. See &#167; 1961(1)(A) (racketeering activity includes \"any act or threat involving... extortion... which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Although we will assume that the filing of frivolous suits may constitute RICO extortion in some instances, see, e.g., Lemelson v. Wang Labs., Inc., 874 F. Supp 430, 433 (D. Mass. 1994), in this case the Gonzalezes do not make out the kind of pattern that poses \"a threat of continued criminal activity.\" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239.

The mere fact that separate proceedings were instituted (one to evict La Americana from the rental property, another to collect on the promissory note, etc.) does not convert what is essentially a single episode into the kind of pattern that demonstrates a threat of continued activity. See J.D. Marshall Int'l Inc., v. Redstart, Inc., 935 F.2d 815, 820-21 (7th Cir. 1991) (no pattern in \"a single scheme... involv[ing] a single victim... predicated upon a single transaction--the Purchase Agreement.\"); SIL-SLO Inc. v.

Similarly, the fact that some of the local court suits are still pending does not constitute long-term conduct demonstrating a threat of future activity. See Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 F.2d 1406, 1417-19 (3d Cir. 1991) (\"[I]t is of little importance that a particular injury was inflicted over an extended period of time, rather than all at once.\"); United States Textiles, Inc. v.

With these Puerto Rico proceedings ongoing, the Gonzalezes sued Hernandez, his wife \"Jane Doe,\" and their conjugal partnership<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in federal court, claiming that the attachment of their property violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961 et seq. (RICO), and Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

Claudio and Isabel Gonzalez purchased a hardware business from Maderera Hato Rey, Inc. (\"Maderera\"), a retailer of lumber and construction materials owned by Hernandez. As part of the purchase, the Gonzalezes personally guaranteed a $400,000 promissory note, with requirements of monthly payments and payment of the balance due on July 31, 1995. Unable to make all payments, the Gonzalezes owed about $50,000 at the time the note was due. As a result, Hernandez filed several suits in the Puerto Rico courts, including suits to evict La Americana from its rented premises (filed by Pego Realty Corp., owned by Hernandez), a suit for rent, and a suit to recover the promissory note debt (filed by Hernandez personally).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Hernandez filed suit to collect on the promissory note, he simultaneously moved for an ex parte attachment of the Gonzalezes' property. The Puerto Rico court ordered Hernandez \"to show by authentic means the existence of indebtedness [and] that it is for an amount certain, payable on demand, and due\" and also to show \"the extraordinary circumstances that would warrant the attachment writ be granted without a hearing.\" Hernandez filed a motion in compliance, offering the contract for the sale of the hardware business (which included the terms of the promissory note), a document allegedly establishing Hernandez's rights to collect on the note, and a sworn affidavit. The court granted a writ of attachment and Hernandez seized various equipment from La Americana. Following the attachment, the court evaluated motions and heard argument as to whether Hernandez could personally collect on a promissory note issued to his company, Maderera, an issue which turned on whether the note had properly been assigned to Hernandez. The court eventually determined that Hernandez had made a sufficient showing to move forward and that the attachment would remain in effect until \"testimonial proof is heard.\" Although the complaint is unclear, at some point Hernandez apparently posted a bond in connection with the attachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gonzalezes then brought the instant suit in federal court, arguing that Hernandez had violated their constitutional rights (a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983), RICO, and a number of Puerto Rico laws. The district court dismissed the suit for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), because the Gonzalezes had not demonstrated state action as required by &#167; 1983 and because they had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a RICO violation. As no federal claims had been properly pled, the district court dismissed the Puerto Rico law counts. See Camelio v.

The Gonzalezes filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, arguing, inter alia, that Hernandez was a \"state actor\" because he used attachment procedures that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico had declared unconstitutional in Rivera v. Stowell, 93 J.T.S. 111 (1993). Rejecting this view, the trial court denied the motion.

Rule 56.4's language does not explicitly require a showing of either exigent circumstances or documentary proof that a debt is due. See Connecticut v. Doehr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112615\"><a href=\"/opinion/112615/connecticut-v-doehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18 (1991) (holding that attachment statute allowing tort plaintiff to attach property ex parte without a showing of exigent circumstances violated due process); Mitchell v.

In Rivera v. Stowell, 93 JTS 111, (1993) the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico recognized the difficulties with Rule 56.4's language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56.4 currently in force is unconstitutional inasmuch as it permits that a court issue an attachment order, without holding a previous hearing, in those situations in which the claimant: has not alleged or demonstrated having a previous proprietary interest in the attached object, Mitchell, ante; has not alleged or demonstrated the existence of extraordinary circumstances, Doehr, ante; nor has alleged or demonstrated the possibility of prevailing by means of documentary proof whereby it may be established the debt is determinate, due and payable on demand. Only in these three situations may a Court defer holding such a hearing after the attachment has been effected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Rivera makes plain that some applications of Rule 56.4 are constitutionally deficient, the Gonzalezes cannot state a &#167; 1983 claim by citing those deficiencies. Instead, they must allege constitutional deficiencies in the ex parte procedures used to attach their property. The Gonzalezes' complaint makes clear that in this case the court required Hernandez to demonstrate both proof of debt and exigent circumstances before authorizing the ex parte attachment. The complaint states that the Court issued the following order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 15 days the party plaintiff (that is: Hernandez) shall strictly comply with Rivera v.

In the same fashion [Hernandez] must show by his sworn statement the extraordinary circumstances that would warrant that the attachment writ be granted without a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complaint &#182; 14.

Instead, the adjective-laden and often repetitive allegations of the thirty-six page complaint challenge the attachment proceedings on three other grounds that are not actionable under &#167; 1983. First, the Gonzalezes challenge Hernandez's allegedly bad motives in moving for the attachment, arguing that Hernandez sought the attachment to \"vex, annoy, and harass the plaintiffs,\" Complaint &#182; 6, and to \"cause economic harm... and humiliate\" them, id. &#182; 7. Second, the Gonzalezes allege that Hernandez lied to the court to obtain the attachment. The complaint accuses Hernandez of \"false representations, spurious documents, and brazen trickery,\" id. &#182; 89, and states that \"the defendant at all times knew, willfully ignored, and kept from the Court\" the fact that the attachment was inappropriate, id. &#182; 7. Third, the Gonzalezes challenge the evidentiary basis for the court's decision, pointing to supposed deficiencies in the proof on exigent circumstances and the existence of a debt, see id. &#182;&#182; 8, 79-81, 86-88, 96-97.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, then, the Gonzalezes allege nothing more than improper motives and misrepresentations on the part of Hernandez and an incorrect assessment of evidence by the Puerto Rico court. While the Gonzalezes point to problems with Puerto Rico Civil Procedure Rule 56.4, they do not challenge the Rivera procedures actually employed by the trial court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As a result, the &#167; 1983 complaint against Hernandez was properly dismissed for a lack of state action.

See 18 U.S.C. 1962(c). In pertinent part, &#167; 1962(c) reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprises's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" the RICO plaintiff must point to at least two predicate acts enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(1).

The plaintiff must also show that the acts are related and that they demonstrate a threat of continued criminal activity. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel.

See &#167; 1961(1)(A) (racketeering activity includes \"any act or threat involving... extortion... which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Although we will assume that the filing of frivolous suits may constitute RICO extortion in some instances, see, e.g., Lemelson v. Wang Labs., Inc., 874 F. Supp 430, 433 (D.

The mere fact that separate proceedings were instituted (one to evict La Americana from the rental property, another to collect on the promissory note, etc.) does not convert what is essentially a single episode into the kind of pattern that demonstrates a threat of continued activity.

While the Gonzalezes' assert that \"the amended complaint contains other distinct actionable claims under &#167; 1983,\" they fail to develop any argument in favor of these supposed other claims. See United States v. Hughes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198913\"><a href=\"/opinion/198913/united-states-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 684 n.6 (1st Cir. 2000) (party waives issue by failing to develop argument).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  We note that the parties failed to provide a translation of Rivera as we require.

While \"we may commission unofficial translations and impose on the offending parties the costs incurred and, where appropriate, sanctions,\" Lama v.

To the extent that the Gonzalezes would offer additional arguments based on portions of the Rivera opinion that they did not translate, they waive those arguments by failing to provide the translation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Of course, \"[t]he court is not required to accept legal conclusions as true when considering a motion to dismiss.\" New England Cleaning Servs., Inc. v.

Thus, a court could still dismiss the Gonzalezes' complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground that the procedures described in the complaint did not, as a matter of law, violate due process.
