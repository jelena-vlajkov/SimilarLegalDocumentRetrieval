Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Edward L.

Curran, United States Attorney, and Donald C.\r\nLockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 7, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.    Petitioner Edward L. Mahan, III,\r\nappeals pro se from the denial of a 28 U.S.C.  2255 petition. \r\nThe district court granted a certificate of appealability\r\nlimited to the issue\r\n                              whether a criminal defendant who\r\n               was advised of his right to\r\n               appeal, afforded an opportunity\r\n               to exercise that right, and\r\n               still failed to affirmatively\r\n               exercise that right has in fact\r\n               waived his right to appeal.\r\nUpon review, we affirm.\r\n          As an initial matter, the district court's factual\r\nfinding that Mahan failed to ask his attorney to file a notice\r\nof appeal is not clearly erroneous.  See Strickland v.\r\nWashington, 466 U.S.  668, 698 (1984) (\"district court findings\r\n[made in the course of deciding an ineffective assistance\r\nclaim] are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 52(a)\"); Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 53 (1st\r\nCir. 1993) (applying clearly erroneous standard to factual\r\nfindings underpinning ineffective assistance claim).  The\r\nevidence, which included counsel's testimony as to his\r\ncustomary practice, supported competing inferences.  The\r\ndistrict court rejected the credibility of Mahan's testimony,\r\nand Mahan provides insufficient reason to second-guess this\r\njudgment. \r\n          Moreover, without deciding whether a request to\r\nappeal is always required, compare Ludwig v. United States, 162\r\nF.3d 456, 459 (6th Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he constitution is only\r\nimplicated when a defendant actually requests an appeal, and\r\nhis counsel disregards that request.\") with White v. Johnson,\r\n180 F.3d 648, 656 (5th Cir. 1999) (granting habeas relief where\r\ncounsel's failure to fully inform petitioner of his appellate\r\nrights caused him to lose the opportunity to appeal), we think\r\nthat the district court appropriately found waiver based on the\r\nabsence of an affirmative request where, as here: petitioner\r\nwas twice advised of his right to appeal by the sentencing\r\ncourt; petitioner pled guilty and his claim is limited to the\r\nloss of a sentencing appeal; petitioner conceded that counsel\r\nadvised him that the case law is against him on the sole\r\nsentencing issue preserved by counsel; and petitioner was in\r\ncontact with counsel's office after sentencing, and he could\r\nhave solicited further advice regarding the merits of an\r\nappeal, if necessary to a decision.   \r\n          Affirmed.\n",
