Morton A. Brody,* U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Donald K.

This appeal tests the limits of\n\na federal district court's authority to promulgate local rules.\n\nThe court below upheld a rule constraining the issuance of\n\nsubpoenas seeking client-related information from lawyers in\n\ncriminal cases.      Because we find that the rule falls outside the\n\npermissible scope of local rulemaking authority, we reverse.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Before      assaying      a     preliminary         question   of\n\njusticiability and addressing the controversy's merits, we trace\n\nthe origins of the challenged rule and chart the travel of the\n\ncase.\n\n             A.     The Evolution of Local Rule 3.8(f).\n\n           The 1980s witnessed a dramatic increase in the number\n\nof subpoenas served on defense attorneys by federal prosecutors.\n\nThe reasons for this trend are difficult to pinpoint, but some\n\ncommentators have linked it with heightened efforts to fight\n\norganized crime and drug-trafficking, new forfeiture laws, and\n\nan unprecedented expansion of the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nSee 1 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. & W. William Hodes, The Law of\n\nLawyering § 3.8:701, at 700 (Supp. 1996); Frank O. Bowman, III,\n\nA Bludgeon by Any Other Name, 9 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 665, 686\n\nn.74 (1996).      In 1985, mindful that forcing a lawyer to offer\n\nevidence   against    her   client   may    sow   seeds   of   mistrust   and\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fincrease    the   incidence    of       conflicted    interests,     the     DOJ\n\nintroduced guidelines for the issuance of attorney subpoenas,\n\nincluding an internal preapproval process.             See United States v.\n\nPerry, 847 F.2d 1346, 1347-48 (9th Cir. 1988) (citing United\n\nStates     Attorneys'   Manual      §    9-2.161(a)    (July   18,    1985)).\n\nResponding to the prodding of bar leaders, the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (the SJC) also took prophylactic action.\n\nIt adopted an ethics rule, known as Prosecutorial Function 15\n\n(PF 15), which stated that:\n\n            It   is   unprofessional   conduct   for  a\n            prosecutor to subpoena an attorney to a\n            grand jury without prior judicial approval\n            in circumstances where the prosecutor seeks\n            to compel the attorney/witness to provide\n            evidence   concerning   a  person   who  is\n            represented by the attorney/witness.\n\nS.J.C. R. 3:07, PF 15 (effective Jan. 1, 1986).\n\n            The United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts     thereafter   incorporated      PF    15   into   its     local\n\nrules.     PF 15 withstood the United States Attorney's ensuing\n\nchallenge by the narrowest of margins.                See United States v.\n\nKlubock, 639 F. Supp. 117 (D. Mass. 1986), aff'd, 832 F.2d 664\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (equally divided en banc).                  Crucial to the\n\ndistrict court's holding was the fact that PF 15 imposed no\n\nsubstantive limitations on the right to issue subpoenas.                     See\n\nid. at 120 & n.7, 124.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f          For the next twelve years, PF 15 held sway in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.      In the interim, the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court adopted a rule of conduct requiring prosecutors to\n\nobtain judicial approval prior to issuing attorney subpoenas.\n\nSee R.I. Sup. Ct. Rules, Art. V., R. Prof'l Conduct 3.8 & cmt.\n\n(adopted Nov. 1, 1988).     This rule closely resembled PF 15, with\n\ntwo significant deviations:       its reach extended to subpoenas\n\noutside the grand jury context, and its text included a comment\n\noutlining substantive standards to be applied by a court in\n\ndetermining whether to sanction an attorney subpoena request.\n\nSee id.   Specifically, the comment suggested that judicial\n\napprobation   should   be    withheld    unless,   inter   alia,   the\n\ninformation sought was (a) not privileged, (b) \"essential\" to\n\nthe government's investigation, and (c) unobtainable from any\n\n\"other feasible alternative.\"          Id.   When the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island incorporated the\n\nstate standard into its local rules on April 20, 1989, the\n\nUnited States Attorney for that district challenged it.             In\n\nWhitehouse v. United States District Court, 53 F.3d 1349 (1st\n\nCir. 1995), a panel of this court upheld the local rule, albeit\n\nstrongly suggesting that a different result would obtain were\n\nthe criteria limned in the comment embedded in the text of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\frule itself (and, thus, made mandatory rather than precatory).\n\nSee id. at 1357-58 & n.12.\n\n         We temporarily shift our focus to the national stage.\n\nIn 1990, the American Bar Association (the ABA) amended Rule 3.8\n\nof the Model Rules of Professional Conduct by adding a new\n\nparagraph (f) and comment:\n\n         The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:\n\n         . . .\n         (f) not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or\n         other   criminal   proceeding      to   present\n         evidence about a past or present client\n         unless:\n           (1) the prosecutor reasonably believes:\n                (i) the information sought is\n                not protected from disclosure\n                by any applicable privilege;\n                (ii) the evidence sought is\n                essential to the successful\n                completion    of    an    ongoing\n                investigation or prosecution;\n                [and]\n                (iii)   there    is    no   other\n                feasible alternative to obtain\n                the information; and\n           (2)   the   prosecutor     obtains   prior\n           judicial approval after an opportunity\n           for an adversarial proceeding.\n\n         Comment\n\n         Paragraph (f) is intended to limit the\n         issuance of lawyer subpoenas in grand jury\n         and other criminal proceedings to those\n         situations in which there is a genuine need\n         to    intrude   into    the   client-lawyer\n         relationship. The prosecutor is required to\n         obtain court approval for the issuance of\n         the subpoena after an opportunity for an\n         adversarial hearing is afforded in order to\n\n                              -6-\n\f              assure an independent determination that the\n              applicable standards are met.\n\nABA Standing Comm. on Ethics and Prof'l Responsibility and\n\nSection of Criminal Justice, Report 118, at 1 (Feb. 1990).\n\nAfter the Third Circuit struck down a bar rule patterned on\n\nModel Rule 3.8(f), see Baylson v. Disciplinary Bd., 975 F.2d 102\n\n(3d Cir. 1992), the ABA retreated; it removed the judicial\n\npreapproval requirement by deleting both subparagraph (2) and\n\nthe second sentence of the comment.           See ABA Standing Comm. on\n\nEthics and Prof'l Responsibility, Report 101, at 1 (Aug. 1995).\n\n              On June 9, 1997, the SJC amended the Massachusetts Code\n\nof Professional Conduct to replace PF 15 with the (discarded)\n\n1990 version of Model Rule 3.8(f), omitting the second sentence\n\nof the comment, but including the rescinded subparagraph (2).\n\nSee S.J.C. R. 3:07, Rule 3.8(f) & cmt. 4.                The result was to\n\nalter PF 15 in three important respects:             extending it to trial\n\nas well as grand jury subpoenas; providing for an \"adversarial\n\nproceeding\" in advance of the issuance of an attorney subpoena;\n\nand   promulgating     three    substantive       standards    for   judicial\n\npreapproval.\n\n                      B.   The Instant Litigation.\n\n              By local rule, attorneys practicing in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts must\n\nadhere   to    the   ethical   rules    adopted    by   the   SJC,   unless   a\n\n                                       -7-\n\fspecific exception obtains.          See D. Mass. R. 83.6(4)(B).       On\n\nNovember 17, 1997, the United States Attorney for the District\n\nof Massachusetts, Donald K. Stern, wrote to the chief judge of\n\nthe district court, urging that such an exception be made for\n\nState Rule 3.8(f).     By letter dated December 3, 1997, the court\n\ndeclined to craft a specific exception, indicating that Stern's\n\nconcerns would be resolved on a case-by-case basis.          On January\n\n1, 1998, Rule 3.8(f) went into effect.           At that point, Stern\n\ndirected his staff to hold in abeyance any applications to the\n\ndistrict court for attorney subpoenas.\n\n           Stern and Craig C. Donsanto (a senior DOJ lawyer based\n\nin Washington and a member of the Massachusetts bar), both\n\nacting in their official capacities, filed suit in the district\n\ncourt on May 13, 1998.       They sought to have both State Rule\n\n3.8(f) and Local Rule 3.8(f) declared invalid as applied to\n\nmembers   of   the   Massachusetts    bar   practicing   before   federal\n\ncourts.   The complaint alleged in substance that Rule 3.8(f), in\n\nboth its federal and state incarnations, exceeded the district\n\ncourt's rulemaking authority, contradicted the federal common\n\nlaw anent grand jury practice, conflicted with the federal rules\n\nof criminal procedure and evidence, and violated the Supremacy\n\nClause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f            Initially, the named defendants were the SJC, the\n\nMassachusetts Board of Bar Overseers (the Board), Bar Counsel,\n\nand the United States District Court itself.1                The complaint was\n\nlater amended to add as defendants the individual judges of the\n\ndistrict court (hereinafter, along with the court itself, the\n\nJudicial Defendants).\n\n            The contours of the case were narrowed when Bar Counsel\n\nfiled an affidavit in which he vouchsafed that he would not\n\nwield    State   Rule   3.8(f)       against    federal     prosecutors,      but,\n\nrather,    would    refer    any   alleged     violations     to   the   federal\n\ndistrict court for discipline under Local Rule 3.8(f).                        This\n\nconcession rendered the Supremacy Clause issue moot and led the\n\nplaintiffs to dismiss their claims against the SJC and the\n\nBoard.     Rosenfeld then agreed not to attempt to enforce Local\n\nRule 3.8(f) against members of the Massachusetts bar practicing\n\noutside    the   commonwealth,        and    Donsanto   dropped    out   of    the\n\npicture.\n\n            Stern    had     moved    at     the   outset    for   preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief.         All the defendants opposed this motion, and\n\nthe Judicial Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint\n\n\n\n    1The SJC administers professional responsibility matters\nthrough the Board. In turn, Bar Counsel, currently Arnold R.\nRosenfeld, serves as the Board's chief enforcement officer. See\nS.J.C. R. 4:01.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fas unripe.       The district court heard argument on October 7,\n\n1998, and took both motions under advisement.                While the court\n\nwas pondering the matter, the President signed into law a bill,\n\nnow codified at 28 U.S.C. § 530B, that made certain state\n\nstandards    directly   applicable      to    federal    prosecutors.         The\n\nparties debated the relevance and effect of this provision in a\n\nseries of subsequent submissions.\n\n            The district court ultimately determined the issues\n\npresented to be ripe for review and rejected the claim that\n\nsection 530B rendered the controversy moot.                 See Stern v. SJC,\n\n184 F.R.D. 10, 13-14 & n.5 (D. Mass. 1999).                       Then, reading\n\nsubparagraphs     (1)   and    (2)    independently,        the    court   found\n\nWhitehouse    controlling      in    part    and   upheld    both    the   prior\n\njudicial     approval   requirement         and    the   provision      for    an\n\nadversarial hearing.          See id. at 17-19.          Finally, the court\n\napproved the substantive requirements of subparagraph (1) as\n\nethical precepts not inconsistent with federal law.                  See id. at\n\n19.   Following the entry of a final judgment, Stern launched\n\nthis appeal.\n\n\n\nII.   RIPENESS\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            We consider de novo the Judicial Defendants' contention\n\nthat the controversy is not ripe for adjudication.                      See Riva v.\n\nMassachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            The    ripeness      doctrine      has    both     constitutional      and\n\nprudential dimensions.            See Public Serv. Comm'n v. Wycoff Co.,\n\n344 U.S. 237, 242-44 (1952); Rhode Island Ass'n of Realtors v.\n\nWhitehouse,       199    F.3d    26,   33    (1st    Cir.     1999).      Its   basic\n\nrationale    is    \"to    prevent      the   courts,     through       avoidance   of\n\npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract\n\ndisagreements.\"           Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148\n\n(1967).   Courts must apply a two-part test to assess ripeness.\n\nSee id. at 149.         First, it is necessary to determine whether the\n\nissue presented is fit for judicial review — an inquiry that\n\n\"typically    involves       subsidiary       queries        concerning   finality,\n\ndefiniteness,       and    the    extent      to     which    resolution    of     the\n\nchallenge depends on facts that may not yet be sufficiently\n\ndeveloped.\"       Ernst & Young v. Depositors Econ. Protection Corp.,\n\n45 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir. 1995).                   Second, it is necessary to\n\nevaluate the extent to which withholding judgment will impose\n\nhardship — an inquiry that typically \"turns upon whether the\n\nchallenged action creates a 'direct and immediate' dilemma for\n\nthe parties.\"       W.R. Grace & Co. v. EPA, 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 152).                     Both prongs\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fof the test ordinarily must be satisfied, although a very strong\n\nshowing on one axis may compensate for a relatively weak showing\n\non the other.       See Ernst & Young, 45 F.3d at 535.\n\n            This case, which questions whether the federal district\n\ncourt has the power to incorporate State Rule 3.8(f) into the\n\narmamentarium of its local rules, passes the first prong of the\n\ntest.       The    issue   presented    can   be   finally    resolved   by\n\ndeclaratory judgment, its contours are sharply defined, and\n\nadditional facts will not affect its resolution.             The conclusion\n\nthat the issue is fit for review is bolstered, moreover, by a\n\nrealization that deciding the question appears unavoidable:\n\nLocal   Rule      3.8(f)   imposes   new    substantive   and   procedural\n\nrequirements on prosecutors who request attorney subpoenas, and\n\nBar Counsel has stated unequivocally that he will enforce those\n\nrequirements.        Since bringing this suit, the United States\n\nAttorney has delayed requests for no fewer than twenty-six such\n\nsubpoenas, and it seems reasonable to suppose that in some of\n\nthese instances the prosecutors would have had difficulty in\n\nsatisfying the \"essentiality\" and/or \"no feasible alternative\"\n\ncriteria.      Short of a continuation of Stern's self-imposed\n\nmoratorium — and the public has a right to expect that such a\n\nstate of affairs will not last indefinitely — a test of Local\n\nRule 3.8(f)'s facial validity appears inevitable.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f           This case also satisfies the hardship prong.           Delaying\n\nadjudication until a more concrete controversy emerges (until,\n\nsay, a particular attorney subpoena request reaches the judicial\n\npreapproval stage or disciplinary proceedings are instituted in\n\nthe aftermath of a served subpoena) would inflict significant\n\ninstitutional costs with little corresponding gain.               Indeed,\n\ncharting such a course would put Stern on the horns of a\n\ndilemma,   forcing     him   to   decide   whether   to   serve   attorney\n\nsubpoenas in cases arguably prohibited by the local rule and\n\nthus risk potential sanctions or to refrain from so doing and\n\nthus jeopardize the success of ongoing criminal investigations.\n\nIt is precisely this sort of \"'direct and immediate' dilemma,\"\n\nW.R. Grace, 959 F.2d at 364 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at\n\n152), that Congress wished to ameliorate when it passed the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act.         See ANR Pipeline Co. v. Corporation\n\nComm'n, 860 F.2d 1571, 1578 (10th Cir. 1988) (\"Once the gun has\n\nbeen cocked and aimed and the finger is on the trigger, it is\n\nnot necessary to wait until the bullet strikes to invoke the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act.\").\n\n           A determination that this case is ripe for adjudication\n\nsquares with the way in which we, and other courts of appeals,\n\nhave treated analogous cases (albeit without explicit discussion\n\nof ripeness).     In    Klubock, this court fielded a preemptive\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fstrike by federal prosecutors against a newly adopted ethics\n\nrule.   In Whitehouse, we entertained a similar foray, explaining\n\nthat \"the proper method for mounting a facial challenge to the\n\nvalidity of [a local rule] . . . is through an action for\n\ndeclaratory       and/or     injunctive   relief   filed      in    the    district\n\ncourt.\"    53 F.3d at 1353.       Moreover, two other courts of appeals\n\nhave adjudicated pre-enforcement challenges to ethics rules in\n\nparallel circumstances.          See United States v. Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt, 189 F.3d 1281 (10th Cir. 1999) (CSC II); Baylson, 975\n\nF.2d 102.\n\n            Another     case    that   sheds   light    on    the    question     of\n\nripeness is United States v. Colorado Supreme Court, 87 F.3d\n\n1161 (10th Cir. 1996) (CSC I).             There, the Tenth Circuit held\n\nthat the United States had standing to mount a pre-enforcement\n\nchallenge    to    a   local    rule   identical   to    Local      Rule    3.8(f),\n\ncrediting the government's stated trepidation that the rule\n\nwould interfere with federal subpoena practice.                        See id. at\n\n1165-67.    Although the CSC I court did not discuss ripeness per\n\nse, standing and ripeness often overlap.               See Rhode Island Ass'n\n\nof Realtors, 199 F.3d at 33.               So here:       we think that the\n\ncourt's    finding      of    standing    necessarily        implied      that   the\n\ncontroversy was ripe for adjudication.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f           In     a    pre-enforcement       challenge   to     a    law    carrying\n\nsignificant penalties, standing exists when the plaintiff has\n\nmanifested an intention to engage in conduct arguably proscribed\n\nby   the   statute,         and   there   exists   a   \"credible      threat\"     of\n\nenforcement.      New Hampshire Right to Life Political Action Comm.\n\nv. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 1996).                In most situations,\n\nas here, that self-same credible threat serves to render the\n\ncase fit for judicial review and to demonstrate the hardship\n\nthat will result should no review ensue.               See Rhode Island Ass'n\n\nof Realtors, 199 F.3d at 33 (stating that a \"concrete plan[] to\n\nengage immediately (or nearly so) in an arguably proscribed\n\nactivity . . . gives a precise shape to disobedience, posing a\n\nspecific legal question fit for judicial review,\" and \"[a]\n\nshowing    that       the   challenged     statute,    fairly       read,    thwarts\n\nimplementation of the plan adds the element of hardship\").\n\n           The Judicial Defendants' vigorous arguments to the\n\ncontrary are ultimately unpersuasive.                  Citing Ernst & Young,\n\nthey asseverate that Stern's claims are too contingent and\n\nuncertain to be fit for review.                  But the examples they give\n\ninclude events that are almost certain to materialize (e.g.,\n\ninternal DOJ approval of an application for a subpoena addressed\n\nto an attorney), and events that are completely irrelevant\n\n(e.g., destruction of evidence by a targeted attorney).                        Stern\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fstands poised to request and serve attorney subpoenas, but\n\nreasonably fears disciplinary proceedings (for himself and his\n\nstaff) if he does so.     Thus, the only contingency likely to\n\ndeter the parties from a collision course is continued self-\n\nrestraint on the part of Stern's office.   This is a far cry from\n\nErnst & Young, where the relevant injury would materialize, if\n\nat all, only after a long chain of remote and speculative\n\nevents, many of which involved third parties.2    See 45 F.3d at\n\n538.\n\n           Next, the Judicial Defendants note that the \"linchpin\n\nof ripeness . . . is adverseness.\"   Rhode Island v. Narragansett\n\nIndian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 692 (1st Cir. 1994).      Building on\n\nthis foundation, they complain that the current controversy\n\nlacks adverseness because the lawyers potentially subject to\n\nsubpoena (and their clients, for that matter) are unrepresented.\n\nThis rather simplistic formulation overlooks, however, that as\n\na general rule a \"conflict between state officials empowered to\n\nenforce a law and private parties subject to prosecution of that\n\nlaw is a classic 'case' or 'controversy' within the meaning of\n\n\n\n       2\n     Massachusetts Ass'n of Afro-American Police v. Boston\nPolice Department, 973 F.2d 18 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam), is\nsimilarly distinguishable.   There, we found a pre-enforcement\nchallenge unripe because the party with the power to inflict the\nfeared injury had expressly disclaimed any intent to do so. See\nid. at 20-21.\n\n                              -16-\n\fArt. III.\"     Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 64 (1986).            The\n\ndefendants here are empowered to enforce the strictures of Local\n\nRule 3.8(f) through disciplinary proceedings against Stern and\n\nhis subalterns.    This type of controversy is thus sufficiently\n\nadverse even though the class of persons that the law was\n\ndesigned to protect is not separately represented.          After all,\n\nthat   class   \"lacks   a   judicially   cognizable   interest   in   the\n\nprosecution or nonprosecution\" of Stern or the other attorneys\n\nin his office.     Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619\n\n(1973).   Consequently, the fact that the district court adopted\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) out of a desire to shield the attorney-client\n\nrelationship does not mean that particular attorneys and clients\n\nmust be joined in a facial attack on the rule.\n\n          Finally, the Judicial Defendants suggest that the DOJ\n\nguidelines render this case unripe.             Because the standards\n\ncontained in the guidelines and those contained in Local Rule\n\n3.8(f) overlap, this thesis goes, there is scant likelihood that\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) will work any harm.              This thesis has a\n\nplausible ring but, in the last analysis, it fails to cover the\n\nground.   We explain briefly.\n\n          There    is   no    question   that   the   DOJ   guidelines'\n\n\"reasonably needed\" criterion, 3 Department of Justice Manual §\n\n9-13.410, at 9-165 (2d ed. 2000), is markedly less demanding\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fthan the \"essentiality\" requirement contained in Local Rule\n\n3.8(f).    We think that the DOJ criteria are also less demanding\n\nthan the \"no feasible alternative\" requirement; the guidelines\n\nstipulate that \"all reasonable attempts shall be made to obtain\n\nthe information from alternative sources . . . unless such\n\nefforts    would    compromise       the    investigation          or    case,\"    id.\n\n(emphasis    supplied),       whereas      the    \"no    feasible       alternative\"\n\nprovision contains no similar loophole.                     In all events, the\n\nguidelines are subject to change at the whim of the DOJ.                          Last\n\n(but not least), an internal review mechanism that specifically\n\ndisavows    any     intent    to    create       legally    enforceable       rights\n\nobviously does not burden prosecutors in the same way, or to the\n\nsame extent, as does a binding rule of court that imposes\n\nsubstantive standards, requires prior judicial approval, and\n\nsubjects government attorneys to potential disciplinary action.\n\nCf.   Whitehouse,     53     F.3d   at   1362     n.18    (suggesting      that    DOJ\n\nguidelines did not render a prior judicial approval requirement\n\nsuperfluous).       For these reasons, we reject the notion that the\n\nmere existence of the DOJ guidelines dissipates any hardship.\n\n            We have said enough on this score.                      The threat of\n\nethics enforcement is genuine, compliance costs are real and\n\nimmediate, and the chilling effect on attorney subpoena requests\n\nconstitutes    an    injury     sufficient        to     support    a   justiciable\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fcontroversy.   See CSC I, 87 F.3d at 1165-67.     Thus, the issue\n\npresented here — the authority of the federal district court to\n\nincorporate State Rule 3.8(f) into its local rules — is ripe for\n\nreview.\n\nIII.   THE MERITS\n\n          The authority of the federal district courts to adopt\n\nlocal rules emanates from three sources.      First, Congress has\n\nempowered the Supreme Court to prescribe rules of practice and\n\nprocedure for the federal courts.     See 28 U.S.C. § 2072(a).    In\n\nturn, the Supreme Court has authorized district courts to craft\n\nlocal rules to implement, or fill gaps in, national rules of\n\npractice and procedure.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 57(a)(1); Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 83(a)(1).   Second, Congress has vested the lower federal\n\ncourts with independent authority to prescribe local rules.      See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2071(a).   Third, district courts have inherent power\n\narising from the nature of the judicial process, and this power\n\nextends to certain types of rulemaking.    See Chambers v. NASCO,\n\nInc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991); Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at 1355.\n\n          Regardless of the source, local rulemaking authority\n\nis bounded.    A local rule must be both constitutional and\n\nrational, and its subject matter must be within the ambit of the\n\ncourt's regulatory power.    See Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U.S. 641,\n\n646 (1987); Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at 1355-56.     In this same vein,\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fa local rule must be consistent with, but not duplicative of,\n\nActs of Congress and nationally applicable rules of practice,\n\nprocedure, and evidence.    See 28 U.S.C. § 2071(a); Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 57(a)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(1).      Even if a local rule\n\ndoes not contravene the text of a national rule, the former\n\ncannot survive if it subverts the latter's purpose.     See Hawes\n\nv. Club Ecuestre el Comandante, 535 F.2d 140, 144 (1st Cir.\n\n1976).     Then, too, local rules should cover only interstitial\n\nmatters.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 57 advisory committee's note; see\n\nalso United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 760 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(noting that a court's inherent power has definite limits).\n\nThey may not create or affect substantive rights, see 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2072(b), or institute \"basic procedural innovations,\"     Miner\n\nv. Atlass, 363 U.S. 641, 650 (1960).\n\n            The core issue presented by this appeal is whether the\n\ndistrict court had the power to adopt Local Rule 3.8(f).     This\n\nquestion of law engenders de novo review.   Before answering this\n\nquery, however, we pause to measure its dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n              A.   How to Construe Local Rule 3.8(f).\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f          At   Bar   Counsel's   urging,     the    court     below    read\n\nsubparagraphs (1) and (2) of Local Rule 3.8(f) independently.\n\nSee Stern, 184 F.R.D. at 16-17.    On this bifurcated reading, the\n\nsubstantive standards delineated in subparagraph (1) would be\n\nrelevant only to potential disciplinary proceedings, and a court\n\ndeciding whether to approve a subpoena request pursuant to\n\nsubparagraph (2) would have no obligation to apply them.                 We\n\nreject this artificial construction of Local Rule 3.8(f).\n\n          The most sensible way to construe Local Rule 3.8(f) is\n\nas a unified whole.        Each subparagraph is a mere sentence\n\nfragment and neither makes sense without reference to the shared\n\nintroductory   language.      Court      rules,    like     statutes    and\n\nordinances, generally are to be read in a holistic manner.             See,\n\ne.g., King v. St. Vincent's Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221 (1991);\n\nMassachusetts Ass'n of HMOs v. Ruthardt, 194 F.3d 176, 180 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); O'Connell v. Shalala, 79 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   This tenet applies with special force when subdivisions\n\nare grammatically interrelated.       See American Standard, Inc. v.\n\nCrane Co., 510 F.2d 1043, 1058 (2d Cir. 1974).\n\n          Here, the case for reading the rule as a whole is even\n\nstronger, for the connection between the two halves is not only\n\ngrammatical but also logical.           Subparagraph (2) outlines a\n\nprocess for determining whether a subpoena application should be\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fapproved, but gives no clue as to what standard a judge is to\n\napply in making that determination.             The obvious place to look\n\nis subparagraph (1), which sets forth such a standard.              Indeed,\n\nthe court below acknowledged that \"as a practical matter, a\n\ncourt faced with a request for an attorney-subpoena is likely to\n\nengage in a similar inquiry in the course of determining whether\n\nissuance of the subpoena is appropriate.\"            Stern, 184 F.R.D. at\n\n16 n.12.      The presence of the attorney to be subpoenaed — a\n\nfeature    not   involved   in   the   scheme    upheld   in   Whitehouse   —\n\nvirtually guarantees such an inquiry.\n\n             On the other hand, subparagraph (2) would serve no\n\npurpose if courts evaluated subpoena applications solely on the\n\nbasis   of    traditional    motion-to-quash       standards.      For   the\n\nadversarial hearing to be meaningful, the targeted attorney\n\nwould have to be told in advance of the content of the testimony\n\nor materials sought.        This notice, no less than service of the\n\nsubpoena itself, would drive a wedge of distrust between lawyer\n\nand client.      Thus, subparagraph (2), on the bifurcated reading,\n\nwould mirror existing quashal procedure and generate no ethics\n\nbenefits whatsoever.\n\n             The sockdolager is that the original drafters certainly\n\nintended that the two subparagraphs of the rule be harmonized,\n\nnot balkanized.       As discussed above, the text of Local Rule\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f3.8(f) derives from (and is identical to) a former ABA Model\n\nRule.    The comment to that rule made it transparently clear that\n\nthe   judicial    preapproval   described     in   subparagraph   (2)   was\n\ndesigned to ensure compliance with the substantive standards\n\ndescribed in subparagraph (1).        Absent some specific disclaimer\n\n(not present here), the district court cannot adopt verbatim the\n\ntext of a model rule without accepting the drafters' unequivocal\n\ninterpretation of its meaning.             Cf. Felix Frankfurter,       Some\n\nReflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527,\n\n537 (1947) (\"[I]f a word is obviously transplanted from another\n\nlegal source . . . it brings the old soil with it.\").\n\n              To be sure, when the SJC formulated State Rule 3.8(f),\n\nit omitted the second sentence of the comment to the former ABA\n\nrule (which made the connection between the two subparagraphs\n\nexplicit).       But see Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at 1358 nn.12 & 14,\n\n1364-65 (noting that comments and commentary are not binding).\n\nIn addition, the Massachusetts version lists as the sources for\n\nsubparagraph (2) both former ABA Model Rule 3.8(f)(2) and PF 15,\n\nand     the   latter   rule   has   been    interpreted   to   impose     no\n\nsubstantive restrictions beyond the prototypical motion-to-quash\n\nstandards.      See Klubock, 639 F. Supp. at 120 & n.7, 124.             But\n\nthese reeds are far too slender to shore up a construction that\n\nsplits grammatically interrelated provisions, imports a standard\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fof review from outside the ethics code, and directly contradicts\n\nthe drafters' manifest intention.\n\n         Bar Counsel also argues that we should defer to his\n\nconstruction because he is the official charged with enforcement\n\nof ethics rules in Massachusetts.    With respect, we doubt that\n\nBar Counsel's litigation position is entitled to any deference.\n\nCf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 212 (1988)\n\n(holding that an agency's litigating position is not entitled to\n\ndeference); Massachusetts v. Blackstone Valley Elec. Co., 67\n\nF.3d 981, 991 (1st Cir. 1995) (same).       In all events, Bar\n\nCounsel's construction does not bind the judges of the District\n\nof Massachusetts who, as defendants here, have pointedly refused\n\nto endorse it.3   Finally, any deference that might normally be\n\ndue is overcome here by the availability of a much more logical\n\nreading and a clear statement of the drafters' intent.    Cf. 12\n\nCharles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3153,\n\nat 533 (2d ed. 1997) (explaining that even \"a district court's\n\nconstruction of its own rule will be reversed if the appellate\n\ncourt is convinced that the district court has misconstrued its\n\nown rule\").\n\n\n\n    3 Consistent with their position that the controversy is not\nripe, the Judicial Defendants apparently deem it incumbent upon\nthem to refrain from rendering what might be seen as an advisory\nopinion.\n\n                              -24-\n\f            Bar Counsel next invokes the principle that courts\n\nshould resist interpreting a statute in a way that provokes a\n\nconstitutional problem.         See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d\n\n462, 473 (1st Cir. 1994).       Other courts of appeals have extended\n\nthis principle to the construction of local rules, thereby\n\nseeking to avoid interpretations that place local rules on a\n\ncollision course with national rules.              See, e.g., Marshall v.\n\nGates, 44 F.3d 722, 725 (9th Cir. 1995); United States v. White,\n\n980 F.2d 836, 844 (2d Cir. 1992); cf. Jaroma v. Massey, 873 F.2d\n\n17, 20 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam) (explaining that ambiguous\n\n\"[l]ocal district court rules cannot be construed in such a way\n\nas to render them inconsistent with applicable provisions of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure\").\n\n            There are reasons to question whether such an extension\n\nof the principle is appropriate; after all, striking down a\n\nlocal rule, unlike declaring a statute unconstitutional, does\n\nnot    implicate   separation       of    powers   or    countermajoritarian\n\nconcerns.      But even assuming, for argument's sake, the validity\n\nof the extended principle — on the ground, say, that the local\n\nrule   here    derives   from   a   state     rule,     and   that   the   issue\n\ntherefore has overtones of comity — it does not control the\n\noutcome   in    this   instance.         Interpretive    ingenuity     has   its\n\nlimits.     The idea that judges charged with interpreting a rule\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fshould strive to do so in a way that will avoid conflicts with\n\ngoverning law is a useful device in doubtful cases, but it does\n\nnot permit the interpreters to substitute their judgment for\n\nthat of the drafters or to rewrite the rule from scratch.       Here,\n\nthere is both a natural, holistic reading of the local rule and\n\na clear statement by the drafters in support of such a reading.\n\nIn these circumstances, we will not embrace an implausible\n\nconstruction simply to minimize the potential for conflict with\n\nfederal law.\n\n            For these reasons, we hold that Local Rule 3.8(f) must\n\nbe   read   as   an   indivisible   whole.   Consequently,   judicial\n\npreapproval under subparagraph (2) of the rule proceeds, if at\n\nall, on the basis of the substantive standards elucidated in\n\nsubparagraph (1).\n\n      B.    Rule 3.8(f) as Applied to Grand Jury Subpoenas.\n\n            Because local rulemaking authority is at a lower ebb\n\nin the grand jury context, we ease first into those relatively\n\nshallow waters.\n\n            The grand jury is deeply rooted in Anglo-American\n\ntradition and is \"a constitutional fixture in its own right.\"\n\nUnited States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).           It is not a part of either the\n\nExecutive or Judicial Branch, but, rather, \"a kind of buffer .\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f. . between the Government and the people.\"                   Id.       Accordingly,\n\n\"any power federal courts may have to fashion, on their own\n\ninitiative, rules of grand jury procedure is a very limited one,\n\nnot remotely comparable to the power they maintain over their\n\nown   proceedings.\"          Id.     at     50.     A    local      rule      may   not\n\n\"substantially alter[] the traditional relationships between the\n\nprosecutor, the constituting court, and the grand jury itself.\"\n\nId.   Nor may a local rule trench upon any core attribute of the\n\ngrand jury, including:             \"1) its independence from the court's\n\nsupervision;    2)     its     broad        investigative     powers;         3)     the\n\npresumption of validity accorded its subpoenas; 4) the secrecy\n\nof its proceedings; [or] 5) its general freedom from procedural\n\ndetours and delays.\"               Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at 1357.                  It is\n\nagainst this backdrop that we take the measure of Local Rule\n\n3.8(f) as it pertains to grand jury subpoenas.\n\n          We do not write on a pristine page.                 As the defendants\n\nrepeatedly    remind    us,        Whitehouse     held    that      a    local      rule\n\nrequiring judicial preapproval for the service of an attorney\n\nsubpoena neither undermined the historic role of the grand jury\n\nnor interfered with its essential attributes.                    See id. at 1357-\n\n62.     But    this    holding           rested   squarely    on        the    panel's\n\ndetermination    that        the    particular        local   rule        worked      no\n\nsubstantive    change    in        the    governing     law   because         judicial\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\fpreapproval would be granted or denied under traditional motion-\n\nto-quash standards.       See id. at 1357-58 & nn.12-13 (explaining\n\nthat the rule \"merely authorizes district courts to reject a\n\nprosecutor's attorney-subpoena application for the traditional\n\nreasons justifying the quashing of a subpoena\"); see also Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 17(c) (authorizing courts to quash a subpoena \"if\n\ncompliance   would   be    unreasonable   or   oppressive\").   In   so\n\nholding, the Whitehouse court brushed aside the seemingly more\n\nrigorous criteria delineated in the comment to the rule, on the\n\nground that the comment was merely advisory.          See 53 F.3d at\n\n1358 n.12.   So viewed, the rule imposed no additional burden on\n\ngrand jury independence because courts, in theory, would apply\n\nthe motion-to-quash standards that govern under Rule 17, not the\n\ncomment's suggested criteria, in determining whether to approve\n\nan attorney subpoena request.4\n\n\n\n\n    4 To be sure, the panel also suggested that the preapproval\nprocess did not impede grand jury independence because it did\nnot apply to subpoenas sought by the grand jury acting\nindependently from the prosecutor. See Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at\n1357.   While we are bound by the holding of Whitehouse, we\neschew this component of its reasoning. As a practical matter,\ngrand jury subpoenas are almost universally issued by and\nthrough federal prosecutors.     See, e.g., In re Grand Jury\nMatters (United States), 751 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1984).\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the notion\nthat an otherwise impermissible rule of grand jury procedure\nbecomes permissible if it is enforced against the prosecutor\ninstead of the grand jury itself. See Williams, 504 U.S. at 53.\n\n                                 -28-\n\f           The Rhode Island rule's saving grace is absent here.\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) differs significantly in that it imposes new\n\nsubstantive requirements for judicial preapproval of grand jury\n\nsubpoenas.      In so doing, the rule alters the grand jury's\n\nhistoric     role,     places       it    under     overly      intrusive    court\n\nsupervision, curbs its broad investigative powers, reverses the\n\npresumption of validity accorded to its subpoenas, undermines\n\nthe secrecy of its proceedings, and creates procedural detours\n\nand delays.     It therefore impermissibly interferes with grand\n\njury proceedings.       See 1 Hazard & Hodes, supra, § 3.8:701, at\n\n702 (Supp. 1997) (\"Rule 3.8(f) in its original form seemed\n\nclearly invalid . . . as applied to . . . federal grand jury\n\nsubpoenas to criminal defense lawyers.\").\n\n           Because     any    one    of    these    vices      would   suffice    to\n\ninvalidate the rule as applied to grand jury subpoenas, we\n\nconfine our discussion to two of the most glaring defects:\n\nLocal   Rule   3.8(f)'s       impact      on    grand   jury    secrecy    and   its\n\npotential as an incubator for delay.                    In United States v. R.\n\nEnterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 292 (1991), the Court held that the\n\ngovernment     could    not    be    required      to    demonstrate      that   the\n\nmaterials sought by a grand jury subpoena were relevant.                         See\n\nid. at 298-99.         The Court explained that such a requirement\n\n\"'would saddle a grand jury with minitrials and preliminary\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fshowings,'\" id. (quoting United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1,\n\n17        (1973)),    and   would    \"threaten[]         to   compromise       'the\n\nindispensable secrecy of grand jury proceedings,'\" id. at 299\n\n(quoting United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 513 (1943));\n\nsee also Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) (cloaking grand jury proceedings\n\nin secrecy).          Requiring a prosecutor to show that subpoenaed\n\nevidence is essential and not otherwise feasibly obtainable\n\nwould have the same two impermissible effects.                 Consequently, we\n\nhold that Local Rule 3.8(f), as it pertains to grand jury\n\nsubpoenas, encroaches unduly upon grand jury prerogatives and,\n\ntherefore, is ultra vires.\n\n     C.    Rule 3.8(f) as Applied Outside the Grand Jury Context.\n\n               Outside the grand jury context, Stern asseverates that\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) is beyond the district court's competency\n\nbecause it goes past the \"matters of detail\" appropriate for\n\nlocal rulemaking, Fed. R. Crim. P. 57 advisory committee's note,\n\nand       works   a   fundamental   procedural      change.         This   argument\n\ndepends heavily on Miner v. Atlass, in which the Court held that\n\na local admiralty rule authorizing oral discovery depositions\n\nexceeded the district court's rulemaking authority.                        See 363\n\nU.S. at 650.          The Court reasoned that this innovation, \"though\n\nconcededly        'procedural,'     may   be   of   as   great      importance   to\n\nlitigants as many a 'substantive' doctrine.\"                  Id.    Accordingly,\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fit was too basic to be effectuated through local rulemaking.\n\nSee id.\n\n            In Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149 (1973), the Court\n\nelaborated    on    this    concept,      explaining       that    \"[t]he      'basic\n\nprocedural    innovations'        to     which   Miner     referred      are    those\n\naspects of the litigatory process which bear upon the ultimate\n\noutcome of the litigation.\"              Id. at 163 n.23.          Applying this\n\ntaxonomy, the Court upheld a local rule providing for six-member\n\ncivil juries in lieu of traditional twelve-member juries because\n\nthe party challenging the rule had not shown any discernible\n\ndifference in the results reached.               See id.    Synthesizing Miner\n\nand Colgrove, we conclude that the relevant inquiry is whether\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f), applied outside the grand jury context, is\n\napt to affect the ultimate outcome of criminal proceedings.                       See\n\nEash v. Riggins Trucking Inc., 757 F.2d 557, 569 (3d Cir. 1985)\n\n(en banc).\n\n            The    answer    to   this    inquiry    depends,      in    the    first\n\ninstance, on current practice under Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.                         Rule\n\n17(c) authorizes subpoenas for the production of documentary\n\nevidence,    objects,       and   the    like.      That    rule    prescribes      a\n\nprocedure and a standard for challenging such subpoenas:                         \"The\n\ncourt on motion made promptly may quash or modify the subpoena\n\nif compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.\"                     The Supreme\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fCourt elucidated the meaning of this standard in United States\n\nv. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), holding that a subpoena duces\n\ntecum is not \"unreasonable or oppressive\" if the proponent\n\nestablishes relevancy, admissibility, and specificity.                           See id.\n\nat 700.\n\n              Roughly        the   same        standard   applies       to     subpoenas\n\ncompelling      the    attendance         of    witnesses,      i.e.,    subpoenas       ad\n\ntestificandum.              Although      Rule     17(a),    which      governs        such\n\nsubpoenas,          does     not   provide        explicitly      for        quashal     or\n\nmodification, courts routinely have entertained motions seeking\n\nsuch       relief    and     decided     them     by   reference        to    comparable\n\nprinciples.         Specifically, a subpoena ad testificandum survives\n\nscrutiny if the party serving it can show that the testimony\n\nsought is both relevant and material.                       See United States v.\n\nValenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 867 (1982); United States v.\n\nCampbell, 874 F.2d 838, 850-51 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n              These        traditional     standards      for    quashal       of   trial\n\nsubpoenas form the template for further inquiry here. 5                             As we\n\n\n       5\n     It bears emphasis that the motion-to-quash standards\napplicable to trial subpoenas historically have not been applied\nto grand jury subpoenas.    See R. Enters., 498 U.S. at 298-99\n(holding that recourse to the Nixon criteria would unduly\ninterfere with grand jury proceedings); In re Grand Jury\nProceedings (Hill), 786 F.2d 3, 5 n.2 (1st Cir. 1986) (per\ncuriam) (declining to require a showing of \"need\" or \"relevance\"\nbefore a court may enforce a grand jury subpoena directed to an\nattorney). Because grand jury subpoenas are sui generis, we use\n\n                                           -32-\n\fhave said, Local Rule 3.8(f) requires a prosecutor, before\n\nserving    an     attorney      subpoena,      to     demonstrate         that     the\n\ninformation      sought   is    essential,      not     privileged,         and    not\n\notherwise feasibly available.           These are significant departures\n\nfrom    prior   practice,      and   they    raise    the    bar    for   obtaining\n\nrelevant and material evidence.             Collectively, they work changes\n\ntoo    fundamental   to   be    accomplished         under    the   aegis    of    the\n\ndistrict courts' local rulemaking power.\n\n            In particular, the \"essentiality\" and \"no feasible\n\nalternative\" requirements are substantially more onerous (and,\n\nthus, more restrictive) than the traditional motion-to-quash\n\nstandards.      Essentiality is obviously a more demanding criterion\n\nthan    relevancy    or   materiality.          By     like    token,       Rule    17\n\njurisprudence contains no corollary to the principle that a\n\nsubpoena issued to one source cannot stand if the information\n\nsought is (or may be) available from some other source.\n\n            Two examples illustrate these points.                   Suppose, in a\n\nrobbery case, that a defense lawyer received a lump-sum advance\n\npayment for services in the precise amount of the purloined\n\nfunds from a client with no visible means of support.                       There is\n\nother evidence linking the client to the robbery, so the billing\n\n\nthe term \"trial subpoenas\" as a shorthand for all other\nsubpoenas (e.g., subpoenas issued in the course of pretrial\nhearings).\n\n                                      -33-\n\finformation could not fairly be described as \"essential\" to the\n\nprosecution.        Hence,   Local   Rule    3.8(f)    would   prohibit     the\n\nprosecutor from serving a subpoena on the defense attorney,\n\nnotwithstanding the unarguable materiality and relevancy of the\n\nretainer information.        Next, consider unprivileged documents in\n\na lawyer's file relating to a complex, and possibly fraudulent,\n\ninternational real estate transaction.              These documents may be\n\nobtainable     without   a   subpoena     duces     tecum   directed   to   the\n\nlawyer, but only through time-consuming, relatively expensive\n\n(but still feasible) alternative means.             Local Rule 3.8(f) would\n\nprohibit an attorney subpoena, even though the situation easily\n\nsatisfies      standards      of     relevancy,       admissibility,        and\n\nspecificity.\n\n            These examples are not eccentric hypotheticals, but,\n\nrather, fairly typical of the sort of situation in which a\n\nprosecutor might wish to serve an attorney subpoena (others\n\neasily   can   be   conceived).      We     think   that    they   demonstrate\n\nconvincingly that Local Rule 3.8(f) imposes novel requirements\n\nthat threaten to preclude the service of otherwise unimpeachable\n\nsubpoenas and thus restrict the flow of relevant, material\n\nevidence to the factfinder.           Considering that compelling the\n\nproduction of evidence is of \"great importance\" to litigants,\n\nMiner, 363 U.S. at 650, this is a fairly drastic alteration of\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fthe rules — too basic to be effected through local rulemaking.6\n\nSee Klubock, 832 F.2d at 673 (equally divided en banc) (opinion\n\nof Breyer, J.) (suggesting that a local rule imposing standards\n\nof   review    for   attorney    subpoenas    stricter    than   traditional\n\nmotion-to-quash       standards    would     fall   outside   the     district\n\ncourt's rulemaking authority).\n\n              Moreover, unlike in Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 163 n.23,\n\nthere has been no showing here that Local Rule 3.8(f) will not\n\naffect the outcome of criminal proceedings.                Indeed, there is\n\nevery reason to believe that the opposite is true.                Local Rule\n\n3.8(f) imposes new substantive requirements applicable only to\n\nprosecutors and creates a novel procedural device to ensure that\n\nthese requirements are enforced.              The likely result will be\n\nfewer     attorney   subpoenas    served     by   the   government;    as   the\n\ncomment to the rule makes clear, the goal is \"to limit the\n\nissuance of lawyer subpoenas.\"         Certain evidence, as long as a\n\ncourt finds that it is not \"essential,\" will never reach the\n\ntrier of fact.       So, too, when the government decides that the\n\n\n\n      6\n      In striking down a local rule in Miner, the Court\nrepeatedly cited the fact than an analogous national rule had\nbeen considered and rejected. See Miner, 363 U.S. at 644-45,\n648-51.   The situation here is reminiscent of that scenario:\nCongress declined to enact a bill sponsored by Senator Paul\nSimon that was designed to \"provide procedural safeguards with\nrespect to the issuance of lawyer client subpoenas.\" 134 Cong.\nRec. 21,589, 21,599 (1988).\n\n                                    -35-\n\f\"feasible alternative\" to an attorney subpoena is not worth the\n\nadditional effort.        In short, Local Rule 3.8(f), if permitted to\n\nstand, will make it measurably more difficult for prosecutors to\n\nsecure convictions.         The magnitude of this new burden is simply\n\ntoo large to be imposed by local rule.                 Accordingly, the rule\n\ncannot stand.\n\n           The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion with\n\nrespect    to   a   closely   analogous       rule.     At    issue     there   was\n\nPennsylvania's       analog   to    Local     Rule   3.8(f),    which    required\n\njudicial    preapproval       for    attorney        subpoenas    in     criminal\n\nproceedings.        See Baylson, 975 F.2d at 104.            The comment to the\n\nrule7 stipulated that approval normally would be denied unless\n\nthe court found that the information sought was relevant and not\n\nconfidential        or   privileged,    that     compliance      would    not    be\n\nunreasonable or oppressive, that the primary purpose of the\n\nsubpoena was not harassment, and that there were no feasible\n\nalternative means of obtaining the information sought.                    See id.\n\nAlthough only the \"no feasible alternative\" requirement was\n\nsubstantively new, the court held that the rule went beyond the\n\n\"matters of detail\" contemplated by Fed. R. Crim. P. 57 and thus\n\ntranscended local rulemaking authority.                  See id. at 108-09.\n\n\n    7 The Third Circuit, unlike the panel in Whitehouse, see 53\nF.3d at 1358 n.12, assumed that trial courts would not ignore\nthe comment in applying the rule. See Baylson, 975 F.2d at 109.\n\n                                       -36-\n\fBecause it requires essentiality as well, Local Rule 3.8(f)\n\nrepresents an even greater encroachment than the rule that\n\nconfronted the Baylson court.\n\n                               D.    Section 530B.\n\n             Shortly     after      the     hearing   in   the    district     court,\n\nCongress passed an omnibus budget bill.                     The bill contained a\n\nprovision entitled \"Ethical standards for attorneys for the\n\nGovernment,\" now codified as section 530B, which provides that:\n\n             An attorney for the Government shall be\n             subject to State laws and rules, and local\n             Federal court rules, governing attorneys in\n             each State where such attorney engages in\n             that attorney's duties, to the same extent\n             and in the same manner as other attorneys in\n             that State.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 530B(a).             Bar Counsel asserts that this passage\n\ncures any conflict between Local Rule 3.8(f) and other federal\n\nlaw.   We do not agree.\n\n             \"Because     of     the        fundamental     importance       of     the\n\nprinciples shielding federal installations and activities from\n\nregulation by the States, an authorization of state regulation\n\nis   found     only   when     and     to    the   extent    there    is   a      clear\n\ncongressional mandate, specific congressional action that makes\n\nthis authorization of state regulation clear and unambiguous.\"\n\nHancock   v.    Train,    426    U.S.       167,   179   (1976)    (footnotes       and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).                 We believe it is reasonable\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\fto require comparable specificity before inferring congressional\n\nintent to abandon the goal of national consistency anent rules\n\nof federal practice.      Moreover, that benchmark is not attainable\n\nhere:    it simply cannot be said that Congress, by enacting\n\nsection 530B, meant to empower states (or federal district\n\ncourts, for that matter) to regulate government attorneys in a\n\nmanner inconsistent with federal law.            We explain briefly.\n\n             The federal rules of procedure, unlike state laws, are\n\nnationally uniform.       See 28 U.S.C. § 2071(a); Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n57(a)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(1).              In the area of ethics,\n\nhowever, federal district courts generally have adopted their\n\nown rules, often modeled on the rules of the state in which they\n\nsit, but sometimes with significant deviations.                See, e.g., D.\n\nMass.   R.   83.6(4)(B)    (stating    that     SJC   ethics   rules   govern\n\n\"except as otherwise provided by specific rule of this court\").\n\nThe   potential    for    conflict    between    state   and    federal   law\n\ntherefore should have been obvious, but section 530B does not\n\nspeak to the issue.        Instead, Congress directed the Attorney\n\nGeneral to fill out the details of enforcement by regulation.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 530B(b) (empowering the Attorney General to\n\npromulgate implementing regulations).            These regulations dispel\n\nthe notion that section 530B grants states and lower federal\n\ncourts the power, in the guise of regulating ethics, to impose\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\fstrictures that are inconsistent with federal law.                  See 28\n\nC.F.R. § 77.1(b) (directing that section 530B \"should not be\n\nconstrued in any way to alter federal substantive, procedural,\n\nor evidentiary law\").\n\n             The Eleventh Circuit recently had the opportunity to\n\nconsider the effect of section 530B.            That court rejected the\n\nargument that the statute cured an incipient conflict between a\n\nstate ethics rule (which had been incorporated into the federal\n\ndistrict court's local rules) and the federal rules of evidence.\n\nSee United States v. Lowery, 166 F.3d 1119, 1124-25 (11th Cir.\n\n1999).       The court wrote:        \"If Congress wants to give state\n\ncourts   and    legislatures    veto    power   over    the   admission   of\n\nevidence in federal court, it will have to tell us that in plain\n\nlanguage using clear terms.\"          Id. at 1125.      We agree with this\n\npronouncement and apply it here:            because Local Rule 3.8(f)\n\nimpermissibly interferes with federal grand jury practice and\n\ntranscends district court rulemaking authority, section 530B\n\ncannot salvage it.\n\n             If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — Local\n\nRule 3.8(f) clearly extends beyond the shelter that section 530B\n\nprovides.      Although the statutory text, which refers to \"State\n\nlaws   and    rules,   and   local    Federal   court    rules,   governing\n\nattorneys,\" is arguably susceptible to a broad interpretation,\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fwe have noted before that a statute's caption may assist in\n\nclarifying ambiguities.           See, e.g., Massachusetts Ass'n of HMOs,\n\n194 F.3d at 180; Berniger v. Meadow Green-Wildcat Corp., 945\n\nF.2d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 1991).                The title of the statute here\n\n(\"Ethical standards for attorneys for the Government\") removes\n\nany doubt about its scope:          section 530B applies only to ethical\n\nstandards.      This conclusion becomes irresistible in light of the\n\nlegislative history and implementing regulations.                    See, e.g.,\n\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-825, at 1102 (1998); 144 Cong. Rec. E301\n\n(daily ed. Mar. 5, 1998) (statement of sponsor, Rep. McDade); 28\n\nC.F.R. §§ 77.1(b), 77.2(h).8\n\n              That   ends   the    matter.      Local    Rule   3.8(f),    though\n\ndoubtless motivated by ethical concerns, has outgrown those\n\nhumble beginnings.          Substance, not form, must control.             See 28\n\nC.F.R.    §   77.2(h)(1)      (explaining       that    the   applicability     of\n\nsection 530B does not depend on \"whether or not [the state or\n\nlocal] rule is included in a code of professional responsibility\n\nfor attorneys\").       As written, Local Rule 3.8(f) is more than an\n\nethical   standard.         It    adds   a   novel     procedural   step   —   the\n\nopportunity for a pre-service adversarial hearing — and to\n\n\n    8Unlike Bar Counsel, we do not ascribe much weight to the\ndire predictions of broader applicability made by opponents of\nsection 530B. See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S12,996-97 (daily ed.\nNov. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Abraham); 144 Cong. Rec.\nS12,798-99 (daily ed. Oct. 21, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch).\n\n                                         -40-\n\fcompound the matter, ordains that the hearing be conducted with\n\nnew substantive standards in mind.\n\n            In recommending the deletion of subparagraph (2) from\n\nthe former ABA Model Rule, the Standing Committee explained that\n\nthe judicial preapproval provision was an anomaly:      \"Rather than\n\nstating a substantive ethical precept, it sets out a type of\n\nimplementing requirement that is properly established by rules\n\nof criminal procedure rather than established as an ethical\n\nnorm.\"    ABA Standing Comm. on Ethics and Prof'l Responsibility,\n\nReport 101, at 7 (Aug. 1995).        We agree with this assessment.\n\nBecause Local Rule 3.8(f) goes beyond the realm of ethics,\n\nsection 530B neither rescues it nor renders the instant case\n\nmoot.9    Cf. CSC II, 189 F.3d at 1283-89 (relying on section 530B\n\nto uphold an ethics rule consisting of subparagraph (1) but\n\nwithout any provision for an adversarial hearing).\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.    We conclude that the authority\n\nof the district court to adopt Local Rule 3.8(f) is ripe for\n\njudicial review and that the two subparagraphs of the rule are\n\nto be read together.   Thus, the substantive standards delineated\n\nin subparagraph (1) must guide a court in determining whether to\n\n\n      9\n     For essentially the same reason, Local Rule 3.8(f) is\nbeyond the district court's inherent authority to regulate the\nconduct of attorneys appearing before it.\n\n                                -41-\n\fapprove an attorney subpoena in a pre-service hearing held\n\npursuant    to    subparagraph   (2).      We    also   conclude    that   the\n\nadoption of Local Rule 3.8(f) exceeded the district court's\n\nlawful     authority    to   regulate     both   grand    jury     and   trial\n\nsubpoenas.       Finally, we conclude that 28 U.S.C. § 530B does not\n\nrepair these defects.         Accordingly, we hold that Local Rule\n\n3.8(f) is without force or effect.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n           Before      assaying      a     preliminary         question   of\n\njusticiability and addressing the controversy's merits, we trace\n\nthe origins of the challenged rule and chart the travel of the\n\ncase.\n\n             A.     The Evolution of Local Rule 3.8(f).\n\n           The 1980s witnessed a dramatic increase in the number\n\nof subpoenas served on defense attorneys by federal prosecutors.\n\nThe reasons for this trend are difficult to pinpoint, but some\n\ncommentators have linked it with heightened efforts to fight\n\norganized crime and drug-trafficking, new forfeiture laws, and\n\nan unprecedented expansion of the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nSee 1 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. & W. William Hodes, The Law of\n\nLawyering § 3.8:701, at 700 (Supp. 1996); Frank O. Bowman, III,\n\nA Bludgeon by Any Other Name, 9 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 665, 686\n\nn.74 (1996).

The Instant Litigation.\n\n              By local rule, attorneys practicing in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts must\n\nadhere   to    the   ethical   rules    adopted    by   the   SJC,   unless   a\n\n                                       -7-\n\fspecific exception obtains.          See D. Mass. R. 83.6(4)(B).       On\n\nNovember 17, 1997, the United States Attorney for the District\n\nof Massachusetts, Donald K. Stern, wrote to the chief judge of\n\nthe district court, urging that such an exception be made for\n\nState Rule 3.8(f).     By letter dated December 3, 1997, the court\n\ndeclined to craft a specific exception, indicating that Stern's\n\nconcerns would be resolved on a case-by-case basis.          On January\n\n1, 1998, Rule 3.8(f) went into effect.           At that point, Stern\n\ndirected his staff to hold in abeyance any applications to the\n\ndistrict court for attorney subpoenas.\n\n           Stern and Craig C. Donsanto (a senior DOJ lawyer based\n\nin Washington and a member of the Massachusetts bar), both\n\nacting in their official capacities, filed suit in the district\n\ncourt on May 13, 1998.       They sought to have both State Rule\n\n3.8(f) and Local Rule 3.8(f) declared invalid as applied to\n\nmembers   of   the   Massachusetts    bar   practicing   before   federal\n\ncourts.   The complaint alleged in substance that Rule 3.8(f), in\n\nboth its federal and state incarnations, exceeded the district\n\ncourt's rulemaking authority, contradicted the federal common\n\nlaw anent grand jury practice, conflicted with the federal rules\n\nof criminal procedure and evidence, and violated the Supremacy\n\nClause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f            Initially, the named defendants were the SJC, the\n\nMassachusetts Board of Bar Overseers (the Board), Bar Counsel,\n\nand the United States District Court itself.1                The complaint was\n\nlater amended to add as defendants the individual judges of the\n\ndistrict court (hereinafter, along with the court itself, the\n\nJudicial Defendants).\n\n            The contours of the case were narrowed when Bar Counsel\n\nfiled an affidavit in which he vouchsafed that he would not\n\nwield    State   Rule   3.8(f)       against    federal     prosecutors,      but,\n\nrather,    would    refer    any   alleged     violations     to   the   federal\n\ndistrict court for discipline under Local Rule 3.8(f).                        This\n\nconcession rendered the Supremacy Clause issue moot and led the\n\nplaintiffs to dismiss their claims against the SJC and the\n\nBoard.     Rosenfeld then agreed not to attempt to enforce Local\n\nRule 3.8(f) against members of the Massachusetts bar practicing\n\noutside    the   commonwealth,        and    Donsanto   dropped    out   of    the\n\npicture.\n\n            Stern    had     moved    at     the   outset    for   preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief.         All the defendants opposed this motion, and\n\nthe Judicial Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint\n\n\n\n    1The SJC administers professional responsibility matters\nthrough the Board. In turn, Bar Counsel, currently Arnold R.\nRosenfeld, serves as the Board's chief enforcement officer. See\nS.J.C. R. 4:01.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fas unripe.       The district court heard argument on October 7,\n\n1998, and took both motions under advisement.                While the court\n\nwas pondering the matter, the President signed into law a bill,\n\nnow codified at 28 U.S.C. § 530B, that made certain state\n\nstandards    directly   applicable      to    federal    prosecutors.         The\n\nparties debated the relevance and effect of this provision in a\n\nseries of subsequent submissions.\n\n            The district court ultimately determined the issues\n\npresented to be ripe for review and rejected the claim that\n\nsection 530B rendered the controversy moot.

The    issue   presented    can   be   finally    resolved   by\n\ndeclaratory judgment, its contours are sharply defined, and\n\nadditional facts will not affect its resolution.             The conclusion\n\nthat the issue is fit for review is bolstered, moreover, by a\n\nrealization that deciding the question appears unavoidable:\n\nLocal   Rule      3.8(f)   imposes   new    substantive   and   procedural\n\nrequirements on prosecutors who request attorney subpoenas, and\n\nBar Counsel has stated unequivocally that he will enforce those\n\nrequirements.        Since bringing this suit, the United States\n\nAttorney has delayed requests for no fewer than twenty-six such\n\nsubpoenas, and it seems reasonable to suppose that in some of\n\nthese instances the prosecutors would have had difficulty in\n\nsatisfying the \"essentiality\" and/or \"no feasible alternative\"\n\ncriteria.      Short of a continuation of Stern's self-imposed\n\nmoratorium — and the public has a right to expect that such a\n\nstate of affairs will not last indefinitely — a test of Local\n\nRule 3.8(f)'s facial validity appears inevitable.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f           This case also satisfies the hardship prong.

Indeed,\n\ncharting such a course would put Stern on the horns of a\n\ndilemma,   forcing     him   to   decide   whether   to   serve   attorney\n\nsubpoenas in cases arguably prohibited by the local rule and\n\nthus risk potential sanctions or to refrain from so doing and\n\nthus jeopardize the success of ongoing criminal investigations.\n\nIt is precisely this sort of \"'direct and immediate' dilemma,\"\n\nW.R. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579948\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Grace,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/579948/wr-grace-co-conn-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">364</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(quoting Abbott </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Labs.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at\n\n<span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), that Congress wished to ameliorate when it passed the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act.

Because the standards\n\ncontained in the guidelines and those contained in Local Rule\n\n3.8(f) overlap, this thesis goes, there is scant likelihood that\n\nLocal Rule 3.8(f) will work any harm.

THE MERITS\n\n          The authority of the federal district courts to adopt\n\nlocal rules emanates from three sources.

On this bifurcated reading, the\n\nsubstantive standards delineated in subparagraph (1) would be\n\nrelevant only to potential disciplinary proceedings, and a court\n\ndeciding whether to approve a subpoena request pursuant to\n\nsubparagraph (2) would have no obligation to apply them.                 We\n\nreject this artificial construction of Local Rule 3.8(f).\n\n          The most sensible way to construe Local Rule 3.8(f) is\n\nas a unified whole.        Each subparagraph is a mere sentence\n\nfragment and neither makes sense without reference to the shared\n\nintroductory   language.

Subparagraph (2) outlines a\n\nprocess for determining whether a subpoena application should be\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fapproved, but gives no clue as to what standard a judge is to\n\napply in making that determination.             The obvious place to look\n\nis subparagraph (1), which sets forth such a standard.              Indeed,\n\nthe court below acknowledged that \"as a practical matter, a\n\ncourt faced with a request for an attorney-subpoena is likely to\n\nengage in a similar inquiry in the course of determining whether\n\nissuance of the subpoena is appropriate.\"            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Stern,</span> <span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> at\n\n<span class=\"page\">16</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">n.12.      The presence of the attorney to be subpoenaed — a\n\nfeature    not   involved   in   the   scheme    upheld   in   Whitehouse   —\n\nvirtually guarantees such an inquiry.\n\n             On the other hand, subparagraph (2) would serve no\n\npurpose if courts evaluated subpoena applications solely on the\n\nbasis   of    traditional    motion-to-quash       standards.      For   the\n\nadversarial hearing to be meaningful, the targeted attorney\n\nwould have to be told in advance of the content of the testimony\n\nor materials sought.        This notice, no less than service of the\n\nsubpoena itself, would drive a wedge of distrust between lawyer\n\nand client.      Thus, subparagraph (2), on the bifurcated reading,\n\nwould mirror existing quashal procedure and generate no ethics\n\nbenefits whatsoever.\n\n             The sockdolager is that the original drafters certainly\n\nintended that the two subparagraphs of the rule be harmonized,\n\nnot balkanized.       As discussed above, the text of Local Rule\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f3.8(f) derives from (and is identical to) a former ABA Model\n\nRule.    The comment to that rule made it transparently clear that\n\nthe   judicial    preapproval   described     in   subparagraph   (2)   was\n\ndesigned to ensure compliance with the substantive standards\n\ndescribed in subparagraph (1).        Absent some specific disclaimer\n\n(not present here), the district court cannot adopt verbatim the\n\ntext of a model rule without accepting the drafters' unequivocal\n\ninterpretation of its meaning.

Cf. 12\n\nCharles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3153,\n\nat 533 (2d ed. 1997) (explaining that even \"a district court's\n\nconstruction of its own rule will be reversed if the appellate\n\ncourt is convinced that the district court has misconstrued its\n\nown rule\").\n\n\n\n    3 Consistent with their position that the controversy is not\nripe, the Judicial Defendants apparently deem it incumbent upon\nthem to refrain from rendering what might be seen as an advisory\nopinion.\n\n                              -24-\n\f            Bar Counsel next invokes the principle that courts\n\nshould resist interpreting a statute in a way that provokes a\n\nconstitutional problem.

But even assuming, for argument's sake, the validity\n\nof the extended principle — on the ground, say, that the local\n\nrule   here    derives   from   a   state     rule,     and   that   the   issue\n\ntherefore has overtones of comity — it does not control the\n\noutcome   in    this   instance.         Interpretive    ingenuity     has   its\n\nlimits.

Here,\n\nthere is both a natural, holistic reading of the local rule and\n\na clear statement by the drafters in support of such a reading.\n\nIn these circumstances, we will not embrace an implausible\n\nconstruction simply to minimize the potential for conflict with\n\nfederal law.\n\n            For these reasons, we hold that Local Rule 3.8(f) must\n\nbe   read   as   an   indivisible   whole.

These are significant departures\n\nfrom    prior   practice,      and   they    raise    the    bar    for   obtaining\n\nrelevant and material evidence.             Collectively, they work changes\n\ntoo    fundamental   to   be    accomplished         under    the   aegis    of    the\n\ndistrict courts' local rulemaking power.\n\n            In particular, the \"essentiality\" and \"no feasible\n\nalternative\" requirements are substantially more onerous (and,\n\nthus, more restrictive) than the traditional motion-to-quash\n\nstandards.      Essentiality is obviously a more demanding criterion\n\nthan    relevancy    or   materiality.          By     like    token,       Rule    17\n\njurisprudence contains no corollary to the principle that a\n\nsubpoena issued to one source cannot stand if the information\n\nsought is (or may be) available from some other source.\n\n            Two examples illustrate these points.                   Suppose, in a\n\nrobbery case, that a defense lawyer received a lump-sum advance\n\npayment for services in the precise amount of the purloined\n\nfunds from a client with no visible means of support.                       There is\n\nother evidence linking the client to the robbery, so the billing\n\n\nthe term \"trial subpoenas\" as a shorthand for all other\nsubpoenas (e.g., subpoenas issued in the course of pretrial\nhearings).\n\n                                      -33-\n\finformation could not fairly be described as \"essential\" to the\n\nprosecution.        Hence,   Local   Rule    3.8(f)    would   prohibit     the\n\nprosecutor from serving a subpoena on the defense attorney,\n\nnotwithstanding the unarguable materiality and relevancy of the\n\nretainer information.        Next, consider unprivileged documents in\n\na lawyer's file relating to a complex, and possibly fraudulent,\n\ninternational real estate transaction.              These documents may be\n\nobtainable     without   a   subpoena     duces     tecum   directed   to   the\n\nlawyer, but only through time-consuming, relatively expensive\n\n(but still feasible) alternative means.             Local Rule 3.8(f) would\n\nprohibit an attorney subpoena, even though the situation easily\n\nsatisfies      standards      of     relevancy,       admissibility,        and\n\nspecificity.\n\n            These examples are not eccentric hypotheticals, but,\n\nrather, fairly typical of the sort of situation in which a\n\nprosecutor might wish to serve an attorney subpoena (others\n\neasily   can   be   conceived).      We     think   that    they   demonstrate\n\nconvincingly that Local Rule 3.8(f) imposes novel requirements\n\nthat threaten to preclude the service of otherwise unimpeachable\n\nsubpoenas and thus restrict the flow of relevant, material\n\nevidence to the factfinder.

Section 530B.\n\n             Shortly     after      the     hearing   in   the    district     court,\n\nCongress passed an omnibus budget bill.                     The bill contained a\n\nprovision entitled \"Ethical standards for attorneys for the\n\nGovernment,\" now codified as section 530B, which provides that:\n\n             An attorney for the Government shall be\n             subject to State laws and rules, and local\n             Federal court rules, governing attorneys in\n             each State where such attorney engages in\n             that attorney's duties, to the same extent\n             and in the same manner as other attorneys in\n             that State.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 530B(a).

We believe it is reasonable\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\fto require comparable specificity before inferring congressional\n\nintent to abandon the goal of national consistency anent rules\n\nof federal practice.      Moreover, that benchmark is not attainable\n\nhere:    it simply cannot be said that Congress, by enacting\n\nsection 530B, meant to empower states (or federal district\n\ncourts, for that matter) to regulate government attorneys in a\n\nmanner inconsistent with federal law.            We explain briefly.\n\n             The federal rules of procedure, unlike state laws, are\n\nnationally uniform.       See 28 U.S.C. § 2071(a); Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n57(a)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(1).              In the area of ethics,\n\nhowever, federal district courts generally have adopted their\n\nown rules, often modeled on the rules of the state in which they\n\nsit, but sometimes with significant deviations.                See, e.g., D.\n\nMass.   R.   83.6(4)(B)    (stating    that     SJC   ethics   rules   govern\n\n\"except as otherwise provided by specific rule of this court\").\n\nThe   potential    for    conflict    between    state   and    federal   law\n\ntherefore should have been obvious, but section 530B does not\n\nspeak to the issue.        Instead, Congress directed the Attorney\n\nGeneral to fill out the details of enforcement by regulation.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 530B(b) (empowering the Attorney General to\n\npromulgate implementing regulations).            These regulations dispel\n\nthe notion that section 530B grants states and lower federal\n\ncourts the power, in the guise of regulating ethics, to impose\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\fstrictures that are inconsistent with federal law.                  See 28\n\nC.F.R. § 77.1(b) (directing that section 530B \"should not be\n\nconstrued in any way to alter federal substantive, procedural,\n\nor evidentiary law\").\n\n             The Eleventh Circuit recently had the opportunity to\n\nconsider the effect of section 530B.            That court rejected the\n\nargument that the statute cured an incipient conflict between a\n\nstate ethics rule (which had been incorporated into the federal\n\ndistrict court's local rules) and the federal rules of evidence.\n\nSee United States v. Lowery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73508\"><a href=\"/opinion/73508/united-states-v-lowery/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124-25 (11th Cir.\n\n1999).       The court wrote:        \"If Congress wants to give state\n\ncourts   and    legislatures    veto    power   over    the   admission   of\n\nevidence in federal court, it will have to tell us that in plain\n\nlanguage using clear terms.\"          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73508\"><a href=\"/opinion/73508/united-states-v-lowery/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1125. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">     We agree with this\n\npronouncement and apply it here:            because Local Rule 3.8(f)\n\nimpermissibly interferes with federal grand jury practice and\n\ntranscends district court rulemaking authority, section 530B\n\ncannot salvage it.\n\n             If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — Local\n\nRule 3.8(f) clearly extends beyond the shelter that section 530B\n\nprovides.      Although the statutory text, which refers to \"State\n\nlaws   and    rules,   and   local    Federal   court    rules,   governing\n\nattorneys,\" is arguably susceptible to a broad interpretation,\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fwe have noted before that a statute's caption may assist in\n\nclarifying ambiguities.           See, e.g., Massachusetts Ass'n of </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198675\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">HMOs,</span>\n\n<a href=\"/opinion/198675/massachusetts-v-ruthardt/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Berniger v. Meadow Green-Wildcat Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568543\"><a href=\"/opinion/568543/randi-beth-berniger-v-meadow-green-wildcat-corp-dba-wildcat-mountain/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 1991).                The title of the statute here\n\n(\"Ethical standards for attorneys for the Government\") removes\n\nany doubt about its scope:          section 530B applies only to ethical\n\nstandards.      This conclusion becomes irresistible in light of the\n\nlegislative history and implementing regulations.                    See, e.g.,\n\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-825, at 1102 (1998); 144 Cong. Rec. E301\n\n(daily ed. Mar. 5, 1998) (statement of sponsor, Rep. McDade); 28\n\nC.F.R. §§ 77.1(b), 77.2(h).8\n\n              That   ends   the    matter.      Local    Rule   3.8(f),    though\n\ndoubtless motivated by ethical concerns, has outgrown those\n\nhumble beginnings.          Substance, not form, must control.             See 28\n\nC.F.R.    §   77.2(h)(1)      (explaining       that    the   applicability     of\n\nsection 530B does not depend on \"whether or not [the state or\n\nlocal] rule is included in a code of professional responsibility\n\nfor attorneys\").       As written, Local Rule 3.8(f) is more than an\n\nethical   standard.         It    adds   a   novel     procedural   step   —   the\n\nopportunity for a pre-service adversarial hearing — and to\n\n\n    8Unlike Bar Counsel, we do not ascribe much weight to the\ndire predictions of broader applicability made by opponents of\nsection 530B. See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S12,996-97 (daily ed.\nNov. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Abraham); 144 Cong. Rec.\nS12,798-99 (daily ed. Oct. 21, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch).\n\n                                         -40-\n\fcompound the matter, ordains that the hearing be conducted with\n\nnew substantive standards in mind.\n\n            In recommending the deletion of subparagraph (2) from\n\nthe former ABA Model Rule, the Standing Committee explained that\n\nthe judicial preapproval provision was an anomaly:      \"Rather than\n\nstating a substantive ethical precept, it sets out a type of\n\nimplementing requirement that is properly established by rules\n\nof criminal procedure rather than established as an ethical\n\nnorm.\"    ABA Standing Comm. on Ethics and Prof'l Responsibility,\n\nReport 101, at 7 (Aug. 1995).        We agree with this assessment.\n\nBecause Local Rule 3.8(f) goes beyond the realm of ethics,\n\nsection 530B neither rescues it nor renders the instant case\n\nmoot.9    Cf. CSC </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158581\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/158581/united-states-v-colorado-supreme/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1283-89</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(relying on section 530B\n\nto uphold an ethics rule consisting of subparagraph (1) but\n\nwithout any provision for an adversarial hearing).\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.    We conclude that the authority\n\nof the district court to adopt Local Rule 3.8(f) is ripe for\n\njudicial review and that the two subparagraphs of the rule are\n\nto be read together.   Thus, the substantive standards delineated\n\nin subparagraph (1) must guide a court in determining whether to\n\n\n      9\n     For essentially the same reason, Local Rule 3.8(f) is\nbeyond the district court's inherent authority to regulate the\nconduct of attorneys appearing before it.\n\n                                -41-\n\fapprove an attorney subpoena in a pre-service hearing held\n\npursuant    to    subparagraph   (2).      We    also   conclude    that   the\n\nadoption of Local Rule 3.8(f) exceeded the district court's\n\nlawful     authority    to   regulate     both   grand    jury     and   trial\n\nsubpoenas.       Finally, we conclude that 28 U.S.C. § 530B does not\n\nrepair these defects.         Accordingly, we hold that Local Rule\n\n3.8(f) is without force or effect.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\f</pre>",
