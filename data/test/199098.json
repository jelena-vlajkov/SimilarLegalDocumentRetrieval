On September 16, 1998, a grand jury\n\nreturned a indictment charging Dr. Stephen R. Martin and Caryn L. Camp\n\nwith ten counts of wire fraud, two counts of mail fraud, one count of\n\nconspiracy to steal trade secrets, one count of conspiracy to transport\n\nstolen goods, and one count of interstate transportation of stolen\n\ngoods.   Camp agreed to testify against     Martin as part of a plea\n\nagreement. Martin proceeded to trial, where a jury found him not\n\nguilty on six counts of wire fraud (counts 1-6) and of interstate\n\ntransportation of stolen goods (count 15). The jury found Martin\n\nguilty on the remaining counts of wire fraud (counts 7-10), mail fraud\n\n(counts 11-12), conspiracy to steal trade secrets (count 13), and\n\nconspiracy to transport stolen property in interstate commerce (count\n\n14). This appeal, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence for\n\nconviction, followed.\n\n          For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          This case arises out of an electronic mail \"pen-pal\"\n\nrelationship between a dissatisfied Maine chemist, Caryn Camp, and a\n\nCalifornia scientist, Dr. Stephen Martin.\n\nI.   Events Prior to May 1, 1998\n\n          A.   Camp's Employment at IDEXX\n\n          Camp first began work at IDEXX, Inc. (\"IDEXX\"), a\n\nmanufacturer of veterinary products headquartered in Portland, Maine,\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fin May of 1995. Camp's responsibilities as an IDEXX chemist included\n\nmixing chemicals for diagnostic test kits for both pets and livestock.\n\nAt the time of her employment, she signed non-disclosure and non-\n\ncompetition agreements, promising in part not to \"disclose to others,\n\nor use for [her] own benefit or the benefit of others, any of the\n\nDevelopments or any confidential, proprietary or secret information\n\nowned, possessed or used by [IDEXX] or its customers or contractors.\"\n\nThe proprietary information included, but was not limited to, \"trade\n\nsecrets, processes, data, know-how, marketing plans, forecasts,\n\nunpublished financial statements, budgets, licenses, prices, costs, and\n\nemployee, customer and supplier lists.\" Camp also signed the IDEXX\n\npolicy on ethics and business conduct, which prohibited employees from\n\nrevealing \"proprietary knowledge or data\" without prior authorization.\n\n          B.   Martin's Communication with IDEXX\n\n          In May 1997, Martin, as CEO of Wyoming DNA Vaccine (\"WDV\"),\n\ncontacted IDEXX with a proposal involving research into human\n\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).\n\nAlthough IDEXX ultimately rejected Martin's proposal, he signed a\n\nconfidentiality agreement during his conversations with IDEXX.\n\n          C.   Camp's Initial Contact with Martin\n\n          By early 1998, Camp was dissatisfied and bored with her job.\n\nIn January 1998, she began researching other potential job\n\nopportunities. She found the Internet web site for WDV and sent an\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\felectronic mail message with an attached resum√©. Martin responded\n\nimmediately via electronic mail, praising Camp's credentials and\n\ntouting the beauty of Cody, Wyoming (the future site of WDV). Martin\n\nalso noted the existence of the WDV-IDEXX confidentiality agreement and\n\nthe fact that WDV had chosen to \"develop [its] own program . . . with\n\nrespect to veterinary diagnostics.\" After receiving Martin's response,\n\nCamp   sent    Martin   a   letter   providing   more   detail   about   her\n\nqualifications.\n\n              Between January and March of 1998, Martin and Camp continued\n\ntheir correspondence. Based partly on Martin's encouragement and\n\npartly on her own interests, Camp contacted the Director of Regulatory\n\nAffairs at IDEXX and obtained permission to \"volunteer [her] free time\"\n\nto learn that end of the business. Martin indicated that despite\n\nCamp's preference for laboratory work, she would be more useful to WDV\n\nfor her regulatory experience and knowledge. Martin briefed Camp on\n\nhis own work at WDV, while Camp continued to update Martin on her\n\nprofessional success, in particular her promotion to a technical\n\nposition in IDEXX's Livestock/Poultry unit.\n\n              Camp and Martin's early correspondence established several\n\nthemes that would permeate their e-mails: contained within the small\n\ntalk was on-going discussion of Camp's future employment with Martin's\n\ncompany, as well as a willingness by Camp to relay IDEXX information\n\nand gossip to Martin. Camp described her promotion as preparation\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f\"for making a strong contribution to the success of WDV\" within four to\n\nsix months. Her February 27 letter contained information regarding a\n\nmanual that \"Idexx . . . [is] not exactly supposed to have.\"        And\n\nthroughout this period, Camp's correspondence included light-hearted\n\nremarks about the weather, life in Maine, and a potential future in\n\nWyoming.\n\n           D.   \"Pen-Pals\"\n\n           Camp and Martin's correspondence became more and more\n\nfrequent during March and April of 1998. Camp continued to apprise\n\nMartin of her problems with IDEXX management, the changes associated\n\nwith her new position in technical support, and her interest in new\n\nemployment, both at WDV and elsewhere.         At times she included\n\ninformation about IDEXX's internal strategic weaknesses and customer\n\ncomplaints. Camp noted in an April 12 e-mail that the information she\n\nhad transmitted was to some extent confidential. Martin reciprocated\n\nthe information exchange: he told Camp about conflicts within WDV that\n\nultimately resulted in his formation of a separate company called\n\n\"Maverck\"; he also relayed \"confidential\" WDV information. Martin\n\ncontinued to discuss Camp's future, noting that she could \"have a job\n\nwith either [WDV or Maverck],\" that he thought she \"belong[ed] in\n\nTahoe/Reno,\" and that she might \"become CEO [her]self one day.\"\n\n           As the two corresponded more frequently, their communications\n\nbecame more personal. Camp began to refer to Martin as \"Steve.\" They\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fdiscussed their families and social lives, and even shared the messages\n\nwith family members. As their relationship grew more personal, both\n\nCamp and Martin, but particularly Martin, spoke jokingly of the \"spy\"\n\naspect of the correspondence. For example, Martin referred to Camp's\n\ngossip as \"IDEXX Files\" and described the events at WDV as a \"palace\n\ncoup.\" Martin also continued to praise Camp's \"aggressiveness\" and\n\nexhorted her to work only in her own interest and to continue to\n\naccumulate relevant knowledge.\n\n          On April 14, Martin indicated that he \"had much to tell\"\n\nCamp, but that he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement first.\n\nCamp considered signing the agreement immediately, but ultimately\n\npostponed signing because of potential ethical concerns, including\n\npotential competition between WDV and IDEXX.1\n\n          On April 22, Camp sent Martin an e-mail discussing the\n\npoultry and livestock industries, noting problems IDEXX customers had\n\nbeen having with particular diagnostic kits, and mentioning that\n\ncustomers \"loved\" the IDEXX free software program \"x-Chek.\" Camp\n\ncontinued to discuss IDEXX's poor customer service approach in her May\n\n1 \"travelogue,\" written during a business trip to the Midwest.\n\n\n\n\n1 In an April 19 e-mail message, Camp wrote: \"I'm not certain of how\ncomfortable I am with signing the agreement as long as I am working for\nanother company - particularly a company which is or could be a\npotential competitor, nor I am I [sic] comfortable with you sharing\nwith me anything which you feel needs to be covered by this agreement.\"\n\n                                 -7-\n\fThroughout her \"travelogue,\" Camp repeatedly expressed her happiness in\n\nbeing away from IDEXX and her willingness to move on to new employment.\n\nII.   Events Between May 1, 1998 and July 18, 1998\n\n          The government's first six counts of wire fraud, on which\n\nMartin was acquitted, stem from correspondence occurring prior to July\n\n18, 1998. One count of mail fraud, on which Martin was convicted, also\n\nstems from this period.\n\n          A.   Martin's Initial Requests\n\n          On May 1, in response to Camp's lengthy e-mail detailing her\n\ntrip, Martin made his first explicit request for information, asking\n\nfor \"any info. . . . on the HOT topics in veterinary diagnostics.\"\n\nMartin renewed his request in a May 3 e-mail in which he asked a number\n\nof questions about IDEXX prices, test composition, and test use. In a\n\nsubsequent message, Martin outlined his ability to avoid patent\n\ninfringement with IDEXX and noted that \"IDEXX is going to be in trouble\n\nvery soon.\" On May 3, Camp responded with answers to most of Martin's\n\nquestions. Attached was a letter detailing problems with a particular\n\nIDEXX product. In reference to a previous discussion about flying\n\nplanes, Martin began to refer to Camp as \"Ace,\" a moniker which would\n\nbecome \"Agent Ace\" as their \"spy\" business heated up.\n\n          B.   Camp's Responses\n\n          On May 4, Camp wrote concerning IDEXX's legal problems. She\n\nalso included \"lots & lots of goodies for your next rainy day,\"\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fincluding internal memoranda. Camp noted that the internal memoranda\n\nmay have been confidential. \"I feel like a spy,\" she commented. In a\n\nletter the next day, Camp regretted her actions, promising to \"be good\n\n. . . and send no more dirty secrets from Idexx. . . .\"         Martin\n\nresponded, claiming that he did \"not want to know anything confidential\n\nabout IDEXX,\" and asking only for \"public information.\"\n\n          Despite Camp's repentance and Martin's denial of any desire\n\nfor confidential or proprietary information, Camp continued to assemble\n\nand pass on information, an activity which she apparently viewed as\n\nethically suspect.2 Camp also relayed information on IDEXX's strategic\n\nplans, including a potential partnership with a company whose name, at\n\nleast, was confidential. By late June, Camp appeared set on leaving\n\nIDEXX, as she commented that \"I need to unload all of my stock\n\noptions.\" Furthermore, Camp had received (and ignored) reminders of\n\nher non-compete and non-disclosure agreements; she forwarded these\n\nreminders to Martin, noting that \"as a spy myself, I get a particular\n\nchuckle out of [them],\" and that \"my loyalty has ended.\" Camp and\n\n\n2 Camp's May 7 e-mail noted that \"the fun part of my week has been\nputting together packages of information for you . . .\" and celebrated\n\"the intrigue of being Agent Ace.\" On June 22, she \"couldn't resist\nplaying Ace-the-Spy today . . . and so I am dropping a few more things\nin the mail.\" But her fun did not come without guilt: \"I know I should\nbe shot. But I just can't resist sending you this chain of internal\nIdexx e-mails regarding concern of a certain competitor;\" \"I am\nprobably crossing the line with this [but] I've crossed lines worse\nthan this one.\" However, Camp re-assured herself that she was doing\nnothing wrong, that she was forwarding \"nothing proprietary\" but simply\nthe \"dirty secrets of an IDEXX Livestock and Poultry weekly meeting.\"\n\n                                 -9-\n\fMartin began to formalize their plans for meeting at Lake Tahoe in\n\nearly August, as well as for Camp's eventual move to Nevada.3\n\n\n\n\n3 The result of the so-called \"palace coup\" was that Martin left WDV\nto begin a separate venture (Maverck) prospectively located in Reno,\nNevada.\n\n                               -10-\n\f          C.   More Questions\n\n          As Camp prepared to leave IDEXX, she continued to send Martin\n\ninformation, at times upon his requests and at times on her own\n\ninitiative.    In a July 4 e-mail, Martin inquired about IDEXX's\n\nmethodology for flourescent-based tests. Camp responded that she was\n\nnot familiar with the technology, but that she would \"try to have some\n\nanswers by the end of the week.\" By July 7, she did. In a postscript\n\nto a July 10 message, Martin renewed his request regarding particular\n\ntests, their procedures, and IDEXX sales practices. Camp responded to\n\nthe extent she was able.\n\n          D.   Potential Competition\n\n          Martin also disclosed his \"game-plan\" to compete with IDEXX.\n\nMartin noted that Camp should \"think tests for heartworm, FIV, FeLV,\n\netc.,\" all tests IDEXX currently sold.          Camp responded with\n\ninstructions on how \"[t]o beat the competition (for cat & dog\n\ndiagnostics) . . . [in which] Idexx is definitely the world-wide\n\nleader.\" Martin egged her on: \"I always meant to tell you that we\n\ncould always start our own veterinary lab service company - just like\n\nall the fine folks that IDEXX is trying to buy out.\"\n\n          E.   The First Package\n\n          On July 12, Camp sent Martin a large package of information\n\nvia Priority Mail, including various devices, product inserts, USDA\n\ncourse materials, information on her own projects, miscellaneous IDEXX\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fproduct information, and \"Examples of My Work,\" labeled \"Confidential.\"\n\nCamp also promised to send an actual test kit, if Martin wished. The\n\nmailing and receipt of this package formed the basis of a mail fraud\n\ncharge, of which Martin was ultimately convicted. After receiving the\n\npackage, Martin once more praised Camp's aggressiveness, encouraged her\n\nto \"keep on charging,\" to \"keep on thinking about the competition, and\n\nhow we can beat them,\" and promised that \"lips are sealed.\"\n\nIII.   Events Between July 19, 1998 to August 16, 1998\n\n          Correspondence during the next several weeks provided the\n\nbasis for Martin's conviction on four counts of wire fraud.\n\n          A.   More Questions and Answers\n\n          In several e-mails between July 19 and July 21, Camp outlined\n\na proposal for customer-friendly additions and modifications to current\n\nIDEXX technology.     Martin explained how such a test might be\n\nconstructed, telling Camp that if it could be marketed successfully,\n\nshe would receive \"enough bonus money to buy [a] house for cash.\" Camp\n\nclearly understood that the proposal was for technology competitive\n\nwith that of IDEXX, as she suggested the possibility that \"[she and\n\nMartin would] own the whole market.\"\n\n          Camp's proposal also prompted Martin to ask about the\n\nrelevance and applicability of x-Chek or similar software.        Camp\n\noffered to send Martin a copy of the software IDEXX had developed for\n\npoultry and livestock testing. Martin responded the same day, writing\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fthat \"he would like to play with the software you mentioned.\" Camp\n\nimmediately replied, promising \"lots of cool goodies,\" including the x-\n\nChek disks. Camp also indicated that she was on the verge of \"cleaning\n\nout her office\" and leaving IDEXX; however, she noted that she was\n\nspeaking to headhunters in addition to Martin.\n\n           Martin's response to this last message re-affirmed his\n\nintention to compete with IDEXX.4 Moreover, Martin acknowledged Camp's\n\npotentially illicit activity, and exhorted her to continue in her final\n\nfew days at work.   \"Before you bag IDEXX (I am embarrassed to ask\n\nthis), absorb as much information, physically and intellectually, as\n\nyou can.   I never had a spy before.\"    Camp's answer bemoaned the\n\nconstraints on her information gathering (because co-workers knew she\n\nwas preparing to leave), detailed her continued efforts to take home\n\nboth information and property, and admitted the illegality (or at least\n\ninappropriateness) of her actions.5 However, Camp noted that she had\n\nas of yet been unwilling to copy \"confidential\" documents, although she\n\nadmitted that she had copied \"semi-confidential\" internal e-mail. The\n\n\n\n4 Martin wrote: \"We are going to be in the veterinary business big time\n- vaccines and diagnostics. Dogs, cats, poultry and livestock.\"\n5 \"I have been filling my briefcase every day with all the stuff that\nI want to keep. . . . Aren't I awful? I'm liking this spy business\nway too much. . . . The problem [with hiring other IDEXX employees] is\nthey'll see what a thief I am. . . . My biggest \"inheritance\" from\nIdexx is a multi-channel pipettor. . . . I am still feeling guilty\nabout [taking the pipets]. I don't know where all this lawlessness in\nme is coming from.\"\n\n                                 -13-\n\fnext day, Camp promised to send Martin additional kits as her last\n\n\"secret agent\" act.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f          B.   The Second Package\n\n          In Camp's last several days at IDEXX, she continued to\n\ncollect products and information, which she forwarded to Martin on July\n\n24. The package included operating manuals, IDEXX marketing materials,\n\nresearch and development data, a sales binder prepared by an\n\nindependent contractor, as well as a binder labeled \"Competition.\"\n\n          C.   Found Out\n\n          Unfortunately for Camp and Martin, Camp inadvertently sent\n\nher July 25 e-mail (acknowledging that July 24 was her last day and\n\ndetailing the contents of her second package) to John Lawrence, the\n\nglobal marketing manager for Poultry/Livestock at IDEXX. Camp informed\n\nMartin of what she had done, and continued on her vacation. According\n\nto Camp, Martin later recommended that she lie to IDEXX, i.e., that she\n\ntell them that he was interested only in limited information unrelated\n\nto IDEXX core businesses.      Upon her return to Maine, Camp was\n\nintercepted and interviewed by an FBI agent at the Portland airport.\n\nAn August 9, 1998 search of Martin's home found the contents of Camp's\n\nsecond package, including the x-Chek software.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.   Standard of Review\n\n          An appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\n\npresented to a jury faces a difficult task. An appellate court must\n\n\"examine the evidence in the light most flattering to the prosecution,\"\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\findulge \"all reasonable inferences in favor\" of the prosecution, and\n\nthen determine \"whether a reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\" United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st\n\nCir. 1993). The court must credit both direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence, without evaluating or speculating on the weight the jury has\n\ngiven different pieces of evidence, and without making its own\n\njudgments as to credibility. See id. Furthermore, juries need not\n\nevaluate pieces of evidence in isolation, but may draw conclusions from\n\nthe sum of an evidentiary presentation. See United States v. Ortiz,\n\n966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992). Even if the appellate court feels\n\nthat a jury could have reached a different verdict, the court need only\n\nsatisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in \"a plausible\n\nrendition of the record.\" Id. Note, however, that the jury verdict is\n\nnot given a \"free pass\"; if the evidence, when viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable    to   the   government,   \"gives   equal   or   nearly   equal\n\ncircumstantial support\" to theories of guilt and innocence, the\n\nconvictions must be reversed. United States v. And√∫jar, 49 F.3d 16, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\nII.   Conspiracy to Steal Trade Secrets\n\n            The jury found Martin guilty of count 13, which charged him\n\nwith conspiracy to steal trade secrets in violation of the Economic\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fEspionage Act of 1996, specifically 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1832(a)(5).6 In order\n\nto find a defendant guilty of conspiracy, the prosecution must prove\n\n(1) that an agreement existed, (2) that it had an unlawful purpose, and\n\n(3) that the defendant was a voluntary participant.

Garc√≠a, 983\n\nF.2d 1160, 1165 (1st Cir. 1993)). In addition, the government must\n\nprove that at least one conspirator committed an \"overt act,\" that is,\n\ntook an affirmative step toward achieving the conspiracy's purpose.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1832(a)(5); United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006,\n\n1014 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          The agreement need not be express, however, as long as its\n\nexistence may be inferred from the \"defendants' words and actions and\n\nthe interdependence of activities and persons involved.\" Cassiere, 4\n\nF.3d at 1015 (quoting United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 241-42\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)). A so-called \"tacit\" agreement will suffice. See\n\nUnited States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 67 (1st Cir. 1998). Moreover,\n\nthe conspirators need not succeed in completing the underlying act, see\n\nUnited States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 1987), nor need that\n\nunderlying act even be factually possible.        See id.\n\n          As of yet, only the Third Circuit has had the opportunity to\n\naddress ¬ß 1832(a), which specifically covers private corporate\n\nespionage. See United States v. Hsu, 155 F.3d 189 (3d Cir. 1998). The\n\nstatute criminalizes the knowing theft of trade secrets, as well as\n\nattempts or conspiracies to steal trade secrets. The Act defines a\n\n\"trade secret\" broadly, to include both tangible property and\n\nintangible information, as long as the owner \"has taken reasonable\n\nmeasures to keep such information secret\" and the information \"derives\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\findependent economic value . . . from not being generally known to . .\n\n. the public.\" Id. at 196; 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1839(3).7 This definition of\n\ntrade secret \"protects a wider variety\" of information than most civil\n\nlaws; however, \"it is clear that Congress did not intend . . . to\n\nprohibit lawful competition such as the use of general skills or\n\nparallel development of a similar product,\" Hsu, 155 F.3d at 196-97,\n\nalthough it did mean to punish \"the disgruntled former employee who\n\nwalks out of his former company with a computer diskette full of\n\nengineering schematics,\" id. at 201 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 104-788, at\n\n7). In other words, ¬ß 1832(a) was not designed to punish competition,\n\neven when such competition relies on the know-how of former employees\n\nof a direct competitor. It was, however, designed to prevent those\n\nemployees (and their future employers) from taking advantage of\n\nconfidential information gained, discovered, copied, or taken while\n\nemployed elsewhere.\n\n          Martin contends that the evidence is factually insufficient\n\nto establish a \"meeting of the minds\" or agreement to violate ¬ß\n\n1832(a), because (1) insufficient evidence exists to establish an\n\n\n7 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1839 defines the term \"trade secret\" to include \"all\nforms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic\nor engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations,\nprogram devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques,\nprocesses, procedures, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and\nwhether or how stored, compiled or memorialized physically,\nelectronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing,\" as long\nas the \"reasonable measures\" and \"independent economic value\" tests are\nmet (emphasis added).\n\n                                 -19-\n\fagreement between Martin and Camp; (2) insufficient evidence exists to\n\nprove that Martin had the necessary intent to commit an act prohibited\n\nby ¬ß 1832(a), i.e., injure the owner of the trade secret (IDEXX); and\n\n(3) the information provided by Camp to Martin did not meet the\n\nstatutory definition of a trade secret under ¬ß 1839(3). As we explain\n\nbelow, none of these arguments are persuasive.\n\n          First, the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to\n\nconclude that Martin and Camp formed an agreement regarding the theft\n\nof trade secrets.    Martin's argument against the existence of an\n\nagreement relies on the facts that (a) his early e-mails specifically\n\nrequested that Camp not send him confidential information, and (b) Camp\n\ndid not seem to know the distinction between confidential information,\n\nproprietary information, and office gossip. However, while Martin's\n\ndisclaimer and Camp's confusion indicate the lack of an explicit\n\nagreement at that time, they do not necessarily negate the existence of\n\nan agreement. See Woodward, 149 F.3d at 67 (including tacit agreements\n\nwithin conspiracy requirements). A rational jury could have plausibly\n\nconcluded on the basis of the evidence presented at trial that an\n\nagreement existed.     By July 21, Martin had received extensive\n\ncorrespondence from Camp that she had either marked \"confidential\" or\n\n\"proprietary,\" or had expressed some hesitation in forwarding.8 Despite\n\n8 Some of the information Martin received in their early correspondence\nclearly had the potential to fall within the ¬ß 1839 definition of trade\nsecret: for example, cost information unavailable to the public\n\n                                 -20-\n\fhis previous protestations that he wanted nothing to do with IDEXX or\n\nits confidential information, Martin asked Camp on July 21 to \"absorb\n\nas much information, physically and intellectually, as you can,\" and\n\nincluded a set of questions to direct Camp's research. Throughout June\n\nand July, Martin referred to Camp as \"Agent Ace,\" or as his \"spy.\"\n\nGiven the type of information that Martin had already received, a\n\nreasonable jury could have concluded that, whatever Martin's original\n\nintentions, as of July 21, Camp and Martin had reached a tacit\n\nagreement by which she would send him items and information that\n\npotentially fell under the trade secret definition of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß\n\n1839(3).   In other words, sufficient evidence exists to show an\n\nagreement between Camp and Martin to violate ¬ß 1832(a).\n\n           Second, the evidence is sufficient to show that Martin\n\nintended to injure IDEXX by obtaining IDEXX trade secrets and competing\n\nagainst IDEXX. Although Martin consistently claimed that he had no\n\ninterest in developing products that competed with IDEXX, and hence had\n\nno intention of injuring IDEXX economically, his correspondence with\n\nCamp detailed a plan of competition. Martin had, among other things,\n\nconsidered the possibility of starting a competing veterinary lab,9 and\n\n\nincluded in Camp's message of May 2, a confidential IDEXX business plan\nincluded in Camp's June 8 message, and a customer list included in\nCamp's July 1 message.\n9 In his July 19 message, Martin told Camp that he had \"always meant\nto tell [her] that [they] could always start our own veterinary lab\nservice company - just like all those fine folks that IDEXX is trying\n\n                                 -21-\n\fhad asked Camp to think, in particular, about ways to compete with\n\ntests that IDEXX manufactured. A reasonable jury could have found that\n\nMartin intended to use the information gained from Camp, particularly\n\ninformation on IDEXX's costs and customer dissatisfaction with IDEXX,\n\nto create a more successful competitor with greater capability to\n\ninjure IDEXX.\n\n          Third, Martin's final argument - that he actually received\n\nno trade secrets - even if true, is irrelevant. Martin has only been\n\nfound guilty of a conspiracy to steal trade secrets, rather than the\n\nunderlying offense.10 See Giry, 818 F.2d at 126. The relevant question\n\nto determine whether a conspiracy existed was whether Martin intended\n\nto violate the statute. See id; see also Hsu, 155 F.3d at 198 (\"[T]he\n\ncrimes charged - attempt and conspiracy - do not require proof of the\n\nexistence of an actual trade secret, but, rather, proof only of one's\n\nattempt or conspiracy with intent to steal a trade secret.\"). The key\n\nquestion is whether Martin intended to steal trade secrets. A rational\n\njury, considering the information Camp had already sent Martin, could\n\nhave concluded that his further queries indicated such an intention.\n\n\n\n\nto buy out.\" A previous message from Camp to Martin had detailed\nIDEXX's strategy of purchasing competitors.\n10 Similarly, it is not problematic that the jury found Martin not\nguilty on the underlying offense of interstate transportation of stolen\ngoods, but did find him guilty of the conspiracy to commit such a\ncrime. See United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                                -22-\n\f          A reasonable jury could therefore have concluded that Martin\n\nand Camp formed an agreement by which Camp conveyed information and\n\nproperty to Martin that potentially fell under the definition of a\n\ntrade secret in 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1839. As a result, sufficient evidence\n\nexisted to convict Martin of conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fIII.    Conspiracy to Transport Stolen Property in Interstate Commerce\n\n            The jury also found Martin guilty of conspiracy to transport\n\nstolen goods interstate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 231411 and 18\n\nU.S.C. ¬ß 371,12 as charged in count 14.       Again, a conviction for\n\nconspiracy does not require that the defendant was successful in the\n\nunderlying offense, see Giry, 818 F.2d at 126, but only that an\n\nagreement to commit the underlying offense existed, see Echeverri, 982\n\nF.2d at 679, and that at least one co-conspirator committed an overt\n\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy, see United States v. Cassiere, 4\n\nF.3d 1006, 1014 (1st Cir. 1993). To be found guilty of a conspiracy to\n\ntransport stolen goods interstate, Martin must have agreed to transport\n\n\"goods, wares, [or] merchandise,\" with a \"value of $5,000 or more,\" in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce, and \"known the same to have been\n\nstolen, converted or taken by fraud.\" Dowling v. United States, 473\n\nU.S. 207, 214 (1985) (citing 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2314). Although intangible,\n\n\"purely intellectual\" property does not fall within the auspices of ¬ß\n\n2314, intangible components of tangible items may contribute to the\n\n\n11   In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2314 provides that:\n\n            Whoever transports, transmits, or transfers in\n       interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares,\n       merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or\n       more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or\n       taken by fraud. . . . shall be fined under this title or\n       imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n1218 U.S.C. ¬ß 371 punishes conspiracies \"to commit any offense against\nthe United States.\"\n\n                                  -24-\n\f$5,000 value requirement. See United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301,\n\n1307-08 & n.14 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\n           The indictment for conspiracy to transport stolen goods was\n\nbased in part on Martin's July 21 request for a copy of x-Chek software\n\nand his July 22 acknowledgment that Camp would be sending him\n\nadditional test kits. See Brief for Appellant 31 (admitting that the\n\n\"evidence at trial established . . . two instances on which Dr. Martin\n\nrequested 'property,' as opposed to 'information.'\"). Martin received\n\na large package from Camp in the mail after sending these two e-mails.\n\nHowever, Martin claims that (1) this evidence is insufficient to\n\nestablish the existence of an agreement with Camp to transport stolen\n\nproperty; and (2) that the property in question did not meet the $5,000\n\nvalue requirement of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2314.\n\n           Martin first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport the existence of an agreement between Camp and himself with\n\nrespect to stolen property. For the same reasons that a rational jury\n\ncould plausibly have found an agreement to steal trade secrets, we\n\nconclude that the same rational jury could have found an agreement\n\nbetween Camp and Martin by which she would send him property from\n\nIDEXX.   However, the question remains whether that agreement (1)\n\ncovered \"stolen\" property in violation of ¬ß 2314, and (2) covered\n\nproperty with a value of more than $5,000.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f          For property to be \"stolen\" under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2314, the\n\ndefendant must have \"known\" it to be \"stolen, converted or taken by\n\nfraud.\" Although the prosecution introduced testimony that IDEXX only\n\nprovided x-Chek for \"free\" under a license agreement with its\n\ncustomers, Martin claimed that, based on Camp's previous e-mail\n\ncommunication, he believed the software was free.13 However, in a\n\nconviction challenged for sufficiency of the evidence, we must give the\n\njury's finding great weight, asking only whether a \"reasonable\" or\n\n\"rational\" jury could have \"plausibly\" found guilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677; United States v. Ortiz, 966\n\nF.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992). In this case, given that three months\n\nhad passed since Camp had described x-Chek as \"free,\" that she had\n\noriginally discussed it in connection with customer satisfaction, that\n\nthe \"free\" label occurred at the end of a lengthy e-mail, and that\n\nMartin was a scientist who had surely dealt with companies such as\n\nIDEXX before, a jury could certainly have concluded that he knew that\n\nsuch companies did not provide major software packages for free to\n\nthose who were neither customers nor potential customers, and that\n\nMartin knew the software had been stolen or converted from IDEXX.\n\n\n\n\n13In an April 22, 1998 e-mail, Camp had provided \"a few comments on\nthe poultry and livestock industries,\" concluding that \"[t]he main\nselling point for IDEXX is the free software program (x-Chek) for data\nanalysis and monitoring of vaccination programs - customers love it.\"\n\n                                 -26-\n\f          Moreover, with respect to the \"free\" test kits, the evidence\n\nis much stronger that Martin knew that they had been \"stolen, converted\n\nor taken by fraud.\" First, when Camp sent Martin the original set of\n\nkits, she told him not to \"say where [he] got them,\" and not to mention\n\nthem to her relatives, because \"all rules are null-and-void now that\n\nIdexx has been acquiring kits from its competitors by sneaky means.\"\n\nEven though Camp noted that it was part of her job to send free kits to\n\npotential customers, Martin was clearly not a potential customer, and\n\ncould not plausibly have believed that this mandate applied to his\n\n\"spy\" sending free kits to him.14 Furthermore, Martin admitted that,\n\nin the future, he would have to buy the kits, suggesting that he did\n\nnot really believe he was entitled to obtain them for free.\n\n          Finally, the jury could have plausibly concluded that\n\nMartin's July 21 request to Camp to \"absorb as much information,\n\nphysically and intellectually, as you can,\" included a request to send\n\nhim physical goods such as test kits and software. Martin had already\n\nreceived items from Camp, and was at the time expecting further items,\n\nsuch as the x-Chek software. Although Martin is correct that ¬ß 2314\n\ndoes not apply to purely \"intangible information,\" the theft of which\n\nis punishable under copyright law and other intellectual property\n\n\n\n14Furthermore, Camp appended a facetious \"smiley face\" to her e-mail\nmention of her duty to send customers free kits, indicating that\nwhatever her job description was, it did not include sending Martin\nfree kits.\n\n                                 -27-\n\fstatutes, see United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1307 (10th Cir.\n\n1991), ¬ß 2314 does apply when there has been \"some tangible item taken,\n\nhowever insignificant or valueless it may be, absent the intangible\n\ncomponent,\" id. at 1308 n.14. Given that at this time Camp had already\n\nsent Martin numerous tangible items, he would have been on notice that\n\nany request to \"absorb information\" might (and likely would) produce\n\ntangible material that he would receive.\n\n          As for Martin's claim that the value of his requests did not\n\nmeet the $5,000 floor, there is evidence that the value of the x-Chek\n\nsoftware approached $2,500, and that individual diagnostic kits ranged\n\nfrom $1,500 to $2,200. Furthermore, there is evidence that Martin was\n\naware of the potential cost of test kits.15 Whether the actual items\n\nreceived exceeded the statutory value or not (and there is strong\n\nevidence that they in fact did), a jury could plausibly have concluded\n\nthat Martin, with sufficient knowledge of the kit price, had requested\n\nitems that would likely have exceeded $5,000 and thus satisfied the\n\nvalue prong of the conspiracy charge.16\n\nIV.   Wire Fraud and Mail Fraud\n\n\n15Martin had asked Camp about IDEXX pricing on May 3, 1998, and she\nresponded later the same day with the $1,500-$2,200 range.\n16 In fact, a jury could have concluded that Martin over-estimated the\nprice of diagnostic kits: although Camp provided price information in\nthe $1,500-$2,200 range, the actual price of some of the kits received\nby Martin ranged from $65 to $250. Martin could therefore have intended\nto steal $10,000 worth of property, but have only been successful in\nstealing $5,000 worth.\n\n                                 -28-\n\f           The remainder of defendant's convictions are based on four\n\ncounts of wire fraud and two counts of mail fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n¬ß¬ß 2 (aiding and abetting), 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), and\n\n1346 (honest services fraud).17     Because of the similarity of the\n\noperative language of the wire fraud and mail fraud statutes, we\n\nanalyze the offenses together. See Carpenter v. United States, 484\n\nU.S. 19, 25 n.6 (1987); United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 586 n.11\n\n(1st Cir. 1996). To prove wire or mail fraud, the government must\n\nshow: (1) a scheme to defraud by means of false pretenses; (2) the\n\ndefendant's knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the\n\nintent to defraud; and (3) the use of interstate wire or mail\n\ncommunications in furtherance of the scheme. See Cassiere, 4 F.3d at\n\n1011 (citing United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1989))\n\n\n\n\n17   The relevant language of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1341 and 1343 is the same:\n\n      Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or\n      artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by\n      means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or\n      promises . . . [uses the mails or wires, or causes their\n      use] for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice .\n      . . shall be punished.\n\n     18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1346 defines a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" in the\nwire and mail fraud statutes to include \"a scheme or artifice to\ndeprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\"\n\n     18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2 extends liability to a defendant who \"aids, abets,\ncounsels, commands, induces or procures [the] commission [of an\noffense,]\" and to those who \"willfully cause an act to be done\" which\nwould be an offense if performed by the defendant.\n\n                                 -29-\n\f(elements of wire fraud); United States v. Montminy, 936 F.2d 626, 627\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (elements of mail fraud).\n\n          Although the mail and wire fraud statutes originally required\n\nthat the scheme to defraud aim to deprive the victim of property or\n\nsome other item of economic value, see United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d\n\n713, 723 (1st Cir. 1996), congressional legislation aimed at overruling\n\nMcNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), expanded the definition\n\nto include \"schemes intended to deprive another of the intangible right\n\nto honest services.\" Id. Despite concerns about the overreaching of\n\nthe wire and mail fraud statutes into the employer-employee\n\nrelationship, see, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720 F.2d 1327, 1336\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1983), courts have upheld convictions based on employee\n\nmisconduct, see, e.g., United States v. Frost, 125 F.3d 346 (6th Cir.\n\n1997). As a result of this expanded definition, in order to uphold\n\nMartin's conviction, sufficient evidence must exist to show his\n\nparticipation in either (1) a scheme to defraud IDEXX of property or\n\nother items of economic value by false pretenses, or (2) a scheme to\n\ndefraud IDEXX of Camp's honest services by false pretenses. Note that\n\nMartin's success in the scheme is not relevant. See, e.g., Serrano,\n\n870 F.2d at 6. We conclude that a rational jury could have found that\n\nsuch evidence had been proven under either theory.\n\n          A.   Property Theory\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f           Confidential information may be considered property for the\n\npurposes of ¬ß¬ß 1341 and 1343. See United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d\n\n1069, 1074 (1st Cir. 1997). Where such information is obtained - thus\n\ndepriving the rightful owner of its property rights - through dishonest\n\nor deceitful means, the wire and mail fraud statutes may be violated.\n\nSee id.   However, mere access to the confidential information is\n\ninsufficient; rather, \"either some articulable harm must befall the\n\nholder of the information as a result of the defendant's activities, or\n\nsome gainful use must be intended by the person accessing the\n\ninformation, whether or not this use is profitable in the economic\n\nsense.\" Id. In other words, for Martin's convictions to stand under\n\nthis prong of the wire and mail fraud statutes, sufficient evidence\n\nmust exist for a reasonable jury to find that Martin knowingly and\n\nwillingly participated in a scheme to defraud IDEXX of confidential\n\ninformation or other property via false pretenses, and in so doing\n\neither harmed IDEXX or intended to use the information for his own\n\ngain.\n\n           Martin claims that because, on their face, the e-mails on\n\nwhich counts 7-10 are based contained no misrepresentations, they\n\ncannot provide the basis for a scheme to defraud.18 However, the e-\n\n18 We will ignore the government's somewhat fanciful suggestions that\n(1) Martin's delivery of confidential information about his own company\nand (2) Martin's promises of future employment were themselves\nmisrepresentations. There is no evidence that Martin - for all his\nethical failings here - was insincere in his employment offer to Camp,\n\n                                 -31-\n\fmails themselves need not be fraudulent; rather, it is the scheme\n\nitself that must rely on false pretenses. See United States v. Green,\n\n786 F.2d 247, 249 (7th Cir. 1986) (\"The causal connection between the\n\nmailing and the success of the scheme, not the knavery in the mailings,\n\nis what matters.\").\n\n          A reasonable jury could first have found that, as of July 12\n\n(the date after which the four wire fraud and two mail fraud\n\nconvictions stem), Camp had agreed with Martin to send him confidential\n\ninformation and tangible property. Camp had previously noted that her\n\ne-mails contained information that she should not have spread; Martin's\n\nrepeated questions designed to elicit further information, including\n\nhis acceptance of Camp as his \"spy,\" provide further evidence of the\n\nscheme. A reasonable jury could have found that Martin intended to use\n\nsuch confidential information either to compete with IDEXX, thus\n\nharming IDEXX, or at the very least for his own pecuniary gain. For\n\nexample, Martin and Camp engaged in a lengthy discussion of the best\n\nmanner in which to design a test kit that would surpass IDEXX's in\n\nserving demanding customers in the veterinary profession. A reasonable\n\njury could have found that Martin's requests, including to \"absorb as\n\nmuch information, physically and intellectually as possible,\" indicate\n\n\n\nnor that his passing of confidential information to her was anything\nmore than a calculated risk to get her excited about his projects.\nCamp's consistent misrepresentations to IDEXX are, however, sufficient\nto support the charges of the indictment under examination here.\n\n                                 -32-\n\fthat his participation in the scheme was both willing and knowing.\n\nFinally, a reasonable jury could have found that Camp's actions -\n\nincluding requesting information beyond her job description without\n\ninforming IDEXX of her conflicted interests, sending Martin information\n\nand property under the pretense that he was a customer who had a right\n\nto receive information and property free, and relaying confidential\n\ninformation in violation of both her fiduciary duty to IDEXX and her\n\nsigned non-disclosure and non-compete agreements - constituted false\n\npretenses.19\n\n          B.   Honest Services Theory\n\n          Alternatively, the jury could have found that Martin and\n\nCamp's e-mail communications and mail deposits constituted a scheme to\n\ndeprive IDEXX of Camp's honest services. Although the honest services\n\ndoctrine has mainly been used to punish fraud against the citizenry\n\nperpetrated by government officials,20 see, e.g., Czubinski at 1076-77,\n\ncourts both before McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), and\n\n\n19The fact that Camp engaged in the false pretense, rather than Martin\nhimself, is irrelevant as long as Martin knowingly and willfully\nparticipated in the scheme to take advantage of the false pretenses.\nSee Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1011. As discussed above, a rational jury\ncould have found that Martin's knowledge of the scheme, reference to\nCamp as his \"spy,\" and repeated requests for information were\nsufficient to support a finding that he willingly and knowingly\nparticipated in the scheme.\n20This was the case both before McNally overruled the honest services\ndoctrine, see McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 359-60 (1987),\nand after Congress re-instated the doctrine by passing 18 U.S.C. ¬ß\n1346, see Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1076 n.9.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fafter the passage of ¬ß 1346 have been willing to expand the doctrine to\n\nthe employer-employee relationship, see id. at 1077; United States v.\n\nSun Diamond Growers of California, 138 F.3d 961, 973 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n\n(¬ß 1346 \"has also been used, as here, to prosecute private citizens who\n\ndefraud private entities\"). However, courts have been hesitant to\n\nimpose federal mail and wire fraud liability upon every employee\n\ntransgression, and have required \"a failure to disclose something which\n\nin the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent\n\nbusiness risk to the employer,\" or creates \"reasonably foreseeable\n\neconomic harm\" to the employer. Sun Diamond, 138 F.3d at 973 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Lemire, 720 F.2d 1327, 1337 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).21 While\n\nthis Court has held that merely examining confidential information for\n\none's own purposes does not rise to this level, see Czubinski at 1077,\n\nuse of confidential information for \"private purposes\" may rise to the\n\nnecessary level of self-dealing.        See id.22\n\n\n21Although the First Circuit has not yet considered a case in which\nthe honest services fraud doctrine is applied to the defrauding of a\nprivate entity, in Czubinski the court suggested that the Lemire\nstandard was the appropriate one. See Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1077\n(concluding that \"there must be a breach of a fiduciary duty to an\nemployer that involves self-dealing of an order significantly more\nserious than the [viewing of confidential information at issue in\nCzubinski]\") (citing Lemire, 720 F.2d at 1332-34).\n22Other courts have found honest services fraud by an employee for\npecuniary-related breaches of fiduciary duty. See, e.g., Lemire, 720\nF.2d at 1332-34 (employee took bribes); United States v. Siegel, 717\nF.2d 9, 14 (2d Cir. 1983) (corporate fund use for non-corporate\npurposes). However, the fraud in question need not deprive the\nemployer specifically of money, but may do so indirectly by showing\n\n                                 -34-\n\f          A jury could reasonably have found that Camp's disclosure of\n\nconfidential information was in knowing breach of her fiduciary duty to\n\nIDEXX.23 Moreover, the evidence supports a finding that Camp's failure\n\nto disclose her communication with Martin posed \"an independent\n\nbusiness risk\" to IDEXX and created \"reasonably foreseen economic harm\"\n\nto IDEXX. By July 1998, Camp knew that Martin intended his company to\n\ncompete with IDEXX - in fact, she was authoring proposals detailing how\n\nthat competition would be most successful.\n\n          Under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2, Martin is guilty of aiding and abetting\n\na crime if he \"willfully participated in it,\" that is, wished it to\n\noccur and affirmatively participated in its successful outcome. See\n\nUnited States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 385 (1st Cir. 1979). The\n\ngovernment has offered substantial evidence of Martin's willing\n\nparticipation in (in fact, sponsorship of) Camp's breach of fiduciary\n\nduty. A jury could have found that Martin's request for information\n\nabout IDEXX's competitive stance, his willing receipt of IDEXX\n\n\n\nactual harm to tangible interests. See United States v. Frost, 125\nF.3d at 367-68 (failure to disclose and reasonable contemplation of\nbusiness harm sufficient); United States v. Garfinkel, 29 F.3d 1253,\n1258 (8th Cir. 1994) (deprivation of benefits of pharmaceutical\nresearch).\n23 Camp had signed non-disclosure and non-compete agreements at the\nbeginning of her IDEXX tenure, and had been reminded of the\nconsequences of that agreement midway through her communication with\nMartin, see Joint Appendix 141 (Electronic mail message from Caryn Camp\nto Stephen Martin, forwarding internal IDEXX memorandum dated June 4,\n1998).\n\n                                 -35-\n\fmaterials and inventory, and his request that Camp gather as much\n\ninformation as possible prior to leaving the company both encouraged\n\nand aided Camp in breaching her fiduciary duty to IDEXX. Moreover, in\n\nMartin's use of \"spy\" terminology, in his specific requests for\n\ninformation, and in his apparent willingness to use the information to\n\ncompete directly with IDEXX, a reasonable jury could have found that\n\nhis participation in the scheme to defraud IDEXX of Camp's honest\n\nservices, i.e., to have Camp breach her fiduciary duties for personal\n\ngain and harm to IDEXX, was sufficient to maintain liability for aiding\n\nand abetting pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2.\n\n          C.   The Individual Counts of Wire and Mail Fraud\n\n          The individual counts of wire and mail fraud then only need\n\nbe communications designed to effect a scheme under either the property\n\ntheory or the honest services theory. Again, the communications need\n\nnot be fraudulent on their face. See United States v. Green, 786 F.2d\n\n247, 249 (7th Cir. 1986) (citing United States v. Sampson, 371 U.S. 75\n\n(1962)). We examine each count in turn to determine if a rational jury\n\nmight have plausibly concluded that they were used to effect one of the\n\ntwo possible schemes to defraud.\n\n          Martin claims that the e-mails on which counts 7 and 8 are\n\nbased (Camp's offer to send him x-Chek software and his affirmative\n\nresponse) cannot be communications designed to effect a scheme to\n\ndefraud because he had no knowledge that the software was not free. As\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fpreviously pointed out, the record belies this claim. In any event,\n\nCamp certainly knew that she was only supposed to send x-Chek to\n\ncustomers; Martin was clearly not a customer. Thus her x-Chek offer\n\ncould be construed as part of a scheme to defraud IDEXX of her honest\n\nservices. In other words, a reasonable jury could conclude that Camp's\n\noffer to send x-Chek to Martin breached her fiduciary duty to IDEXX and\n\ncaused IDEXX harm. As a reasonable jury could also find that Martin\n\naided and abetted this breach, see supra, the evidence is sufficient to\n\nconvict on counts 7 and 8. Furthermore, a jury could reasonably have\n\nfound that Martin knew that he was not entitled to a free copy of x-\n\nChek. If so, Martin would have obtained the software through false\n\npretenses, and thus satisfied the alternative prong of the wire fraud\n\ntest with his affirmative response.\n\n          Martin admits that his e-mail on which count 9 is based,\n\nasking Camp to \"absorb as much physically and intellectually as you\n\ncan,\" could be construed as \"requesting . . . non-confidential public\n\ninformation,\" Appellant Brief 38, but only if read in isolation.\n\nMartin argues that as a non-competitor, he had no use for confidential\n\ninformation, and that the words \"as you can\" incorporated previous\n\nguidelines of confidentiality. Id. at 39. However, it is not our task\n\nto determine if alternate interpretations of the evidence were\n\navailable to the jury, but rather if the evidence was sufficient for\n\nthe jury to reach a reasonable interpretation upon which it could\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fconvict. See, e.g., United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).    Certainly the request made by Martin in this\n\nparticular e-mail is highly suggestive of a request for information\n\nwhich he knew was confidential and would require Camp's \"spying\" to\n\nunearth. A reasonable jury could have interpreted his request in this\n\nmanner, and thus found that this communication was made in furtherance\n\nof the scheme to defraud.\n\n          Martin claims that because Camp's July 21 e-mail (on which\n\ncount 10 is based) denies any use of confidential information, that it\n\ncould not be part of the scheme to defraud.     However, this e-mail\n\nalerted Martin to the delivery of seven binders (which included\n\ninformation marked specifically as \"confidential\"), provided further\n\ninformation about IDEXX procedures and methods, and noted that Camp had\n\n\"found a jackpot.\" Despite Camp's denial, we have found above that\n\nsufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that a scheme to\n\ndefraud existed and that Martin received confidential information in\n\nconnection with this scheme. Given that evidence, this communication -\n\namong other things, notifying Martin that she had sent documents to him\n\n- clearly furthered the scheme.\n\n          With respect to the mail fraud counts (11 and 12), Martin\n\nclaims that, because Camp mailed items to Martin on her own initiative,\n\nMartin could not be guilty of aiding and abetting mail fraud on these\n\ncounts. Again, defense counsel confuses what Martin is guilty of\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\faiding and abetting - the scheme to defraud, not the individual\n\nmailing. Again, the jury had sufficient evidence to find Martin guilty\n\nof aiding and abetting the scheme to defraud, either through\n\ndeprivation of property under false pretenses or via honest services\n\nfraud. Camp's mailing of the packages to Martin was in furtherance of\n\nthe scheme: either because it finalized the property removal from\n\nIDEXX or provided the final pieces to Martin's future competition with\n\nIDEXX. Thus sufficient evidence existed to convict Martin on either\n\ncount. Moreover, ¬ß 1341 itself criminalizes the act of \"causing\"\n\nanother to deposit items in the mails that further a scheme to defraud.\n\nEspecially with respect to the second mail fraud count, based on the\n\npackage that included the IDEXX software, a reasonable jury could have\n\nfound that Martin's request caused Camp to send him those materials,\n\nand found him guilty of violating ¬ß 1341 without relying on aiding and\n\nabetting liability.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          A careful reading of the seven-month e-mail communication\n\nbetween Dr. Stephen Martin and Caryn Camp could lead to the conclusion\n\nMartin and his counsel urge - that this is simply a pen-pal\n\nrelationship between a lonely Maine lab technician and a reclusive\n\nCalifornia scientist. However, the evidence could also lead a reader\n\nto the conclusion that something far more sinister was afoot: that an\n\noriginally harmless communication mushroomed into a conspiracy to steal\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\ftrade secrets and transport stolen property interstate, and that the\n\nelectronic mail and U.S. mails were used to further a scheme to defraud\n\nIDEXX. Because we find there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable\n\njury to conclude the latter beyond any reasonable doubt, we AFFIRM the\n\ndefendant's conviction on all counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\f",

Events Prior to May 1, 1998</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Camp's Employment at IDEXX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp first began work at IDEXX, Inc. (\"IDEXX\"), a manufacturer of veterinary products headquartered in Portland, Maine, in May of 1995.  Camp's responsibilities as an IDEXX chemist included mixing chemicals for diagnostic test kits for both pets and livestock.  At the time of her employment, she signed non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, promising in part not to \"disclose to others, or use for [her] own benefit or the benefit of others, any of the Developments or any confidential, proprietary or secret information owned, possessed or used by [IDEXX] or its customers or contractors.\"  The proprietary information included, but was not limited to, \"trade secrets, processes, data, know-how, marketing plans, forecasts, unpublished financial statements, budgets, licenses, prices, costs, and employee, customer and supplier lists.\"  Camp also signed the IDEXX policy on ethics and business conduct, which prohibited employees from revealing \"proprietary knowledge or data\" without prior authorization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Martin's Communication with IDEXX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1997, Martin, as CEO of Wyoming DNA Vaccine (\"WDV\"), contacted IDEXX with a proposal involving research into human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).  Although IDEXX ultimately rejected Martin's proposal, he signed a confidentiality agreement during his conversations with IDEXX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Camp's Initial Contact with Martin</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By early 1998, Camp was dissatisfied and bored with her job.  In January 1998, she began researching other potential job opportunities.  She found the Internet web site for WDV and sent an electronic mail message with an attached resume.  Martin responded immediately via electronic mail, praising Camp's credentials and touting the beauty of Cody, Wyoming (the future site of WDV). Martin also noted the existence of the WDV-IDEXX confidentiality agreement and the fact that WDV had chosen to \"develop [its] own program . . . with respect to veterinary diagnostics.\"  After receiving Martin's response, Camp sent Martin a letter providing more detail about her qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between January and March of 1998, Martin and Camp continued their correspondence.  Based partly on Martin's encouragement and partly on her own interests, Camp contacted the Director of Regulatory Affairs at IDEXX and obtained permission to \"volunteer [her] free time\" to learn that end of the business. Martin indicated that despite Camp's preference for laboratory work, she would be more useful to WDV for her regulatory experience and knowledge.  Martin briefed Camp on his own work at WDV, while Camp continued to update Martin on her professional success, in particular her promotion to a technical position in IDEXX's Livestock/Poultry unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp and Martin's early correspondence established several themes that would permeate their e-mails:  contained within the small talk was on-going discussion of Camp's future employment with Martin's company, as well as a willingness by Camp to relay IDEXX information and gossip to Martin.  Camp described her promotion as preparation \"for making a strong contribution to the success of WDV\" within four to six months.  Her February 27 letter contained information regarding a manual that \"Idexx . . . [is] not exactly supposed to have.\"  And throughout this period, Camp's correspondence included light-hearted remarks about the weather, life in Maine, and a potential future in Wyoming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.  \"Pen-Pals\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp and Martin's correspondence became more and more frequent during March and April of 1998.  Camp continued to apprise Martin of her problems with IDEXX management, the changes associated with her new position in technical support, and her interest in new employment, both at WDV and elsewhere.  At times she included information about IDEXX's internal strategic weaknesses and customer complaints.  Camp noted in an April 12 e-mail that the information she had transmitted was to some extent confidential.  Martin reciprocated the information exchange: he told Camp about conflicts within WDV that ultimately resulted in his formation of a separate company called \"Maverck\"; he also relayed \"confidential\" WDV information.  Martin continued to discuss Camp's future, noting that she could \"have a job with either [WDV or Maverck],\" that he thought she \"belong[ed] in Tahoe/Reno,\" and that she might \"become CEO [her]self one day.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the two corresponded more frequently, their communications became more personal.  Camp began to refer to Martin as \"Steve.\"  They discussed their families and social lives, and even shared the messages with family members.  As their relationship grew more personal, both Camp and Martin, but particularly Martin, spoke jokingly of the \"spy\" aspect of the correspondence.  For example, Martin referred to Camp's gossip as \"IDEXX Files\" and described the events at WDV as a \"palace coup.\" Martin also continued to praise Camp's \"aggressiveness\" and exhorted her to work only in her own interest and to continue to accumulate relevant knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, Martin indicated that he \"had much to tell\"Camp, but that he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement first.  Camp considered signing the agreement immediately, but ultimately postponed signing because of potential ethical concerns, including potential competition between WDV and IDEXX.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, Camp sent Martin an e-mail discussing the poultry and livestock industries, noting problems IDEXX customers had been having with particular diagnostic kits, and mentioning that customers \"loved\" the IDEXX free software program \"x-Chek.\" Camp continued to discuss IDEXX's poor customer service approach in her May 1 \"travelogue,\" written during a business trip to the Midwest.  Throughout her \"travelogue,\" Camp repeatedly expressed her happiness in being away from IDEXX and her willingness to move on to new employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II.

One count of mail fraud, on which Martin was convicted, also stems from this period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Martin's Initial Requests</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, in response to Camp's lengthy e-mail detailing her trip, Martin made his first explicit request for information, asking for \"any info. . . . on the HOT topics in veterinary diagnostics.\"  Martin renewed his request in a May 3 e-mail in which he asked a number of questions about IDEXX prices, test composition, and test use.  In a subsequent message, Martin outlined his ability to avoid patent infringement with IDEXX and noted that \"IDEXX is going to be in trouble very soon.\"  On May 3, Camp responded with answers to most of Martin's questions. Attached was a letter detailing problems with a particular IDEXX product.  In reference to a previous discussion about flying planes, Martin began to refer to Camp as \"Ace,\" a moniker which would become \"Agent Ace\" as their \"spy\" business heated up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Camp's Responses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, Camp wrote concerning IDEXX's legal problems. She also included \"lots &amp; lots of goodies for your next rainy day,\" including internal memoranda.  Camp noted that the internal memoranda may have been confidential.  \"I feel like a spy,\" she commented.  In a letter the next day, Camp regretted her actions, promising to \"be good . . . and send no more dirty secrets from Idexx. . . .\"  Martin responded, claiming that he did \"not want to know anything confidential about IDEXX,\" and asking only for \"public information.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Camp's repentance and Martin's denial of any desire for confidential or proprietary information, Camp continued to assemble and pass on information, an activity which she apparently viewed as ethically suspect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Camp also relayed information on IDEXX's strategic plans, including a potential partnership with a company whose name, at least, was confidential. By late June, Camp appeared set on leaving IDEXX, as she commented that \"I need to unload all of my stock options.\"  Furthermore, Camp had received (and ignored) reminders of her non-compete and non-disclosure agreements; she forwarded these reminders to Martin, noting that \"as a spy myself, I get a particular chuckle out of [them],\" and that \"my loyalty has ended.\"  Camp and Martin began to formalize their plans for meeting at Lake Tahoe in early August, as well as for Camp's eventual move to Nevada.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  More Questions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Camp prepared to leave IDEXX, she continued to send Martin information, at times upon his requests and at times on her own initiative.  In a July 4 e-mail, Martin inquired about IDEXX's methodology for flourescent-based tests.  Camp responded that she was not familiar with the technology, but that she would \"try to have some answers by the end of the week.\" By July 7, she did.  In a postscript to a July 10 message, Martin renewed his request regarding particular tests, their procedures, and IDEXX sales practices.  Camp responded to the extent she was able.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.  Potential Competition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin also disclosed his \"game-plan\" to compete with IDEXX.  Martin noted that Camp should \"think tests for heartworm, FIV, FeLV, etc.,\" all tests IDEXX currently sold.  Camp responded with instructions on how \"[t]o beat the competition (for cat &amp; dog diagnostics) . . . [in which] Idexx is definitely the world-wide leader.\"  Martin egged her on:  \"I always meant to tell you that we could always start our own veterinary lab service company - just like all the fine folks that IDEXX is trying to buy out.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.  The First Package</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, Camp sent Martin a large package of information via Priority Mail, including various devices, product inserts, USDA course materials, information on her own projects, miscellaneous IDEXX product information, and \"Examples of My Work,\" labeled \"Confidential.\"  Camp also promised to send an actual test kit, if Martin wished.  The mailing and receipt of this package formed the basis of a mail fraud charge, of which Martin was ultimately convicted.  After receiving the package, Martin once more praised Camp's aggressiveness, encouraged her to \"keep on charging,\" to \"keep on thinking about the competition, and how we can beat them,\" and promised that \"lips are sealed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III.

More Questions and Answers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In several e-mails between July 19 and July 21, Camp outlined a proposal for customer-friendly additions and modifications to current IDEXX technology.  Martin explained how such a test might be constructed, telling Camp that if it could be marketed successfully, she would receive \"enough bonus money to buy [a] house for cash.\"  Camp clearly understood that the proposal was for technology competitive with that of IDEXX, as she suggested the possibility that \"[she and Martin would] own the whole market.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp's proposal also prompted Martin to ask about the relevance and applicability of x-Chek or similar software.  Camp offered to send Martin a copy of the software IDEXX had developed for poultry and livestock testing.  Martin responded the same day, writing that \"he would like to play with the software you mentioned.\"  Camp immediately replied, promising \"lots of cool goodies,\" including the x-Chek disks.  Camp also indicated that she was on the verge of \"cleaning out her office\" and leaving IDEXX; however, she noted that she was speaking to headhunters in addition to Martin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin's response to this last message re-affirmed his intention to compete with IDEXX.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, Martin acknowledged Camp's potentially illicit activity, and exhorted her to continue in her final few days at work.  \"Before you bag IDEXX (I am embarrassed to ask this), absorb as much information, physically and intellectually, as you can.  I never had a spy before.\"  Camp's answer bemoaned the constraints on her information gathering (because co-workers knew she was preparing to leave), detailed her continued efforts to take home both information and property, and admitted the illegality (or at least inappropriateness) of her actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  However, Camp noted that she had as of yet been unwilling to copy \"confidential\" documents, although she admitted that she had copied \"semi-confidential\" internal e-mail.  The next day, Camp promised to send Martin additional kits as her last \"secret agent\" act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  The Second Package</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Camp's last several days at IDEXX, she continued to collect products and information, which she forwarded to Martin on July 24.  The package included operating manuals, IDEXX marketing materials, research and development data, a sales binder prepared by an independent contractor, as well as a binder labeled \"Competition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Found Out</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Camp and Martin, Camp inadvertently sent her July 25 e-mail (acknowledging that July 24 was her last day and detailing the contents of her second package) to John Lawrence, the global marketing manager for Poultry/Livestock at IDEXX.  Camp informed Martin of what she had done, and continued on her vacation.  According to Camp, Martin later recommended that she lie to IDEXX, i.e., that she tell them that he was interested only in limited information unrelated to IDEXX core businesses.  Upon her return to Maine, Camp was intercepted and interviewed by an FBI agent at the Portland airport.  An August 9, 1998 search of Martin's home found the contents of Camp's second package, including the x-Chek software.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence presented to a jury faces a difficult task.  An appellate court must \"examine the evidence in the light most flattering to the prosecution,\" indulge \"all reasonable inferences in favor\" of the prosecution, and then determine \"whether a reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).  The court must credit both direct and circumstantial evidence, without evaluating or speculating on the weight the jury has given different pieces of evidence, and without making its own judgments as to credibility. See id.  Furthermore, juries need not evaluate pieces of evidence in isolation, but may draw conclusions from the sum of an evidentiary presentation.  See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).  Even if the appellate court feels that a jury could have reached a different verdict, the court need only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in \"a plausible rendition of the record.\"  Id.  Note, however, that the jury verdict is not given a \"free pass\"; if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, \"gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support\" to theories of guilt and innocence, the convictions must be reversed.  United States v.Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  Conspiracy to Steal Trade Secrets</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Martin guilty of count 13, which charged him with conspiracy to steal trade secrets in violation of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, specifically 18 U.S.C. &#167;a1832(a)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In order to find a defendant guilty of conspiracy, the prosecution must prove (1) that an agreement existed, (2) that it had an unlawful purpose, and (3) that the defendant was a voluntary participant.  See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 677, 679 (1st Cir. 1993).  The government must prove that the defendant possessed both the \"intent to agree and [the] intent to commit the substantive offense.\"  United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Garca, 983 F.2d 1160, 1165 (1st Cir. 1993)).  In addition, the government must prove that at least one conspirator committed an \"overt act,\" that is, took an affirmative step toward achieving the conspiracy's purpose.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1832(a)(5); United States v. Cassiere, 4aF.3d 1006, 1014 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement need not be express, however, as long as its existence may be inferred from the \"defendants' words and actions and the interdependence of activities and persons involved.\"  Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1015 (quoting United States v.Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1990)).  A so-called \"tacit\" agreement will suffice.  See United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 67 (1st Cir. 1998).  Moreover, the conspirators need not succeed in completing the underlying act, see United States v.Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 1987), nor need that underlying act even be factually possible.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of yet, only the Third Circuit has had the opportunity to address &#167; 1832(a), which specifically covers private corporate espionage.  See United States v. Hsu, 155 F.3d 189 (3d Cir. 1998). The statute criminalizes the knowing theft of trade secrets, as well as attempts or conspiracies to steal trade secrets.  The Act defines a \"trade secret\" broadly, to include both tangible property and intangible information, as long as the owner \"has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret\" and the information \"derives independent economic value . . . from not being generally known to . . . the public.\"  Id.  at 196; 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1839(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  This definition of trade secret \"protects a wider variety\" of information than most civil laws; however, \"it is clear that Congress did not intend . . . to prohibit lawful competition such as the use of general skills or parallel development of a similar product,\"  Hsu, 155 F.3d at 196-97, although it did mean to punish \"the disgruntled former employee who walks out of his former company with a computer diskette full of engineering schematics,\"id. at 201 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 104-788, at 7).  In other words, &#167; 1832(a) was not designed to punish competition, even when such competition relies on the know-how of former employees of a direct competitor.  It was, however, designed to prevent those employees (and their future employers) from taking advantage of confidential information gained, discovered, copied, or taken while employed elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin contends that the evidence is factually insufficient to establish a \"meeting of the minds\" or agreement to violate &#167; 1832(a), because (1) insufficient evidence exists to establish an agreement between Martin and Camp; (2) insufficient evidence exists to prove that Martin had the necessary intent to commit an act prohibited by &#167; 1832(a), i.e., injure the owner of the trade secret (IDEXX); and (3) the information provided by Camp to Martin did not meet the statutory definition of a trade secret under &#167; 1839(3).  As we explain below, none of these arguments are persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Martin and Camp formed an agreement regarding the theft of trade secrets.  Martin's argument against the existence of an agreement relies on the facts that (a) his early e-mails specifically requested that Camp not send him confidential information, and (b) Camp did not seem to know the distinction between confidential information, proprietary information, and office gossip.  However, while Martin's disclaimer and Camp's confusion indicate the lack of an explicit agreement at that time, they do not necessarily negate the existence of an agreement. See Woodward, 149 F.3d at 67 (including tacit agreements within conspiracy requirements).  A rational jury could have plausibly concluded on the basis of the evidence presented at trial that an agreement existed.  By July 21, Martin had received extensive correspondence from Camp that she had either marked \"confidential\" or \"proprietary,\" or had expressed some hesitation in forwarding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Despite his previous protestations that he wanted nothing to do with IDEXX or its confidential information, Martin asked Camp on July 21 to \"absorb as much information, physically and intellectually, as you can,\" and included a set of questions to direct Camp's research.  Throughout June and July, Martin referred to Camp as \"Agent Ace,\" or as his \"spy.\"  Given the type of information that Martin had already received, a reasonable jury could have concluded that, whatever Martin's original intentions, as of July 21, Camp and Martin had reached a tacit agreement by which she would send him items and information that potentially fell under the trade secret definition of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1839(3).  In other words, sufficient evidence exists to show an agreement between Camp and Martin to violate &#167; 1832(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the evidence is sufficient to show that Martin intended to injure IDEXX by obtaining IDEXX trade secrets and competing against IDEXX.  Although Martin consistently claimed that he had no interest in developing products that competed with IDEXX, and hence had no intention of injuring IDEXX economically, his correspondence with Camp detailed a plan of competition.  Martin had, among other things, considered the possibility of starting a competing veterinary lab,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and had asked Camp to think, in particular, about ways to compete with tests that IDEXX manufactured.  A reasonable jury could have found that Martin intended to use the information gained from Camp, particularly information on IDEXX's costs and customer dissatisfaction with IDEXX, to create a more successful competitor with greater capability to injure IDEXX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Martin's final argument - that he actually received no trade secrets - even if true, is irrelevant.  Martin has only been found guilty of a conspiracy to steal trade secrets, rather than the underlying offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Giry, 818 F.2d at 126. The relevant question to determine whether a conspiracy existed was whether Martin intended to violate the statute.  See id; see alsoHsu, 155 F.3d at 198 (\"[T]he crimes charged - attempt and conspiracy - do not require proof of the existence of an actual trade secret, but, rather, proof only of one's attempt or conspiracy with intent to steal a trade secret.\").  The key question is whether Martin intended to steal trade secrets.  A rational jury, considering the information Camp had already sent Martin, could have concluded that his further queries indicated such an intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could therefore have concluded that Martin and Camp formed an agreement by which Camp conveyed information and property to Martin that potentially fell under the definition of a trade secret in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1839.  As a result, sufficient evidence existed to convict Martin of conspiracy to steal trade secrets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Conspiracy to Transport Stolen Property in Interstate Commerce</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also found Martin guilty of conspiracy to transport stolen goods interstate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;a2314<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> as charged in count 14.  Again, a conviction for conspiracy does not require that the defendant was successful in the underlying offense, see Giry, 818 F.2d at 126, but only that an agreement to commit the underlying offense existed, see Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679, and that at least one co-conspirator committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, see United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1014 (1st Cir. 1993).  To be found guilty of a conspiracy to transport stolen goods interstate, Martin must have agreed to transport \"goods, wares, [or] merchandise,\" with a \"value of $5,000 or more,\" in interstate or foreign commerce, and \"known the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 214 (1985) (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314).  Although intangible, \"purely intellectual\" property does not fall within the auspices of &#167; 2314, intangible components of tangible items may contribute to the $5,000 value requirement.  See United States v.Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1307-08 &amp; n.14 (10th Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment for conspiracy to transport stolen goods was based in part on Martin's July 21 request for a copy of x-Chek software and his July 22 acknowledgment that Camp would be sending him additional test kits.  See Brief for Appellant 31 (admitting that the \"evidence at trial established . . . two instances on which Dr. Martin requested 'property,' as opposed to 'information.'\").  Martin received a large package from Camp in the mail after sending these two e-mails.  However, Martin claims that (1) this evidence is insufficient to establish the existence of anagreement with Camp to transport stolen property; and (2) that the property in question did not meet the $5,000 value requirement of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the existence of an agreement between Camp and himself with respect to stolen property.  For the same reasons that a rational jury could plausibly have found an agreement to steal trade secrets, we conclude that the same rational jury could have found an agreement between Camp and Martin by which she would send him property from IDEXX.  However, the question remains whether that agreement (1) covered \"stolen\" property in violation of &#167;a2314, and (2) covered property with a value of more than $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For property to be \"stolen\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314, the defendant must have \"known\" it to be \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  Although the prosecution introduced testimony that IDEXX only provided x-Chek for \"free\" under a license agreement with its customers, Martin claimed that, based on Camp's previous e-mail communication, he believed the software was free.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  However, in a conviction challenged for sufficiency of the evidence, we must give the jury's finding great weight, asking only whether a \"reasonable\" or \"rational\" jury could have \"plausibly\" found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677; United States v.Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).  In this case, given that three months had passed since Camp had described x-Chek as \"free,\" that she had originally discussed it in connection with customersatisfaction, that the \"free\" label occurred at the end of a lengthy e-mail, and that Martin was a scientist who had surely dealt with companies such as IDEXX before, a jury could certainly have concluded that he knew that such companies did not provide major software packages for free to those who were neither customers nor potential customers, and that Martin knew the software had been stolen or converted from IDEXX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, with respect to the \"free\" test kits, the evidence is much stronger that Martin knew that they had been \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  First, when Camp sent Martin the original set of kits, she told him not to \"say where [he] got them,\" and not to mention them to her relatives, because \"all rules are null-and-void now that Idexx has been acquiring kits from its competitors by sneaky means.\"  Even though Camp noted that it was part of her job to send free kits to potential customers, Martin was clearly not a potential customer, and could not plausibly have believed that this mandate applied to his \"spy\" sending free kits to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Furthermore, Martin admitted that, in the future, he would have to buy the kits, suggesting that he did not really believe he was entitled to obtain them for free.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the jury could have plausibly concluded that Martin's July 21 request to Camp to \"absorb as much information, physically and intellectually, as you can,\" included a request to send him physical goods such as test kits and software.  Martin had already received items from Camp, and was at the time expecting further items, such as the x-Chek software.  Although Martin is correct that &#167; 2314 does not apply to purely \"intangible information,\" the theft of which is punishable under copyright law and other intellectual property statutes, see United States v.Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1307 (10th Cir. 1991), &#167; 2314 does apply when there has been \"some tangible item taken, however insignificant or valueless it may be, absent the intangible component,\" id. at 1308 n.14.  Given that at this time Camp had already sent Martin numerous tangible items, he would have been on notice that any request to \"absorb information\" might (and likely would) produce tangible material that he would receive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Martin's claim that the value of his requests did not meet the $5,000 floor, there is evidence that the value of the x-Chek software approached $2,500, and that individual diagnostic kits ranged from $1,500 to $2,200.  Furthermore, there is evidence that Martin was aware of the potential cost of test kits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Whether the actual items received exceeded the statutory value or not (and there is strong evidence that they in fact did), a jury could plausibly have concluded that Martin, with sufficient knowledge of the kit price, had requested items that would likely have exceeded $5,000 and thus satisfied the value prong of the conspiracy charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.  Wire Fraud and Mail Fraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remainder of defendant's convictions are based on four counts of wire fraud and two counts of mail fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 (aiding and abetting), 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), and 1346 (honest services fraud).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Because of the similarity of the operative language of the wire fraud and mail fraud statutes, we analyze the offenses together.  See Carpenter v.United States, 484 U.S. 19, 25 n.6 (1987); United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 586 n.11 (1st Cir. 1996).  To prove wire or mail fraud, the government must show: (1) a scheme to defraud by means of false pretenses; (2) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud; and (3) the use of interstate wire or mail communications in furtherance of the scheme.  See Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1011 (citing United States v.Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1989)) (elements of wire fraud);United States v. Montminy, 936 F.2d 626, 627 (1st Cir. 1991) (elements of mail fraud).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the mail and wire fraud statutes originally required that the scheme to defraud aim to deprive the victim of property or some other item of economic value, see United States v.Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir. 1996), congressional legislation aimed at overruling McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), expanded the definition to include \"schemes intended to deprive another of the intangible right to honest services.\"  Id.  Despite concerns about the overreaching of the wire and mail fraud statutes into the employer-employee relationship, see, e.g., United Statesv. Lemire, 720 F.2d 1327, 1336 (D.C. Cir. 1983), courts have upheld convictions based on employee misconduct, see, e.g., United Statesv. Frost, 125 F.3d 346 (6th Cir. 1997).  As a result of this expanded definition, in order to uphold Martin's conviction, sufficient evidence must exist to show his participation in either(1) a scheme to defraud IDEXX of property or other items of economic value by false pretenses, or (2) a scheme to defraud IDEXX of Camp's honest services by false pretenses.  Note that Martin's success in the scheme is not relevant.  See, e.g., Serrano, 870 F.2d at 6.  We conclude that a rational jury could have found that such evidence had been proven under either theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Property Theory</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confidential information may be considered property for the purposes of &#167;&#167; 1341 and 1343.  See United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir. 1997).  Where such information is obtained - thus depriving the rightful owner of its property rights - through dishonest or deceitful means, the wire and mail fraud statutes may be violated.  See id.  However, mere access to the confidential information is insufficient; rather, \"either some articulable harm must befall the holder of the information as a result of the defendant's activities, or some gainful use must be intended by the person accessing the information, whether or not this use is profitable in the economic sense.\"  Id.  In other words, for Martin's convictions to stand under this prong of the wire and mail fraud statutes, sufficient evidence must exist for a reasonable jury to find that Martin knowingly and willingly participated in a scheme to defraud IDEXX of confidential information or other property via false pretenses, and in so doing either harmed IDEXX or intended to use the information for his own gain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin claims that because, on their face, the e-mails on which counts 7-10 are based contained no misrepresentations, they cannot provide the basis for a scheme to defraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  However, the e-mails themselves need not be fraudulent; rather, it is the schemeitself that must rely on false pretenses.  See United States v.Green, 786 F.2d 247, 249 (7th Cir. 1986) (\"The causal connection between the mailing and the success of the scheme, not the knavery in the mailings, is what matters.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could first have found that, as of Julya12 (the date after which the four wire fraud and two mail fraud convictions stem), Camp had agreed with Martin to send him confidential information and tangible property.  Camp had previously noted that her e-mails contained information that she should not have spread; Martin's repeated questions designed to elicit further information, including his acceptance of Camp as his \"spy,\" provide further evidence of the scheme.  A reasonable jury could have found that Martin intended to use such confidential information either to compete with IDEXX, thus harming IDEXX, or at the very least for his own pecuniary gain.  For example, Martin and Camp engaged in a lengthy discussion of the best manner in which to design a test kit that would surpass IDEXX's in serving demanding customers in the veterinary profession.  A reasonable jury could have found that Martin's requests, including to \"absorb as much information, physically and intellectually as possible,\" indicate that his participation in the scheme was both willing and knowing. Finally, a reasonable jury could have found that Camp's actions - including requesting information beyond her job description without informing IDEXX of her conflicted interests, sending Martin information and property under the pretense that he was a customer who had a right to receive information and property free, and relaying confidential information in violation of both her fiduciary duty to IDEXX and her signed non-disclosure and non-compete agreements - constituted false pretenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Honest Services Theory</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the jury could have found that Martin and Camp's e-mail communications and mail deposits constituted a scheme to deprive IDEXX of Camp's honest services.  Although the honest services doctrine has mainly been used to punish fraud against the citizenry perpetrated by government officials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> see, e.g.,Czubinski at 1076-77, courts both before McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), and after the passage of &#167; 1346 have been willing to expand the doctrine to the employer-employee relationship, see id. at 1077; United States v. Sun Diamond Growers of California, 138 F.3d 961, 973 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (&#167; 1346 \"has also been used, as here, to prosecute private citizens who defraud private entities\").  However, courts have been hesitant to impose federal mail and wire fraud liability upon every employee transgression, and have required \"a failure to disclose something which in the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent business risk to the employer,\" or creates \"reasonably foreseeable economic harm\" to the employer.  Sun Diamond, 138 F.3d at 973  (quoting United States v. Lemire, 720 F.2d 1327, 1337 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  While this Court has held that merely examining confidential information for one's own purposes does not rise to this level, see Czubinski at 1077, use of confidential information for \"private purposes\" may rise to the necessary level of self-dealing.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could reasonably have found that Camp's disclosure of confidential information was in knowing breach of her fiduciary duty to IDEXX.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Moreover, the evidence supports a finding that Camp's failure to disclose her communication with Martin posed \"an independent business risk\" to IDEXX and created \"reasonably foreseen economic harm\" to IDEXX.  By July 1998, Camp knew that Martin intended his company to compete with IDEXX - in fact, she was authoring proposals detailing how that competition would be most successful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, Martin is guilty of aiding and abetting a crime if he \"willfully participated in it,\" that is, wished it to occur and affirmatively participated in its successful outcome.  See United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 385 (1st Cir. 1979).  The government has offered substantial evidence of Martin's willing participation in (in fact, sponsorship of) Camp's breach of fiduciary duty.  A jury could have found that Martin's request for information about IDEXX's competitive stance, his willing receipt of IDEXX materials and inventory, and his request that Camp gather as much information as possible prior to leaving the company both encouraged and aided Camp in breaching her fiduciary duty to IDEXX.  Moreover, in Martin's use of \"spy\" terminology, in his specific requests for information, and in his apparent willingness to use the information to compete directly with IDEXX, a reasonable jury could have found that his participation in the scheme to defraud IDEXX of Camp's honest services, i.e., to have Camp breach her fiduciary duties for personal gain and harm to IDEXX, was sufficient to maintain liability for aiding and abetting pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.  The Individual Counts of Wire and Mail Fraud</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual counts of wire and mail fraud then only need be communications designed to effect a scheme under either the property theory or the honest services theory.  Again, the communications need not be fraudulent on their face.  See United States v. Green, 786 F.2d 247, 249 (7th Cir. 1986) (citing United States v. Sampson, 371 U.S. 75 (1962)).  We examine each count in turn to determine if a rational jury might have plausibly concluded that they were used to effect one of the two possible schemes to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin claims that the e-mails on which counts 7 and 8 are based (Camp's offer to send him x-Chek software and his affirmative response) cannot be communications designed to effect a scheme to defraud because he had no knowledge that the software was not free.  As previously pointed out, the record belies this claim.  In any event, Camp certainly knew that she was only supposed to send x-Chek to customers; Martin was clearly not a customer.  Thus her x-Chek offer could be construed as part of a scheme to defraud IDEXX of her honest services.  In other words, a reasonable jury could conclude that Camp's offer to send x-Chek to Martin breached her fiduciary duty to IDEXX and caused IDEXX harm. As a reasonable jury could also find that Martin aided and abetted this breach, see supra, the evidence is sufficient to convict on counts 7 and 8.  Furthermore, a jury could reasonably have found that Martin knew that he was not entitled to a free copy of x-Chek. If so, Martin would have obtained the software through false pretenses, and thus satisfied the alternative prong of the wire fraud test with his affirmative response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin admits that his e-mail on which count 9 is based, asking Camp to \"absorb as much physically and intellectually as you can,\" could be construed as \"requesting . . . non-confidential public information,\" Appellant Brief 38, but only if read in isolation.  Martin argues that as a non-competitor, he had no use for confidential information, and that the words \"as you can\" incorporated previous guidelines of confidentiality.  Id. at 39. However, it is not our task to determine if alternate interpretations of the evidence were available to the jury, but rather if the evidence was sufficient for the jury to reach a reasonable interpretation upon which it could convict.  See, e.g.,United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1991). Certainly the request made by Martin in this particular e-mail is highly suggestive of a request for information which he knew was confidential and would require Camp's \"spying\" to unearth.  A reasonable jury could have interpreted his request in this manner, and thus found that this communication was made in furtherance of the scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin claims that because Camp's July 21 e-mail (on which count 10 is based) denies any use of confidential information, that it could not be part of the scheme to defraud. However, this e-mail alerted Martin to the delivery of seven binders (which included information marked specifically as \"confidential\"), provided further information about IDEXX procedures and methods, and noted that Camp had \"found a jackpot.\" Despite Camp's denial, we have found above that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that a scheme to defraud existed and that Martin received confidential information in connection with this scheme.  Given that evidence, this communication - among other things, notifying Martin that she had sent documents to him - clearly furthered the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the mail fraud counts (11 and 12), Martin claims that, because Camp mailed items to Martin on her own initiative, Martin could not be guilty of aiding and abetting mail fraud on these counts.  Again, defense counsel confuses what Martin is guilty of aiding and abetting - the scheme to defraud, not the individual mailing.  Again, the jury had sufficient evidence to find Martin guilty of aiding and abetting the scheme to defraud, either through deprivation of property under false pretenses or via honest services fraud.  Camp's mailing of the packages to Martin was in furtherance of the scheme:  either because it finalized the property removal from IDEXX or provided the final pieces to Martin's future competition with IDEXX.  Thus sufficient evidence existed to convict Martin on either count.  Moreover, &#167; 1341 itself criminalizes the act of \"causing\" another to deposit items in the mails that further a scheme to defraud.  Especially with respect to the second mail fraud count, based on the package that included the IDEXX software, a reasonable jury could have found that Martin's request caused Camp to send him those materials, and found him guilty of violating &#167; 1341 without relying on aiding and abetting liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A careful reading of the seven-month e-mail communication between Dr. Stephen Martin and Caryn Camp could lead to the conclusion Martin and his counsel urge - that this is simply a pen-pal relationship between a lonely Maine lab technician and a reclusive California scientist.  However, the evidence could also lead a reader to the conclusion that something far more sinister was afoot:  that an originally harmless communication mushroomed into a conspiracy to steal trade secrets and transport stolen property interstate, and that the electronic mail and U.S. mails were used to further a scheme to defraud IDEXX.  Because we find there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude the latter beyond any reasonable doubt, we AFFIRM the defendant's conviction on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>    Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>    In an April 19 e-mail message, Camp wrote:  \"I'm not certain of how comfortable I am with signing the agreement as long as I am working for another company - particularly a company which is or could be a potential competitor, nor I am I [sic] comfortable with you sharing with me anything which you feel needs to be covered by this agreement.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>    Camp's May 7 e-mail noted that \"the fun part of my week has been putting together packages of information for you . . .\" and celebrated \"the intrigue of being Agent Ace.\"  On June 22, she \"couldn't resist playing Ace-the-Spy today . . . and so I am dropping a few more things in the mail.\"  But her fun did not come without guilt: \"I know I should be shot.

Martin and CarynaL. Camp with ten counts of wire fraud, two counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, one count of conspiracy to transport stolen goods, and one count of interstate transportation of stolen goods.  Camp agreed to testify against Martin as part of a plea agreement.  Martin proceeded to trial, where a jury found him not guilty on six counts of wire fraud (counts 1-6) and of interstate transportation of stolen goods (count 15).  The jury found Martin guilty on the remaining counts of wire fraud (counts 7-10), mail fraud (counts 11-12), conspiracy to steal trade secrets (count 13), and conspiracy to transport stolen property in interstate commerce (count 14).

Events Prior to May 1, 1998</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Camp's Employment at IDEXX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp first began work at IDEXX, Inc. (\"IDEXX\"), a manufacturer of veterinary products headquartered in Portland, Maine, in May of 1995.  Camp's responsibilities as an IDEXX chemist included mixing chemicals for diagnostic test kits for both pets and livestock.  At the time of her employment, she signed non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, promising in part not to \"disclose to others, or use for [her] own benefit or the benefit of others, any of the Developments or any confidential, proprietary or secret information owned, possessed or used by [IDEXX] or its customers or contractors.\"  The proprietary information included, but was not limited to, \"trade secrets, processes, data, know-how, marketing plans, forecasts, unpublished financial statements, budgets, licenses, prices, costs, and employee, customer and supplier lists.\"  Camp also signed the IDEXX policy on ethics and business conduct, which prohibited employees from revealing \"proprietary knowledge or data\" without prior authorization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Martin's Communication with IDEXX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1997, Martin, as CEO of Wyoming DNA Vaccine (\"WDV\"), contacted IDEXX with a proposal involving research into human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).  Although IDEXX ultimately rejected Martin's proposal, he signed a confidentiality agreement during his conversations with IDEXX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Camp's Initial Contact with Martin</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By early 1998, Camp was dissatisfied and bored with her job.  In January 1998, she began researching other potential job opportunities.  She found the Internet web site for WDV and sent an electronic mail message with an attached resume.  Martin responded immediately via electronic mail, praising Camp's credentials and touting the beauty of Cody, Wyoming (the future site of WDV). Martin also noted the existence of the WDV-IDEXX confidentiality agreement and the fact that WDV had chosen to \"develop [its] own program . . . with respect to veterinary diagnostics.\"  After receiving Martin's response, Camp sent Martin a letter providing more detail about her qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between January and March of 1998, Martin and Camp continued their correspondence.  Based partly on Martin's encouragement and partly on her own interests, Camp contacted the Director of Regulatory Affairs at IDEXX and obtained permission to \"volunteer [her] free time\" to learn that end of the business. Martin indicated that despite Camp's preference for laboratory work, she would be more useful to WDV for her regulatory experience and knowledge.  Martin briefed Camp on his own work at WDV, while Camp continued to update Martin on her professional success, in particular her promotion to a technical position in IDEXX's Livestock/Poultry unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp and Martin's early correspondence established several themes that would permeate their e-mails:  contained within the small talk was on-going discussion of Camp's future employment with Martin's company, as well as a willingness by Camp to relay IDEXX information and gossip to Martin.  Camp described her promotion as preparation \"for making a strong contribution to the success of WDV\" within four to six months.  Her February 27 letter contained information regarding a manual that \"Idexx . . . [is] not exactly supposed to have.\"  And throughout this period, Camp's correspondence included light-hearted remarks about the weather, life in Maine, and a potential future in Wyoming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.  \"Pen-Pals\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp and Martin's correspondence became more and more frequent during March and April of 1998.  Camp continued to apprise Martin of her problems with IDEXX management, the changes associated with her new position in technical support, and her interest in new employment, both at WDV and elsewhere.  At times she included information about IDEXX's internal strategic weaknesses and customer complaints.  Camp noted in an April 12 e-mail that the information she had transmitted was to some extent confidential.  Martin reciprocated the information exchange: he told Camp about conflicts within WDV that ultimately resulted in his formation of a separate company called \"Maverck\"; he also relayed \"confidential\" WDV information.  Martin continued to discuss Camp's future, noting that she could \"have a job with either [WDV or Maverck],\" that he thought she \"belong[ed] in Tahoe/Reno,\" and that she might \"become CEO [her]self one day.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the two corresponded more frequently, their communications became more personal.  Camp began to refer to Martin as \"Steve.\"  They discussed their families and social lives, and even shared the messages with family members.  As their relationship grew more personal, both Camp and Martin, but particularly Martin, spoke jokingly of the \"spy\" aspect of the correspondence.  For example, Martin referred to Camp's gossip as \"IDEXX Files\" and described the events at WDV as a \"palace coup.\" Martin also continued to praise Camp's \"aggressiveness\" and exhorted her to work only in her own interest and to continue to accumulate relevant knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, Martin indicated that he \"had much to tell\"Camp, but that he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement first.  Camp considered signing the agreement immediately, but ultimately postponed signing because of potential ethical concerns, including potential competition between WDV and IDEXX.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, Camp sent Martin an e-mail discussing the poultry and livestock industries, noting problems IDEXX customers had been having with particular diagnostic kits, and mentioning that customers \"loved\" the IDEXX free software program \"x-Chek.\" Camp continued to discuss IDEXX's poor customer service approach in her May 1 \"travelogue,\" written during a business trip to the Midwest.  Throughout her \"travelogue,\" Camp repeatedly expressed her happiness in being away from IDEXX and her willingness to move on to new employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II.  Events Between May 1, 1998 and July 18, 1998</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's first six counts of wire fraud, on which Martin was acquitted, stem from correspondence occurring prior to July 18, 1998.  One count of mail fraud, on which Martin was convicted, also stems from this period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  Martin's Initial Requests</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, in response to Camp's lengthy e-mail detailing her trip, Martin made his first explicit request for information, asking for \"any info. . . . on the HOT topics in veterinary diagnostics.\"  Martin renewed his request in a May 3 e-mail in which he asked a number of questions about IDEXX prices, test composition, and test use.  In a subsequent message, Martin outlined his ability to avoid patent infringement with IDEXX and noted that \"IDEXX is going to be in trouble very soon.\"  On May 3, Camp responded with answers to most of Martin's questions. Attached was a letter detailing problems with a particular IDEXX product.  In reference to a previous discussion about flying planes, Martin began to refer to Camp as \"Ace,\" a moniker which would become \"Agent Ace\" as their \"spy\" business heated up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Camp's Responses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, Camp wrote concerning IDEXX's legal problems. She also included \"lots &amp; lots of goodies for your next rainy day,\" including internal memoranda.  Camp noted that the internal memoranda may have been confidential.  \"I feel like a spy,\" she commented.  In a letter the next day, Camp regretted her actions, promising to \"be good . . . and send no more dirty secrets from Idexx. . . .\"  Martin responded, claiming that he did \"not want to know anything confidential about IDEXX,\" and asking only for \"public information.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Camp's repentance and Martin's denial of any desire for confidential or proprietary information, Camp continued to assemble and pass on information, an activity which she apparently viewed as ethically suspect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Camp also relayed information on IDEXX's strategic plans, including a potential partnership with a company whose name, at least, was confidential. By late June, Camp appeared set on leaving IDEXX, as she commented that \"I need to unload all of my stock options.\"  Furthermore, Camp had received (and ignored) reminders of her non-compete and non-disclosure agreements; she forwarded these reminders to Martin, noting that \"as a spy myself, I get a particular chuckle out of [them],\" and that \"my loyalty has ended.\"  Camp and Martin began to formalize their plans for meeting at Lake Tahoe in early August, as well as for Camp's eventual move to Nevada.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  More Questions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Camp prepared to leave IDEXX, she continued to send Martin information, at times upon his requests and at times on her own initiative.  In a July 4 e-mail, Martin inquired about IDEXX's methodology for flourescent-based tests.  Camp responded that she was not familiar with the technology, but that she would \"try to have some answers by the end of the week.\" By July 7, she did.  In a postscript to a July 10 message, Martin renewed his request regarding particular tests, their procedures, and IDEXX sales practices.  Camp responded to the extent she was able.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.  Potential Competition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin also disclosed his \"game-plan\" to compete with IDEXX.  Martin noted that Camp should \"think tests for heartworm, FIV, FeLV, etc.,\" all tests IDEXX currently sold.  Camp responded with instructions on how \"[t]o beat the competition (for cat &amp; dog diagnostics) . . . [in which] Idexx is definitely the world-wide leader.\"  Martin egged her on:  \"I always meant to tell you that we could always start our own veterinary lab service company - just like all the fine folks that IDEXX is trying to buy out.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.  The First Package</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, Camp sent Martin a large package of information via Priority Mail, including various devices, product inserts, USDA course materials, information on her own projects, miscellaneous IDEXX product information, and \"Examples of My Work,\" labeled \"Confidential.\"  Camp also promised to send an actual test kit, if Martin wished.  The mailing and receipt of this package formed the basis of a mail fraud charge, of which Martin was ultimately convicted.  After receiving the package, Martin once more praised Camp's aggressiveness, encouraged her to \"keep on charging,\" to \"keep on thinking about the competition, and how we can beat them,\" and promised that \"lips are sealed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III.  Events Between July 19, 1998 to August 16, 1998</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Correspondence during the next several weeks provided the basis for Martin's conviction on four counts of wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.  More Questions and Answers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In several e-mails between July 19 and July 21, Camp outlined a proposal for customer-friendly additions and modifications to current IDEXX technology.  Martin explained how such a test might be constructed, telling Camp that if it could be marketed successfully, she would receive \"enough bonus money to buy [a] house for cash.\"  Camp clearly understood that the proposal was for technology competitive with that of IDEXX, as she suggested the possibility that \"[she and Martin would] own the whole market.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camp's proposal also prompted Martin to ask about the relevance and applicability of x-Chek or similar software.  Camp offered to send Martin a copy of the software IDEXX had developed for poultry and livestock testing.  Martin responded the same day, writing that \"he would like to play with the software you mentioned.\"  Camp immediately replied, promising \"lots of cool goodies,\" including the x-Chek disks.  Camp also indicated that she was on the verge of \"cleaning out her office\" and leaving IDEXX; however, she noted that she was speaking to headhunters in addition to Martin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin's response to this last message re-affirmed his intention to compete with IDEXX.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, Martin acknowledged Camp's potentially illicit activity, and exhorted her to continue in her final few days at work.  \"Before you bag IDEXX (I am embarrassed to ask this), absorb as much information, physically and intellectually, as you can.  I never had a spy before.\"  Camp's answer bemoaned the constraints on her information gathering (because co-workers knew she was preparing to leave), detailed her continued efforts to take home both information and property, and admitted the illegality (or at least inappropriateness) of her actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  However, Camp noted that she had as of yet been unwilling to copy \"confidential\" documents, although she admitted that she had copied \"semi-confidential\" internal e-mail.  The next day, Camp promised to send Martin additional kits as her last \"secret agent\" act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  The Second Package</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Camp's last several days at IDEXX, she continued to collect products and information, which she forwarded to Martin on July 24.  The package included operating manuals, IDEXX marketing materials, research and development data, a sales binder prepared by an independent contractor, as well as a binder labeled \"Competition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Found Out</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Camp and Martin, Camp inadvertently sent her July 25 e-mail (acknowledging that July 24 was her last day and detailing the contents of her second package) to John Lawrence, the global marketing manager for Poultry/Livestock at IDEXX.  Camp informed Martin of what she had done, and continued on her vacation.  According to Camp, Martin later recommended that she lie to IDEXX, i.e., that she tell them that he was interested only in limited information unrelated to IDEXX core businesses.  Upon her return to Maine, Camp was intercepted and interviewed by an FBI agent at the Portland airport.  An August 9, 1998 search of Martin's home found the contents of Camp's second package, including the x-Chek software.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.  Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence presented to a jury faces a difficult task.

The court must credit both direct and circumstantial evidence, without evaluating or speculating on the weight the jury has given different pieces of evidence, and without making its own judgments as to credibility. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  Furthermore, juries </a></span>need not evaluate pieces of evidence in isolation, but may draw conclusions from the sum of an evidentiary presentation.

Even if the appellate court feels that a jury could have reached a different verdict, the court need only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in \"a plausible rendition of the record.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Note, however, </a></span>that the jury verdict is not given a \"free pass\"; if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, \"gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support\" to theories of guilt and innocence, the convictions must be reversed.

The Act defines a \"trade secret\" broadly, to include both tangible property and intangible information, as long as the owner \"has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret\" and the information \"derives independent economic value . . . from not being generally known to . . . the public.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757746\"><a href=\"/opinion/757746/united-states-v-kai-lo-hsu-aka-james-hsu-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  at 196; </a></span>18 U.S.C. &#167; 1839(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  This definition of trade secret \"protects a wider variety\" of information than most civil laws; however, \"it is clear that Congress did not intend . . . to prohibit lawful competition such as the use of general skills or parallel development of a similar product,\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757746\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hsu,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/757746/united-states-v-kai-lo-hsu-aka-james-hsu-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">196-97</span></a></span>, although it did mean to punish \"the disgruntled former employee who walks out of his former company with a computer diskette full of engineering schematics,\"id. at 201 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 104-788, at 7).  In other words, &#167; 1832(a) was not designed to punish competition, even when such competition relies on the know-how of former employees of a direct competitor.  It was, however, designed to prevent those employees (and their future employers) from taking advantage of confidential information gained, discovered, copied, or taken while employed elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin contends that the evidence is factually insufficient to establish a \"meeting of the minds\" or agreement to violate &#167; 1832(a), because (1) insufficient evidence exists to establish an agreement between Martin and Camp; (2) insufficient evidence exists to prove that Martin had the necessary intent to commit an act prohibited by &#167; 1832(a), i.e., injure the owner of the trade secret (IDEXX); and (3) the information provided by Camp to Martin did not meet the statutory definition of a trade secret under &#167; 1839(3).  As we explain below, none of these arguments are persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Martin and Camp formed an agreement regarding the theft of trade secrets.  Martin's argument against the existence of an agreement relies on the facts that (a) his early e-mails specifically requested that Camp not send him confidential information, and (b) Camp did not seem to know the distinction between confidential information, proprietary information, and office gossip.  However, while Martin's disclaimer and Camp's confusion indicate the lack of an explicit agreement at that time, they do not necessarily negate the existence of an agreement. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Woodward,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">67</span> </a></span>(including tacit agreements within conspiracy requirements).  A rational jury could have plausibly concluded on the basis of the evidence presented at trial that an agreement existed.  By July 21, Martin had received extensive correspondence from Camp that she had either marked \"confidential\" or \"proprietary,\" or had expressed some hesitation in forwarding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Despite his previous protestations that he wanted nothing to do with IDEXX or its confidential information, Martin asked Camp on July 21 to \"absorb as much information, physically and intellectually, as you can,\" and included a set of questions to direct Camp's research.  Throughout June and July, Martin referred to Camp as \"Agent Ace,\" or as his \"spy.\"  Given the type of information that Martin had already received, a reasonable jury could have concluded that, whatever Martin's original intentions, as of July 21, Camp and Martin had reached a tacit agreement by which she would send him items and information that potentially fell under the trade secret definition of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1839(3).  In other words, sufficient evidence exists to show an agreement between Camp and Martin to violate &#167; 1832(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the evidence is sufficient to show that Martin intended to injure IDEXX by obtaining IDEXX trade secrets and competing against IDEXX.  Although Martin consistently claimed that he had no interest in developing products that competed with IDEXX, and hence had no intention of injuring IDEXX economically, his correspondence with Camp detailed a plan of competition.  Martin had, among other things, considered the possibility of starting a competing veterinary lab,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and had asked Camp to think, in particular, about ways to compete with tests that IDEXX manufactured.  A reasonable jury could have found that Martin intended to use the information gained from Camp, particularly information on IDEXX's costs and customer dissatisfaction with IDEXX, to create a more successful competitor with greater capability to injure IDEXX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Martin's final argument - that he actually received no trade secrets - even if true, is irrelevant.  Martin has only been found guilty of a conspiracy to steal trade secrets, rather than the underlying offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488024\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Giry,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/488024/united-states-v-pierre-michel-henri-giry-and-steven-seward/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>.

The key question is whether Martin intended to steal trade secrets.  A rational jury, considering the information Camp had already sent Martin, could have concluded that his further queries indicated such an intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could therefore have concluded that Martin and Camp formed an agreement by which Camp conveyed information and property to Martin that potentially fell under the definition of a trade secret in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1839.  As a result, sufficient evidence existed to convict Martin of conspiracy to steal trade secrets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III.

To be found guilty of a conspiracy to transport stolen goods interstate, Martin must have agreed to transport \"goods, wares, [or] merchandise,\" with a \"value of $5,000 or more,\" in interstate or foreign commerce, and \"known the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  Dowling v.

Although intangible, \"purely intellectual\" property does not fall within the auspices of &#167; 2314, intangible components of tangible items may contribute to the $5,000 value requirement.  See United States v.Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555893\"><a href=\"/opinion/555893/united-states-v-john-m-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span>, 1307-08 &amp; n.14 (10th Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment for conspiracy to transport stolen goods was based in part on Martin's July 21 request for a copy of x-Chek software and his July 22 acknowledgment that Camp would be sending him additional test kits.  See Brief for Appellant 31 (admitting that the \"evidence at trial established . . . two instances on which Dr. Martin requested 'property,' as opposed to 'information.'\").  Martin received a large package from Camp in the mail after sending these two e-mails.  However, Martin claims that (1) this evidence is insufficient to establish the existence of anagreement with Camp to transport stolen property; and (2) that the property in question did not meet the $5,000 value requirement of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the existence of an agreement between Camp and himself with respect to stolen property.  For the same reasons that a rational jury could plausibly have found an agreement to steal trade secrets, we conclude that the same rational jury could have found an agreement between Camp and Martin by which she would send him property from IDEXX.  However, the question remains whether that agreement (1) covered \"stolen\" property in violation of &#167;a2314, and (2) covered property with a value of more than $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For property to be \"stolen\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314, the defendant must have \"known\" it to be \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  Although the prosecution introduced testimony that IDEXX only provided x-Chek for \"free\" under a license agreement with its customers, Martin claimed that, based on Camp's previous e-mail communication, he believed the software was free.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  However, in a conviction challenged for sufficiency of the evidence, we must give the jury's finding great weight, asking only whether a \"reasonable\" or \"rational\" jury could have \"plausibly\" found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Echeverri,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>; United States v.Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).  In this case, given that three months had passed since Camp had described x-Chek as \"free,\" that she had originally discussed it in connection with customersatisfaction, that the \"free\" label occurred at the end of a lengthy e-mail, and that Martin was a scientist who had surely dealt with companies such as IDEXX before, a jury could certainly have concluded that he knew that such companies did not provide major software packages for free to those who were neither customers nor potential customers, and that Martin knew the software had been stolen or converted from IDEXX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, with respect to the \"free\" test kits, the evidence is much stronger that Martin knew that they had been \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  First, when Camp sent Martin the original set of kits, she told him not to \"say where [he] got them,\" and not to mention them to her relatives, because \"all rules are null-and-void now that Idexx has been acquiring kits from its competitors by sneaky means.\"  Even though Camp noted that it was part of her job to send free kits to potential customers, Martin was clearly not a potential customer, and could not plausibly have believed that this mandate applied to his \"spy\" sending free kits to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Furthermore, Martin admitted that, in the future, he would have to buy the kits, suggesting that he did not really believe he was entitled to obtain them for free.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the jury could have plausibly concluded that Martin's July 21 request to Camp to \"absorb as much information, physically and intellectually, as you can,\" included a request to send him physical goods such as test kits and software.  Martin had already received items from Camp, and was at the time expecting further items, such as the x-Chek software.  Although Martin is correct that &#167; 2314 does not apply to purely \"intangible information,\" the theft of which is punishable under copyright law and other intellectual property statutes, see United States v.Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555893\"><a href=\"/opinion/555893/united-states-v-john-m-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span>, 1307 (10th Cir. 1991), &#167; 2314 does apply when there has been \"some tangible item taken, however insignificant or valueless it may be, absent the intangible component,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1308 </span>n.14.  Given that at this time Camp had already sent Martin numerous tangible items, he would have been on notice that any request to \"absorb information\" might (and likely would) produce tangible material that he would receive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Martin's claim that the value of his requests did not meet the $5,000 floor, there is evidence that the value of the x-Chek software approached $2,500, and that individual diagnostic kits ranged from $1,500 to $2,200.  Furthermore, there is evidence that Martin was aware of the potential cost of test kits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Whether the actual items received exceeded the statutory value or not (and there is strong evidence that they in fact did), a jury could plausibly have concluded that Martin, with sufficient knowledge of the kit price, had requested items that would likely have exceeded $5,000 and thus satisfied the value prong of the conspiracy charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

A reasonable jury could have found that Martin's requests, including to \"absorb as much information, physically and intellectually as possible,\" indicate that his participation in the scheme was both willing and knowing. Finally, a reasonable jury could have found that Camp's actions - including requesting information beyond her job description without informing IDEXX of her conflicted interests, sending Martin information and property under the pretense that he was a customer who had a right to receive information and property free, and relaying confidential information in violation of both her fiduciary duty to IDEXX and her signed non-disclosure and non-compete agreements - constituted false pretenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The government has offered substantial evidence of Martin's willing participation in (in fact, sponsorship of) Camp's breach of fiduciary duty.  A jury could have found that Martin's request for information about IDEXX's competitive stance, his willing receipt of IDEXX materials and inventory, and his request that Camp gather as much information as possible prior to leaving the company both encouraged and aided Camp in breaching her fiduciary duty to IDEXX.  Moreover, in Martin's use of \"spy\" terminology, in his specific requests for information, and in his apparent willingness to use the information to compete directly with IDEXX, a reasonable jury could have found that his participation in the scheme to defraud IDEXX of Camp's honest services, i.e., to have Camp breach her fiduciary duties for personal gain and harm to IDEXX, was sufficient to maintain liability for aiding and abetting pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

We examine each count in turn to determine if a rational jury might have plausibly concluded that they were used to effect one of the two possible schemes to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin claims that the e-mails on which counts 7 and 8 are based (Camp's offer to send him x-Chek software and his affirmative response) cannot be communications designed to effect a scheme to defraud because he had no knowledge that the software was not free.  As previously pointed out, the record belies this claim.  In any event, Camp certainly knew that she was only supposed to send x-Chek to customers; Martin was clearly not a customer.  Thus her x-Chek offer could be construed as part of a scheme to defraud IDEXX of her honest services.  In other words, a reasonable jury could conclude that Camp's offer to send x-Chek to Martin breached her fiduciary duty to IDEXX and caused IDEXX harm. As a reasonable jury could also find that Martin aided and abetted this breach, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra</span>, the evidence is sufficient to convict on counts 7 and 8.  Furthermore, a jury could reasonably have found that Martin knew that he was not entitled to a free copy of x-Chek. If so, Martin would have obtained the software through false pretenses, and thus satisfied the alternative prong of the wire fraud test with his affirmative response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin admits that his e-mail on which count 9 is based, asking Camp to \"absorb as much physically and intellectually as you can,\" could be construed as \"requesting . . . non-confidential public information,\" Appellant Brief 38, but only if read in isolation.  Martin argues that as a non-competitor, he had no use for confidential information, and that the words \"as you can\" incorporated previous guidelines of confidentiality.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 39. </span>However, it is not our task to determine if alternate interpretations of the evidence were available to the jury, but rather if the evidence was sufficient for the jury to reach a reasonable interpretation upon which it could convict.  See, e.g.,United States v. Batista-Polanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1991). Certainly the request made by Martin in this particular e-mail is highly suggestive of a request for information which he knew was confidential and would require Camp's \"spying\" to unearth.  A reasonable jury could have interpreted his request in this manner, and thus found that this communication was made in furtherance of the scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin claims that because Camp's July 21 e-mail (on which count 10 is based) denies any use of confidential information, that it could not be part of the scheme to defraud. However, this e-mail alerted Martin to the delivery of seven binders (which included information marked specifically as \"confidential\"), provided further information about IDEXX procedures and methods, and noted that Camp had \"found a jackpot.\" Despite Camp's denial, we have found above that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that a scheme to defraud existed and that Martin received confidential information in connection with this scheme.  Given that evidence, this communication - among other things, notifying Martin that she had sent documents to him - clearly furthered the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the mail fraud counts (11 and 12), Martin claims that, because Camp mailed items to Martin on her own initiative, Martin could not be guilty of aiding and abetting mail fraud on these counts.  Again, defense counsel confuses what Martin is guilty of aiding and abetting - the scheme to defraud, not the individual mailing.  Again, the jury had sufficient evidence to find Martin guilty of aiding and abetting the scheme to defraud, either through deprivation of property under false pretenses or via honest services fraud.  Camp's mailing of the packages to Martin was in furtherance of the scheme:  either because it finalized the property removal from IDEXX or provided the final pieces to Martin's future competition with IDEXX.  Thus sufficient evidence existed to convict Martin on either count.  Moreover, &#167; 1341 itself criminalizes the act of \"causing\" another to deposit items in the mails that further a scheme to defraud.  Especially with respect to the second mail fraud count, based on the package that included the IDEXX software, a reasonable jury could have found that Martin's request caused Camp to send him those materials, and found him guilty of violating &#167; 1341 without relying on aiding and abetting liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A careful reading of the seven-month e-mail communication between Dr. Stephen Martin and Caryn Camp could lead to the conclusion Martin and his counsel urge - that this is simply a pen-pal relationship between a lonely Maine lab technician and a reclusive California scientist.  However, the evidence could also lead a reader to the conclusion that something far more sinister was afoot:  that an originally harmless communication mushroomed into a conspiracy to steal trade secrets and transport stolen property interstate, and that the electronic mail and U.S. mails were used to further a scheme to defraud IDEXX.  Because we find there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude the latter beyond any reasonable doubt, we AFFIRM the defendant's conviction on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>    Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>    In an April 19 e-mail message, Camp wrote:  \"I'm not certain of how comfortable I am with signing the agreement as long as I am working for another company - particularly a company which is or could be a potential competitor, nor I am I [sic] comfortable with you sharing with me anything which you feel needs to be covered by this agreement.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>    Camp's May 7 e-mail noted that \"the fun part of my week has been putting together packages of information for you . . .\" and celebrated \"the intrigue of being Agent Ace.\"  On June 22, she \"couldn't resist playing Ace-the-Spy today . . . and so I am dropping a few more things in the mail.\"  But her fun did not come without guilt: \"I know I should be shot.
