ROFFMAN,\r\n\n              Third-Party Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n           [Hon. Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   David Berman for appellant.\r\n   Paul M. McDermott with whom Jonathan W. Fitch and Sally &amp;\r\nFitch were on brief for third-party plaintiff, appellee Revolution\r\nPortfolio, LLC.\r\n\nSEPTEMBER 23, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  The appeal before us is from the district\r\ncourt's denial of a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to revisit \r\nthe earlier judgment granted in favor of the appellee's predecessor \r\nin interest.  The judgement sought to be reopened was affirmed by \r\nthis court in Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio LLC, 166 F.3d 389 (1st\r\nCir. 1999), which provides the pertinent background.\r\nHaving considered the record and the arguments of both\r\nsides, we are satisfied that several of the grounds on which\r\nappellant urges that the judgment be reopened are ones that were or\r\nshould properly have been submitted to the district court prior to\r\nits entry of summary judgment; appellant does not show any adequate\r\njustification for considering them at this late date, apart from\r\nhis disagreement with the legal conclusions of the district court.\r\nSee Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995) (wrongly decided\r\npoint of law not grounds for relief under Rule 60(b)).  \r\nThere are two other arguments that appellant claims have\r\nonly become available subsequent to the summary judgment due to\r\nchanged circumstances or newly revealed facts.  Without deciding\r\nwhether this avoids the Rule 60(b) bar, it is enough to say that\r\nthe district court rejected both arguments on the merits, and we\r\nagree with the district court's reasoning and see no need for\r\nfurther discussion of the assignments of error.\r\nAffirmed.\n",
