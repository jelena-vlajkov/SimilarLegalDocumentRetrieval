Appellant   Roland\n\nMarshall Dumas was convicted in a jury trial of conspiracy to\n\npossess cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. ยง 846 (1988).         The district court (Woodlock, J.) imposed\n\na sentence of 262 months imprisonment, and denied Dumas's Motion\n\nfor New Trial and Revised Motion for New Trial based on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.           Dumas appeals this ruling denying his\n\nmotions for a new trial.\n\n               On appeal, Dumas presents two instances in which he\n\nclaims the district court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotions for a new trial, which we address seriatim.               First, he\n\nclaims that the district court should have granted his motions\n\nbecause the government failed to disclose allegedly exculpatory\n\ndocuments relating to the impeachment of a government witness.\n\nThis witness's lack of credibility, he claims, was vital to his\n\nentrapment defense.          Second, he claims that the district court\n\nshould have granted the motions for a new trial in order to\n\nremedy     a     violation    of   due   process      springing   from   the\n\ngovernment's failure to disclose, and subsequent destruction of,\n\nnotes that Dumas claims constituted exculpatory material.                For\n\nthe reasons discussed below, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of the motions, finding no abuse of discretion.\n\nI. Facts\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f         The    facts    of   this    case   are     byzantine   in   their\n\ncomplexity. We recount only those facts that are essential to\n\nour decision.   In the fall of 1993, Dumas was serving a sentence\n\nin federal prison in Pennsylvania.         At the request of the United\n\nStates Attorney's Office, the Bureau of Prisons transferred\n\nDumas to the Plymouth County House of Corrections (\"Plymouth\"),\n\na Massachusetts state prison facility.             According to Dumas, the\n\nUnited States Attorney's Office sought this transfer in order to\n\nobtain his testimony before a federal grand jury in a public\n\ncorruption case.     Dumas refused to testify, and was subsequently\n\nheld in contempt and remained incarcerated at Plymouth.                This\n\nrefusal to testify, Dumas argued at trial, set in motion the\n\nevents that led to his ultimate entrapment by the government.\n\nHe claimed at trial, and continues to do so on appeal, that the\n\ngovernment entrapped him in order to gain additional leverage\n\nwith   which    to      secure   his       grand     jury   testimony.\n\n         While at Plymouth, Dumas met Christopher Coyne, who\n\ninvited Dumas to share a cell with him.             Coyne, unbeknownst to\n\nDumas, was an informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\").\n\nCoyne's initial investigative goal did not involve Dumas; Coyne\n\nsought, unsuccessfully, to set up drug transactions involving\n\nfour others, and only turned his attention to Dumas after he\n\nfailed in that endeavor.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          Dumas claims that during the time in which the two\n\nshared a cell at Plymouth, Coyne put extraordinary pressure on\n\nhim to engage in a drug transaction.       The amount of time that\n\nthe two spent in a cell together was a matter of dispute, and\n\none which Dumas felt was vital to his entrapment defense.         DEA\n\nAgent Steven Story testified that the two men shared a cell for\n\n\"no more than a week.\"     Coyne, for his part, recalled that they\n\nshared a cell for approximately two weeks.      Dumas, on the other\n\nhand, testified that he and Coyne shared a cell for nearly two\n\nmonths.\n\n          Eventually, Coyne introduced Dumas to Agent Story, who\n\nwas posing as a drug dealer affiliated with Coyne.             Dumas\n\nparticipated in three telephone conversations with Agent Story,\n\nand planned a drug transaction.        Though the transaction never\n\ntook place, these conversations formed the basis for Dumas's\n\nconspiracy conviction.\n\n          None of the conversations between Coyne and Dumas,\n\nwhich   Dumas   claims   constituted   entrapment,   were   recorded.\n\nBecause of this, Dumas claims that Coyne's credibility was\n\ncrucial to his conviction.       He points,    inter alia, to the\n\nclosing argument of the prosecutor, who stated: \"If you believe\n\nChris Coyne, the case is very simple.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Nearly two years after entry of judgment, Dumas moved\n\nfor a new trial.       He did so because he had learned from a\n\ncorrections officer that, during the relevant time period, Coyne\n\nhad been placed on a \"Q-5 suicide watch\" at Plymouth.                This\n\ninformation had not been provided to the defense, although the\n\ndefense had received general information on Coyne's overall\n\npsychiatric background.    The government was aware of the suicide\n\nwatch, because it was documented in the notes of DEA Agent\n\nThaddeus Blazak.       Apparently, Agent Blazak had spoken with\n\ncorrections officials, and had taken notes at the meeting.\n\nBlazak had learned that Coyne had been placed on the Q-5 suicide\n\nwatch because of \"relationship problems.\"              In the course of\n\ninvestigating this new revelation, Dumas also claims to have\n\nlearned definitively that he and Coyne had shared a cell for\n\nnearly two months.\n\n          Based on this information, Dumas brought a motion for\n\na new trial.    The government, not surprisingly, opposed this\n\nmotion.   In doing so, the government contended that Coyne had\n\nrequested the suicide watch in order to be segregated from the\n\ngeneral   population    because   he    was   afraid   of   Dumas.    The\n\ngovernment, in support of this position, offered the testimony\n\nof Agent Story, who had spoken with another informant who was\n\nincarcerated with Coyne.     The informant stated to Agent Story:\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f           [T]hat he was aware that there had been some\n           problems surrounding Coyne backing out of\n           the proposed undercover transaction and that\n           he felt because of some heat, as he put it,\n           that the defendant Dumas . . . had placed on\n           him, that Coyne staged this incident or\n           staged this ruse as an attempt to get him\n           away from the defendant and to put him in a\n           safe position without actually having to ask\n           or request prison officials to be moved to\n           isolation which invariably would mean that\n           he had the status of being a Government\n           informant.\n\n\nA-182.    After he was informed that he would be testifying in a\n\nhearing on Dumas's motion for a new trial, Agent Blazak shredded\n\ncertain   pages   from    his    notebook    which     the    defense    alleges\n\ncontained information relating to Dumas's case.                   Dumas claims\n\nthat Blazak did this despite knowing that he would have to\n\nproduce any relevant notes at this hearing.\n\n           Some   pages   pertaining        to    Dumas     remained    in   Agent\n\nBlazak's notebook, including those pages that documented the Q-5\n\nsuicide    watch.        In     addition,        Blazak's     notes    contained\n\ninformation that supported Dumas's contention that Dumas and\n\nCoyne had shared a prison cell for nearly two months.                        These\n\nnotes, Dumas now asserts, could have been used to impeach both\n\nCoyne and Agent Story.            In addition, Dumas claims that the\n\ngovernment discovered during trial that Story's testimony on the\n\nlength of time Coyne and Dumas shared a cell was erroneous, and\n\nfailed to correct it.         Finally, Dumas asserts that the shredding\n\n                                     -7-\n\fof   pages   from     Blazak's   notebook      constituted         destruction    of\n\nevidence in violation of his Due Process rights.\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\n             We review the district court's denial of a motion for\n\na new trial only for manifest abuse of discretion.                     See United\n\nStates v.      Brimage, 115 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n118 S. Ct. 321 (1997).         In motions brought for a new trial based\n\nupon newly discovered evidence of prosecutorial nondisclosure,\n\nwe accord deference to the district court's determination of\n\nmateriality.     See United States v. Hahn, 17 F.3d 502, 510 (1st\n\nCir.   1994)    (\"[T]he    district       court's   determination         of     the\n\nmateriality     of    newly    discovered      evidence       in    prosecutorial\n\nnondisclosure cases is ordinarily accorded deference.\") (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 618 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\nIII. Analysis\n\n             While Dumas states many facts, he alleges essentially\n\ntwo legal claims.        First, he alleges that failure to disclose\n\nthe contents of Agent Blazak's notes, which included information\n\non the Q-5 suicide watch and the amount of time Coyne and Dumas\n\nshared   a    cell,    which     would    constitute      a    Brady    violation\n\njustifying a grant of a new trial.              Second, he argues that the\n\nshredding of certain of Blazak's notes could be a violation of\n\nArizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58-58 (1988) (holding that\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fbad faith destruction of evidence constitutes a due process\n\nviolation) and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) (requiring\n\ndisclosure of exculpatory evidence).\n\n          A. Substantive Standards\n\n                  1. Brady\n\n          As the Supreme Court has stated: \"We do not . . .\n\nautomatically require a new trial whenever a combing of the\n\nprosecutors'   files   after   the   trial   has   disclosed    evidence\n\npossibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed\n\nthe verdict . . . .\"   Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154\n\n(1972)   (internal   quotation   marks   omitted).      Instead,    \"[a]\n\nfinding of materiality of the evidence is required under Brady.\"\n\nId.\n\n          Evidence is material under Brady only when \"there is\n\na reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed\n\nto the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.\"    United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985)\n\n(opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also Kyles v. Whitney, 514 U.S.\n\n419, 433-35 (1995) (endorsing Bagley test); United States v.\n\nCunan, 152 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) (same).            This, as we\n\nstated in Cunan, does not mean that the reviewing court must be\n\ncertain that a different result would obtain.         See id.    Rather,\n\na defendant such as Dumas may prove a Brady violation by showing\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthat \"the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put\n\nthe   whole    case     in    such   a     different         light   as    to   undermine\n\nconfidence in the verdict.\"                Kyles, 514 U.S. at 435; Cunan, 152\n\nF.3d at 34.\n\n                      2. Destruction of Evidence\n\n              Part of Dumas's prayer for a new trial is based on\n\ndestruction      of   exculpatory           evidence         under   Youngblood.         We\n\nexamine this claim under a different standard.                            As we noted in\n\na previous case, \"[T]he Supreme Court's jurisprudence divides\n\ncases involving nondisclosure of evidence into two distinct\n\nuniverses.      Brady and its progeny address exculpatory evidence\n\nthat is still in the government's possession.                         Youngblood and\n\nTrombetta      govern    cases       in    which       the    government        no   longer\n\npossesses the disputed evidence.\"                      United States v. Femia, 9\n\nF.3d 990, 993 (1st Cir. 1993).                     This standard, culled from\n\nCalifornia      v.    Trombetta,          467   U.S.    479,    488-89      (1984),     and\n\nYoungblood, 488 U.S. at 58, establishes three hurdles.                                 The\n\ndefendant must show that, in failing to preserve the evidence,\n\nthe   government,       (1)    acted       in   bad     faith    when      it   destroyed\n\nevidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and\n\nwhich (3) is to some extent irreplaceable.                      See Femia, 9 F.3d at\n\n993-94.\n\n              B. Application\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\f                     1. Failure To Turn Over Evidence of the Q-5\n                        Suicide Watch\n\n           According to Dumas, had he been able to introduce\n\nevidence of Chris Coyne's suicide watch, the jury would have\n\nassessed   Coyne's     credibility     differently.         Dumas       suggests,\n\nprobably rightly, that in order for the jury to reject his\n\nentrapment defense, it would have needed to find Coyne more\n\ncredible than Dumas.          Evidence of psychiatric problems, he\n\nasserts, would have called into question the reliability and\n\naccuracy of Coyne's testimony.\n\n           As a preliminary matter, it is clear that impeachment\n\nevidence falls within the Brady rule.            See Giglio, 405 U.S. at\n\n154.    The simple fact that evidence could be used to impeach a\n\ngovernment   witness,       however,   does    not   end    the     materiality\n\ninquiry.     \"Impeachment      evidence,      even   that       which   tends   to\n\nfurther undermine the credibility of the key Government witness\n\nwhose credibility has already been shaken due to extensive\n\ncross-examination, does not create a reasonable doubt that did\n\nnot    otherwise    exist   where   that   evidence        is    cumulative     or\n\ncollateral.\"       United States v. Shelton, 588 F.2d 1242, 1248 (9th\n\nCir. 1978), quoted in United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607,\n\n618-19 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           The district court considered Dumas's contentions with\n\nrespect to the suicide watch in some detail.                     It ultimately\n\n                                    -11-\n\fconcluded that the evidence would not likely have aided Dumas's\n\ncause, in light of the explanation that would have been offered\n\nby the government for the suicide watch.            The court stated:\n\n            With respect to the question of Mr. Coyne's\n            placement on the Q-5 suicide watch, I start\n            with what seems to me to be โ in the light\n            most favorable to the defendant โ a very\n            contested set of circumstances about what\n            was really going on here. The evidence that\n            I have before me of record suggests that Mr.\n            Coyne undertook this as a self-help measure\n            to protect himself from being identified as\n            an informant and being exposed to some form\n            of retaliation.    It is, of course, also,\n            consistent with a fragile psychological\n            construct.     And there have been some\n            disclosures of psychological difficulties by\n            Mr. Coyne. But the weight of the evidence\n            simply does not support the proposition that\n            there is a sufficient basis to have a jury\n            find that he was put in administrative\n            supervision on the basis of some sort of\n            suicidal ideation.\n\n             . . . This much I know:     That given the\n            state of the record now, this would not have\n            been exculpatory rather than inculpatory of\n            Mr. Dumas.\n\n            This evidence, which arguably impeaches Coyne with\n\nrespect    to   mental   stability    and   his   ability     to    recall    and\n\nperceive    events   accurately,     does   not   rise   to    the    level    of\n\nmateriality     required.     While    we   recognize    that      impeachment\n\nevidence, if powerful enough, could constitute grounds for a new\n\ntrial, we do not think that such is the case here.                 See Sanchez,\n\n917 F.2d at 618-19.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f             In United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) we noted, in conducting abuse of discretion review of a\n\nmotion for a new trial, that \"the district court is usually in\n\na much better position to judge the credibility of the witnesses\n\nand   to    assess   the   highly   nuanced    relationship     between   the\n\npurported new evidence, and what previously transpired at trial\n\n. . . .\"       We think    Slade's words instructive in this case.\n\nTherefore, mindful of the district court's superior position\n\nfrom which to assess the new evidence and the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses, we are unwilling to disturb the court's careful\n\nconclusion on this point.\n\n                     2. Failure To Turn Over Evidence of the Amount\nof                      Time Dumas and Coyne Shared a Cell\n\n             Dumas, as we have stated, argued that he was entrapped\n\nby Coyne, a government agent.              He argues on appeal that his\n\nentrapment     defense     would    have    been   successful   had   Dumas's\n\ntestimony about the length of time he shared a cell with Coyne\n\nbeen corroborated by Brady material that should have been turned\n\nover.      This evidence, too, was considered by the district court\n\non the motion for a new trial.             The court stated:\n\n             I turn to the question of the amount of time\n             that he shared the cell with Mr. Coyne.\n             That was the disputed issue at trial. But\n             was it material?     Would it have made a\n             difference in . . . the outcome?     I think\n             not. [Defense counsel] makes a forceful\n             point that it was a kind of reed from which\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          he was attempting to construct a defense,\n          but it was a thin reed.    And the defense,\n          given the state of the record, was grasping\n          at such reeds. And this difference in the\n          amount of time simply wouldn't have made a\n          difference in the result of the case. That\n          really was a dispute over subsidiary and,\n          frankly, secondary kinds of issues that do\n          not provide a touchstone for the kind of\n          proof or evidentiary material that Bagley\n          and all of its progeny have required for\n          there to be a finding of materiality with\n          respect   to  late   disclosed  exculpatory\n          evidence . . . in the final analysis, it\n          would not have made a difference.\n\n\nUpon careful review, we find an adequate basis for the court's\n\nconclusion that there was not a reasonable probability that\n\nevidence would have made a difference in the result of the\n\ntrial.   We are particularly persuaded by the district court's\n\nview of the collateral nature of the disputed evidence.              This\n\nview, to which we owe deference, see Slade, 980 F.2d at 29,\n\nprovides sufficient basis for the court's decision.\n\n          We   are   impressed   by   the   fact   that   Dumas   himself\n\nadmitted on cross-examination that Coyne did not mention a drug\n\ntransaction for some time after they began sharing a cell.            The\n\ngovernment presses this point on appeal, noting the following\n\ncolloquy from the trial record:\n\n                 Q. Christopher Coyne didn't say\n          anything to you about a drug deal the first\n          three weeks you were there; is that your\n          testimony?\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f                A. The first three or four weeks, he\n         said nothing until โ I think it was right\n         around the time I went to the Grand Jury.\n                Q. When was that?\n                A. I have no idea. It probably was โ\n         I think I went to the Grand Jury ten days\n         after I was there. And about a week after I\n         got back, I was complaining because I was\n         going to get the contempt charge . . . So,\n         I'd say it was probably the last week of\n         October.\n\n         Dumas's argument for the materiality of the disputed\n\nevidence is that Coyne pressured him into the drug transaction\n\nover an extended period of time.   The longer they shared a cell,\n\nDumas argues, the more time Coyne had to exert pressure.     But\n\nDumas's own testimony undercuts this view.    He admits that for\n\na significant proportion of the time they were together, Coyne\n\ndid not pressure him.\n\n         The district court's decision on this point is further\n\nbolstered by the fact that the evidence goes to only one prong\n\nof an entrapment defense.   See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d\n\n462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994) (affirmative defense of entrapment\n\nincludes proof of both inducement and lack of predisposition).\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fGiven Dumas's criminal history,1 the latter element might likely\n\nhave proven just as fatal as the former.2\n\n           3. Shredding of Agent Blazak's Notes\n\n           In order to prevail on a motion for a new trial based\n\non destruction of evidence, a defendant must show that the\n\ngovernment: (1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence,\n\nwhich (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and which (3)\n\nis to some extent irreplaceable.        See Femia, 9 F.3d at 993-94.\n\nDumas's argument that the government violated his due process\n\nrights by destroying Blazak's notes calls us to split this first\n\nprong of the analysis into two distinct inquiries.            First, did\n\nthe   government   destroy   evidence   at   all?   Second,    was   that\n\nevidence destroyed in bad faith?\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Dumas was sentenced as career offender, a designation he\ndoes not dispute on appeal. Even without the career offender\ndesignation, his criminal history category, as revealed in the\nPresentence Report, is Category V.\n      2Dumas also argues more generally that the evidence about\nthe length of time he and Coyne shared a cell could have\naffected the verdict because it would have bolstered his own\ncredibility and weakened that of both Coyne and Story, and that\nthe entrapment defense as a whole turned on witness credibility.\nBut even if the disputed evidence clearly established that Coyne\nand Story's recollections regarding the time period were\ninaccurate and that Dumas's was accurate, it seems unlikely that\nthe jury would have drawn any general inference of dishonesty or\nhonesty from the comparison, much less that their verdict could\nhave turned on it.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f         With respect to the first question, the district court\n\nfound as a matter of fact that Blazak did not destroy notes that\n\nwere relevant to the instant case.       The court stated:\n\n         [I]t is bad business for the Government to\n         fool around with integrated documents that\n         are   going  to   provide   the   basis  for\n         examination and they do so at their peril.\n         And I'm astonished that an agent with even a\n         couple of years of experience would treat\n         the notebook that he has like a game: \"This\n         is relevant, that part isn't\" and throw that\n         part out and keep this part.\n                Nevertheless, I've looked at the\n         notebook fairly carefully.    I've looked at\n         the agent's testimony fairly carefully and\n         thought about it. And I believe that what\n         remains here is all that is relevant to the\n         Dumas case.\n\nWe share the district court's incredulity at this unquestionably\n\npoor law enforcement practice.   This does not, however, undercut\n\nour faith in the district court's finding of fact that the\n\nrelevant materials were not excised, but were in fact produced.\n\n\n\n         With   respect   to   the     second   question,   the   court\n\ndetermined that any destruction was not in bad faith.        The court\n\nstated: \"[I]f it is all that is relevant โ and I find that it is\n\nโ then it does nothing more than show certain sloppy practice.\"\n\nAgain, we are loathe to disturb a finding based so heavily on\n\nthe credibility of witnesses.    See Slade, 980 F.2d at 29.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f            The district court's findings with respect to either\n\nthe first or second question would each individually suffice to\n\nsupport   its    denial    of     the     motion       based   on    destruction     of\n\nevidence.     Accordingly, we refuse to disturb that decision.\n\n            4. Cumulative Effect of the New Evidence\n\n            Having found that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion      with    respect      to   each    piece    of    new    evidence     in\n\nisolation, all that remains is to determine whether it abused\n\nits discretion in failing to order a new trial due to the\n\ncumulative effect of the errors Dumas claims.                          The district\n\ncourt considered the cumulative effect, succinctly stating: \"I\n\ncan't find that, individually or taken together, the evidentiary\n\nmaterials    upon      which   Mr.    Dumas      now    relies      would   have   been\n\nsufficient to change the outcome.                And for that reason, they are\n\nnot material and ultimately do not provide a basis for a new\n\ntrial.\"     Put just as succinctly, we agree.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm                       the district\n\ncourt's ruling in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f",

The district court (Woodlock, J.) imposed a sentence of 262 months imprisonment, and denied Dumas's Motion for New Trial and Revised Motion for New Trial based on newly discovered evidence. Dumas appeals this ruling denying his motions for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dumas presents two instances in which he claims the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions for a new trial, which we address seriatim. First, he claims that the district court should have granted his motions because the government failed to disclose allegedly exculpatory documents relating to the impeachment of a government witness. This witness's lack of credibility, he claims, was vital to his entrapment defense. Second, he claims that the district court should have granted the motions for a new trial in order to remedy a violation of due process springing from the government's failure to disclose, and subsequent destruction of, notes that Dumas claims constituted exculpatory material. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the district court's denial of the motions, finding no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are byzantine in their complexity. We recount only those facts that are essential to our decision. In the fall of 1993, Dumas was serving a sentence in federal prison in Pennsylvania. At the request of the United States Attorney's Office, the Bureau of Prisons transferred Dumas to the Plymouth County House of Corrections (\"Plymouth\"), a Massachusetts state prison facility. According to Dumas, the United States Attorney's Office sought this transfer in order to obtain his testimony before a federal grand jury in a public corruption case. Dumas refused to testify, and was subsequently held in contempt and remained incarcerated at Plymouth. This refusal to testify, Dumas argued at trial, set in motion the events that led to his ultimate entrapment by the government. He claimed at trial, and continues to do so on appeal, that the government entrapped him in order to gain additional leverage with which to secure his grand jury testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While at Plymouth, Dumas met Christopher Coyne, who invited Dumas to share a cell with him. Coyne, unbeknownst to Dumas, was an informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"). Coyne's initial investigative goal did not involve Dumas; Coyne sought, unsuccessfully, to set up drug transactions involving four others, and only turned his attention to Dumas after he failed in that endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dumas claims that during the time in which the two shared a cell at Plymouth, Coyne put extraordinary pressure on him to engage in a drug transaction. The amount of time that the two spent in a cell together was a matter of dispute, and one which Dumas felt was vital to his entrapment defense. DEA Agent Steven Story testified that the two men shared a cell for \"no more than a week.\" Coyne, for his part, recalled that they shared a cell for approximately two weeks. Dumas, on the other hand, testified that he and Coyne shared a cell for nearly two months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Coyne introduced Dumas to Agent Story, who was posing as a drug dealer affiliated with Coyne. Dumas participated in three telephone conversations with Agent Story, and planned a drug transaction. Though the transaction never took place, these conversations formed the basis for Dumas's conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the conversations between Coyne and Dumas, which Dumas claims constituted entrapment, were recorded. Because of this, Dumas claims that Coyne's credibility was crucial to his conviction. He points, inter alia, to the closing argument of the prosecutor, who stated: \"If you believe Chris Coyne, the case is very simple.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly two years after entry of judgment, Dumas moved for a new trial. He did so because he had learned from a corrections officer that, during the relevant time period, Coyne had been placed on a \"Q-5 suicide watch\" at Plymouth. This information had not been provided to the defense, although the defense had received general information on Coyne's overall psychiatric background. The government was aware of the suicide watch, because it was documented in the notes of DEA Agent Thaddeus Blazak. Apparently, Agent Blazak had spoken with corrections officials, and had taken notes at the meeting. Blazak had learned that Coyne had been placed on the Q-5 suicide watch because of \"relationship problems.\" In the course of investigating this new revelation, Dumas also claims to have learned definitively that he and Coyne had shared a cell for nearly two months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this information, Dumas brought a motion for a new trial. The government, not surprisingly, opposed this motion. In doing so, the government contended that Coyne had requested the suicide watch in order to be segregated from the general population because he was afraid of Dumas. The government, in support of this position, offered the testimony of Agent Story, who had spoken with another informant who was incarcerated with Coyne. The informant stated to Agent Story:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]hat he was aware that there had been some problems surrounding Coyne backing out of the proposed undercover transaction and that he felt because of some heat, as he put it, that the defendant Dumas . . . had placed on him, that Coyne staged this incident or staged this ruse as an attempt to get him away from the defendant and to put him in a safe position without actually having to ask or request prison officials to be moved to isolation which invariably would mean that he had the status of being a Government informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A-182. After he was informed that he would be testifying in a hearing on Dumas's motion for a new trial, Agent Blazak shredded certain pages from his notebook which the defense alleges contained information relating to Dumas's case. Dumas claims that Blazak did this despite knowing that he would have to produce any relevant notes at this hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some pages pertaining to Dumas remained in Agent Blazak's notebook, including those pages that documented the Q-5 suicide watch. In addition, Blazak's notes contained information that supported Dumas's contention that Dumas and Coyne had shared a prison cell for nearly two months. These notes, Dumas now asserts, could have been used to impeach both Coyne and Agent Story. In addition, Dumas claims that the government discovered during trial that Story's testimony on the length of time Coyne and Dumas shared a cell was erroneous, and failed to correct it. Finally, Dumas asserts that the shredding of pages from Blazak's notebook constituted destruction of evidence in violation of his Due Process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of a motion for a new trial only for manifest abuse of discretion. See United States v. Brimage, 115 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 321 (1997). In motions brought for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence of prosecutorial nondisclosure, we accord deference to the district court's determination of materiality. See United States v. Hahn, 17 F.3d 502, 510 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[T]he district court's determination of the materiality of newly discovered evidence in prosecutorial nondisclosure cases is ordinarily accorded deference.\") (quoting United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 618 (1st Cir. 1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Dumas states many facts, he alleges essentially two legal claims. First, he alleges that failure to disclose the contents of Agent Blazak's notes, which included information on the Q-5 suicide watch and the amount of time Coyne and Dumas shared a cell, which would constitute a Brady violation justifying a grant of a new trial. Second, he argues that the shredding of certain of Blazak's notes could be a violation of Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58-58 (1988) (holding that bad faith destruction of evidence constitutes a due process violation) and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) (requiring disclosure of exculpatory evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Substantive Standards</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Brady</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court has stated: \"We do not . . . automatically require a new trial whenever a combing of the prosecutors' files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict . . . .\" Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, \"[a] finding of materiality of the evidence is required under Brady.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence is material under Brady only when \"there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also Kyles v. Whitney, 514 U.S. 419, 433-35 (1995) (endorsing Bagley test); United States v. Cunan, 152 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) (same). This, as we stated in Cunan, does not mean that the reviewing court must be certain that a different result would obtain. See id. Rather, a defendant such as Dumas may prove a Brady violation by showing that \"the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" Kyles, 514 U.S. at 435; Cunan, 152 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Destruction of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part of Dumas's prayer for a new trial is based on destruction of exculpatory evidence under Youngblood. We examine this claim under a different standard. As we noted in a previous case, \"[T]he Supreme Court's jurisprudence divides cases involving nondisclosure of evidence into two distinct universes. Brady and its progeny address exculpatory evidence that is still in the government's possession. Youngblood and Trombetta govern cases in which the government no longer possesses the disputed evidence.\" United States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990, 993 (1st Cir. 1993). This standard, culled from California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 488-89 (1984), and Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 58, establishes three hurdles. The defendant must show that, in failing to preserve the evidence, the government, (1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable. See Femia, 9 F.3d at 993-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Failure To Turn Over Evidence of the Q-5 Suicide Watch</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dumas, had he been able to introduce evidence of Chris Coyne's suicide watch, the jury would have assessed Coyne's credibility differently. Dumas suggests, probably rightly, that in order for the jury to reject his entrapment defense, it would have needed to find Coyne more credible than Dumas. Evidence of psychiatric problems, he asserts, would have called into question the reliability and accuracy of Coyne's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, it is clear that impeachment evidence falls within the Brady rule. See Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154. The simple fact that evidence could be used to impeach a government witness, however, does not end the materiality inquiry. \"Impeachment evidence, even that which tends to further undermine the credibility of the key Government witness whose credibility has already been shaken due to extensive cross-examination, does not create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist where that evidence is cumulative or collateral.\" United States v. Shelton, 588 F.2d 1242, 1248 (9th Cir. 1978), quoted in United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 618-19 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered Dumas's contentions with respect to the suicide watch in some detail. It ultimately concluded that the evidence would not likely have aided Dumas's cause, in light of the explanation that would have been offered by the government for the suicide watch. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the question of Mr. Coyne's placement on the Q-5 suicide watch, I start with what seems to me to be - in the light most favorable to the defendant - a very contested set of circumstances about what was really going on here. The evidence that I have before me of record suggests that Mr. Coyne undertook this as a self-help measure to protect himself from being identified as an informant and being exposed to some form of retaliation. It is, of course, also, consistent with a fragile psychological construct. And there have been some disclosures of psychological difficulties by Mr. Coyne. But the weight of the evidence simply does not support the proposition that there is a sufficient basis to have a jury find that he was put in administrative supervision on the basis of some sort of suicidal ideation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . This much I know: That given the state of the record now, this would not have been exculpatory rather than inculpatory of Mr. Dumas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence, which arguably impeaches Coyne with respect to mental stability and his ability to recall and perceive events accurately, does not rise to the level of materiality required. While we recognize that impeachment evidence, if powerful enough, could constitute grounds for a new trial, we do not think that such is the case here. See Sanchez, 917 F.2d at 618-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 1992) we noted, in conducting abuse of discretion review of a motion for a new trial, that \"the district court is usually in a much better position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to assess the highly nuanced relationship between the purported new evidence, and what previously transpired at trial . . . .\" We think Slade's words instructive in this case. Therefore, mindful of the district court's superior position from which to assess the new evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, we are unwilling to disturb the court's careful conclusion on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Failure To Turn Over Evidence of the Amount of Time Dumas and Coyne Shared a Cell</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dumas, as we have stated, argued that he was entrapped by Coyne, a government agent. He argues on appeal that his entrapment defense would have been successful had Dumas's testimony about the length of time he shared a cell with Coyne been corroborated by Brady material that should have been turned over. This evidence, too, was considered by the district court on the motion for a new trial. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I turn to the question of the amount of time that he shared the cell with Mr. Coyne. That was the disputed issue at trial. But was it material? Would it have made a difference in . . . the outcome? I think not. [Defense counsel] makes a forceful point that it was a kind of reed from which he was attempting to construct a defense, but it was a thin reed. And the defense, given the state of the record, was grasping at such reeds. And this difference in the amount of time simply wouldn't have made a difference in the result of the case. That really was a dispute over subsidiary and, frankly, secondary kinds of issues that do not provide a touchstone for the kind of proof or evidentiary material that Bagley and all of its progeny have required for there to be a finding of materiality with respect to late disclosed exculpatory evidence . . . in the final analysis, it would not have made a difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon careful review, we find an adequate basis for the court's conclusion that there was not a reasonable probability that evidence would have made a difference in the result of the trial. We are particularly persuaded by the district court's view of the collateral nature of the disputed evidence. This view, to which we owe deference, see Slade, 980 F.2d at 29, provides sufficient basis for the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are impressed by the fact that Dumas himself admitted on cross-examination that Coyne did not mention a drug transaction for some time after they began sharing a cell. The government presses this point on appeal, noting the following colloquy from the trial record:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Christopher Coyne didn't say anything to you about a drug deal the first three weeks you were there; is that your testimony?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The first three or four weeks, he said nothing until - I think it was right around the time I went to the Grand Jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. When was that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I have no idea. It probably was - I think I went to the Grand Jury ten days after I was there. And about a week after I got back, I was complaining because I was going to get the contempt charge . . . So, I'd say it was probably the last week of October.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dumas's argument for the materiality of the disputed evidence is that Coyne pressured him into the drug transaction over an extended period of time. The longer they shared a cell, Dumas argues, the more time Coyne had to exert pressure. But Dumas's own testimony undercuts this view. He admits that for a significant proportion of the time they were together, Coyne did not pressure him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision on this point is further bolstered by the fact that the evidence goes to only one prong of an entrapment defense. See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994) (affirmative defense of entrapment includes proof of both inducement and lack of predisposition). Given Dumas's criminal history,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the latter element might likely have proven just as fatal as the former.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Shredding of Agent Blazak's Notes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail on a motion for a new trial based on destruction of evidence, a defendant must show that the government: (1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable. See Femia, 9 F.3d at 993-94. Dumas's argument that the government violated his due process rights by destroying Blazak's notes calls us to split this first prong of the analysis into two distinct inquiries. First, did the government destroy evidence at all? Second, was that evidence destroyed in bad faith?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first question, the district court found as a matter of fact that Blazak did not destroy notes that were relevant to the instant case. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t is bad business for the Government to fool around with integrated documents that are going to provide the basis for examination and they do so at their peril. And I'm astonished that an agent with even a couple of years of experience would treat the notebook that he has like a game: \"This is relevant, that part isn't\" and throw that part out and keep this part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I've looked at the notebook fairly carefully. I've looked at the agent's testimony fairly carefully and thought about it. And I believe that what remains here is all that is relevant to the Dumas case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We share the district court's incredulity at this unquestionably poor law enforcement practice. This does not, however, undercut our faith in the district court's finding of fact that the relevant materials were not excised, but were in fact produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the second question, the court determined that any destruction was not in bad faith. The court stated: \"[I]f it is all that is relevant - and I find that it is - then it does nothing more than show certain sloppy practice.\" Again, we are loathe to disturb a finding based so heavily on the credibility of witnesses. See Slade, 980 F.2d at 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's findings with respect to either the first or second question would each individually suffice to support its denial of the motion based on destruction of evidence. Accordingly, we refuse to disturb that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Cumulative Effect of the New Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to each piece of new evidence in isolation, all that remains is to determine whether it abused its discretion in failing to order a new trial due to the cumulative effect of the errors Dumas claims. The district court considered the cumulative effect, succinctly stating: \"I can't find that, individually or taken together, the evidentiary materials upon which Mr. Dumas now relies would have been sufficient to change the outcome. And for that reason, they are not material and ultimately do not provide a basis for a new trial.\" Put just as succinctly, we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's ruling in its entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Dumas was sentenced as career offender, a designation he does not dispute on appeal. Even without the career offender designation, his criminal history category, as revealed in the Presentence Report, is Category V.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Dumas also argues more generally that the evidence about the length of time he and Coyne shared a cell could have affected the verdict because it would have bolstered his own credibility and weakened that of both Coyne and Story, and that the entrapment defense as a whole turned on witness credibility. But even if the disputed evidence clearly established that Coyne and Story's recollections regarding the time period were inaccurate and that Dumas's was accurate, it seems unlikely that the jury would have drawn any general inference of dishonesty or honesty from the comparison, much less that their verdict could have turned on it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court (Woodlock, J.) imposed a sentence of 262 months imprisonment, and denied Dumas's Motion for New Trial and Revised Motion for New Trial based on newly discovered evidence. Dumas appeals this ruling denying his motions for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dumas presents two instances in which he claims the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions for a new trial, which we address seriatim. First, he claims that the district court should have granted his motions because the government failed to disclose allegedly exculpatory documents relating to the impeachment of a government witness. This witness's lack of credibility, he claims, was vital to his entrapment defense. Second, he claims that the district court should have granted the motions for a new trial in order to remedy a violation of due process springing from the government's failure to disclose, and subsequent destruction of, notes that Dumas claims constituted exculpatory material. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the district court's denial of the motions, finding no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are byzantine in their complexity. We recount only those facts that are essential to our decision. In the fall of 1993, Dumas was serving a sentence in federal prison in Pennsylvania. At the request of the United States Attorney's Office, the Bureau of Prisons transferred Dumas to the Plymouth County House of Corrections (\"Plymouth\"), a Massachusetts state prison facility. According to Dumas, the United States Attorney's Office sought this transfer in order to obtain his testimony before a federal grand jury in a public corruption case. Dumas refused to testify, and was subsequently held in contempt and remained incarcerated at Plymouth. This refusal to testify, Dumas argued at trial, set in motion the events that led to his ultimate entrapment by the government. He claimed at trial, and continues to do so on appeal, that the government entrapped him in order to gain additional leverage with which to secure his grand jury testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While at Plymouth, Dumas met Christopher Coyne, who invited Dumas to share a cell with him. Coyne, unbeknownst to Dumas, was an informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"). Coyne's initial investigative goal did not involve Dumas; Coyne sought, unsuccessfully, to set up drug transactions involving four others, and only turned his attention to Dumas after he failed in that endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dumas claims that during the time in which the two shared a cell at Plymouth, Coyne put extraordinary pressure on him to engage in a drug transaction. The amount of time that the two spent in a cell together was a matter of dispute, and one which Dumas felt was vital to his entrapment defense. DEA Agent Steven Story testified that the two men shared a cell for \"no more than a week.\" Coyne, for his part, recalled that they shared a cell for approximately two weeks. Dumas, on the other hand, testified that he and Coyne shared a cell for nearly two months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Coyne introduced Dumas to Agent Story, who was posing as a drug dealer affiliated with Coyne. Dumas participated in three telephone conversations with Agent Story, and planned a drug transaction. Though the transaction never took place, these conversations formed the basis for Dumas's conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the conversations between Coyne and Dumas, which Dumas claims constituted entrapment, were recorded. Because of this, Dumas claims that Coyne's credibility was crucial to his conviction. He points, inter alia, to the closing argument of the prosecutor, who stated: \"If you believe Chris Coyne, the case is very simple.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly two years after entry of judgment, Dumas moved for a new trial. He did so because he had learned from a corrections officer that, during the relevant time period, Coyne had been placed on a \"Q-5 suicide watch\" at Plymouth. This information had not been provided to the defense, although the defense had received general information on Coyne's overall psychiatric background. The government was aware of the suicide watch, because it was documented in the notes of DEA Agent Thaddeus Blazak. Apparently, Agent Blazak had spoken with corrections officials, and had taken notes at the meeting. Blazak had learned that Coyne had been placed on the Q-5 suicide watch because of \"relationship problems.\" In the course of investigating this new revelation, Dumas also claims to have learned definitively that he and Coyne had shared a cell for nearly two months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this information, Dumas brought a motion for a new trial. The government, not surprisingly, opposed this motion. In doing so, the government contended that Coyne had requested the suicide watch in order to be segregated from the general population because he was afraid of Dumas. The government, in support of this position, offered the testimony of Agent Story, who had spoken with another informant who was incarcerated with Coyne. The informant stated to Agent Story:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]hat he was aware that there had been some problems surrounding Coyne backing out of the proposed undercover transaction and that he felt because of some heat, as he put it, that the defendant Dumas . . . had placed on him, that Coyne staged this incident or staged this ruse as an attempt to get him away from the defendant and to put him in a safe position without actually having to ask or request prison officials to be moved to isolation which invariably would mean that he had the status of being a Government informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A-182. After he was informed that he would be testifying in a hearing on Dumas's motion for a new trial, Agent Blazak shredded certain pages from his notebook which the defense alleges contained information relating to Dumas's case. Dumas claims that Blazak did this despite knowing that he would have to produce any relevant notes at this hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some pages pertaining to Dumas remained in Agent Blazak's notebook, including those pages that documented the Q-5 suicide watch. In addition, Blazak's notes contained information that supported Dumas's contention that Dumas and Coyne had shared a prison cell for nearly two months. These notes, Dumas now asserts, could have been used to impeach both Coyne and Agent Story. In addition, Dumas claims that the government discovered during trial that Story's testimony on the length of time Coyne and Dumas shared a cell was erroneous, and failed to correct it. Finally, Dumas asserts that the shredding of pages from Blazak's notebook constituted destruction of evidence in violation of his Due Process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of a motion for a new trial only for manifest abuse of discretion.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Dumas states many facts, he alleges essentially two legal claims. First, he alleges that failure to disclose the contents of Agent Blazak's notes, which included information on the Q-5 suicide watch and the amount of time Coyne and Dumas shared a cell, which would constitute a Brady violation justifying a grant of a new trial. Second, he argues that the shredding of certain of Blazak's notes could be a violation of Arizona v.

Destruction of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part of Dumas's prayer for a new trial is based on destruction of exculpatory evidence under Youngblood. We examine this claim under a different standard. As we noted in a previous case, \"[T]he Supreme Court's jurisprudence divides cases involving nondisclosure of evidence into two distinct universes. Brady and its progeny address exculpatory evidence that is still in the government's possession. Youngblood and Trombetta govern cases in which the government no longer possesses the disputed evidence.\" United States v. Femia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195039\"><a href=\"/opinion/195039/united-states-v-femia/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span>, 993 (1st Cir. 1993). This standard, culled from California v.

The defendant must show that, in failing to preserve the evidence, the government, (1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195039\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Femia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195039/united-states-v-femia/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">993-94</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Dumas suggests, probably rightly, that in order for the jury to reject his entrapment defense, it would have needed to find Coyne more credible than Dumas. Evidence of psychiatric problems, he asserts, would have called into question the reliability and accuracy of Coyne's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, it is clear that impeachment evidence falls within the Brady rule. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108471\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Giglio,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/108471/giglio-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>. The simple fact that evidence could be used to impeach a government witness, however, does not end the materiality inquiry. \"Impeachment evidence, even that which tends to further undermine the credibility of the key Government witness whose credibility has already been shaken due to extensive cross-examination, does not create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist where that evidence is cumulative or collateral.\" United States v. Shelton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361948\"><a href=\"/opinion/361948/united-states-v-darrel-e-shelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1242</span></a></span>, 1248 (9th Cir. 1978), quoted in United States v. Sanchez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 618-19 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered Dumas's contentions with respect to the suicide watch in some detail. It ultimately concluded that the evidence would not likely have aided Dumas's cause, in light of the explanation that would have been offered by the government for the suicide watch. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the question of Mr. Coyne's placement on the Q-5 suicide watch, I start with what seems to me to be - in the light most favorable to the defendant - a very contested set of circumstances about what was really going on here. The evidence that I have before me of record suggests that Mr. Coyne undertook this as a self-help measure to protect himself from being identified as an informant and being exposed to some form of retaliation. It is, of course, also, consistent with a fragile psychological construct. And there have been some disclosures of psychological difficulties by Mr. Coyne. But the weight of the evidence simply does not support the proposition that there is a sufficient basis to have a jury find that he was put in administrative supervision on the basis of some sort of suicidal ideation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . This much I know: That given the state of the record now, this would not have been exculpatory rather than inculpatory of Mr. Dumas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence, which arguably impeaches Coyne with respect to mental stability and his ability to recall and perceive events accurately, does not rise to the level of materiality required. While we recognize that impeachment evidence, if powerful enough, could constitute grounds for a new trial, we do not think that such is the case here.

Slade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir. 1992) we noted, in conducting abuse of discretion review of a motion for a new trial, that \"the district court is usually in a much better position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to assess the highly nuanced relationship between the purported new evidence, and what previously transpired at trial . . . .\" We think Slade's words instructive in this case. Therefore, mindful of the district court's superior position from which to assess the new evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, we are unwilling to disturb the court's careful conclusion on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Failure To Turn Over Evidence of the Amount of Time Dumas and Coyne Shared a Cell</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dumas, as we have stated, argued that he was entrapped by Coyne, a government agent. He argues on appeal that his entrapment defense would have been successful had Dumas's testimony about the length of time he shared a cell with Coyne been corroborated by Brady material that should have been turned over. This evidence, too, was considered by the district court on the motion for a new trial. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I turn to the question of the amount of time that he shared the cell with Mr. Coyne. That was the disputed issue at trial. But was it material? Would it have made a difference in . . . the outcome? I think not. [Defense counsel] makes a forceful point that it was a kind of reed from which he was attempting to construct a defense, but it was a thin reed. And the defense, given the state of the record, was grasping at such reeds. And this difference in the amount of time simply wouldn't have made a difference in the result of the case. That really was a dispute over subsidiary and, frankly, secondary kinds of issues that do not provide a touchstone for the kind of proof or evidentiary material that Bagley and all of its progeny have required for there to be a finding of materiality with respect to late disclosed exculpatory evidence . . . in the final analysis, it would not have made a difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon careful review, we find an adequate basis for the court's conclusion that there was not a reasonable probability that evidence would have made a difference in the result of the trial. We are particularly persuaded by the district court's view of the collateral nature of the disputed evidence. This view, to which we owe deference, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Slade,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, provides sufficient basis for the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are impressed by the fact that Dumas himself admitted on cross-examination that Coyne did not mention a drug transaction for some time after they began sharing a cell. The government presses this point on appeal, noting the following colloquy from the trial record:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Christopher Coyne didn't say anything to you about a drug deal the first three weeks you were there; is that your testimony?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The first three or four weeks, he said nothing until - I think it was right around the time I went to the Grand Jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. When was that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I have no idea. It probably was - I think I went to the Grand Jury ten days after I was there. And about a week after I got back, I was complaining because I was going to get the contempt charge . . . So, I'd say it was probably the last week of October.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dumas's argument for the materiality of the disputed evidence is that Coyne pressured him into the drug transaction over an extended period of time. The longer they shared a cell, Dumas argues, the more time Coyne had to exert pressure. But Dumas's own testimony undercuts this view. He admits that for a significant proportion of the time they were together, Coyne did not pressure him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision on this point is further bolstered by the fact that the evidence goes to only one prong of an entrapment defense. See United States v. Gifford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 468 (1st Cir. 1994) (affirmative defense of entrapment includes proof of both inducement and lack of predisposition). Given Dumas's criminal history,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the latter element might likely have proven just as fatal as the former.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Shredding of Agent Blazak's Notes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail on a motion for a new trial based on destruction of evidence, a defendant must show that the government: (1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195039\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Femia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195039/united-states-v-femia/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">993-94</span></a></span>. Dumas's argument that the government violated his due process rights by destroying Blazak's notes calls us to split this first prong of the analysis into two distinct inquiries. First, did the government destroy evidence at all? Second, was that evidence destroyed in bad faith?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first question, the district court found as a matter of fact that Blazak did not destroy notes that were relevant to the instant case. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t is bad business for the Government to fool around with integrated documents that are going to provide the basis for examination and they do so at their peril. And I'm astonished that an agent with even a couple of years of experience would treat the notebook that he has like a game: \"This is relevant, that part isn't\" and throw that part out and keep this part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I've looked at the notebook fairly carefully. I've looked at the agent's testimony fairly carefully and thought about it. And I believe that what remains here is all that is relevant to the Dumas case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We share the district court's incredulity at this unquestionably poor law enforcement practice. This does not, however, undercut our faith in the district court's finding of fact that the relevant materials were not excised, but were in fact produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the second question, the court determined that any destruction was not in bad faith. The court stated: \"[I]f it is all that is relevant - and I find that it is - then it does nothing more than show certain sloppy practice.\" Again, we are loathe to disturb a finding based so heavily on the credibility of witnesses. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Slade,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's findings with respect to either the first or second question would each individually suffice to support its denial of the motion based on destruction of evidence. Accordingly, we refuse to disturb that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Cumulative Effect of the New Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to each piece of new evidence in isolation, all that remains is to determine whether it abused its discretion in failing to order a new trial due to the cumulative effect of the errors Dumas claims. The district court considered the cumulative effect, succinctly stating: \"I can't find that, individually or taken together, the evidentiary materials upon which Mr. Dumas now relies would have been sufficient to change the outcome. And for that reason, they are not material and ultimately do not provide a basis for a new trial.\" Put just as succinctly, we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's ruling in its entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Dumas was sentenced as career offender, a designation he does not dispute on appeal. Even without the career offender designation, his criminal history category, as revealed in the Presentence Report, is Category V.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Dumas also argues more generally that the evidence about the length of time he and Coyne shared a cell could have affected the verdict because it would have bolstered his own credibility and weakened that of both Coyne and Story, and that the entrapment defense as a whole turned on witness credibility. But even if the disputed evidence clearly established that Coyne and Story's recollections regarding the time period were inaccurate and that Dumas's was accurate, it seems unlikely that the jury would have drawn any general inference of dishonesty or honesty from the comparison, much less that their verdict could have turned on it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
