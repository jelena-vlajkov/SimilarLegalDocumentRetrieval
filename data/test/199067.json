Margaret J. Kravchuk, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     William C. Nugent on brief for appellant.\n     Peter M. Garcia and Skelton, Taintor & Abbott on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       August 29, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam.       After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm.               The lower court\n\nfound that the fair market value of the destroyed property\n\nwas $165,000, and given that the uncontroverted evidence\n\nshowed that was the cost of replacing the property, we see\n\nno error in the court’s conclusion.              See Ferrell v. Cox, 617\n\nA.2d     1003,   1007     (Me.     1992)    (uncontroverted        evidence\n\npresented by owner as to fair market value of property\n\nsupported award of damages).          To the extent appellant argues\n\nthe evidence only demonstrated the retail fair market value\n\nof the property, not the wholesale value, the argument is\n\nforfeited since it was first raised in the reply brief.                      See\n\nWaste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).      Furthermore, the argument is meritless, since\n\nthe    uncontroverted         testimony     established         that    as     a\n\nwholesaler, appellee would have had to pay $165,000 in order\n\nto replace the property.           Finally, we see no error in the\n\ncourt’s calculation of appellee’s post-accident damages,\n\nespecially since the court explicitly reduced the amounts in\n\nquestion by appellee’s profit margin.               See Titcomb v. Saco\n\nMobile    Home   Sales,    Inc.,    544    A.2d   754,    758    (Me.   1988)\n\n(property     owner     not    required     to    prove    damages      to     a\n\n“mathematical certainty”).\n\fAffirmed.   1st Cir.
