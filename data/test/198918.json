APFEL, COMMISSIONER, SOCIAL SECURITY\nADMINISTRATION,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n          Michael James Kelley on brief for appellant.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Rayford A.\nFarquhar, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 4, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam. Claimant Velia Ciccariello appeals a\n\ndistrict court order that upheld the denial of her claim for\n\nSocial Security disability benefits.        Although claimant had\n\nmoved    the   district   court   to    remand   her   case   to   the\n\nCommissioner     under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), sentence six, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that the claimant had failed to adduce\n\n\"new\" and \"material\" evidence and denied her motion to\n\nremand while holding that the Commissioner's decision was\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.         Claimant now maintains\n\nthat both the district court and the Appeals Council erred\n\nby declining to remand her case to the ALJ.             She further\n\nargues    that   the   ALJ's   decision    is    not   supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence.     Having thoroughly reviewed the record\n\nand the parties' briefs on appeal, we are disposed to affirm\n\nfor the following reasons.\n\n           First, we conclude that the district court did not\n\nerr by denying claimant's motion to remand.             Even if the\n\nevidence that claimant submitted to the Appeals Council was\n\nnew and material (a matter we need not decide in light of\n\nour disposition), it is clear that the claimant failed to\n\nestablish the \"good cause\" required to justify a remand\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), sentence six.1              \"Congress plainly\n\n intended that remands for good cause should be few and far\n\n between....\"         Evangelista v. Secretary of Health and Human\n\n Services, 826 F.2d 136, 141 (1st Cir. 1987).              Virtually all\n\n of       the   medical   records   that    claimant   submitted   to   the\n\n Appeals Council were in existence long before the date of\n\n her administrative hearing.           Yet both below and on appeal,\n\n claimant's         counsel   has   offered    only    personal    unsworn\n\n assertions that these late-submitted medical records were\n\n previously unavailable because of the poor record-keeping of\n\n claimant's medical providers.              It is well established in\n\n this circuit that this is not enough.             See, e.g., Gooley v.\n\n Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 n. 2 (1st Cir. 1988); cf.\n\n Blackburn v. Heckler, 615 F. Supp. 908, 914 (D.C. Ill.\n\n 1985)(finding \"good cause\" where counsel submitted affidavit\n\n to support allegations of unavailable medical records).\n\n Since claimant failed to submit any proof to support her\n\n\n      1\n     In relevant part, the sixth sentence of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g)\nprovides that:\n\n                The court may ... at any time order\n                additional evidence to be taken before the\n                Commissioner ... but only upon a showing\n                that there is new evidence which is material\n                and that there is good cause for the failure\n                to incorporate such evidence into the record\n                in a prior proceeding....\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f \"good cause\" claim, there was no error in the denial of her\n\n motion to remand.2\n\n              Claimant has waived her contention that the ALJ's\n\n decision is not supported by substantial evidence by failing\n\n to raise this argument below.            See Evangelista, 826 F.2d at\n\n 143.      Her     arguments   that   the   Appeals    Council    erred   by\n\n failing      to    state   the   basis     of   its   decision    denying\n\n claimant's request for review and by failing even to review\n\n her late-submitted evidence similarly have been waived.                  We\n\n note, however, that the record clearly establishes that the\n\n Appeals Council reviewed claimant's additional evidence and\n\n that the Appeals Council was not required to explain the\n\n basis   of      its   decision   denying   review.      See   Perkins    v.\n\n Chater, 107 F.3d 1290, 1293-94 (7 th Cir. 1997); Damato v.\n\n Sullivan, 945 F.2d 982, 988 (7th Cir. 1992).\n\n              In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the\n\n district court is affirmed.           See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n    2We do not suggest that the allegations about the poor\nrecord-keeping of claimant's medical providers are false. We\nsimply emphasize that unsworn allegations do not constitute the\nproof required by the good cause standard.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
