This appeal asks whether, under\n\nparticular circumstances, an amendment adding a party after the\n\nexpiration of the statute of limitations relates back to the\n\ndate on which the plaintiff commenced the action.                         Although a\n\nstraightforward        reading   of    Federal      Rule    of    Civil    Procedure\n\n15(c)(3)    seems      to   require    an     affirmative         answer    to    this\n\nquestion, a doubt lingers because some courts, spurred by a\n\nmischievous bit of dictum, have glossed the text of the rule.\n\nResisting the temptation to read more into Rule 15(c)(3) than\n\nits unvarnished language implies, we hold that the attempted\n\namendment      \"relates     back,\"    and,    accordingly,        we    reverse    the\n\ndistrict court's order of dismissal.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            The seeds of this controversy were sown in Lebanon, New\n\nHampshire, on February 28, 1995, when a Jeep owned by Maureen\n\nBoulanger and operated by Kay Parry collided with a car driven\n\nby   Mitchell    Leonard.        Leonard      and     his   minor      child,    Jade,\n\nsustained injuries. Since Raymond Boulanger (Maureen's husband)\n\nhad arranged for insurance on the Jeep, the Leonards' attorney\n\ncontacted the carrier with a view toward settlement of the\n\npersonal injury claims.\n\n            These negotiations bore some fruit: the parties agreed\n\nto   resolve    Jade    Leonard's     claim     for    a    sum   certain.        They\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fprepared a settlement agreement and, in accordance with local\n\ncustom, submitted it for approval in a New Hampshire state court\n\non January 26, 1998.          Significantly, the agreement and the\n\npetition in the concomitant \"friendly suit\" — both of which were\n\ndrafted by a lawyer representing the insurer — named only the\n\npolicyholder, Raymond Boulanger, as a defendant and misdescribed\n\nhim as the operator of the Jeep.             A state court judge approved\n\nthe settlement on February 18.\n\n            Mindful   of    New    Hampshire's    three-year      statute    of\n\nlimitations for personal injury claims, see N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 508:4(I), Leonard filed suit on January 27, 1998, to recover\n\nfor his own injuries.         Remarking the existence of diversity\n\njurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), he chose a federal forum.\n\nEmulating the petition in Jade's case, his complaint incorrectly\n\nnamed Boulanger as the driver and sole defendant.\n\n            After   the    summons    and    complaint    had   been   served,\n\ndefense   counsel     awoke   to     the    confusion    over   the    driver's\n\nidentity.    On February 13, he called Leonard's lawyer and shared\n\nthis epiphany with the lawyer's secretary.              On the same date, he\n\nwrote to the lawyer advising that the papers memorializing the\n\nJade Leonard settlement would have to be revised to release the\n\nproper defendants.         Despite these contacts, Leonard took no\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\ffurther action in respect to his case within the limitations\n\nperiod.\n\n          The statute of limitations ran on February 28, 1998.\n\nA few days later, Boulanger — a Massachusetts resident — moved\n\nto dismiss Leonard's suit for lack of in personam jurisdiction.\n\nLeonard conceded the jurisdictional point, but moved to amend\n\nthe complaint by substituting Parry as the defendant.         The\n\ndistrict court granted the motion to amend without prejudice,\n\nsimultaneously dismissing the action as to Boulanger.\n\n          Leonard served Parry on May 25.   She moved to dismiss,\n\nclaiming that she had been sued too late.      The district court\n\nagreed.   See Leonard v. Parry, No. 98-42, slip op. (D.N.H. July\n\n22,    1999).       Following    an   unsuccessful   motion   for\n\nreconsideration, Leonard prosecuted this appeal.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n          Because Leonard amended his complaint to substitute\n\nParry for Boulanger after the statute of limitations expired,\n\nhis appeal turns on whether this modification \"related back\" to\n\nthe inception of the action.    The touchstone for such an inquiry\n\nis Rule 15(c)(3).    It provides that an amendment which changes\n\nthe party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is\n\nasserted relates back to the date of the original complaint if\n\n— and only if — the claim or defense asserted in the amended\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fpleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence\n\nset forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading\n\nand,\n\n             within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for\n             service of the summons and complaint, the\n             party to be brought in by amendment (A) has\n             received such notice of the institution of\n             the action that the party will not be\n             prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the\n             merits, and (B) knew or should have known\n             that, but for a mistake concerning the\n             identity of the proper party, the action\n             would have been brought against the party.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3).\n\n             As written, Rule 15(c)(3) has three requirements.               The\n\nfirst (same transaction) clearly is satisfied here:                     both the\n\noriginal and the amended complaints derive from precisely the\n\nsame conduct.         So, too, the second requirement (timely notice):\n\nParry      concedes    that   Leonard    served   her    within   the    120-day\n\ndefault period prescribed by Rule 4(m).1\n\n             This leaves only the third requirement:              knowledge of\n\na   mistake     in    identity.     To    satisfy       this   criterion,    the\n\namendment's proponent must show not only that he made a mistake\n\n\n       1\n     Parry advances some vague ruminations about prejudice — but\nthese are sound and fury, signifying nothing of legal\nconsequence. We fail to see how there could be prejudice from\nletter-perfect service of process within the default period. In\nany event, it strains credulity to argue that Parry somehow was\nunfairly harmed by the small incremental delay in receiving\nnotice.    See Leonard, slip op. at 7 (dismissing Parry's\nsuggestion of prejudice).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fanent the proper party's identity, but also that the later-named\n\nparty, within the prescribed time limit, knew or should have\n\nknown that, but for this mistake, the action would have been\n\nbrought against her.\n\n          In this instance, it is plain from the face of the\n\noriginal complaint — which erroneously stated that Boulanger was\n\ndriving at the time of the accident — that Leonard made a\n\nmistake concerning the identity of the proper party defendant.\n\nSee generally Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 760\n\n(1983) (defining \"mistake\" as \"a wrong action or statement\n\nproceeding      from   faulty     judgment,     inadequate     knowledge,   or\n\ninattention\").         By like token, this blunder alone explained\n\nLeonard's failure to sue Parry in the first place.2               Thus, Parry\n\n— who knew to a certainty that she, not Boulanger, had been\n\noperating the Jeep when the accident occurred — knew or should\n\nhave known from the moment she was served with the amended\n\ncomplaint that the action originally would have been brought\n\nagainst   her    but     for    the   mistake   about    who   was   driving.\n\nConsequently,      all    the    requirements     of    Rule   15(c)(3)   were\n\n\n    2The district court suggested that Leonard might have\nintentionally opted to sue Boulanger on a theory of negligent\nentrustment (or so Parry could have thought). See Leonard, slip\nop. at 7 n.3. This speculation is conclusively refuted by the\nfact that both the original and amended complaints were\npredicated exclusively on allegations of the driver's negligence\nin the operation of the motor vehicle.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fsatisfied,    the   amendment   related    back   to   the   date   of   the\n\noriginal filing, and Parry's limitations defense should have\n\nbeen rejected.\n\n            The district court, however, found to the contrary.\n\nIt elected to go beyond the plain language of Rule 15(c)(3),\n\ntheorizing that \"if a plaintiff knew (or, through the exercise\n\nof reasonable diligence, could have known) the identity of the\n\nproper defendant within the pertinent limitations period, but\n\nwaited until after that period lapsed before seeking to add that\n\ndefendant, he cannot avail himself of the protections of Rule\n\n15(c).\"     Leonard, slip op. at 10.       Applying this premise, the\n\ncourt concluded that Leonard's \"mistake\" did not come within the\n\nrule.     See id. at 11-14.\n\n            The court's premise is unsound, and its conclusion is\n\ntherefore unfounded.      Virtually by definition, every mistake\n\ninvolves an element of negligence, carelessness, or fault — and\n\nthe language of Rule 15(c)(3) does not distinguish among types\n\nof mistakes concerning identity.          Properly construed, the rule\n\nencompasses both mistakes that were easily avoidable and those\n\nthat were serendipitous.      The examples assembled by the advisory\n\ncommittee — e.g., the naming of a nonexistent federal agency or\n\na retired officer, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory committee's\n\nnote (1966 Amendment) — confirm this construction.           The drafters\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fbelieved     that      such    errors    would     trigger   Rule   15(c)(3)\n\nnotwithstanding that reasonable diligence almost always would\n\nprevent them from occurring.\n\n           We need not belabor the point.            Rule 15(c)(3) requires\n\ncourts to ponder whether, in a counterfactual error-free world,\n\nthe action would have been brought against the proper party, not\n\nwhether the action should have been amended subsequently to\n\ninclude that party.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory committee's\n\nnote (1966 Amendment) (explaining that the appropriate question\n\nis whether the proper party \"knew or should have known that the\n\naction would have been brought against him initially had there\n\nnot been a mistake concerning [identity]\" (emphasis supplied)).\n\nThus, what the plaintiff knew (or thought he knew) at the time\n\nof the original pleading generally is the relevant datum in\n\nrespect to the question of whether a mistake concerning identity\n\nactually took place.           See, e.g., Wells v. HBO & Co., 813 F.\n\nSupp. 1561, 1567 (N.D. Ga. 1992) (\"[E]ven the most liberal\n\ninterpretation of 'mistake' cannot include a deliberate decision\n\nnot to sue a party whose identity plaintiff knew from the\n\noutset.\").      What the plaintiff learned later, however, cannot be\n\nrelevant for this purpose.\n\n           We    say    \"for    this    purpose\"    because,   even   though\n\nevaluating the existence of a plaintiff's mistake in light of\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fsubsequently acquired knowledge is flatly inconsistent with the\n\nlanguage of Rule 15(c)(3), post-filing events occasionally can\n\nshed light on the plaintiff's state of mind at an earlier time.\n\nCf. United States v. Mena, 933 F.2d 19, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(explaining that events which occur after an incident may bear\n\non an assessment of an actor's state of mind at an earlier\n\ntime).    Morever, such events can inform a defendant's reasonable\n\nbeliefs    concerning   whether    her    omission   from   the   original\n\ncomplaint represented a mistake (as opposed to a conscious\n\nchoice).    See Kilkenny v. Arco Marine Inc., 800 F.2d 853, 857\n\n(9th Cir. 1986) (\"A plaintiff's failure to amend its complaint\n\nto add a defendant after being notified of a mistake concerning\n\nthe identity of a proper party . . . may cause the unnamed party\n\nto conclude that it was not named because of strategic reasons\n\nrather than as a result of the plaintiff's mistake.\").3           We limit\n\nour holding accordingly:          knowledge acquired by a plaintiff\n\n\n\n    3 Kilkenny's original complaint targeted the wrong defendant.\nWith the limitations period still open, the named defendant\nanswered the complaint, stating exactly the correct defendants'\nidentities. Kilkenny demonstrated her appreciation of this fact\nby including these new defendants in a second suit, but did not\nattempt to amend her complaint in her initial action for over\ntwo years (at which point the statute of limitations had run).\nSee 800 F.2d at 854-55. No such exaggerated fact pattern exists\nhere: Leonard's conduct after filing the original complaint,\nthough lackadaisical, could not have led Parry to believe that\nshe was omitted from that complaint for any reason other than\nhis mistake.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fafter   filing   his   original   complaint   is    without   weight    in\n\ndetermining his state of mind at the time he filed the initial\n\ncomplaint and, thus, in determining whether a mistake concerning\n\nidentity occurred.     See id. at 856.\n\n          There are two other matters that deserve comment.            The\n\nfirst relates to how an able district judge was led astray.             In\n\nsupport of its critical premise, the court relied heavily on\n\nKilkenny,4 a case which, as indicated above, supports a literal\n\nreading of Rule 15(c)(3).         Nevertheless, although reaching a\n\ndefensible conclusion, the Kilkenny court gratuitously stated\n\nthat \"Rule 15(c) was never intended to assist a plaintiff who\n\nignores or fails to respond in a reasonable fashion to notice of\n\na potential party.\"     800 F.2d at 857-58.        This mischievous bit\n\nof dictum, which understandably misled not only the court below\n\nbut also several other district courts,            see, e.g., Brink v.\n\nFirst Credit Resources, 57 F. Supp. 2d 848, 856-57 (D. Ariz.\n\n1999); Sims v. Montgomery County Comm'n, 873 F. Supp. 585, 611-\n\n12 (M.D. Ala. 1994); Potts v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 118 F.R.D.\n\n597, 608-09 (N.D. Ind. 1987), is simply wrong.          Under the clear\n\nlanguage of Rule 15(c), post-filing events (including inaction\n\n\n\n    4 The court also drew support from Pessotti v. Eagle\nManufacturing Co., 946 F.2d 974 (1st Cir. 1991).       Pessotti\nrequires no discussion, however, as Rule 15(c) was not at issue\nthere. See id. at 977 n.2.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fin the face of new information) can be relevant only to the\n\nextent that they (a) shed light upon the plaintiff's state of\n\nmind when he filed the original complaint, or (b) inform an\n\nadded party's reasonable belief concerning the cause of her\n\nomission from that complaint.\n\n                  To be sure, there is an explanation for the Kilkenny\n\ndictum.       When no responsive pleading has been filed, a plaintiff\n\ncan amend his complaint once without first obtaining leave of\n\ncourt and, as long as the requirements of Rule 15(c) are met,\n\nrelation back is automatic.                    But when, as in Kilkenny, the\n\ndefendants          have     served     responsive       pleadings,     an    amended\n\ncomplaint can be filed \"only by leave of the court or by written\n\nconsent of the adverse party.\"                 Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).         What the\n\nplaintiff knew or should have known and what he did or should\n\nhave       done    are    relevant     to    the    question   of   whether   justice\n\nrequires leave to amend under this discretionary provision.\n\nSee, e.g., Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (explaining\n\nthat \"undue delay\" can justify denial of leave to amend under\n\nRule 15(a)).             We think it likely that a blurring between the\n\n15(a)       and    15(c)     inquiries      explains    the    errant   language   in\n\nKilkenny.5\n\n\n       5\n     Indeed,             a   leading        treatise    has    foreshadowed      this\nexplanation:\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\f            In all events, the origin of the Kilkenny dictum is\n\nmostly a matter of academic interest here.         In this case, no\n\nresponsive pleading had been filed, and the district court\n\ntherefore    lacked   discretion   to    deny   Leonard's   proposed\n\namendment.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (stipulating that a \"party\n\nmay amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any\n\ntime before a responsive pleading is served\"); Dartmouth Review\n\nv. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding\n\nthat a motion to dismiss does not qualify as a responsive\n\npleading for Rule 15(a) purposes).      In addition, everything that\n\nwe can glean about Leonard's knowledge at the time he filed his\n\noriginal complaint indicates that he named Boulanger instead of\n\nParry on the patently erroneous assumption that Boulanger was\n\nthe driver.     There is no reason to think that this bevue,\n\n\n    A few cases tend to suggest that if plaintiff's own\n    inexcusable neglect was responsible for the failure to\n    name the correct party, an amendment substituting the\n    proper party will not be allowed, notwithstanding\n    adequate notice to the new party.       Although this\n    factor is germane to the question of permitting an\n    amendment, it is more closely related to the trial\n    court's exercise of discretion under Rule 15(a)\n    whether to allow the change than it is to the\n    satisfaction of the notice requirements of Rule 15(c).\n\n6A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure §\n1498, at 142-43 (2d ed. 1990) (footnotes omitted).    Courts'\ntendency   to  collapse   the  two   inquiries  in  cases  of\nmisidentification is understandable because the parties to be\nadded, by definition, are not present to argue their position\nwhen the plaintiff initially seeks leave to amend.\n\n                                -13-\n\fhowever careless, was anything but an honest mistake concerning\n\nidentity.\n\n            The final matter we must mention relates to a decision\n\nof this court, Wilson v. United States Government, 23 F.3d 559,\n\n563 (1st Cir. 1994), not adequately discussed by the parties or\n\nthe district court.            Following injuries sustained during a\n\nstranding at sea aboard a vessel owned by the United States\n\nNavy,    Wilson    chose    to    sue    his    employer,    General     Electric\n\nGovernment Services (GEGS), under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. §\n\n688.     When     he    belatedly      realized   that     the   Jones   Act   was\n\nineffectual in the circumstances of his case, he attempted to\n\ntrain his sights instead on the United States pursuant to the\n\nPublic Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. §§ 781-790, and the Suits in\n\nAdmiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. §§ 741-752.                  See Wilson, 23 F.3d at\n\n560.    The statute of limitations had run, and the district court\n\nrepulsed this effort.             We affirmed, stating three separate,\n\nindependently sufficient reasons for rejecting Wilson's argument\n\nthat his amendment substituting the government should relate\n\nback under Rule 15(c)(3):              (1) there was no showing that the\n\ngovernment had received timely notice; (2) there was no basis\n\nfor imputing knowledge of a mistake to the government within the\n\nprescribed      time;    and     (3)    there   was   no   mistake   concerning\n\nidentity within the meaning of the rule.

Any such comfort is illusory.           Wilson is\n\nnot a case in which a plaintiff intended to sue A and sued B by\n\nreason of a mistake concerning identity.

Although a straightforward reading of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(3) seems to require an affirmative answer to this question, a doubt lingers because some courts, spurred by a mischievous bit of dictum, have glossed the text of the rule. Resisting the temptation to read more into Rule 15(c)(3) than its unvarnished language implies, we hold that the attempted amendment \"relates back,\" and, accordingly, we reverse the district court's order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seeds of this controversy were sown in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on February 28, 1995, when a Jeep owned by Maureen Boulanger and operated by Kay Parry collided with a car driven by Mitchell Leonard. Leonard and his minor child, Jade, sustained injuries. Since Raymond Boulanger (Maureen's husband) had arranged for insurance on the Jeep, the Leonards' attorney contacted the carrier with a view toward settlement of the personal injury claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These negotiations bore some fruit: the parties agreed to resolve Jade Leonard's claim for a sum certain. They prepared a settlement agreement and, in accordance with local custom, submitted it for approval in a New Hampshire state court on January 26, 1998. Significantly, the agreement and the petition in the concomitant \"friendly suit\" - both of which were drafted by a lawyer representing the insurer - named only the policyholder, Raymond Boulanger, as a defendant and misdescribed him as the operator of the Jeep. A state court judge approved the settlement on February 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of New Hampshire's three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, see N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 508:4(I), Leonard filed suit on January 27, 1998, to recover for his own injuries. Remarking the existence of diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), he chose a federal forum. Emulating the petition in Jade's case, his complaint incorrectly named Boulanger as the driver and sole defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the summons and complaint had been served, defense counsel awoke to the confusion over the driver's identity. On February 13, he called Leonard's lawyer and shared this epiphany with the lawyer's secretary. On the same date, he wrote to the lawyer advising that the papers memorializing the Jade Leonard settlement would have to be revised to release the proper defendants. Despite these contacts, Leonard took no further action in respect to his case within the limitations period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of limitations ran on February 28, 1998. A few days later, Boulanger - a Massachusetts resident - moved to dismiss Leonard's suit for lack of in personam jurisdiction. Leonard conceded the jurisdictional point, but moved to amend the complaint by substituting Parry as the defendant. The district court granted the motion to amend without prejudice, simultaneously dismissing the action as to Boulanger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leonard served Parry on May 25. She moved to dismiss, claiming that she had been sued too late. The district court agreed. See Leonard v. Parry, No. 98-42, slip op. (D.N.H. July 22, 1999). Following an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, Leonard prosecuted this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Leonard amended his complaint to substitute Parry for Boulanger after thestatute of limitations expired, his appeal turns on whether this modification \"related back\" to the inception of the action. The touchstone for such an inquiry is Rule 15(c)(3). It provides that an amendment which changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back to the date of the original complaint if - and only if - the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading and,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As written, Rule 15(c)(3) has three requirements. The first (same transaction) clearly is satisfied here: both the original and the amended complaints derive from precisely the same conduct. So, too, the second requirement (timely notice): Parry concedes that Leonard served her within the 120-day default period prescribed by Rule 4(m).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only the third requirement: knowledge of a mistake in identity. To satisfy this criterion, the amendment's proponent must show not only that he made a mistake anent the proper party's identity, but also that the later-named party, within the prescribed time limit, knew or should have known that, but for this mistake, the action would have been brought against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, it is plain from the face of the original complaint - which erroneously stated that Boulanger was driving at the time of the accident - that Leonard made a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party defendant. See generally Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 760 (1983) (defining \"mistake\" as \"a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention\"). By like token, this blunder alone explained Leonard's failure to sue Parry in the first place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, Parry - who knew to a certainty that she, not Boulanger, had been operating the Jeep when the accident occurred - knew or should have known from the moment she was served with the amended complaint that the action originally would have been brought against her but for the mistake about who was driving. Consequently, all the requirements of Rule 15(c)(3) were satisfied, the amendment related back to the date of the original filing, and Parry's limitations defense should have been rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, found to the contrary. It elected to go beyond the plain language of Rule 15(c)(3), theorizing that \"if a plaintiff knew (or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have known) the identity of the proper defendant within the pertinent limitations period, but waited until after that period lapsed before seeking to add that defendant, he cannot avail himself of the protectionsof Rule 15(c).\" Leonard, slip op. at 10. Applying this premise, the court concluded that Leonard's \"mistake\" did not come within the rule. See id. at 11-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's premise is unsound, and its conclusion is therefore unfounded. Virtually by definition, every mistake involves an element of negligence, carelessness, or fault - and the language of Rule 15(c)(3) does not distinguish among types of mistakes concerning identity. Properly construed, the rule encompasses both mistakes that were easily avoidable and those that were serendipitous. The examples assembled by the advisory committee - e.g., the naming of a nonexistent federal agency or a retired officer, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory committee's note (1966 Amendment) - confirm this construction. The drafters believed that such errors would trigger Rule 15(c)(3) notwithstanding that reasonable diligence almost always would prevent them from occurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor the point. Rule 15(c)(3) requires courts to ponder whether, in a counterfactual error-free world, the action would have been brought against the proper party, not whether the action should have been amended subsequently to include that party. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory committee's note (1966 Amendment) (explaining that the appropriate question is whether the proper party \"knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against him initially had there not been a mistake concerning [identity]\" (emphasis supplied)). Thus, what the plaintiff knew (or thought he knew) at the time of the original pleading generally is the relevant datum in respect to the question of whether a mistake concerning identity actually took place. See, e.g., Wells v. HBO &amp; Co., 813 F. Supp. 1561, 1567 (N.D. Ga. 1992) (\"[E]ven the most liberal interpretation of 'mistake' cannot include a deliberate decision not to sue a party whose identity plaintiff knew from the outset.\"). What the plaintiff learned later, however, cannot be relevant for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"for this purpose\" because, even though evaluating the existence of a plaintiff's mistake in light of subsequently acquired knowledge is flatly inconsistent with the language of Rule 15(c)(3), post-filing events occasionally can shed light on the plaintiff's state of mind at an earlier time. Cf. United States v. Mena, 933 F.2d 19, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that events which occur after an incident may bear on an assessment of an actor's state of mind at an earlier time). Morever, such events can inform a defendant's reasonable beliefs concerning whether her omission from the original complaint represented a mistake (as opposed to a conscious choice). See Kilkenny v. Arco Marine Inc., 800 F.2d 853, 857 (9th Cir. 1986) (\"A plaintiff's failure to amend its complaint to add a defendant after being notified of a mistake concerning the identity of a proper party . . . may cause the unnamed party to conclude that it was not named because of strategic reasons rather than as a result of the plaintiff's mistake.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We limit our holding accordingly: knowledge acquired by a plaintiff after filing his original complaint is without weight in determining his state of mind at the time he filed the initial complaint and, thus, in determining whether a mistake concerning identity occurred. See id. at 856.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two other matters that deserve comment. The first relates to how an able district judge was led astray. In support of its critical premise, the court relied heavily on Kilkenny,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> a case which, as indicated above, supports a literal reading of Rule 15(c)(3). Nevertheless, although reaching a defensible conclusion, the Kilkenny court gratuitously stated that \"Rule 15(c) was never intended to assist a plaintiff who ignores or fails to respond in a reasonable fashion to notice of a potential party.\" 800 F.2d at 857-58. This mischievous bit of dictum, which understandably misled not only the court below but also several other district courts, see, e.g., Brink v. First Credit Resources, 57 F. Supp. 2d 848, 856-57 (D. Ariz. 1999); Sims v. Montgomery County Comm'n, 873 F. Supp. 585, 611-12 (M.D. Ala. 1994); Potts v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 118 F.R.D. 597, 608-09 (N.D. Ind. 1987), is simply wrong. Under the clear language of Rule 15(c), post-filing events (including inaction in the face of new information) can be relevant only to the extent that they (a) shed light upon the plaintiff's state of mind when he filed the original complaint, or (b) inform an added party's reasonable belief concerning the cause of her omission from that complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there is an explanation for the Kilkenny dictum. When no responsive pleading has been filed, a plaintiff can amend his complaint once without first obtaining leave of court and, as long as the requirements of Rule 15(c) are met, relation back is automatic. But when, as in Kilkenny, the defendants have served responsive pleadings, an amended complaint can be filed \"only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). What the plaintiff knew or should have known and what he did or should have done are relevant to the question of whether justice requires leave to amend under this discretionary provision. See, e.g., Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (explaining that \"undue delay\" can justify denial of leave to amend under Rule 15(a)). We think it likely that a blurring between the 15(a) and 15(c) inquiries explains the errant language in Kilkenny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the origin of the Kilkenny dictum is mostly a matter of academic interest here. In this case, no responsive pleading had been filed, and the district court therefore lacked discretion to deny Leonard's proposed amendment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (stipulating that a \"party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served\"); Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that a motion to dismiss does not qualify as a responsive pleading for Rule 15(a) purposes). In addition, everything that we can glean about Leonard's knowledge at the time he filed his original complaint indicates that he named Boulanger instead of Parry on the patently erroneous assumption that Boulanger was the driver. There is no reason to think that this bevue,however careless, was anything but an honest mistake concerning identity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final matter we must mention relates to a decision of this court, Wilson v. United States Government, 23 F.3d 559, 563 (1st Cir. 1994), not adequately discussed by the parties or the district court. Following injuries sustained during a stranding at sea aboard a vessel owned by the United States Navy, Wilson chose to sue his employer, General Electric Government Services (GEGS), under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167; 688. When he belatedly realized that the Jones Act was ineffectual in the circumstances of his case, he attempted to train his sights instead on the United States pursuant to the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 781-790, and the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 741-752. See Wilson, 23 F.3d at 560. The statute of limitations had run, and the district court repulsed this effort. We affirmed, stating three separate, independently sufficient reasons for rejecting Wilson's argument that his amendment substituting the government should relate back under Rule 15(c)(3): (1) there was no showing that the government had received timely notice; (2) there was no basis for imputing knowledge of a mistake to the government within the prescribed time; and (3) there was no mistake concerning identity within the meaning of the rule. See id. at 562-63. We explained the third reason as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was no \"mistake concerning the identity of the proper party,\" as required by Rule 15(c)(3). Rather, Wilson merely lacked knowledge of the proper party. In other words, Wilson fully intended to sue GEGS, he did so, and GEGS turned out to be the wrong party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 563.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, this statement appears to lend comfort to Parry's position. Any such comfort is illusory. Wilson is not a case in which a plaintiff intended to sue A and sued B by reason of a mistake concerning identity. Rather, it is a case in which the plaintiff chose the wrong theory of liability - the Jones Act - and sued the wrong party. See id. (concluding that \"Wilson fully intended to sue GEGS\"). We agree with the Wilson court that Rule 15(c)(3) was not designed to remedy a mistake in the selection of a legal theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See id.; see also Rendall-Speranza v. Nassim, 107 F.3d 913, 917-18 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (rejecting the view that Rule 15(c)(3) applies where \"the mistake is one of legal judgment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We construe Rule 15(c)(3) in accordance with its plain meaning. Because Leonard fulfilled all the rule's requirements, his amendment related back to the date of his original pleading, and his action was timely. Consequently, the lower court erred in dismissing the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Parry advances some vague ruminations about prejudice - but these are sound and fury, signifying nothing of legal consequence. We fail to see how there could be prejudice from letter-perfect service of process within the default period. In any event, it strains credulity to argue that Parry somehow was unfairly harmed by the small incremental delay in receiving notice. See Leonard, slip op. at 7 (dismissing Parry's suggestion of prejudice).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court suggested that Leonard might have intentionally opted to sue Boulanger on a theory of negligent entrustment (or so Parry could have thought). See Leonard, slip op. at 7 n.3. This speculation is conclusively refuted by the fact that both the original and amended complaints were predicated exclusively on allegations of the driver's negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Kilkenny's original complaint targeted the wrong defendant. With the limitations period still open, the named defendant answered the complaint, stating exactly the correct defendants' identities. Kilkenny demonstrated her appreciation of this fact by including these new defendants in a second suit, but did not attempt to amend her complaint in her initial action for over two years (at which point the statute of limitations had run). See 800 F.2d at 854-55. No such exaggerated fact pattern exists here: Leonard's conduct after filing the original complaint, though lackadaisical, could not have led Parry to believe that she was omitted from that complaint for any reason other than his mistake.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The court also drew support from Pessotti v. Eagle Manufacturing Co., 946 F.2d 974 (1st Cir. 1991). Pessotti requires no discussion, however, as Rule 15(c) was not at issue there.

Although a straightforward reading of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(3) seems to require an affirmative answer to this question, a doubt lingers because some courts, spurred by a mischievous bit of dictum, have glossed the text of the rule. Resisting the temptation to read more into Rule 15(c)(3) than its unvarnished language implies, we hold that the attempted amendment \"relates back,\" and, accordingly, we reverse the district court's order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seeds of this controversy were sown in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on February 28, 1995, when a Jeep owned by Maureen Boulanger and operated by Kay Parry collided with a car driven by Mitchell Leonard. Leonard and his minor child, Jade, sustained injuries. Since Raymond Boulanger (Maureen's husband) had arranged for insurance on the Jeep, the Leonards' attorney contacted the carrier with a view toward settlement of the personal injury claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These negotiations bore some fruit: the parties agreed to resolve Jade Leonard's claim for a sum certain. They prepared a settlement agreement and, in accordance with local custom, submitted it for approval in a New Hampshire state court on January 26, 1998. Significantly, the agreement and the petition in the concomitant \"friendly suit\" - both of which were drafted by a lawyer representing the insurer - named only the policyholder, Raymond Boulanger, as a defendant and misdescribed him as the operator of the Jeep. A state court judge approved the settlement on February 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of New Hampshire's three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, see N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 508:4(I), Leonard filed suit on January 27, 1998, to recover for his own injuries. Remarking the existence of diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), he chose a federal forum. Emulating the petition in Jade's case, his complaint incorrectly named Boulanger as the driver and sole defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the summons and complaint had been served, defense counsel awoke to the confusion over the driver's identity. On February 13, he called Leonard's lawyer and shared this epiphany with the lawyer's secretary. On the same date, he wrote to the lawyer advising that the papers memorializing the Jade Leonard settlement would have to be revised to release the proper defendants. Despite these contacts, Leonard took no further action in respect to his case within the limitations period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of limitations ran on February 28, 1998. A few days later, Boulanger - a Massachusetts resident - moved to dismiss Leonard's suit for lack of in personam jurisdiction. Leonard conceded the jurisdictional point, but moved to amend the complaint by substituting Parry as the defendant. The district court granted the motion to amend without prejudice, simultaneously dismissing the action as to Boulanger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leonard served Parry on May 25. She moved to dismiss, claiming that she had been sued too late. The district court agreed. See Leonard v. Parry, No. 98-42, slip op. (D.N.H. July 22, 1999). Following an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, Leonard prosecuted this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Leonard amended his complaint to substitute Parry for Boulanger after thestatute of limitations expired, his appeal turns on whether this modification \"related back\" to the inception of the action. The touchstone for such an inquiry is Rule 15(c)(3). It provides that an amendment which changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back to the date of the original complaint if - and only if - the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading and,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As written, Rule 15(c)(3) has three requirements. The first (same transaction) clearly is satisfied here: both the original and the amended complaints derive from precisely the same conduct. So, too, the second requirement (timely notice): Parry concedes that Leonard served her within the 120-day default period prescribed by Rule 4(m).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only the third requirement: knowledge of a mistake in identity. To satisfy this criterion, the amendment's proponent must show not only that he made a mistake anent the proper party's identity, but also that the later-named party, within the prescribed time limit, knew or should have known that, but for this mistake, the action would have been brought against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, it is plain from the face of the original complaint - which erroneously stated that Boulanger was driving at the time of the accident - that Leonard made a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party defendant. See generally Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 760 (1983) (defining \"mistake\" as \"a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention\"). By like token, this blunder alone explained Leonard's failure to sue Parry in the first place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, Parry - who knew to a certainty that she, not Boulanger, had been operating the Jeep when the accident occurred - knew or should have known from the moment she was served with the amended complaint that the action originally would have been brought against her but for the mistake about who was driving. Consequently, all the requirements of Rule 15(c)(3) were satisfied, the amendment related back to the date of the original filing, and Parry's limitations defense should have been rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, found to the contrary. It elected to go beyond the plain language of Rule 15(c)(3), theorizing that \"if a plaintiff knew (or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have known) the identity of the proper defendant within the pertinent limitations period, but waited until after that period lapsed before seeking to add that defendant, he cannot avail himself of the protectionsof Rule 15(c).\" Leonard, slip op. at 10. Applying this premise, the court concluded that Leonard's \"mistake\" did not come within the rule. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 11-14.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's premise is unsound, and its conclusion is therefore unfounded. Virtually by definition, every mistake involves an element of negligence, carelessness, or fault - and the language of Rule 15(c)(3) does not distinguish among types of mistakes concerning identity. Properly construed, the rule encompasses both mistakes that were easily avoidable and those that were serendipitous. The examples assembled by the advisory committee - e.g., the naming of a nonexistent federal agency or a retired officer, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory committee's note (1966 Amendment) - confirm this construction. The drafters believed that such errors would trigger Rule 15(c)(3) notwithstanding that reasonable diligence almost always would prevent them from occurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor the point. Rule 15(c)(3) requires courts to ponder whether, in a counterfactual error-free world, the action would have been brought against the proper party, not whether the action should have been amended subsequently to include that party. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory committee's note (1966 Amendment) (explaining that the appropriate question is whether the proper party \"knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against him initially had there not been a mistake concerning [identity]\" (emphasis supplied)). Thus, what the plaintiff knew (or thought he knew) at the time of the original pleading generally is the relevant datum in respect to the question of whether a mistake concerning identity actually took place. See, e.g., Wells v. HBO &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1807278\"><a href=\"/opinion/1807278/wells-v-hbo-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1561</span></a></span>, 1567 (N.D. Ga. 1992) (\"[E]ven the most liberal interpretation of 'mistake' cannot include a deliberate decision not to sue a party whose identity plaintiff knew from the outset.\"). What the plaintiff learned later, however, cannot be relevant for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"for this purpose\" because, even though evaluating the existence of a plaintiff's mistake in light of subsequently acquired knowledge is flatly inconsistent with the language of Rule 15(c)(3), post-filing events occasionally can shed light on the plaintiff's state of mind at an earlier time. Cf. United States v. Mena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561243\"><a href=\"/opinion/561243/united-states-v-edward-ramon-mena/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that events which occur after an incident may bear on an assessment of an actor's state of mind at an earlier time). Morever, such events can inform a defendant's reasonable beliefs concerning whether her omission from the original complaint represented a mistake (as opposed to a conscious choice). See Kilkenny v. Arco Marine Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475822\"><a href=\"/opinion/475822/gloria-lee-weiss-marmion-kilkenny-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 857 (9th Cir. 1986) (\"A plaintiff's failure to amend its complaint to add a defendant after being notified of a mistake concerning the identity of a proper party . . . may cause the unnamed party to conclude that it was not named because of strategic reasons rather than as a result of the plaintiff's mistake.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We limit our holding accordingly: knowledge acquired by a plaintiff after filing his original complaint is without weight in determining his state of mind at the time he filed the initial complaint and, thus, in determining whether a mistake concerning identity occurred. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475822\"><a href=\"/opinion/475822/gloria-lee-weiss-marmion-kilkenny-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 856.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two other matters that deserve comment. The first relates to how an able district judge was led astray. In support of its critical premise, the court relied heavily on Kilkenny,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> a case which, as indicated above, supports a literal reading of Rule 15(c)(3). Nevertheless, although reaching a defensible conclusion, the Kilkenny court gratuitously stated that \"Rule 15(c) was never intended to assist a plaintiff who ignores or fails to respond in a reasonable fashion to notice of a potential <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475822\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">party.\"</span> <a href=\"/opinion/475822/gloria-lee-weiss-marmion-kilkenny-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">857-58</span></a></span>. This mischievous bit of dictum, which understandably misled not only the court below but also several other district courts, see, e.g., Brink v. First Credit Resources, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2417322\"><a href=\"/opinion/2417322/brink-v-first-credit-resources/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 856-57 (D. Ariz. 1999); Sims v. Montgomery County Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1466365\"><a href=\"/opinion/1466365/sims-v-montgomery-county-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, 611-12 (M.D. Ala. 1994); Potts v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></span>, 608-09 (N.D. Ind. 1987), is simply wrong. Under the clear language of Rule 15(c), post-filing events (including inaction in the face of new information) can be relevant only to the extent that they (a) shed light upon the plaintiff's state of mind when he filed the original complaint, or (b) inform an added party's reasonable belief concerning the cause of her omission from that complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there is an explanation for the Kilkenny dictum. When no responsive pleading has been filed, a plaintiff can amend his complaint once without first obtaining leave of court and, as long as the requirements of Rule 15(c) are met, relation back is automatic. But when, as in Kilkenny, the defendants have served responsive pleadings, an amended complaint can be filed \"only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). What the plaintiff knew or should have known and what he did or should have done are relevant to the question of whether justice requires leave to amend under this discretionary provision. See, e.g., Foman v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 182 (1962) (explaining that \"undue delay\" can justify denial of leave to amend under Rule 15(a)). We think it likely that a blurring between the 15(a) and 15(c) inquiries explains the errant language in Kilkenny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the origin of the Kilkenny dictum is mostly a matter of academic interest here. In this case, no responsive pleading had been filed, and the district court therefore lacked discretion to deny Leonard's proposed amendment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (stipulating that a \"party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served\"); Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that a motion to dismiss does not qualify as a responsive pleading for Rule 15(a) purposes). In addition, everything that we can glean about Leonard's knowledge at the time he filed his original complaint indicates that he named Boulanger instead of Parry on the patently erroneous assumption that Boulanger was the driver. There is no reason to think that this bevue,however careless, was anything but an honest mistake concerning identity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final matter we must mention relates to a decision of this court, Wilson v. United States Government, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195350\"><a href=\"/opinion/195350/wilson-v-us-government/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 563 (1st Cir. 1994), not adequately discussed by the parties or the district court. Following injuries sustained during a stranding at sea aboard a vessel owned by the United States Navy, Wilson chose to sue his employer, General Electric Government Services (GEGS), under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167; 688. When he belatedly realized that the Jones Act was ineffectual in the circumstances of his case, he attempted to train his sights instead on the United States pursuant to the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 781-790, and the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 741-752. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195350\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wilson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195350/wilson-v-us-government/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>. The statute of limitations had run, and the district court repulsed this effort. We affirmed, stating three separate, independently sufficient reasons for rejecting Wilson's argument that his amendment substituting the government should relate back under Rule 15(c)(3): (1) there was no showing that the government had received timely notice; (2) there was no basis for imputing knowledge of a mistake to the government within the prescribed time; and (3) there was no mistake concerning identity within the meaning of the rule. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195350\"><a href=\"/opinion/195350/wilson-v-us-government/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 562-63. </a></span>We explained the third reason as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was no \"mistake concerning the identity of the proper party,\" as required by Rule 15(c)(3). Rather, Wilson merely lacked knowledge of the proper party. In other words, Wilson fully intended to sue GEGS, he did so, and GEGS turned out to be the wrong party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195350\"><a href=\"/opinion/195350/wilson-v-us-government/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 563.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, this statement appears to lend comfort to Parry's position. Any such comfort is illusory. Wilson is not a case in which a plaintiff intended to sue A and sued B by reason of a mistake concerning identity. Rather, it is a case in which the plaintiff chose the wrong theory of liability - the Jones Act - and sued the wrong party. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195350\"><a href=\"/opinion/195350/wilson-v-us-government/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> (concluding that </a></span>\"Wilson fully intended to sue GEGS\"). We agree with the Wilson court that Rule 15(c)(3) was not designed to remedy a mistake in the selection of a legal theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See id.; see also Rendall-Speranza v. Nassim, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736850\"><a href=\"/opinion/736850/margot-rendall-speranza-v-edward-a-nassim/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span>, 917-18 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (rejecting the view that Rule 15(c)(3) applies where \"the mistake is one of legal judgment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We construe Rule 15(c)(3) in accordance with its plain meaning. Because Leonard fulfilled all the rule's requirements, his amendment related back to the date of his original pleading, and his action was timely. Consequently, the lower court erred in dismissing the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Parry advances some vague ruminations about prejudice - but these are sound and fury, signifying nothing of legal consequence. We fail to see how there could be prejudice from letter-perfect service of process within the default period. In any event, it strains credulity to argue that Parry somehow was unfairly harmed by the small incremental delay in receiving notice. See Leonard, slip op. at 7 (dismissing Parry's suggestion of prejudice).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court suggested that Leonard might have intentionally opted to sue Boulanger on a theory of negligent entrustment (or so Parry could have thought). See Leonard, slip op. at 7 n.3. This speculation is conclusively refuted by the fact that both the original and amended complaints were predicated exclusively on allegations of the driver's negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Kilkenny's original complaint targeted the wrong defendant. With the limitations period still open, the named defendant answered the complaint, stating exactly the correct defendants' identities. Kilkenny demonstrated her appreciation of this fact by including these new defendants in a second suit, but did not attempt to amend her complaint in her initial action for over two years (at which point the statute of limitations had run). <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475822\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/475822/gloria-lee-weiss-marmion-kilkenny-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">854-55</span></a></span>.
