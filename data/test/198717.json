William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Samson Omosefunmi on brief pro se.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Rayford A.\r\nFarquhar, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nNovember 16, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  After a careful review of the record and\r\nthe submissions of the parties, the court affirms the district\r\ncourt's dismissal of the complaint.  The district court lacked\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction to consider the claims under the\r\nFederal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.  2674, as any claim\r\nappellant submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService did not comply with the requirement of 28 C.F.R.  14.2\r\nthat it include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. \r\nSee Coska v. United States, 114 F.3d 319, 322 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nAppellant's claim that he was deprived of his eighth amendment\r\nrights is more properly termed a violation of his due process\r\nrights.  Lyons v. Powell, 838 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1988).  And\r\nwhile one cannot argue that racial harassment of detainees\r\ncould ever be reasonably related to a legitimate administrative\r\ngoal, see Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538 (1979),\r\nappellant's claim still fails.  No protected liberty interest\r\nhas been identified.  See Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3, 7 (1st\r\nCir. 1991) (\"Fear or emotional injury which results solely from\r\nverbal harassment or idle threats is generally not sufficient\r\nto constitute an invasion of an identified liberty interest.\")\r\n(citations omitted).  Further, the alleged conduct, while\r\ndeplorable, does not \"shock the conscience.\"  See Brown v. Hot,\r\nSexy &amp; Safer Productions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 531 (1995)\r\n(\"Although we have not foreclosed the possibility that words or\r\nverbal harassment may constitute \"conscious shocking\" behavior\r\nin violation of substantive due process rights, . . . our\r\nreview of the caselaw indicates that the threshold for alleging\r\nsuch claims is high.\") (citing Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 427\r\n(1st Cir. 1995)).  No other basis for a constitutional violation\r\nappears in the complaint.\r\n          Affirmed. See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n",
