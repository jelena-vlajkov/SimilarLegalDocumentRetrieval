Claimant Anthony Budkzo appeals from\n\na decision of the district court upholding the determination\n\nof    an    Administrate      Law    Judge     (\"ALJ\")         that   claimant    is\n\nineligible for continuing social security benefits because\n\nsubstance abuse is material to his disability.                        See Contract\n\nwith America Advancement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-121 § 105,\n\n110    Stat.       847,    852-55    (1996).        Specifically,           the   ALJ\n\nconcluded that, if claimant's substance abuse problem were\n\nto    cease,    he    would    have    no    severe       mental      or   physical\n\nimpairment.         Upon review of the briefs and record, we affirm\n\nessentially for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge\n\nin    his    May     11,   1999     report    and    recommended           decision.\n\nWithout attempting to address each of claimant's arguments,\n\nwe add the following comments.\n\n              The     district      judge     did        not    err   in    denying\n\nclaimant's motion to remand for the taking of additional\n\nevidence.       Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), the court may\n\norder       additional       evidence        to     be     taken      before      the\n\nCommissioner \"upon a showing that there is new evidence\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fwhich is material and that there is good cause for the\n\nfailure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a\n\nprior proceeding.\"           In the instant case, the additional\n\nevidence takes the form of a January 1999 letter, written by\n\nan examining consultant some five months after claimant\n\ninitiated    suit      in   the     district      court,     in   response    to\n\nquestions    relative       to     the    consultant's       1992   evaluation\n\nbefore the agency.           Passing without deciding the question\n\nwhether the 1999 letter is \"new\" or \"material,\" the evidence\n\nrather clearly founders on the \"good cause\" requirement.\n\nThe mere fact that the date on the report postdates the\n\nagency proceedings does not establish good cause.                     See Lisa\n\nv. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 940 F.2d 40, 45 (2d\n\nCir.   1991).       Nor     does   the     fact   that     claimant   did    not\n\nanticipate the ALJ's negative ruling.                    Cf. Key v. Heckler,\n\n754 F.2d 1545, 1551 (9th Cir. 1985) (explaining that the good\n\ncause requirement would be meaningless if every time a\n\nclaimant lost before the agency he was free to seek out a\n\nnew expert witness who might better support his position).\n\n            We   are      persuaded       that    on   the    facts   of    this\n\nparticular case the report of Dr. Hoch, a non-examining\n\nconsultant, constitutes substantial evidence to support the\n\nALJ's conclusion regarding claimant's personality problems.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fCf. Berrios Lopez v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 951\n\nF.2d 427, 431 (1st Cir. 1991) (recognizing that the amount of\n\nweight that can properly be given the conclusion of non-\n\ntestifying, non-examining physicians will vary with the\n\ncircumstances, including the nature of the illness and the\n\ninformation provided the expert).          Dr. Hoch concluded that\n\nthere is no personality disorder outside of alcoholism.\n\nThere is every indication that in reaching this conclusion\n\nDr. Hoch had available to him most, if not all, of the\n\nmedical evidence for his review.         Claimant's medical records\n\nreveal   that   a   number    of   clinicians,   over   the   years,\n\ndiagnosed solely a substance abuse problem and not also a\n\npersonality disorder.        Under the circumstances, we reject\n\nclaimant's suggestion that Dr. Hoch's conclusion comes \"out\n\nof thin air.\"\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
