Defendants Patrick King and\n\nJay Woodward appeal their bank robbery convictions, arguing,\n\ninter alia, that witness identifications of them should have\n\nbeen excluded from evidence at trial and that the court erred by\n\nenhancing their sentences based on the bodily injury caused to\n\na teller.     Finding no error in the court's admission of the\n\nidentifications and no merit in defendants' other contentions,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n       A Fleet Bank in Peabody, Massachusetts, was robbed at\n\ngunpoint on the morning of June 23, 1998, at approximately 11:30\n\na.m.   A few minutes later, truck driver Gary Evans observed four\n\ndarkly dressed men, two of whom were transferring leather bags\n\nfrom   one   car   to   another,   in   the    parking   lot   of   a   nearby\n\nrestaurant.\n\n       The following facts are derived from testimony given at a\n\nhearing on Woodward's motion to suppress Evans's identification\n\nof him as one of the four men.          Evans was pulling into the rear\n\nparking lot of the Hometown Buffet restaurant to make a delivery\n\nwhen he was cut off by a gray Oldsmobile.                 Evans, angered,\n\nyelled at the car's driver as the car raced around him and\n\npulled to a stop in front of him, near a parked black Mustang BT\n\nand a red vehicle.       Evans proceeded to park his truck to make\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fhis delivery and observed two men exit the car and load leather\n\nbags from the gray Oldsmobile into the trunk of the Mustang\n\nbefore speeding off in the Mustang.           The front seat passenger of\n\nthe   Oldsmobile   then    got   out    and   showed   Evans   that   he   was\n\ncarrying a gun before leaving the scene in the red car with the\n\nfourth individual.        Evans asked restaurant employees to phone\n\nthe police.\n\n      After being interviewed by local police and FBI Agent\n\nMargaret Cronin, Evans was taken by police car to Chestnut\n\nStreet in Lynn to view two of the suspects.             When pulling onto\n\nthe street, Evans saw the red car he had seen at the restaurant,\n\nand at approximately 1:20 p.m. Evans identified Remington as he\n\nstood on the sidewalk and then King, also standing on the\n\nsidewalk with police.       After making the identifications, Evans\n\nobserved Remington and King being arrested and taken away in\n\npolice cruisers and the red car being searched and then towed\n\naway.\n\n      Evans was then escorted, this time by Agent Cronin, to Alice\n\nAvenue.   On the way to Alice Avenue, Evans was told by Cronin\n\nthat police believed they had apprehended the remaining two\n\nindividuals and that Evans needed to identify them if he could.\n\nThe street was blocked off, multiple police cars were present,\n\nand bystanders were trying to observe the situation.                   Evans\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fobserved the black Mustang before he was asked to view anyone.\n\nAt approximately 2:25 p.m., Evans confirmed that Meola, who was\n\npresented in handcuffs and escorted by police officers into the\n\nmiddle of the street, was one of the individuals present at the\n\nHometown Buffet.   Finally, Evans identified Woodward, who was\n\nalso escorted into the street in handcuffs by police.\n\n    Woodward    filed   a   motion   seeking   to   suppress   Evans's\n\nidentification of him on the ground that it was so suggestive\n\nand unreliable that its admission into evidence would violate\n\nhis due process rights.1      The district court agreed that the\n\nidentification was impermissibly suggestive, but held that it\n\nwas sufficiently reliable to be admitted.        Woodward renews his\n\nchallenge on appeal.    Both appellants also challenge the court's\n\nfinding that bodily injury was caused to a teller during the\n\nrobbery   and   make    various   claims     regarding   the   court's\n\ninstructions to the jury and its sentencing determinations.\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\n    A.    Identification\n\n\n\n\n    1Although King challenges the admission of his show-up\nidentification on appeal, he neither joined in Woodward's motion\nto suppress below nor presented evidence at the suppression\nhearing and thus has not preserved his argument. See Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 12(f); Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 95 (1st\nCir. 1999).\n\n                                  -5-\n\f       An      out-of-court         identification           claimed         to     be\n\nconstitutionally flawed is subject to a two-pronged inquiry.\n\nSee United States v. De Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).       The court must first consider whether the procedure was\n\nimpermissibly suggestive.            See id.       If the court finds that the\n\ntechnique was improper, it must consider whether, under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, the identification itself was\n\nreliable, despite the suggestive procedure.                   See id.; see also\n\nManson v. Braithwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977) (\"[R]eliability\n\nis     the     linchpin    in      determining        the    admissibility          of\n\nidentification testimony . . . .\").                   Indicia of reliability\n\ninclude \"the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at\n\nthe time of the crime, the witness' degree of attention, the\n\naccuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of\n\ncertainty      demonstrated     at    the     confrontation,     and        the   time\n\nbetween the crime and the confrontation.\"                   Manson, 432 U.S. at\n\n114 (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199-200 (1972)); see\n\nalso    De    Jesus-Rios,     990    F.2d     at    677.     \"[I]t     is    only   in\n\nextraordinary      cases    that     identification         evidence    should      be\n\nwithheld from the jury.\"           United States v. Turner, 892 F.2d 11,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n       Although the admissibility of a witness identification is\n\na mixed question of law and fact, for the purposes of argument\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fonly, we indulge Woodward's argument that the district court's\n\ndetermination should be reviewed de novo.                  Even if we conclude\n\nthat error occurred, however, the jury's judgment remains intact\n\nif a review of the entire record persuades us that the error was\n\n\"'harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.'\" De Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d\n\nat 678 (citation omitted).\n\n       We   are    in     full   agreement     with    the      district    court's\n\ndetermination that the procedure was impermissibly suggestive.\n\nEven though Woodward was already in custody and could easily\n\nhave    been      taken     to    the   police      station      for    a   line-up\n\nidentification, he was singled out in handcuffs to Evans, who\n\nhad seen the other individuals he identified be arrested and who\n\nhad been told by police that they believed they had apprehended\n\nthe remaining robbers.             See, e.g., Velez v. Schmer, 724 F.2d\n\n249, 251 (1st Cir. 1984) (noting that \"[a] staged show-up is\n\npresumptively more suggestive than a line-up\" and concluding\n\nthat a show-up was improper when the police made suggestive\n\nremarks     and   could     have    waited     a   short   time    to   allow   the\n\norganization of a line-up).              We thus turn to the reliability\n\nprong of the analysis.\n\n       Woodward     argues       that   inaccuracies       in    Evans's    initial\n\ndescription of him render the show-up identification unreliable.\n\nWhen first interviewed at the Hometown Buffet, Evans described\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fWoodward as having a blond crew cut, although Evans apparently\n\nhad long blond hair at the back of his head and the hair at the\n\nfront of his head was described by Agent Cronin as brown.\n\nWoodward also emphasizes that Evans described Meola as dark-\n\nskinned, although Agent Cronin testified that she would not\n\ncharacterize him as such, and that Evans misidentified the make\n\nof the red car.         Finally, Woodward points out that although\n\nEvans testified at the suppression hearing that four men arrived\n\nat   the   Hometown    Buffet   in   the    Oldsmobile      and   Agent   Cronin\n\nconfirmed that he had so stated at the scene, a Peabody police\n\nofficer testified that Evans told him he saw three men exit the\n\nOldsmobile    but     the   fourth   was    waiting    in   the   red   vehicle.\n\nWoodward contends that the accuracy of the prior description is\n\nthe most important factor in assessing reliability and that the\n\ndiscrepancies here are therefore of great significance, relying\n\non Dispensa v. Lynaugh, 847 F.2d 211 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n      Contrary   to    Woodward's     argument,       accuracy    is    given   no\n\ngreater emphasis than the other factors relevant to reliability.\n\nWoodward's reliance on Dispensa is misplaced because there the\n\ncourt held only that, based on the particular facts before it,\n\nthe lack of accuracy in the witness's prior description was by\n\nfar the greatest indication that the out-of-court identification\n\nwas not reliable.           See id. at 220 (not only did the witness\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdescribe assailant as shorter and lighter than defendant, but\n\nalso did not include \"his             moustache, his general hirsuteness,\n\nand the striking tattoos\" in her description).               Furthermore, the\n\ndiscrepancies in Evans's descriptions are not sufficient to\n\ntaint the overall reliability of the identifications.                    As the\n\ndistrict court noted, Woodward was likely wearing a hooded\n\nsweatshirt similar to those Evans specifically reported seeing\n\non two of the other participants,2 which would have obscured\n\nEvans's view of the length of the hair on the back of Woodward's\n\nhead, which Evans correctly described as blond.                 In addition,\n\ndespite the fact that Evans mistook the red car, which was a\n\nDodge Stratus, for an Oldsmobile, he reported five of the six\n\ndigits on its license plate, and he also correctly identified\n\nthe black car as a Mustang GT.                Finally, although the Peabody\n\nofficer        testified   differently,        Evans's    statement     that   he\n\nobserved four men in the gray Oldsmobile as it pulled into the\n\nparking lot was substantiated by Agent Cronin's report.\n\n    Evans's physical descriptions of the four individuals, as\n\nleast     as     relayed   at   the    suppression       hearing,     admittedly\n\n\n\n\n    2At the suppression hearing, Evans testified that Woodward\ndid have a hooded sweatshirt on, with the hood up on his head\nduring part of the encounter, but this information was\napparently not in Agent Cronin's report of Evans's original\ndescription.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fcontained less detail than is ideal.3              Nevertheless, this court\n\nhas    upheld   the   admission    of    identifications       even     when   the\n\noriginal description contained minimal physical detail, see\n\nAllen v. Massachusetts, 926 F.2d 74, 81 (1st Cir. 1991) (only\n\ndescription witness apparently gave of suspect was that he was\n\na     black   man),   and   when   a     witness        provided   no   physical\n\ndescription     of    the   suspect     prior      to    the   identification,\n\nsee United States v. Watson, 76 F.3d 4, 7 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(witness provided no description of assailant but identified him\n\nwithin minutes of the assault); United States v. Drougas, 748\n\nF.2d 8, 28 (1st Cir. 1984) (witness did not provide any prior\n\ndescription but was co-conspirator with suspect).                  Furthermore,\n\nwe have allowed an identification when the witness's original\n\ndescription contained inaccuracies.             See Gullick v. Perrin, 669\n\nF.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1981) (description was reliable even though\n\nthe victim's initial description of her assailant included a\n\npatch of silver hair, which defendant did not have).\n\n       Moreover, other factors weigh in favor of reliability.\n\nAlthough Woodward contends that the incident at the Hometown\n\nBuffet happened very quickly, preventing Evans from having a\n\n\n\n       3\n     At the hearing, little information was elicited from Agent\nCronin as to the \"detailed descriptions\" of each of the four\nindividuals that Evans supposedly gave her at the Hometown\nBuffet.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fgood opportunity to observe the suspects, he admits that Evans's\n\ndegree of attention was very high.          Because the car in front of\n\nhim was in close proximity to the four suspects, Evans had a\n\ngood opportunity to observe the four men and his level of\n\nattention was heightened by their actions.            Evans also was very\n\ncertain    about   his    identifications.      He    interrupted   Agent\n\nCronin's explanation of the show-up process to exclaim that he\n\ncould identify Remington, who was standing on the sidewalk, and\n\nhe testified that the moment he saw Woodward, as Woodward walked\n\nbetween two cars towards him, he was positive that he recognized\n\nhim.    Finally, the time between Evans's observation of the four\n\nmen and his show-up identification of Remington and King was\n\nonly about two hours and of Woodward and Meola, approximately\n\nthree hours.       While we do not attach great weight to this\n\nfactor, two or three hours is not sufficiently extended to\n\ndetract    from    the    other   factors     indicating    reliability.\n\nSee Velez, 724 F.2d at 252 (concluding that most cases that\n\nplace substantial weight on this factor involved identifications\n\nmade within an hour of the crime and declining to place weight\n\non timing when the identification occurred more than nine hours\n\nafter    the   original   observation).       Thus,    although   Evans's\n\ndescription of Woodward was not completely accurate, the sum of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe reliability factors leads us to conclude that the court did\n\nnot err in admitting Evans's show-up identification of Woodward.\n\n    Furthermore, even if the court did err in admitting the\n\nshow-up    identification,     the    error    was   harmless    given    the\n\nabundance of other evidence confirming Woodward's guilt.                  See\n\nClark v.    Moran, 942 F.2d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1991)                 (\"In the\n\npractical application of this standard, courts have found error\n\nto be harmless when the untainted evidence, standing alone,\n\nprovided 'overwhelming evidence' of the defendant's guilt.\").\n\nCooperating defendant Meola testified that all four defendants\n\nmet several times during the week before the robbery to plan it,\n\nthat Woodward had helped to count the stolen funds, and that he\n\nhelped to hide the money before surrendering to police.             Meola's\n\nformer girlfriend testified that all four defendants entered her\n\nhouse at the same time on June 23, 1998, and announced that they\n\nhad just committed a robbery.        She and Meola both testified that\n\nWoodward helped them to hide the money in a bedroom closet in\n\nthe house on Alice Avenue.\n\n    B. Sentencing\n\n    Both Woodward and King contend that the court erred by\n\nincreasing their base offense levels by two pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B3.1(b)(3)(A), based on the bodily injury sustained by a bank\n\nteller    who   was   pushed   to    the    ground   by   King   during   the\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcommission of the robbery.           \"Bodily injury\" is defined by the\n\nguidelines as \"any significant injury; e.g., an injury that is\n\npainful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention\n\nordinarily would be sought.\"           U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 cmt. 1(b).        The\n\ndistrict court's determination that bodily injury was sustained\n\nis a factual finding that we review for clear error.              See United\n\nStates v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir. 1997) (factual\n\nfindings must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nand are reviewed for clear error); United States v. Isaacs, 947\n\nF.2d 112, 114-15 (4th Cir. 1991) (whether bodily injury occurred\n\nis factual question).\n\n       Here, the court relied on facts contained in the presentence\n\nreport, see United States v. Skrodzki, 9 F.3d 198, 202 (1st Cir.\n\n1993), such as that the teller suffered a welt as well as\n\nwhiplash from being struck by King during the robbery. 4                  The\n\npresentence report also stated that the teller sought medical\n\ntreatment at the hospital following the incident and that she\n\nwas unable to return to work for one month due to pain and\n\nheadaches.        Furthermore, the medical records in evidence assert\n\nthat       the   teller   was   diagnosed    with   cervical   strain   and   a\n\n\n\n       4\n     Although the presentence report indicated that the teller\nhad been struck with a gun, the district court did not believe\nthat a gun had been used, but found that King had pushed her to\nthe ground and caused her injury.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fcontusion on her scalp, for which she was fitted with a cervical\n\ncollar and placed on a regimen of Motrin.   In short, the court's\n\nfinding that King caused bodily injury during the commission of\n\nthe robbery was not clearly erroneous.\n\n    Defendants'   remaining   contentions   are   without   merit.\n\nBecause we conclude that the court did not err in any of the\n\nrespects alleged by defendants, we affirm the convictions and\n\nsentences.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f",

Defendants Patrick King and\n\nJay Woodward appeal their bank robbery convictions, arguing,\n\ninter alia, that witness identifications of them should have\n\nbeen excluded from evidence at trial and that the court erred by\n\nenhancing their sentences based on the bodily injury caused to\n\na teller.     Finding no error in the court's admission of the\n\nidentifications and no merit in defendants' other contentions,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n       A Fleet Bank in Peabody, Massachusetts, was robbed at\n\ngunpoint on the morning of June 23, 1998, at approximately 11:30\n\na.m.   A few minutes later, truck driver Gary Evans observed four\n\ndarkly dressed men, two of whom were transferring leather bags\n\nfrom   one   car   to   another,   in   the    parking   lot   of   a   nearby\n\nrestaurant.\n\n       The following facts are derived from testimony given at a\n\nhearing on Woodward's motion to suppress Evans's identification\n\nof him as one of the four men.          Evans was pulling into the rear\n\nparking lot of the Hometown Buffet restaurant to make a delivery\n\nwhen he was cut off by a gray Oldsmobile.                 Evans, angered,\n\nyelled at the car's driver as the car raced around him and\n\npulled to a stop in front of him, near a parked black Mustang BT\n\nand a red vehicle.       Evans proceeded to park his truck to make\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fhis delivery and observed two men exit the car and load leather\n\nbags from the gray Oldsmobile into the trunk of the Mustang\n\nbefore speeding off in the Mustang.           The front seat passenger of\n\nthe   Oldsmobile   then    got   out    and   showed   Evans   that   he   was\n\ncarrying a gun before leaving the scene in the red car with the\n\nfourth individual.        Evans asked restaurant employees to phone\n\nthe police.\n\n      After being interviewed by local police and FBI Agent\n\nMargaret Cronin, Evans was taken by police car to Chestnut\n\nStreet in Lynn to view two of the suspects.             When pulling onto\n\nthe street, Evans saw the red car he had seen at the restaurant,\n\nand at approximately 1:20 p.m. Evans identified Remington as he\n\nstood on the sidewalk and then King, also standing on the\n\nsidewalk with police.       After making the identifications, Evans\n\nobserved Remington and King being arrested and taken away in\n\npolice cruisers and the red car being searched and then towed\n\naway.\n\n      Evans was then escorted, this time by Agent Cronin, to Alice\n\nAvenue.   On the way to Alice Avenue, Evans was told by Cronin\n\nthat police believed they had apprehended the remaining two\n\nindividuals and that Evans needed to identify them if he could.\n\nThe street was blocked off, multiple police cars were present,\n\nand bystanders were trying to observe the situation.                   Evans\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fobserved the black Mustang before he was asked to view anyone.\n\nAt approximately 2:25 p.m., Evans confirmed that Meola, who was\n\npresented in handcuffs and escorted by police officers into the\n\nmiddle of the street, was one of the individuals present at the\n\nHometown Buffet.   Finally, Evans identified Woodward, who was\n\nalso escorted into the street in handcuffs by police.\n\n    Woodward    filed   a   motion   seeking   to   suppress   Evans's\n\nidentification of him on the ground that it was so suggestive\n\nand unreliable that its admission into evidence would violate\n\nhis due process rights.1      The district court agreed that the\n\nidentification was impermissibly suggestive, but held that it\n\nwas sufficiently reliable to be admitted.        Woodward renews his\n\nchallenge on appeal.    Both appellants also challenge the court's\n\nfinding that bodily injury was caused to a teller during the\n\nrobbery   and   make    various   claims     regarding   the   court's\n\ninstructions to the jury and its sentencing determinations.\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\n    A.    Identification\n\n\n\n\n    1Although King challenges the admission of his show-up\nidentification on appeal, he neither joined in Woodward's motion\nto suppress below nor presented evidence at the suppression\nhearing and thus has not preserved his argument.

We thus turn to the reliability\n\nprong of the analysis.\n\n       Woodward     argues       that   inaccuracies       in    Evans's    initial\n\ndescription of him render the show-up identification unreliable.\n\nWhen first interviewed at the Hometown Buffet, Evans described\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fWoodward as having a blond crew cut, although Evans apparently\n\nhad long blond hair at the back of his head and the hair at the\n\nfront of his head was described by Agent Cronin as brown.\n\nWoodward also emphasizes that Evans described Meola as dark-\n\nskinned, although Agent Cronin testified that she would not\n\ncharacterize him as such, and that Evans misidentified the make\n\nof the red car.         Finally, Woodward points out that although\n\nEvans testified at the suppression hearing that four men arrived\n\nat   the   Hometown    Buffet   in   the    Oldsmobile      and   Agent   Cronin\n\nconfirmed that he had so stated at the scene, a Peabody police\n\nofficer testified that Evans told him he saw three men exit the\n\nOldsmobile    but     the   fourth   was    waiting    in   the   red   vehicle.\n\nWoodward contends that the accuracy of the prior description is\n\nthe most important factor in assessing reliability and that the\n\ndiscrepancies here are therefore of great significance, relying\n\non Dispensa v. Lynaugh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(5th Cir. 1998).\n\n      Contrary   to    Woodward's     argument,       accuracy    is    given   no\n\ngreater emphasis than the other factors relevant to reliability.\n\nWoodward's reliance on Dispensa is misplaced because there the\n\ncourt held only that, based on the particular facts before it,\n\nthe lack of accuracy in the witness's prior description was by\n\nfar the greatest indication that the out-of-court identification\n\nwas not reliable.           See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 220 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(not only did the witness\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdescribe assailant as shorter and lighter than defendant, but\n\nalso did not include \"his             moustache, his general hirsuteness,\n\nand the striking tattoos\" in her description).               Furthermore, the\n\ndiscrepancies in Evans's descriptions are not sufficient to\n\ntaint the overall reliability of the identifications.                    As the\n\ndistrict court noted, Woodward was likely wearing a hooded\n\nsweatshirt similar to those Evans specifically reported seeing\n\non two of the other participants,2 which would have obscured\n\nEvans's view of the length of the hair on the back of Woodward's\n\nhead, which Evans correctly described as blond.                 In addition,\n\ndespite the fact that Evans mistook the red car, which was a\n\nDodge Stratus, for an Oldsmobile, he reported five of the six\n\ndigits on its license plate, and he also correctly identified\n\nthe black car as a Mustang GT.                Finally, although the Peabody\n\nofficer        testified   differently,        Evans's    statement     that   he\n\nobserved four men in the gray Oldsmobile as it pulled into the\n\nparking lot was substantiated by Agent Cronin's report.\n\n    Evans's physical descriptions of the four individuals, as\n\nleast     as     relayed   at   the    suppression       hearing,     admittedly\n\n\n\n\n    2At the suppression hearing, Evans testified that Woodward\ndid have a hooded sweatshirt on, with the hood up on his head\nduring part of the encounter, but this information was\napparently not in Agent Cronin's report of Evans's original\ndescription.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fcontained less detail than is ideal.3              Nevertheless, this court\n\nhas    upheld   the   admission    of    identifications       even     when   the\n\noriginal description contained minimal physical detail, see\n\nAllen v.

Because the car in front of\n\nhim was in close proximity to the four suspects, Evans had a\n\ngood opportunity to observe the four men and his level of\n\nattention was heightened by their actions.            Evans also was very\n\ncertain    about   his    identifications.      He    interrupted   Agent\n\nCronin's explanation of the show-up process to exclaim that he\n\ncould identify Remington, who was standing on the sidewalk, and\n\nhe testified that the moment he saw Woodward, as Woodward walked\n\nbetween two cars towards him, he was positive that he recognized\n\nhim.    Finally, the time between Evans's observation of the four\n\nmen and his show-up identification of Remington and King was\n\nonly about two hours and of Woodward and Meola, approximately\n\nthree hours.       While we do not attach great weight to this\n\nfactor, two or three hours is not sufficiently extended to\n\ndetract    from    the    other   factors     indicating    reliability.\n\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429386\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Velez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/429386/jose-enrique-casiano-velez-v-jose-schmer-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">252</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(concluding that most cases that\n\nplace substantial weight on this factor involved identifications\n\nmade within an hour of the crime and declining to place weight\n\non timing when the identification occurred more than nine hours\n\nafter    the   original   observation).       Thus,    although   Evans's\n\ndescription of Woodward was not completely accurate, the sum of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe reliability factors leads us to conclude that the court did\n\nnot err in admitting Evans's show-up identification of Woodward.\n\n    Furthermore, even if the court did err in admitting the\n\nshow-up    identification,     the    error    was   harmless    given    the\n\nabundance of other evidence confirming Woodward's guilt.
