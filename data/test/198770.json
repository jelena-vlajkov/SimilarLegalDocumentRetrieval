Morris E. Lasker,* Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Dana A. Curhan for appellant.\r\n   Annette C. Benedetto, Assistant Attorney General, Commonwealth\r\nof Massachusetts, with whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and\r\nKenneth E. Steinfield, Assistant Attorney General, were on brief,\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nJanuary 11, 2000\r\n\n          \r\n*Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.  SELYA, Circuit Judge.  Invoking our habeas corpus\r\njurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C.  2241-2254, petitioner-appellant\r\nMichael T. Mims invites us to set aside his state court conviction\r\nfor murder in the first degree.  Like the district court, we\r\ndecline the invitation.\r\nFor the nonce, it suffices to say that after the brutally\r\nmistreated body of Belinda Miscioscia was discovered in an alley in\r\nChelsea, Massachusetts, on June 27, 1993, the authorities charged\r\nMims and a compatriot, Michael Cowels, with her slaying.  A jury\r\nfound each of them guilty of first-degree murder, and the\r\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed their\r\nconvictions.  See Commonwealth v. Cowels, 680 N.E.2d 924 (Mass.\r\n1997).  The petitioner then filed an application for habeas relief\r\nin the federal district court, but to no avail.  See Mims v.\r\nDiPaolo, No. 98-CV-11203-MEL (D. Mass. Apr. 1, 1999) (unpublished\r\nmem. op.).  The district court did, however, grant a certificate of\r\nappealability.  See 28 U.S.C.  2253(c); Fed. R. App. P. 22(b); see\r\nalso Grant-Chase v. Commissioner, N.H. Dep't of Corrections, 145\r\nF.3d 431, 435 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nOn appeal, the petitioner asseverates that (1) the\r\nevidence against him was inadequate to permit a jury to convict\r\nhim, and (2) certain statements made by the prosecutor during\r\nclosing argument deprived him of a fair trial.  Mindful of the\r\nlimits that attach to the federal courts' power to review state\r\nconvictions in habeas proceedings, see, e.g., O'Brien v. Dubois,\r\n145 F.3d 16, 20-25 (1st Cir. 1998), the petitioner wraps both\r\nasseverations in the trappings of due process.\r\nThe facts of the case have been canvassed methodically by\r\nthe SJC, and we refer the reader who thirsts for greater detail to\r\nthat court's lucid opinion.  See Cowels, 680 N.E.2d at 926-28. \r\nUnder current law (applicable to this case), our review of habeas\r\npetitions brought by state prisoners is governed by the\r\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\r\nU.S.C.  2254(d).  The AEDPA significantly alters the treatment of\r\nsuch petitions.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 20-25.  Among other\r\nthings, it brings the state court's decision to center stage and\r\nrequires the performance of a bifurcated analysis.  See id. at 20. \r\nFirst, the reviewing (federal) court must ask whether the United\r\nStates Supreme Court has prescribed a rule that governs the\r\npetitioner's claim and, if so, whether the state court decision is\r\ncontrary to that rule.  If such a rule exists, and if the state\r\ncourt decision contravenes it, relief may be granted.  If, however,\r\nthe state court correctly apprehended the rule (or, alternatively,\r\ncorrectly apprehended the absence of a governing rule), the habeas\r\ncourt proceeds to the second step of the analysis and determines\r\nwhether the state court's resolution resulted in an unreasonable\r\napplication of existing Supreme Court case law.  See id. at 24.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we turn initially to the\r\npetitioner's insufficiency-of-evidence claim.  The parties agree,\r\nas they must, that a landmark Supreme Court precedent directly\r\ngoverns this aspect of the case.  See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\r\n307 (1979).  The core holding of Jackson is that the Due Process\r\nClause precludes a valid criminal conviction unless the evidence\r\nadmitted at trial, taken as a whole and interpreted in the light\r\nmost favorable to the prosecution, suffices to permit a rational\r\ntrier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.  See id. at 319.  Because the SJC identified and articulated\r\nthis tenet, see Cowels, 680 N.E.2d at 929 &amp; n.6 (citing\r\nCommonwealth v. Latimore, 393 N.E.2d 370, 374 (Mass. 1979), and\r\nnoting that it incorporates the Jackson criterion), we move to the\r\nsecond tier of the AEDPA test.\r\nThe petitioner argues vociferously that although the SJC\r\npaid lip service to the Jackson standard, it unreasonably\r\n(mis)applied that standard.  Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, his\r\nargument boils down to the assertion that, even after taking the\r\nevidence in the aspect most congenial to the prosecution and\r\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, no responsible jury\r\ncould have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nInasmuch as the district court already has addressed\r\n(and, in our view, successfully rebutted) this same assertion, we\r\nneed not tarry.  The short of it is that the SJC's careful analysis\r\nof the evidence belies the petitioner's argument.  See id. at 928-\r\n29.  As that court noted, multiple witnesses placed Mims and Cowels\r\nin the decedent's company on the night of her murder; indeed, they\r\nwere the last people seen with her.  The evidence further\r\nestablished that Mims and Cowels each had a prior sexual\r\nrelationship with the decedent; that she had voiced fears about\r\nbeing with them; that both Mims and Cowels attempted to dispose of\r\nclothing which they had been wearing on the night in question; and\r\nthat each of them lied to the police when questioned about their\r\nactivities.  The jury also heard testimony that Mims and Cowels\r\nthreatened others in what reasonably could be construed as a\r\nconcerted effort to procure the silence of prospective witnesses. \r\nLast   but far from least   a percipient witness testified that, on\r\nthe night of the slaying, Cowels, in the petitioner's presence and\r\nwithin his earshot, declared that \"we killed her\"   and the\r\npetitioner offered no disclaimer.\r\nWe think that this evidence more than suffices to allow\r\na rational finder of fact to deem the petitioner's guilt proven\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, and thus to ground the petitioner's\r\nconviction under Jackson.  That this case arises on habeas review\r\ncinches the matter.  After all, under the AEDPA, the key question\r\nis not whether we, if sitting as a jury or as a court of first\r\ninstance, would conclude that the Commonwealth had proved its case,\r\nbut, rather, whether the state court decision is \"so offensive to\r\nexisting precedent, so devoid of record support, or so arbitrary,\r\nas to indicate that it is outside the universe of plausible,\r\ncredible outcomes.\"  O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25; accord Vieux v. Pepe,\r\n184 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir. 1999), petition for cert. filed,    \r\nU.S.L.W.     (U.S. Oct. 18, 1999) (No. 99-6629); Bui v. DiPaolo,\r\n170 F.3d 232, 243 (1st Cir. 1999), petition for cert. filed,    \r\nU.S.L.W.     (U.S. June 14, 1999) (No. 98-9840).  Given this\r\nexpansive framework, the state court decision easily passes muster.\r\nThe petitioner's second asseveration likewise lacks\r\nforce.  He maintains that the prosecutor's summation was so\r\nimproper and injurious that it violated his right to due process,\r\nand that the state court's refusal to recognize that verity\r\nconstituted an unreasonable application of federal law.\r\nThis is one of those context-contingent situations in\r\nwhich it cannot fairly be said that the case is controlled by a\r\nclosely analogous Supreme Court precedent.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d\r\nat 24-25 (discussing, in general terms, what is needed to bring the\r\nfirst prong of the AEDPA analysis to bear).  In the absence of\r\nexplicit Supreme Court guidance, we proceed to the second tier of\r\nthe AEDPA test and ask whether the SJC's rejection of the\r\npetitioner's \"improper summation\" plaint constituted an\r\nunreasonable application of general principles of federal\r\nconstitutional law as articulated by the Supreme Court.\r\nThe SJC noted in its opinion that the prosecutor had gone\r\ntoo far and had impermissibly appealed to emotion in his closing\r\nargument.  See Cowels, 680 N.E.2d at 930.  For example, the\r\nprosecutor described the decedent's screams (despite the utter\r\nabsence of any evidence to that effect) and repeated numerous\r\ntimes, for no discernibly valid purpose, testimony that the\r\npetitioner had called the victim vile names.  See id.  On habeas\r\nreview, however, it is not enough for the petitioner to show that\r\nan error occurred; he must show that the error was of\r\nconstitutional magnitude.  See Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168,\r\n181 (1986); Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1204 (1st Cir. 1987). \r\nHe also must show that the state court's treatment of the error\r\nresulted in an unreasonable application of federal constitutional\r\nlaw as articulated by the Supreme Court.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at\r\n24.  While it is theoretically possible for a prosecutor's closing\r\nargument to go so far afield as to threaten due process, see, e.g.,\r\nShurn v. Delo, 177 F.3d 662, 667 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S.\r\nCt. 510 (1999);  Mahorney v. Wallman, 917 F.2d 469, 473-74 (10th\r\nCir. 1990), no such constitutional infirmity looms here,\r\nnotwithstanding  the excesses in which the prosecutor needlessly\r\nindulged.  See James v. Bowersox, 187 F.3d 866, 869-70 (8th Cir.\r\n1999) (holding that state prosecutor's reference to petitioner as\r\n\"slime\" during closing argument did not sink to the level of a due\r\nprocess violation), petition for cert. filed,     U.S.L.W.    \r\n(U.S. Dec. 15, 1999) (NO. 99-7516); Duvall v. Reynolds, 139 F.3d\r\n768, 794-95 (10th Cir.) (holding that state prosecutor's comments\r\nduring final argument, though plainly improper, did not render\r\npetitioner's trial fundamentally unfair), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct.\r\n345 (1998); see also Amirault v. Fair, 968 F.2d 1404, 1406 (1st\r\nCir. 1992).  Consequently, we hold that the SJC's reasoned\r\nresolution of the \"improper summation\" charge not only gave the\r\npetitioner all the process that was due, but also accorded with the\r\nrigors of clearly established federal constitutional law.\r\nWe need go no further.  Simply put, the petitioner cannot\r\ncome close to clearing the AEDPA hurdle.  For aught that appears,\r\nMims was fairly tried and justly convicted.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court did not err in rejecting his application for a writ\r\nof habeas corpus.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cowels,</span> <span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">930</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  For example, the\r\nprosecutor described the decedent's screams (despite the utter\r\nabsence of any evidence to that effect) and repeated numerous\r\ntimes, for no discernibly valid purpose, testimony that the\r\npetitioner had called the victim vile names.  See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  On habeas\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">\nreview, however, it is not enough for the petitioner to show that\r\nan error occurred; he must show that the error was of\r\nconstitutional magnitude.  See Darden v. Wainwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111717\"><a href=\"/opinion/111717/darden-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n181 (1986); Puleio v.

See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Brien,</span> <span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at\r\n<span class=\"page\">24</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  While it is theoretically possible for a prosecutor's closing\r\nargument to go so far afield as to threaten due process, see, e.g.,\r\nShurn v. Delo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764188\"><a href=\"/opinion/764188/daryl-shurn-v-paul-delo-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S.\r\nCt. 510 (1999);  Mahorney v.

See James v. Bowersox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765679\"><a href=\"/opinion/765679/steffano-james-v-michael-bowersox/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 869-70 (8th Cir.\r\n1999) (holding that state prosecutor's reference to petitioner as\r\n\"slime\" during closing argument did not sink to the level of a due\r\nprocess violation), petition for cert. filed,     U.S.L.W.    \r\n(U.S. Dec. 15, 1999) (NO. 99-7516); Duvall v.

Consequently, we hold that the SJC's reasoned\r\nresolution of the \"improper summation\" charge not only gave the\r\npetitioner all the process that was due, but also accorded with the\r\nrigors of clearly established federal constitutional law.\r\nWe need go no further.  Simply put, the petitioner cannot\r\ncome close to clearing the AEDPA hurdle.  For aught that appears,\r\nMims was fairly tried and justly convicted.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court did not err in rejecting his application for a writ\r\nof habeas corpus.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
