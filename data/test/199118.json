THURSTON,\n\n                     Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n          WILLIAM J. HENDERSON, POSTMASTER GENERAL,\n                UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n         [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Curtis Webber, with whom Linnell, Choate & Webber, LLP were\non brief, for appellant.\n     Anna V. Crawford, Attorney, with whom Thomas Marshall,\nManaging Counsel, Andrew L. Freeman, Deputy Managing Counsel,\nDavid R. Collins, Assistant United States Attorney, and Jay P.\nMcCloskey, United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\f                        October 5, 2000\n\n\n          Per Curiam.    Plaintiff Michael Thurston appeals\n\nfrom the grant of summary judgment in his harassment claim\n\nbrought against defendant William J. Henderson, Postmaster\n\nGeneral, pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 791 and 794.      After a thorough review of the\n\nrecord   and   the    Plaintiff’s   submissions,     we   affirm\n\nsubstantially for the reasons recited by the district court\n\nin its order dated March 8, 2000.      See Mullin v. Raytheon\n\nCo., 164 F.3d 696, 699 (1st Cir. 1999) (appellate courts\n\nneed not wax longiloquent when a district court has resolved\n\na claim correctly and explained its rationale in a well-\n\nreasoned rescript).\n\n          We add only the following.      Thurston contends that\n\nthe district court erred in failing to consider the 1996\n\ntime-barred incidents as relevant background evidence of\n\nworkplace harassment.    Although it is true that time-barred\n\nevents may be considered as relevant background evidence,\n\nthese occurrences cannot be used as a substitute for proof\n\nof actual harassment during the limitations period.          See\n\nUnited Airlines Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977);\n\n\n                              -2-\n                               2\n\fMorrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 108 F.3d 429, 439\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).          Thus, Thurston first was required to\n\nadduce proof that a hostile work environment existed during\n\nthe relevant period.         As the district court painstakingly\n\nexplained, and as we note below, he has failed to do so.\n\n            Thurston also argues that the district court erred\n\nby failing to consider a meeting that occurred subsequent to\n\nhis July 1997 return to the Auburn Post Office.                Thurston\n\nasserts     that   the    fact   that   the    meeting     produced   no\n\nimprovement in his working environment demonstrates that,\n\nalthough the Postal Service was aware of the harassment that\n\noccurred in 1996, it did nothing thereafter to fulfill its\n\nobligation to take prompt and effective steps to end the\n\nimproper conduct.        This argument is meritless because, while\n\nfailure by an employer to take remedial steps may constitute\n\nimproper behavior subjecting it to liability, that failure\n\nis not itself harassment.         See Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy,\n\n145 F.3d 5, 15 (1st Cir. 1998).                The Postal Service’s\n\nresponse,     or   lack     thereof,    to    Thurston’s     complaints\n\nregarding the 1996 incidents of harassment does not bear on\n\nwhether Thurston was exposed to a hostile work environment\n\nbased upon his disability in 1997 and 1998.\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n                                   3\n\f            Finally, Thurston contends that the district court\n\nerroneously excluded on hearsay grounds Thurston’s statement\n\nthat Paul Lauziere filed a false grievance on Thurston’s\n\nbehalf. But even if the district court improperly failed to\n\nconsider    this   evidence,     Thurston’s     showing     is   still\n\ninadequate to establish a hostile work environment as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n            In sum, we agree with the district court that\n\nThurston has not offered sufficient evidence to permit a\n\nreasonable jury to find that the harassment during the\n\nrelevant period was sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nalter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive\n\nworking    environment.   See    Oncole    v.   Sundowner    Offshore\n\nServs., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1999); Harris v. Forklift Sys.,\n\nInc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).      The Supreme Court directs us\n\n“to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile\n\nor abusive by looking at all of the circumstances, including\n\nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity;\n\nwhether it is physically threatening and humiliating, or a\n\nmere   offensive    utterance;     and    whether   it    reasonably\n\ninterferes with an employee’s work performance.”             Faragher\n\nv. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 778 (1998); see also\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 23. And because Thurston has failed to\n\n                                 -4-\n                                  4\n\fshow that the alleged harassment constituted an unreasonably\n\nabusive or offensive work environment, it is unnecessary for\n\nus   to   determine    whether   the   Postmaster   General   took\n\nreasonable steps to remedy the conduct of which it was\n\naware.    See DeGrace v. Rumsfeld, 614 F.2d 796, 805 (1st Cir.\n\n1980).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n                                  5\n\f",
