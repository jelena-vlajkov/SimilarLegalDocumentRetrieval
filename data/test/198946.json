EDWARDS, JR.,\n\n                     Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n   STEPHEN BROWN; HAROLD F. PEARSON, III; WILLIAM R. GORDON;\nTHOMAS\n    L.

Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     A.G. Edwards, Jr. on brief pro se.\n     John G. Fabiano, G. Perry Wu, and Hale and Dorr LLP on brief\nfor defendants Stephen Brown, William R. Gordon, and the Estate\nof John G. McElwee.\n     William C. Saturley and Nelson, Kinder, Mosseau, & Saturley,\nPC on brief for defendants Prince A. Hawkins and the Firm of\nHawkins, Rhodes & Sharp.\n\f                         MAY 18, 2000\n\n\n\n\n         Per   Curiam.     We   have   carefully   reviewed   the\n\nparties' briefs and the record and affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court that res judicata bars the current action\n\nfor essentially the reasons stated in the court's Memorandum\n\nand Order, dated July 21, 1999.    We only add that we find no\n\nmerit to appellant's contentions that the district court\n\njudge (1) erred by not treating him leniently since he was\n\nproceeding pro se, (2) was biased against him because of his\n\npro se status and Native-American ancestry, and (3) delayed\n\nin processing his complaint due to the district judge's\n\ninvolvement in planning the new courthouse.\n\n         Affirmed.   See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                             -2-\n\f",
