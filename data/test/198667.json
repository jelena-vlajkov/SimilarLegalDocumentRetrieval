Ziady, and Riemer &amp;\r\nBraunstein LLP on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                      October 4, 1999\r\n                                           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. The question presented is whether\r\na debtor under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code may claim more than\r\n$15,000 in exemption for payment received on account of personal\r\nbodily injury under 11 U.S.C.  522(d)(11)(D). We hold that a\r\ndebtor may not.\r\nLee C. Christo filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy\r\nunder Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 22, 1997. In her\r\nSchedule C, she claimed three exemptions for three personal injury\r\nclaims stemming from three separate pre-petition accidents.\r\nChristo's personal injury claims had not yet been settled; she\r\nsought potential exemptions of $15,000 for each of the three\r\npersonal injury claims, for a total potential exemption of $45,000.\r\nThe trustee filed a \"Limited Objection to Claim of Exemption\" with\r\nrespect to the three tort claims on the grounds that no value was\r\nlisted. The bankruptcy court sustained the objection, continued the\r\nmatter generally, and directed Christo to file amended schedules of\r\nexemptions. Christo then filed a \"Motion for Determination of\r\nValidity of Exemptions and Consequent Denial of Trustee's Limited\r\nObjection to Claims of Exemption.\" In response, the trustee argued\r\nthat, under 11 U.S.C.  522(d)(11)(D), Christo was entitled only to\r\na total exemption of $15,000 for all her personal injury claims.\r\nThe Bankruptcy Court found for the trustee, and the Bankruptcy\r\nAppellate Panel (BAP) affirmed. See In re Christo, 228 B.R. 48, 53\r\n(B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1999). \r\nThe interpretation of  522(d)(11)(D) of the Bankruptcy\r\nCode is a legal question, which we review de novo. See In re\r\nLamanna, 153 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998). Section 522(d)(11)(D) of\r\nthe Code states: \r\n  d) The following property may be exempted under\r\nsubsection (b)(1) of this section: . . . (11) The\r\ndebtor's right to receive, or property that is traceable\r\nto-- . . . (D) a payment, not to exceed $15,000, on\r\naccount of personal bodily injury, not including pain and\r\nsuffering or compensation for actual pecuniary loss, of\r\nthe debtor or an individual of whom the debtor is a\r\ndependent . . . .\r\n\n11 U.S.C.  522(d)(11)(D).\r\nChristo, relying on the arguments set forth in In re\r\nMarcus, 172 B.R. 502 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1994), contends that a debtor\r\nis entitled, under  522(d)(11)(D), to multiple exemptions for\r\npersonal injury judgments or settlements. See also In re Anderson,\r\n932 P.2d 1110, 1113-14 (Okla. 1996) (relying on Marcus to interpret\r\nan analogous provision of the Oklahoma Code). She argues that\r\n522(d)(11)(D) is not plain on its face and, thus, should be\r\ninterpreted within the context of the entire exemption scheme of\r\n522(d) and the legislative history of the statute. That scheme\r\nand history, she argues, support a reading that permits as many\r\n$15,000 exemptions as there are personal injury claims. She notes\r\nthat exemptions allowed under subsections (1), (3), (4), (5), (6),\r\nand (8) of  522(d) all refer to the \"aggregate\" interest that may\r\nbe exempted, while subsection (11) does not. When Congress intended\r\nto specify a limit to the total number of exemptions under a\r\nspecific category, she concludes, it made its view clear. Congress\r\nmade no such specification in subsection (11)(D) and, therefore,\r\nnone can be presumed. Christo also points to a note to the\r\nprecursor provision to  522(d)(11)(D) in the Report of the\r\nCommission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Doc.\r\nNo. 93-137, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), which states that the\r\nvalue of personal injury exemptions \"is not limited.\" Since the\r\nHouse Report on the final bill did not explicitly reject this note,\r\nshe contends that we should adopt the Commission Report's view in\r\nour interpretation of the statute. Finally, she points to the\r\npolicy of liberally construing exemptions in favor of the debtor.\r\nThe trustee, espousing the view taken in In re Rhodes,\r\n147 B.R. 443, 444-45 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1992) (interpreting an\r\nanalogous provision of the Illinois Code), argues that the language\r\nof the statute is clear, the statutory scheme contradicts Christo's\r\nclaim, and that to hold otherwise would lead to nonsensical\r\nresults. The trustee points out that  522(d)(11)(D) refers to \"a\r\npayment, not to exceed $15,000, on account of personal bodily\r\ninjury,\" 11 U.S.C.  522(d)(11)(D) (emphasis added), and does not\r\nuse language such as \"payment, not to exceed $15,000, on account of\r\neach instance of personal bodily injury.\" Furthermore, the trustee\r\nargues,  522(d) distinguishes exempted property from non-exempted\r\nproperty by type and not number. While certain subsections do refer\r\nto \"aggregate\" interests (e.g., subsections (1) (real property),\r\n(3) (household furnishings), and (4) (jewelry)) and subsection (2)\r\ndoes limit the exemption to \"one\" motor vehicle, the trustee notes\r\nthat it is easy to see how Congress anticipated multiple properties\r\nand so multiple claims in these areas but did not do so in the\r\ncontext of personal bodily injuries. Finally, the trustee argues\r\nthat Christo's reading of the statute would result in inequity\r\nbecause it would treat similarly situated debtors differently.\r\nThe BAP agreed with the trustee's interpretation in an\r\nopinion examining text, context, and legislative history. We\r\naffirm, largely adopt the BAP's opinion, and outline briefly our\r\nreasons. First, the language of the exemption in 11 U.S.C.\r\n522(d)(11)(D) refers to \"a payment.\" While there is some\r\nambiguity, the more natural reading is that there is a single\r\nexemption. Second, the overall scheme of exemptions in  522(d)(11)\r\ndisplays a pattern of allowing one exemption per category. Third,\r\nthe purpose of exemptions is to provide support for the debtors at\r\na reasonably necessary level. The reasonably necessary level should\r\nnot, logically, vary to provide more in total exemption amount to\r\nsomeone who is in three minor accidents than one who is in a single\r\ncatastrophic accident. That is particularly so given that there are\r\nthe exemptions in  522(d)(10)(A) and (C) for social security and\r\ndisability benefits. That is, the exemption for \"a payment in\r\naccount of personal bodily injury\" is not a proxy for degree of\r\ndisability. Fourth, the reading of the exemption as limited to one\r\n$15,000 exemption more equitably treats similarly situated debtors.\r\nAs the BAP states, \"[t]he purpose of the statute . . . is\r\nserved by limiting it to one exemption, regardless of the number of\r\nincidents of bodily injury, because the determination of what is\r\n'reasonably necessary' to support the debtor should not hinge on\r\nthe number of injuries suffered.\" Christo, 228 B.R. at 52-53. If\r\nthe statute were read as Christo suggests, Debtor A who sustained\r\na single $45,000 personal injury would receive only a $15,000\r\nexemption, while Debtor B who sustained three separate injuries of\r\n$15,000 each, totaling $45,000, would receive a $45,000 exemption.\r\nThe \"value\" of the personal injury claims to Debtors A and B would\r\nbe the same but the exemptions allowed to each of them would be\r\nwildly different. Certainly it is possible that multiple incidents\r\nof personal bodily injuries might be more severe, and require more\r\nsupport, than a single incident, but, as the BAP pointed out, see\r\nid. at 53, that will not necessarily be so. More importantly,\r\n\"Congress set a cap of $15,000.00 to be exempted on account of\r\nbodily injury, and there is no indication that amount should be\r\nmultiplied depending on an individual debtor's situation.\" Id.\r\nThough we acknowledge the default rule that courts should\r\nconstrue the Bankruptcy Code's exemptions \"liberally to reflect\r\ntheir remedial purposes,\" In re Caron, 82 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir.\r\n1996), we also recognize that, in certain situations, there are\r\nreasons \"to afford a more narrow reading,\" id. In other words, a\r\ntext's possible ambiguity does not preclude further inquiry into\r\nwhich interpretation better coincides with the Code's purposes.\r\nSuch an inquiry might include reviewing a particular provision's\r\nlegislative history (as in Caron) or logic. This evaluation may\r\nconfirm a construction that is in a debtor's favor. There are\r\ntimes, however, when, as here, a contrary conclusion is warranted.\r\nWe agree with the BAP \"that the phrase 'on account of\r\npersonal bodily injury' should be interpreted as defining the\r\nnature of the payment that is exempt and not the number of injuries\r\nsuffered.\" Id. at 53. Consequently, a Chapter 7 debtor is entitled\r\nto one exemption of no more than $15,000 on account of personal\r\ninjury, regardless of the number of injuries involved. We affirm.\r\n\n                    - Dissent Follows -\r\nJOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting. I\r\nrespectfully dissent. It is by no means clear that Congress meant\r\nsection 522(d)(11)(D) to exempt only one payment on account of\r\nbodily injury and we should resolve the ambiguity in favor of\r\nallowing exemptions, not excluding them.\r\nThe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel relied on a case\r\ninterpreting a distinguishable Illinois statute, In re Rhodes, 147\r\nB.R. 443 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1992), and rejected the case\r\ninterpreting section 522(d)(11)(D), In re Marcus, 172 B.R. 502\r\n(Bankr. D. Conn. 1994), which I consider to be better reasoned and\r\nmore on point. \r\nThe BAP prefaced its opinion with the observation that\r\ncourts have found section 522(d)(11)(D) ambiguous and difficult to\r\ninterpret. In re Christo, 228 B.R. 48, 50 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1999)\r\n(citing In re Gregoire, 210 B.R. 432, 436 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1997) and\r\nIn re Bova, 205 B.R. 467, 476 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1997)). The BAP also\r\nrepeated the familiar principle that exemptions should be construed\r\nliberally in favor of the debtor. In re Christo, 228 B.R. at 50.\r\nThe BAP then discussed the Rhodes case, which applied an\r\nIllinois statute similar to section 522(d)(11)(D), but which\r\nincluded pain and suffering in the personal injury exemption,\r\nunlike the federal statute. Rhodes stated that it would be unjust\r\nto interpret the statute to allow separate exemptions for separate\r\naccidents, because \"the number of incidents suffered by a debtor\r\nhas no bearing on the debtor's need for funds, and therefore should\r\nnot affect the exemption allowed.\" In re Christo, 228 B.R. at 51.\r\nThe Rhodes decision used some four canons of construction\r\nemployed by the Illinois Supreme Court. 147 B.R. at 445-46. Some of\r\nthese canons may to an extent be recognized in federal cases, but\r\nI reject the conclusion that they dictate our interpretation of\r\nthis statute. Rhodes also referred to the fact that the statutory\r\nlist of exemptions distinguishes between exempted and unexempted\r\nproperty by its nature and not number. 147 B.R. at 446. This proves\r\nlittle, however, as those subparagraphs in the federal statute\r\nenumerating property which may be aggregated list either groupings\r\nof types of property such as household furnishings, section\r\n522(d)(3), professional books or tools, section 522(d)(6), or\r\ncertain enumerated property interest in life insurance contracts,\r\nsection 522(d)(8).\r\nIn my view, the BAP's opinion rests on a shaky policy\r\nfoundation and ignores language in the statute that would allow\r\nseparate exemptions for separate bodily injury claims.\r\nAfter discussing the Rhodes and Marcus, the BAP considers\r\nthe legislative history. 228 B.R. at 51-52. This discussion, while\r\npointing to the purposes of the exemptions, fails to illuminate the\r\nissue before us, whether one or more than one exemption is\r\napplicable when a debtor has been unfortunate enough to be involved\r\nin two personal injury accidents.\r\nThe BAP opinion also demonstrates the tenuous if not\r\nspeculative reasoning on which it is based. In its grammatical\r\nanalysis, the panel reasons that the article \"a\" along with the\r\nsingular form of \"payment\" \"would seem to\" indicate that Congress\r\nintended the exemption of a single payment. 228 B.R. at 51. I think\r\nit equally plausible that the term \"a payment on . . . account of\r\npersonal bodily injury\" can be applied to each such payment. \r\nIn discussing the various subsections referring to\r\naggregate interests, the BAP reasons, \"Congress likely did not\r\nanticipate a situation . . . involving multiple incidents of bodily\r\ninjury.\" Id. (emphasis added). In referring to subsection (d) (2)\r\nlimiting the exemption to one motor vehicle, the BAP reasoned,\r\n\"[I]t is easy to see how Congress could have anticipated a debtor\r\nowning more than one car.\" Id. It is evident that the BAP has not\r\nattempted to ascertain the intent of Congress, but has simply\r\narticulated in the \"likely did not anticipate\" and \"easy to see\"\r\nphrases support for what is at base little more than speculation as\r\nto what Congress might have anticipated. In essence, it is a policy\r\nconclusion as to what is best, and in reality, judicial\r\nlegislation.\r\nSection 522(d) lists some twenty types of exemptions in\r\nparagraphs and subparagraphs. Six of those paragraphs limit the\r\nexemption granted to \"the debtor's aggregate interest . . . in\r\n. . . [various types of property].\" 11 U.S.C.  522(d)(1), (3),\r\n(4), (5), (6) and (8) (emphasis added). Another paragraph limits\r\nthe number of motor vehicles that may be exempted (i.e., one).\r\nSection 522(d)(2). In contrast, section 522(d)(11)(D) contains no\r\nrequirement to aggregate and no numerical limitation. This contrast\r\non its face is evidence that Congress chose not to aggregate all\r\nbodily injury exemptions. See Marcus, 172 B.R. at 504; In re\r\nAnderson, 932 P.2d 1110, 1114 (Okla. 1996) (interpreting similar\r\nOklahoma exemption). However, the BAP explained this discrepancy\r\naway, saying that the other sections were categories in which\r\nCongress would have expected a debtor to have more than one item,\r\nwhereas it is unusual for a debtor to have more than one separate\r\nclaim for bodily injury. 228 B.R. at 51. I believe this is\r\nresolving an ambiguity against the debtor, rather than in the\r\ndebtor's favor.\r\nThe statute simply does not say whether \"a payment . . .\r\non account of personal bodily injury\" refers to one or more than\r\none such payment. Congress could have specifically stated which of\r\nthe two meanings it intended, as it did with motor vehicles, and as\r\nit did by the use of the word \"aggregate.\" I can only read the\r\nfailure to use these restrictive terms as demonstrating an intent\r\nfrom the plain language of the statute that there is no such\r\nlimitation and more than one such incident may be the subject of\r\nexemption.\r\nThe legislative history is of no assistance in dealing\r\nwith this ambiguity. In such circumstances, we should construe the\r\nexemption liberally in favor of the debtor. See In re Arrol, 170\r\nF.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing strong policy of federal\r\nbankruptcy law to interpret exemptions liberally in favor of\r\ndebtor); In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472, 474 (2d Cir. 1994) (Vermont\r\nexemption statutes are remedial and receive liberal construction in\r\nfavor of debtor); Caron v. Farmington Nat'l Bank, 82 F.3d 7, 10\r\n(1st Cir. 1996) (recognizing general rule of liberal interpretation\r\nof exemptions).\r\nWhen the BAP moves on from the language of the statute to\r\npolicy, it again resolves doubt against the debtor. The BAP states:\r\n\"While one might argue that a debtor who has suffered more than one\r\nincident of bodily injury will require more support than a debtor\r\nwho has suffered only one, this would not necessarily be the case.\"\r\n228 B.R. at 53. While it might not necessarily be the case, as the\r\nBAP speculates, it might also be more costly to be injured three\r\ntimes than once. In this case, there are allegations of three\r\nseparate accidents producing separate injuries, the net result of\r\nwhich is that the debtor claims to be completely disabled from\r\nself-support. Permitting separate exemptions for each injury is\r\nconsistent with the statutory language and is not an irrational\r\nresult.\r\nAdmittedly, the debtor who suffers multiple incidents of\r\nbodily injury presents a circumstance of greater rarity than the\r\ndebtor who suffers from one, or who owns more than one car. The\r\nonly limitation that Congress chose to place on the exemption was\r\nfirst $7,500, and later with amendment $15,000. It is evident that\r\nCongress knew how to limit the exemption with respect either to\r\nnumbers or aggregates in addition to the monetary limit. That such\r\nwas not done permits only the interpretation that if the rare\r\nsituation occurs where there is more than one personal bodily\r\ninjury, there will be more than one exemption allowed.\r\nA debtor having more than one bodily injury claim is an\r\nunusual situation, but I think the language of the statute must be\r\nread to provide that each such incident is exempted. After all of\r\nthis discussion, perhaps the most telling consideration is the\r\nwell-established rule that exemptions must be construed liberally\r\nin favor of the debtor.\r\nAccordingly, I dissent from the affirmance of the BAP's\r\ndecision by this court.\n",

Congress made no such specification in subsection (11)(D) and, therefore, none can be presumed. Christo also points to a note to the precursor provision to &#167; 522(d)(11)(D) in the Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 93-137, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), which states that the value of personal injury exemptions \"is not limited.\" Since the House Report on the final bill did not explicitly reject this note, she contends that we should adopt the Commission Report's view in our interpretation of the statute. Finally, she points to the policy of liberally construing exemptions in favor of the debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee, espousing the view taken in In re Rhodes, 147 B.R. 443, 444-45 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1992) (interpreting an analogous provision of the Illinois Code), argues that the language of the statute is clear, the statutory scheme contradicts Christo's claim, and that to hold otherwise would lead to nonsensical results. The trustee points out that &#167; 522(d)(11)(D) refers to \"a payment, not to exceed $15,000, on account of personal bodily injury,\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(d)(11)(D) (emphasis added), and does not use language such as \"payment, not to exceed $15,000, on account of each instance of personal bodily injury.\" Furthermore, the trustee argues, &#167; 522(d) distinguishes exempted property from non-exempted property by type and not number. While certain subsections do refer to \"aggregate\" interests (e.g., subsections (1) (real property), (3) (household furnishings), and (4) (jewelry)) and subsection (2) does limit the exemption to \"one\" motor vehicle, the trustee notes that it is easy to see how Congress anticipated multiple properties and so multiple claims in these areas but did not do so in the context of personal bodily injuries. Finally, the trustee argues that Christo's reading of the statute would result in inequity because it would treat similarly situated debtors differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP agreed with the trustee's interpretation in an opinion examining text, context, and legislative history. We affirm, largely adopt the BAP's opinion, and outline briefly our reasons. First, the language of the exemption in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(d)(11)(D) refers to \"a payment.\" While there is some ambiguity, the more natural reading is that there is a single exemption. Second, the overall scheme of exemptions in &#167; 522(d)(11) displays a pattern of allowing one exemption per category. Third, the purpose of exemptions is to provide support for the debtors at a reasonably necessary level. The reasonably necessary level should not, logically, vary to provide more in total exemption amount to someone who is in three minor accidents than one who is in a single catastrophic accident. That is particularly so given that there are the exemptions in &#167;&#167; 522(d)(10)(A) and (C) for social security and disability benefits. That is, the exemption for \"a payment in account of personal bodily injury\" is not a proxy for degree of disability. Fourth, the reading of the exemption as limited to one $15,000 exemption more equitably treats similarly situated debtors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the BAP states, \"[t]he purpose of the statute . . . is served by limiting it to one exemption, regardless of the number of incidents of bodily injury, because the determination of what is 'reasonably necessary' to support the debtor should not hinge on the number of injuries suffered.\" Christo, 228 B.R. at 52-53. If the statute were read as Christo suggests, Debtor A who sustained a single $45,000 personal injury would receive only a $15,000 exemption, while Debtor B who sustained three separate injuries of $15,000 each, totaling $45,000, would receive a $45,000 exemption. The \"value\" of the personal injury claims to Debtors A and B would be the same but the exemptions allowed to each of them would be wildly different. Certainly it is possible that multiple incidents of personal bodily injuries might be more severe, and require more support, than a single incident, but, as the BAP pointed out, see id. at 53, that will not necessarily be so. More importantly, \"Congress set a cap of $15,000.00 to be exempted on account of bodily injury, and there is no indication that amount should be multiplied depending on an individual debtor's situation.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we acknowledge the default rule that courts should construe the Bankruptcy Code's exemptions \"liberally to reflect their remedial purposes,\" In re Caron, 82 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1996), we also recognize that, in certain situations, there are reasons \"to afford a more narrow reading,\" id. In other words, a text's possible ambiguity does not preclude further inquiry into which interpretation better coincides with the Code's purposes. Such an inquiry might include reviewing a particular provision's legislative history (as in Caron) or logic. This evaluation may confirm a construction that is in a debtor's favor. There are times, however, when, as here, a contrary conclusion is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the BAP \"that the phrase 'on account of personal bodily injury' should be interpreted as defining the nature of the payment that is exempt and not the number of injuries suffered.\" Id. at 53. Consequently, a Chapter 7 debtor is entitled to one exemption of no more than $15,000 on account of personal injury, regardless of the number of injuries involved. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The amount of the exemption allowed under &#167; 522(d)(11)(D) has since been increased to $16,150 to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

It is by no means clear that Congress meant section 522(d)(11)(D) to exempt only one payment on account of bodily injury and we should resolve the ambiguity in favor of allowing exemptions, not excluding them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel relied on a case interpreting a distinguishable Illinois statute, In re Rhodes, 147 B.R. 443 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1992), and rejected the case interpreting section 522(d)(11)(D), In re Marcus, 172 B.R. 502 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1994), which I consider to be better reasoned and more on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP prefaced its opinion with the observation that courts have found section 522(d)(11)(D) ambiguous and difficult to interpret. In re Christo, 228 B.R. 48, 50 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1999) (citing In re Gregoire, 210 B.R. 432, 436 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1997) and In re Bova, 205 B.R. 467, 476 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1997)). The BAP also repeated the familiar principle that exemptions should be construed liberally in favor of the debtor. In re Christo, 228 B.R. at 50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP then discussed the Rhodes case, which applied an Illinois statute similar to section 522(d)(11)(D), but which included pain and suffering in the personal injury exemption, unlike the federal statute. Rhodes stated that it would be unjust to interpret the statute to allow separate exemptions for separate accidents, because \"the number of incidents suffered by a debtor has no bearing on the debtor's need for funds, and therefore should not affect the exemption allowed.\" In re Christo, 228 B.R. at 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhodes decision used some four canons of construction employed by the Illinois Supreme Court. 147 B.R. at 445-46. Some of these canons may to an extent be recognized in federal cases, but I reject the conclusion that they dictate our interpretation of this statute. Rhodes also referred to the fact that the statutory list of exemptions distinguishes between exempted and unexempted property by its nature and not number. 147 B.R. at 446. This proves little, however, as those subparagraphs in the federal statute enumerating property which may be aggregated list either groupings of types of property such as household furnishings, section 522(d)(3), professional books or tools, section 522(d)(6), or certain enumerated property interest in life insurance contracts, section 522(d)(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the BAP's opinion rests on a shaky policy foundation and ignores language in the statute that would allow separate exemptions for separate bodily injury claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discussing the Rhodes and Marcus, the BAP considers the legislative history. 228 B.R. at 51-52. This discussion, while pointing to the purposes of the exemptions, fails to illuminate the issue before us, whether one or more than one exemption is applicable when a debtor has been unfortunate enough to be involved in two personal injury accidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP opinion also demonstrates the tenuous if not speculative reasoning on which it is based. In its grammatical analysis, the panel reasons that the article \"a\" along with the singular form of \"payment\" \"would seem to\" indicate that Congress intended the exemption of a single payment. 228 B.R. at 51. I think it equally plausible that the term \"a payment on . . . account of personal bodily injury\" can be applied to each such payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the various subsections referring to aggregate interests, the BAP reasons, \"Congress likely did not anticipate a situation . . . involving multiple incidents of bodily injury.\" Id. (emphasis added). In referring to subsection (d) (2) limiting the exemption to one motor vehicle, the BAP reasoned, \"[I]t is easy to see how Congress could have anticipated a debtor owning more than one car.\" Id. It is evident that the BAP has not attempted to ascertain the intent of Congress, but has simply articulated in the \"likely did not anticipate\" and \"easy to see\" phrases support for what is at base little more than speculation as to what Congress might have anticipated. In essence, it is a policy conclusion as to what is best, and in reality, judicial legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 522(d) lists some twenty types of exemptions in paragraphs and subparagraphs. Six of those paragraphs limit the exemption granted to \"the debtor's aggregate interest . . . in . . . [various types of property].\" 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 522(d)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (8) (emphasis added). Another paragraph limits the number of motor vehicles that may be exempted (i.e., one). Section 522(d)(2). In contrast, section 522(d)(11)(D) contains no requirement to aggregate and no numerical limitation. This contrast on its face is evidence that Congress chose not to aggregate all bodily injury exemptions. See Marcus, 172 B.R. at 504; In re Anderson, 932 P.2d 1110, 1114 (Okla. 1996) (interpreting similar Oklahoma exemption). However, the BAP explained this discrepancy away, saying that the other sections were categories in which Congress would have expected a debtor to have more than one item, whereas it is unusual for a debtor to have more than one separate claim for bodily injury. 228 B.R. at 51. I believe this is resolving an ambiguity against the debtor, rather than in the debtor's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute simply does not say whether \"a payment . . . on account of personal bodily injury\" refers to one or more than one such payment. Congress could have specifically stated which of the two meanings it intended, as it did with motor vehicles, and as it did by the use of the word \"aggregate.\" I can only read the failure to use these restrictive terms as demonstrating an intent from the plain language of the statute that there is no such limitation and more than one such incident may be the subject of exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history is of no assistance in dealing with this ambiguity. In such circumstances, we should construe the exemption liberally in favor of the debtor. See In re Arrol, 170 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing strong policy of federal bankruptcy law to interpret exemptions liberally in favor of debtor); In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472, 474 (2d Cir. 1994) (Vermont exemption statutes are remedial and receive liberal construction in favor of debtor); Caron v. Farmington Nat'l Bank, 82 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1996) (recognizing general rule of liberal interpretation of exemptions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the BAP moves on from the language of the statute to policy, it again resolves doubt against the debtor. The BAP states: \"While one might argue that a debtor who has suffered more than one incident of bodily injury will require more support than a debtor who has suffered only one, this would not necessarily be the case.\" 228 B.R. at 53. While it might not necessarily be the case, as the BAP speculates, it might also be more costly to be injured three times than once. In this case, there are allegations of three separate accidents producing separate injuries, the net result of which is that the debtor claims to be completely disabled from self-support. Permitting separate exemptions for each injury is consistent with the statutory language and is not an irrational result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the debtor who suffers multiple incidents of bodily injury presents a circumstance of greater rarity than the debtor who suffers from one, or who owns more than one car. The only limitation that Congress chose to place on the exemption was first $7,500, and later with amendment $15,000. It is evident that Congress knew how to limit the exemption with respect either to numbers or aggregates in addition to the monetary limit. That such was not done permits only the interpretation that if the rare situation occurs where there is more than one personal bodily injury, there will be more than one exemption allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A debtor having more than one bodily injury claim is an unusual situation, but I think the language of the statute must be read to provide that each such incident is exempted. After all of this discussion, perhaps the most telling consideration is the well-established rule that exemptions must be construed liberally in favor of the debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, I dissent from the affirmance of the BAP's decision by this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Christo filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 22, 1997. In her Schedule C, she claimed three exemptions for three personal injury claims stemming from three separate pre-petition accidents. Christo's personal injury claims had not yet been settled; she sought potential exemptions of $15,000 for each of the three personal injury claims, for a total potential exemption of $45,000. The trustee filed a \"Limited Objection to Claim of Exemption\" with respect to the three tort claims on the grounds that no value was listed. The bankruptcy court sustained the objection, continued the matter generally, and directed Christo to file amended schedules of exemptions. Christo then filed a \"Motion for Determination of Validity of Exemptions and Consequent Denial of Trustee's Limited Objection to Claims of Exemption.\" In response, the trustee argued that, under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(d)(11)(D), Christo was entitled only to a total exemption of $15,000 for all her personal injury claims.

If the statute were read as Christo suggests, Debtor A who sustained a single $45,000 personal injury would receive only a $15,000 exemption, while Debtor B who sustained three separate injuries of $15,000 each, totaling $45,000, would receive a $45,000 exemption. The \"value\" of the personal injury claims to Debtors A and B would be the same but the exemptions allowed to each of them would be wildly different. Certainly it is possible that multiple incidents of personal bodily injuries might be more severe, and require more support, than a single incident, but, as the BAP pointed out, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 53, </a></span>that will not necessarily be so.

Such an inquiry might include reviewing a particular provision's legislative history (as in Caron) or logic. This evaluation may confirm a construction that is in a debtor's favor.

In re <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Christo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP then discussed the Rhodes case, which applied an Illinois statute similar to section 522(d)(11)(D), but which included pain and suffering in the personal injury exemption, unlike the federal statute. Rhodes stated that it would be unjust to interpret the statute to allow separate exemptions for separate accidents, because \"the number of incidents suffered by a debtor has no bearing on the debtor's need for funds, and therefore should not affect the exemption allowed.\" In re <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Christo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhodes decision used some four canons of construction employed by the Illinois Supreme <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1806636\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Court.</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1806636/in-re-rhodes/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">445-46</span></a></span>. Some of these canons may to an extent be recognized in federal cases, but I reject the conclusion that they dictate our interpretation of this statute. Rhodes also referred to the fact that the statutory list of exemptions distinguishes between exempted and unexempted property by its nature and not <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1806636\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">number.</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1806636/in-re-rhodes/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>. This proves little, however, as those subparagraphs in the federal statute enumerating property which may be aggregated list either groupings of types of property such as household furnishings, section 522(d)(3), professional books or tools, section 522(d)(6), or certain enumerated property interest in life insurance contracts, section 522(d)(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the BAP's opinion rests on a shaky policy foundation and ignores language in the statute that would allow separate exemptions for separate bodily injury claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discussing the Rhodes and Marcus, the BAP considers the legislative <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">history.</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">51-52</span></a></span>. This discussion, while pointing to the purposes of the exemptions, fails to illuminate the issue before us, whether one or more than one exemption is applicable when a debtor has been unfortunate enough to be involved in two personal injury accidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BAP opinion also demonstrates the tenuous if not speculative reasoning on which it is based. In its grammatical analysis, the panel reasons that the article \"a\" along with the singular form of \"payment\" \"would seem to\" indicate that Congress intended the exemption of a single <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">payment.</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>. I think it equally plausible that the term \"a payment on . . . account of personal bodily injury\" can be applied to each such payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the various subsections referring to aggregate interests, the BAP reasons, \"Congress likely did not anticipate a situation . . . involving multiple incidents of bodily injury.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added). </a></span>In referring to subsection (d) (2) limiting the exemption to one motor vehicle, the BAP reasoned, \"[I]t is easy to see how Congress could have anticipated a debtor owning more than one car.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> It is </a></span>evident that the BAP has not attempted to ascertain the intent of Congress, but has simply articulated in the \"likely did not anticipate\" and \"easy to see\" phrases support for what is at base little more than speculation as to what Congress might have anticipated. In essence, it is a policy conclusion as to what is best, and in reality, judicial legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 522(d) lists some twenty types of exemptions in paragraphs and subparagraphs. Six of those paragraphs limit the exemption granted to \"the debtor's aggregate interest . . . in . . . [various types of property].\" 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 522(d)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (8) (emphasis added). Another paragraph limits the number of motor vehicles that may be exempted (i.e., one). Section 522(d)(2). In contrast, section 522(d)(11)(D) contains no requirement to aggregate and no numerical limitation. This contrast on its face is evidence that Congress chose not to aggregate all bodily injury exemptions. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2021488\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Marcus,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2021488/in-re-marcus/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>; In re Anderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613569\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613569/in-re-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1114 (Okla. 1996) (interpreting similar Oklahoma exemption). However, the BAP explained this discrepancy away, saying that the other sections were categories in which Congress would have expected a debtor to have more than one item, whereas it is unusual for a debtor to have more than one separate claim for bodily <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">injury.</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>. I believe this is resolving an ambiguity against the debtor, rather than in the debtor's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute simply does not say whether \"a payment . . . on account of personal bodily injury\" refers to one or more than one such payment. Congress could have specifically stated which of the two meanings it intended, as it did with motor vehicles, and as it did by the use of the word \"aggregate.\" I can only read the failure to use these restrictive terms as demonstrating an intent from the plain language of the statute that there is no such limitation and more than one such incident may be the subject of exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history is of no assistance in dealing with this ambiguity. In such circumstances, we should construe the exemption liberally in favor of the debtor. See In re Arrol, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762483\"><a href=\"/opinion/762483/bankr-l-rep-p-77913-99-cal-daily-op-serv-1912-1999-daily-journal/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span>, 937 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing strong policy of federal bankruptcy law to interpret exemptions liberally in favor of debtor); In re Parrotte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668548\"><a href=\"/opinion/668548/in-re-lewis-george-parrotte-ila-jean-parrotte-debtors-lewis-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span>, 474 (2d Cir. 1994) (Vermont exemption statutes are remedial and receive liberal construction in favor of debtor); Caron v. Farmington Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196729\"><a href=\"/opinion/196729/caron-v-farmington-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 1996) (recognizing general rule of liberal interpretation of exemptions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the BAP moves on from the language of the statute to policy, it again resolves doubt against the debtor. The BAP states: \"While one might argue that a debtor who has suffered more than one incident of bodily injury will require more support than a debtor who has suffered only one, this would not necessarily be the <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552613\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">case.\"</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1552613/in-re-christo/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>. While it might not necessarily be the case, as the BAP speculates, it might also be more costly to be injured three times than once. In this case, there are allegations of three separate accidents producing separate injuries, the net result of which is that the debtor claims to be completely disabled from self-support. Permitting separate exemptions for each injury is consistent with the statutory language and is not an irrational result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the debtor who suffers multiple incidents of bodily injury presents a circumstance of greater rarity than the debtor who suffers from one, or who owns more than one car. The only limitation that Congress chose to place on the exemption was first $7,500, and later with amendment $15,000. It is evident that Congress knew how to limit the exemption with respect either to numbers or aggregates in addition to the monetary limit. That such was not done permits only the interpretation that if the rare situation occurs where there is more than one personal bodily injury, there will be more than one exemption allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A debtor having more than one bodily injury claim is an unusual situation, but I think the language of the statute must be read to provide that each such incident is exempted. After all of this discussion, perhaps the most telling consideration is the well-established rule that exemptions must be construed liberally in favor of the debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, I dissent from the affirmance of the BAP's decision by this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
