Appellee Steven Colan, M.D. (“Colan”)\n\nhas moved for summary disposition of this appeal, and after\n\na   thorough      review     of    the    record   and   of    the     parties’\n\nsubmissions, we allow the appellee’s motion and we affirm\n\nthe judgment.\n\n               Appellant Pamela B. Berger’s (“Berger’s”) argument\n\nthat    the    jury’s   verdict      was    against   the     weight    of    the\n\nevidence may not be raised on appeal, as she did not raise\n\nit in a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, nor\n\nin a motion for new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a).\n\nPuerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. V. Constructora Lluch,\n\nInc., 169 F.3d 68, 82 (1st Cir. 1999) (“A motion for a new\n\ntrial must be made in the first instance before the trial\n\ncourt, particularly where the weight of the evidence is at\n\nissue. . . . The failure to move for a new trial waives the\n\nissue    on     appeal.”)     (citations       omitted);       Velazquez       v.\n\nFigueroa-Gomez, 996 F.2d 425, 426-27 (1st Cir. 1993) (failure\n\nto move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a\n\nnew    trial    pursuant     to    Rule    59(a)   results     in    waiver    of\n\nchallenge to sufficiency or weight of evidence).                       Even if\n\nthe matter had been presented properly to the district\n\ncourt, one may not argue that the verdict was against the\n\nweight of the evidence simply by citing to the evidence\n\fwhich was favorable to one’s position.           If evidence was\n\noffered to the contrary, the jury was free to accept or\n\nreject each party’s evidence, and in most cases, a court is\n\nnot warranted in overriding the jury’s choice.\n\n           Likewise, Berger’s argument that the testimony and\n\nopinion of Colon’s expert witness Valhakes was “erroneous”\n\nis insufficient to support relief on appeal.          Berger makes\n\nno argument that Valhakes was unqualified as an expert\n\nwitness or that his testimony was for some other reason\n\ninadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.                Her\n\ncounsel was free to attack Valhakes’ opinion on cross-\n\nexamination (which he did) and in his closing argument.          But\n\nBerger is not entitled to reversal simply because the jury\n\nchose to agree with Valhakes’ view of the medical evidence.\n\n           Berger’s claim that she is entitled to relief based\n\non newly-discovered evidence fails.       Such claims must first\n\nbe brought to the district court through a motion under\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) within one year of judgment.          See In\n\nre Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 186 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (procedure for reopening judgment in light of newly-\n\ndiscovered   evidence   is   motion   under   Rule   60(b)(2);   new\n\nevidence is not to be proffered for the first time on\n\nappeal).\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f         Finally, there is no record support for Berger’s\n\ncontention that jurors slept through portions of the trial,\n\nso her claim that she is entitled to relief on this ground\n\nmust fail.\n\n         Affirmed.   1st Cir.
