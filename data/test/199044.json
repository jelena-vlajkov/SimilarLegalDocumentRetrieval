Héctor Tuesta-Toro appeals the\n\ndenial of his petition to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2255.    For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n           A.   Factual Background\n\n           The facts of this case were aptly summarized by this Court\n\nin United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 773 (1st Cir. 1994). We\n\nsee no need to duplicate that effort. Accordingly, we reiterate our\n\nprevious recitation of the facts largely verbatim.\n\n           On September 2, 1992, after receiving information from a\n\nconfidential informant (\"CI\") that petitioner Tuesta-Toro and Carlos\n\nMartínez-Díaz were distributing large quantities of cocaine in the San\n\nJuan    metropolitan   area,   the   United   States   Drug   Enforcement\n\nAdministration recorded telephone conversations during which Martínez\n\nagreed to sell the CI five kilograms of cocaine at $16,500 per kilogram\n\nand identified Tuesta-Toro as his source. Martínez in turn spoke with\n\nTuesta-Toro by cellular phone in order to establish the price and\n\nquantity of the cocaine to be sold to the CI and the site of the drug\n\ntransaction.\n\n           The next day Martínez advised the CI by phone that a\n\none-kilogram transaction (rather than the five-kilogram transaction\n\ndiscussed the day before) would take place that afternoon, but that\n\nTuesta-Toro did not wish to be seen by the buyer.                Martínez\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\freestablished telephone contact with Tuesta-Toro at 2:40 p.m. En route\n\nto the scene of the transaction, Martínez noted that Tuesta-Toro was\n\ncarrying a gun and more than one kilogram of cocaine. At Tuesta-Toro's\n\ninstruction, Martínez parked their vehicle so that Tuesta-Toro could\n\nwitness the drug deal without being observed. Martínez then exited the\n\ncar and delivered the cocaine to the CI, who was accompanied by an\n\nundercover DEA agent. Shortly thereafter, Martínez and Tuesta-Toro\n\nwere arrested.\n\n           B.   Procedural History\n\n           Following his arrest, petitioner Héctor Tuesta-Toro was\n\ncharged in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, see 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1), carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking\n\noffense, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1), and using a communication facility\n\nto facilitate a drug trafficking offense, see 21 U.S.C. § 843(b).\n\nPursuant to a plea agreement, Martínez testified against petitioner at\n\ntrial.    Petitioner was subsequently convicted on all counts and\n\nsentenced to 138 months of imprisonment.\n\n           On appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction. See generally\n\nTuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771. Petitioner filed a petition for rehearing\n\nand a request for rehearing en banc. Both were denied. Petitioner\n\nthen filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which the Supreme Court\n\ndenied.    See Tuesta-Toro v. United States, 513 U.S. 1132 (1995).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          On April 26, 1995, petitioner filed a motion to vacate his\n\nsentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Petitioner raised five claims\n\nin his habeas petition, only two of which he now pursues on appeal:\n\n(1) ineffective assistance of counsel, and (2) a Giglio claim, see\n\nGiglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972). In addition, petitioner\n\nnow argues on appeal that the district court improperly denied his\n\nGiglio claim without adequate discovery.\n\n          The record indicates that on June 21, 1995, petitioner's\n\nhabeas counsel moved for leave to propound discovery. The magistrate\n\njudge ruled that petitioner's request was \"broad, burdensome on the\n\ngovernment and resembled a fishing expedition on the co-defendant's\n\ncase file.\" Accordingly, petitioner's attorney was instructed to\n\n\"identify those portions of the record relevant to his claims of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel or bias of the trial court.\"\n\nPetitioner was further advised that once the record was examined, a\n\nhearing, if necessary, could be held. Petitioner appealed the ruling,\n\nbut the district court affirmed. The district court order, dated\n\nJanuary 20, 1996, denied discovery relating to (1) an alleged delay in\n\nthe sentencing of petitioner's co-defendant, (2) ineffective assistance\n\nof trial counsel, and (3) the prosecution's trial strategy.\n\n          This notwithstanding, an evidentiary hearing was held before\n\nthe magistrate judge on April 19, 1996. At that hearing, counsel for\n\npetitioner was given the opportunity to question Benito M. Rodríguez-\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMassó, petitioner's trial counsel, in relation to petitioner's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim. After the presentation of\n\nadditional witnesses not relevant to this appeal, the magistrate judge\n\nheard oral argument on petitioner's habeas claims. Following oral\n\nargument, the judge denied from the bench petitioner's request for\n\ndisclosure of additional information pertaining to the confidential\n\ninformant.\n\n          On February 24, 1997, petitioner, through counsel, filed a\n\nMotion Requesting Ruling on Pending Discovery Motions. The magistrate\n\njudge issued a written order on March 14, 1997, stating \"we conclude\n\nthat petitioner's . . . request is MOOT inasmuch as the discovery\n\nrequested has been provided, thus his reiterated petitions for what he\n\nhas already received are frivolous.\" The court reasoned, in part,\n\nthat:\n\n          [E]ven though the minutes of procedure do reflect\n          that discovery requests pertaining to the\n          existence and background of a confidential\n          informant were denied, it remains a fact that\n          throughout the evidentiary hearing attorney for\n          petitioner was given ample opportunity to examine\n          trial attorney Benito Rodríguez-Massó on issues\n          such as: trial strategy, existence of an\n          informant, available information regarding the\n          informant, pretrial motions filed, plea\n          agreements, the individuals present at the\n          sentencing hearing, the sentencing court's\n          demeanor and the existence of a cooperating co-\n          defendant . . . . Thus, it is patently clear\n          that petitioner's prior requests for discovery\n          (except for a request to submit interrogatories\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          to the government and depose the co-defendant)\n          were satisfied during the hearing.\n\nThe court added the following:\n\n          Through his broad, general requests for\n          discovery, counsel has repeatedly violated the\n          provisions of Rule 6(b) of the 28 U.S.C. § 2255\n          Rules, which mandate that discovery requests be\n          specific as to the documents sought. The court\n          will not allow counsel to engage in a fishing\n          expedition, absent some showing by him that: 1)\n          petitioner's claims can remotely entitle him to\n          relief; and 2) the evidence specifically\n          requested provides support to those claims. See\n          DeVincent v. United States, 632 F.2d 145, 146\n          (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n          Shortly thereafter, on March 27, 1998, the magistrate judge\n\nissued its report and recommendation that petitioner's § 2255 motion be\n\ndenied. On January 13, 1999, the district court issued an opinion and\n\norder adopting the report and recommendation. On the same day, the\n\ncourt entered judgment dismissing the case. The instant appeal ensued.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n          Petitioner claims that his trial counsel's alleged failure\n\nto obtain information regarding the identity, whereabouts, and criminal\n\nrecord of the confidential informant in this case constitutes\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.       We disagree.\n\n          To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,\n\npetitioner \"has the burden of showing that (1) counsel's performance\n\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\freasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the\n\nproceedings would have been different.\" Smullen v. United States, 94\n\nF.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1996). In applying this test, first announced in\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), \"judicial scrutiny\n\nof counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\" There is, in\n\nother words, a \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within\n\nthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\" Id.        As a\n\ncorollary, \"the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the\n\ncircumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial\n\nstrategy.'\"   Id. (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101\n\n(1955)). In this regard, this Court has previously stated that \"[t]he\n\ndecision whether to call a particular witness is almost always\n\nstrategic, requiring a balancing of the benefits and risks of the\n\nanticipated testimony.\" Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n          Here, the record clearly demonstrates that petitioner's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim is untenable. Petitioner's\n\ntrial attorney, Rodríguez-Massó, testified before the magistrate judge\n\nthat, contrary to petitioner's assertion, he knew the identity of the\n\nconfidential informant.     He explained that the identity of the\n\ninformant had been provided to attorney Rafael Anglada, petitioner's\n\noriginal trial counsel. Mr. Rodríguez further testified that prior to\n\ntrial he ascertained that the informant was not willing to testify on\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbehalf of the defense. Accordingly, Mr. Rodríguez believed that \"any\n\ninformation, if at all, that [the informant] would have given at trial\n\nwould have been not to [petitioner's] benefit but to [his] detriment.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances, and given the fact that petitioner's co-\n\ndefendant had agreed to testify for the government, Mr. Rodríguez\n\ndetermined that it was best \"as a matter of legal strategy\" not to call\n\nthe informant as a trial witness. In addition, Mr. Rodríguez stated\n\nthat although he was not aware of the informant's criminal record,\n\nwhich consisted of two complaints pertaining to domestic violence, he\n\nwould not have called the informant to testify even if he had seen\n\nthose records prior to trial.\n\n          Given this evidence, the district court correctly determined\n\nthat trial counsel's decision not to personally interview the informant\n\nor call him as a trial witness was purely strategic in nature. This\n\nclaim, therefore, cannot succeed.      See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\nII.   Giglio Claim\n\n          Petitioner next argues that an alleged delay in the\n\nsentencing of the cooperating co-defendant Martínez prejudiced him\n\ninasmuch as the lenient sentence Martínez received for his cooperation\n\ncould have been used by petitioner to impeach Martínez at trial. Once\n\nagain, we see no merit in this argument.\n\n          The government has a constitutional duty to disclose evidence\n\nthat is favorable to a criminal defendant, be it exculpatory or\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fimpeachment evidence. See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 432-33\n\n(1995); United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985); Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 86-87 (1963).       As petitioner correctly\n\nindicates, evidence of a prior agreement with a government witness not\n\nto prosecute that witness is generally considered impeachment material\n\nand therefore discoverable under Brady. See Giglio v. United States,\n\n405 U.S. 150, 153-54 (1972); see also United States v. Dumas, 207 F.3d\n\n11, 16 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[I]t is clear that impeachment evidence falls\n\nwithin the Brady rule.\").\n\n          At trial, Martínez stated that he had not been promised\n\nanything in exchange for his testimony and specifically denied having\n\nreceived a promise of leniency. While Martínez did indicate that two\n\nof the counts in his indictment were to be dismissed in exchange for\n\nhis guilty plea, he clarified that the dismissal of the two counts was\n\nnot contingent on his testifying in court.      The copy of the plea\n\nagreement, submitted by petitioner, confirms this testimony. Martínez\n\nalso indicated that a prior statement he made which exculpated\n\npetitioner was not true. He explained that he had made the prior false\n\nstatement under pressure from petitioner to assume responsibility for\n\nthe crimes in exchange for a car and other assistance.\n\n          There is no question that Martínez ultimately benefitted\n\nfrom the government's sentencing recommendation, adopted by the\n\nsentencing court, that a downward departure from the Sentencing\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fGuidelines was warranted in light of Martínez's substantial assistance.\n\nNevertheless, we concur with the district court's conclusion that\n\n\"[t]he evidence presented at trial shows that [petitioner's]\n\ncodefendant did not receive a promise of leniency in exchange for his\n\ntestimony.\" Tuesta-Toro v. United States, No. 95-1522, slip op. at 7-8\n\n(D.P.R. January 11, 1999).    This finding forecloses petitioner's\n\nargument. Where, as here, the record clearly indicates that there was\n\nno suppression of exculpatory or impeachment evidence by the\n\nprosecution, a Giglio claim fails as a matter of law.\n\n          While we need look no further to reject petitioner's claim,\n\nwe note that petitioner has also failed to make the showing of\n\nmateriality required under Brady. See Brady, 373 U.S. at 87; see also\n\nKyles, 514 U.S. at 433-37 (citing Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682). Evidence\n\nis material under Brady only when \"there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.\" Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682; see\n\nalso Kyles, 514 U.S. at 433-35; United States v. Cunan, 152 F.3d 29, 34\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). Therefore, as the Supreme Court has indicated, \"[w]e\n\ndo not . . . automatically require a new trial whenever 'a combing of\n\nthe prosecutors' files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly\n\nuseful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict.'\"\n\nGiglio, 405 U.S. at 153-54 (quoting United States v. Keogh, 391 F.2d\n\n138, 148 (2d Cir. 1968)).     In this case, as the district court\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\femphasized, the record is replete with additional evidence of\n\npetitioner's guilt other than Martínez's testimony. The record, for\n\nexample, includes recorded phone calls indicating that petitioner was\n\nthe supplier of the cocaine and the incriminating testimony of several\n\nother witnesses who testified for the prosecution.\n\n          Undaunted by the foregoing, petitioner now alleges that the\n\ndistrict court erred by denying his requests for discovery of Giglio\n\nmaterial. Specifically, petitioner states that he was denied the\n\nopportunity (1) to request a transcript of Martínez's sentencing, (2)\n\nto request all plea or cooperation agreements pertaining to Martínez,\n\n(3) to depose Martínez, and (4) to propound interrogatories on the\n\ngovernment regarding the alleged delay in Martínez's sentencing. We\n\nremain unpersuaded.\n\n          Discovery in a habeas proceeding is a matter confided to the\n\ndiscretion of the district court. See Fed. R. 6(a) Governing 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255 Cases; see also Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 909 (1997).\n\nAccordingly, discovery rulings in a habeas case are reviewed for abuse\n\nof discretion only. See, e.g., Clark v. Johnson, 202 F.3d 760, 765-66\n\n(5th Cir. 2000); Campbell v. Blodgett, 982 F.2d 1356, 1358 (9th Cir.\n\n1993); see also DeVincent v. United States, 632 F.2d 145, 146 (1st Cir.\n\n1980).\n\n          Here, the record indicates that petitioner received an\n\nabundance of discovery, including a full evidentiary hearing held on\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fApril 19, 1996. While the district court ultimately denied some of\n\npetitioner's discovery requests, it did so on the ground that\n\n\"[p]etitioner's request for discovery amounts to no more than\n\nspeculative assertions that Giglio material may exist.\" Tuesta-Toro,\n\nNo. 95-1522, slip op. at 7.    This ruling is well within the trial\n\ncourt's discretion.\n\n           First, petitioner ignores the fact that \"a witness' 'nebulous\n\nexpectation of help from the state' is not Brady material.\" Hill v.\n\nJohnson, 210 F.3d 481, 487 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting Goodwin v. Johnson,\n\n132 F.3d 162, 187 (5th Cir. 1997)). Second, and more important, \" Brady\n\nis not a discovery rule, but a rule of fairness and minimum\n\nprosecutorial obligation.\" United States v. Beasley, 576 F.2d 626, 630\n\n(5th Cir. 1978) (citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 107\n\n(1976)).   Accordingly, \"mere speculation about materials in the\n\ngovernment's files [does not require] the district court or this court\n\nunder Brady to make the materials available for [petitioner's]\n\ninspection.\" United States v. Michaels, 796 F.2d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir.\n\n1986) (quoting United States v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary\n\nCorp., 433 F.2d 174, 202 (3d Cir. 1970)); see also DeVincent, 632 F.2d\n\nat 146.    Finally, pursuant to Rule 6(a), a habeas petitioner is\n\nrequired to show good cause for discovery requests. See Fed. R. 6(a)\n\nGoverning 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Cases. In this case, petitioner has failed\n\nto make any such showing.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          In summary, because the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying petitioner's request for additional discovery,\n\nand because the record indicates that the prosecution did not suppress\n\nexculpatory or impeachment evidence in this case, petitioner's Giglio\n\nclaim fails.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\n\norder dismissing Héctor Tuesta-Toro's 28 U.S.C. § 2255 petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f",

For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n           A.   Factual Background\n\n           The facts of this case were aptly summarized by this Court\n\nin United States v. Tuesta-Toro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195508\"><a href=\"/opinion/195508/united-states-v-tuesta-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773 (1st Cir. 1994). We\n\nsee no need to duplicate that effort. Accordingly, we reiterate our\n\nprevious recitation of the facts largely verbatim.\n\n           On September 2, 1992, after receiving information from a\n\nconfidential informant (\"CI\") that petitioner Tuesta-Toro and Carlos\n\nMartínez-Díaz were distributing large quantities of cocaine in the San\n\nJuan    metropolitan   area,   the   United   States   Drug   Enforcement\n\nAdministration recorded telephone conversations during which Martínez\n\nagreed to sell the CI five kilograms of cocaine at $16,500 per kilogram\n\nand identified Tuesta-Toro as his source. Martínez in turn spoke with\n\nTuesta-Toro by cellular phone in order to establish the price and\n\nquantity of the cocaine to be sold to the CI and the site of the drug\n\ntransaction.\n\n           The next day Martínez advised the CI by phone that a\n\none-kilogram transaction (rather than the five-kilogram transaction\n\ndiscussed the day before) would take place that afternoon, but that\n\nTuesta-Toro did not wish to be seen by the buyer.                Martínez\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\freestablished telephone contact with Tuesta-Toro at 2:40 p.m. En route\n\nto the scene of the transaction, Martínez noted that Tuesta-Toro was\n\ncarrying a gun and more than one kilogram of cocaine. At Tuesta-Toro's\n\ninstruction, Martínez parked their vehicle so that Tuesta-Toro could\n\nwitness the drug deal without being observed. Martínez then exited the\n\ncar and delivered the cocaine to the CI, who was accompanied by an\n\nundercover DEA agent. Shortly thereafter, Martínez and Tuesta-Toro\n\nwere arrested.\n\n           B.   Procedural History\n\n           Following his arrest, petitioner Héctor Tuesta-Toro was\n\ncharged in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, see 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1), carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking\n\noffense, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1), and using a communication facility\n\nto facilitate a drug trafficking offense, see 21 U.S.C. § 843(b).\n\nPursuant to a plea agreement, Martínez testified against petitioner at\n\ntrial.    Petitioner was subsequently convicted on all counts and\n\nsentenced to 138 months of imprisonment.\n\n           On appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction. See generally\n\nTuesta-Toro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195508\"><a href=\"/opinion/195508/united-states-v-tuesta-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Petitioner filed a petition for rehearing\n\nand a request for rehearing en banc. Both were denied. Petitioner\n\nthen filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which the Supreme Court\n\ndenied.    See Tuesta-Toro v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1995).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          On April 26, 1995, petitioner filed a motion to vacate his\n\nsentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Petitioner raised five claims\n\nin his habeas petition, only two of which he now pursues on appeal:\n\n(1) ineffective assistance of counsel, and (2) a Giglio claim, see\n\nGiglio v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108471\"><a href=\"/opinion/108471/giglio-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1972). In addition, petitioner\n\nnow argues on appeal that the district court improperly denied his\n\nGiglio claim without adequate discovery.\n\n          The record indicates that on June 21, 1995, petitioner's\n\nhabeas counsel moved for leave to propound discovery. The magistrate\n\njudge ruled that petitioner's request was \"broad, burdensome on the\n\ngovernment and resembled a fishing expedition on the co-defendant's\n\ncase file.\" Accordingly, petitioner's attorney was instructed to\n\n\"identify those portions of the record relevant to his claims of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel or bias of the trial court.\"\n\nPetitioner was further advised that once the record was examined, a\n\nhearing, if necessary, could be held. Petitioner appealed the ruling,\n\nbut the district court affirmed. The district court order, dated\n\nJanuary 20, 1996, denied discovery relating to (1) an alleged delay in\n\nthe sentencing of petitioner's co-defendant, (2) ineffective assistance\n\nof trial counsel, and (3) the prosecution's trial strategy.\n\n          This notwithstanding, an evidentiary hearing was held before\n\nthe magistrate judge on April 19, 1996. At that hearing, counsel for\n\npetitioner was given the opportunity to question Benito M. Rodríguez-\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMassó, petitioner's trial counsel, in relation to petitioner's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim. After the presentation of\n\nadditional witnesses not relevant to this appeal, the magistrate judge\n\nheard oral argument on petitioner's habeas claims. Following oral\n\nargument, the judge denied from the bench petitioner's request for\n\ndisclosure of additional information pertaining to the confidential\n\ninformant.\n\n          On February 24, 1997, petitioner, through counsel, filed a\n\nMotion Requesting Ruling on Pending Discovery Motions. The magistrate\n\njudge issued a written order on March 14, 1997, stating \"we conclude\n\nthat petitioner's . . . request is MOOT inasmuch as the discovery\n\nrequested has been provided, thus his reiterated petitions for what he\n\nhas already received are frivolous.\" The court reasoned, in part,\n\nthat:\n\n          [E]ven though the minutes of procedure do reflect\n          that discovery requests pertaining to the\n          existence and background of a confidential\n          informant were denied, it remains a fact that\n          throughout the evidentiary hearing attorney for\n          petitioner was given ample opportunity to examine\n          trial attorney Benito Rodríguez-Massó on issues\n          such as: trial strategy, existence of an\n          informant, available information regarding the\n          informant, pretrial motions filed, plea\n          agreements, the individuals present at the\n          sentencing hearing, the sentencing court's\n          demeanor and the existence of a cooperating co-\n          defendant . . . . Thus, it is patently clear\n          that petitioner's prior requests for discovery\n          (except for a request to submit interrogatories\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          to the government and depose the co-defendant)\n          were satisfied during the hearing.\n\nThe court added the following:\n\n          Through his broad, general requests for\n          discovery, counsel has repeatedly violated the\n          provisions of Rule 6(b) of the 28 U.S.C. § 2255\n          Rules, which mandate that discovery requests be\n          specific as to the documents sought. The court\n          will not allow counsel to engage in a fishing\n          expedition, absent some showing by him that: 1)\n          petitioner's claims can remotely entitle him to\n          relief; and 2) the evidence specifically\n          requested provides support to those claims.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382751\"><a href=\"/opinion/382751/richard-francis-devincent-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146\n          (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n          Shortly thereafter, on March 27, 1998, the magistrate judge\n\nissued its report and recommendation that petitioner's § 2255 motion be\n\ndenied. On January 13, 1999, the district court issued an opinion and\n\norder adopting the report and recommendation. On the same day, the\n\ncourt entered judgment dismissing the case. The instant appeal ensued.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n          Petitioner claims that his trial counsel's alleged failure\n\nto obtain information regarding the identity, whereabouts, and criminal\n\nrecord of the confidential informant in this case constitutes\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.       We disagree.\n\n          To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,\n\npetitioner \"has the burden of showing that (1) counsel's performance\n\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\freasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the\n\nproceedings would have been different.\" Smullen v.

In this regard, this Court has previously stated that \"[t]he\n\ndecision whether to call a particular witness is almost always\n\nstrategic, requiring a balancing of the benefits and risks of the\n\nanticipated testimony.\" Lema v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601483\"><a href=\"/opinion/601483/charles-d-lema-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n          Here, the record clearly demonstrates that petitioner's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim is untenable. Petitioner's\n\ntrial attorney, Rodríguez-Massó, testified before the magistrate judge\n\nthat, contrary to petitioner's assertion, he knew the identity of the\n\nconfidential informant.     He explained that the identity of the\n\ninformant had been provided to attorney Rafael Anglada, petitioner's\n\noriginal trial counsel. Mr. Rodríguez further testified that prior to\n\ntrial he ascertained that the informant was not willing to testify on\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbehalf of the defense. Accordingly, Mr. Rodríguez believed that \"any\n\ninformation, if at all, that [the informant] would have given at trial\n\nwould have been not to [petitioner's] benefit but to [his] detriment.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances, and given the fact that petitioner's co-\n\ndefendant had agreed to testify for the government, Mr. Rodríguez\n\ndetermined that it was best \"as a matter of legal strategy\" not to call\n\nthe informant as a trial witness. In addition, Mr. Rodríguez stated\n\nthat although he was not aware of the informant's criminal record,\n\nwhich consisted of two complaints pertaining to domestic violence, he\n\nwould not have called the informant to testify even if he had seen\n\nthose records prior to trial.\n\n          Given this evidence, the district court correctly determined\n\nthat trial counsel's decision not to personally interview the informant\n\nor call him as a trial witness was purely strategic in nature. This\n\nclaim, therefore, cannot succeed.

Giglio Claim\n\n          Petitioner next argues that an alleged delay in the\n\nsentencing of the cooperating co-defendant Martínez prejudiced him\n\ninasmuch as the lenient sentence Martínez received for his cooperation\n\ncould have been used by petitioner to impeach Martínez at trial. Once\n\nagain, we see no merit in this argument.\n\n          The government has a constitutional duty to disclose evidence\n\nthat is favorable to a criminal defendant, be it exculpatory or\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fimpeachment evidence.

While Martínez did indicate that two\n\nof the counts in his indictment were to be dismissed in exchange for\n\nhis guilty plea, he clarified that the dismissal of the two counts was\n\nnot contingent on his testifying in court.      The copy of the plea\n\nagreement, submitted by petitioner, confirms this testimony. Martínez\n\nalso indicated that a prior statement he made which exculpated\n\npetitioner was not true. He explained that he had made the prior false\n\nstatement under pressure from petitioner to assume responsibility for\n\nthe crimes in exchange for a car and other assistance.\n\n          There is no question that Martínez ultimately benefitted\n\nfrom the government's sentencing recommendation, adopted by the\n\nsentencing court, that a downward departure from the Sentencing\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fGuidelines was warranted in light of Martínez's substantial assistance.\n\nNevertheless, we concur with the district court's conclusion that\n\n\"[t]he evidence presented at trial shows that [petitioner's]\n\ncodefendant did not receive a promise of leniency in exchange for his\n\ntestimony.\" Tuesta-Toro v. United States, No. 95-1522, slip op. at 7-8\n\n(D.P.R. January 11, 1999).    This finding forecloses petitioner's\n\nargument. Where, as here, the record clearly indicates that there was\n\nno suppression of exculpatory or impeachment evidence by the\n\nprosecution, a Giglio claim fails as a matter of law.\n\n          While we need look no further to reject petitioner's claim,\n\nwe note that petitioner has also failed to make the showing of\n\nmateriality required under Brady.
