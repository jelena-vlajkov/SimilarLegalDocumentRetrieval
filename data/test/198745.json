Gargiulo, Marielise\r\nKelly, and Gargiulo, Rudnick &amp; Gargiulo were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 14, 1999\r\n\n               \r\n\n   *Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  This appeal arises from\r\ntwo interpretations of the Massachusetts Automobile Dealers' Act by\r\nthe district court.  Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93B,  4 (West 1997)\r\n(the Act).  \r\nThe district court ruled that under  4(3)(l) of the Act\r\nthe relevant market area of an automobile dealer is \"a circle, with\r\nthe dealer at the center, circumscribing the geographical area\r\ncomprising either two-thirds of the dealer's new vehicle sales or\r\ntwo-thirds of its service sales, whichever is smaller.\"  The\r\ndistrict court also ruled that  4(3)(l) is the sole provision\r\nwithin the Act under which an aggrieved dealer may seek relief from\r\nan alleged arbitrary prospective dealership placement.  The\r\nappellants, Bernardi Honda and Lundgren Honda, are dealers within\r\nthe definition of the Act.\r\nWe have decided to certify both issues to the Supreme\r\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts.\r\n                              I.\r\nOn March 3, 1998, the appellee, American Honda Motor Co.,\r\nInc., notified both dealers that it intended to award a new Honda\r\ndealership in Westborough, Massachusetts, to three named\r\nindividuals.  The dealers were also notified that Honda intended to\r\nenter into a dealer agreement with the named individuals on or\r\nafter May 15, 1999.  The dealers timely notified Honda as required\r\nby  4(3)(l) of the Act, that they were going to protest the\r\nestablishment of the new dealership.\r\nHonda then filed separate but identical declaratory\r\njudgment actions under 28 U.S.C.  2201(a) seeking a declaratory\r\njudgment that neither dealer had standing to protest the proposed\r\nnew dealership in Westborough or alternatively that the proposed\r\nnew dealership was not arbitrary, improper, or otherwise in\r\nviolation of  4(3)(l) of the Act.  \r\nThe dealers asserted identical counterclaims against\r\nHonda.  Count I alleged that the new proposed dealership would be\r\nan arbitrary, unfair, and/or deceptive act in violation of\r\n4(3)(1) of the Act.\r\nCount II alleged that Honda was impermissibly retaliating\r\nagainst the dealers in violation of the general provisions of  4\r\nof the Act.  The dealers claimed that Honda sought to punish them\r\nbecause of their participation in multi-district litigation against\r\nHonda for conducting its business through a pattern of racketeering\r\nin violation of the civil RICO Act, 18 U.S.C.  1962 et seq.   The\r\nmulti-district litigation was settled in the U.S. District Court\r\nfor Maryland for a $330 million payment by Honda.  \r\n\n                             II.\r\nThe statutory definition of an automobile dealer's\r\nrelevant market area is found in paragraph five of  4(3)(1) of the\r\nAct:\r\n  As used in this subsection, the relevant\r\nmarket area of a motor vehicle dealer with\r\nrespect to any given line make is the more\r\nnarrowly defined and circumscribed\r\ngeographical area immediately surrounding its\r\nexisting dealer location within which it\r\nobtained, during the period of time the\r\ndealership business has been operated from\r\nsaid location or the three-year period\r\nimmediately preceding the date of said notice\r\nof intent to grant or enter into an additional\r\nfranchise or selling agreement, whichever is\r\nthe lesser, at least two-thirds of (i) its\r\nretail sales of new motor vehicles of said\r\nline make or (ii) its retail service sales,\r\n. . . .\r\n\nThe district court ruled:\r\n  [T]his language defines a dealer's RMA as a\r\ncircle, with the dealer at the center,\r\ncircumscribing the geographical area\r\ncomprising either two-thirds of the dealer's\r\nnew vehicle sales or two-thirds of its service\r\nsales, whichever is smaller.\r\n\nThe court considered the dealers' argument that the\r\nrelevant market area \"may consist of an irregular shape as long as\r\nthat shape accurately reflects two-thirds of new vehicles or\r\nservice sales.\"  It rejected this contention based upon\r\nMassachusetts case law.\r\n  In support of their argument, the dealer's \r\n[sic] rely heavily on Ricky Smith Pontiac,\r\nInc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 14 Mass.\r\nApp. Ct. 396 (1982), and Subaru of New\r\nEngland, Inc. v. Subaru of Wakefield, Inc.,\r\nNo. Civ. A. 96-01475, 1997 WL 572934 (Mass.\r\nSuper. Sept. 15, 1997).\r\n\n     Ricky Smith, is not directly analogous to\r\nthis case because an earlier version of c. 93B\r\n(the \"previous statute\") enacted in 1970, with\r\na substantively different definition of RMA,\r\napplied to that case.  14 Mass. App. Ct. at\r\n405-406 (\"[w]e are also satisfied . . . that\r\n[the judge] sought to decide the case upon the\r\ngoverning \"equitable principles\" standard\r\nenunciated in the 1970 statute despite his\r\nreference to the existence of an independent\r\nviolation of the 1977 statute\").  The previous\r\nstatute permitted the court to consider\r\nequitable factors in defining a dealer's RMA. \r\nIn 1977, however, c. 93B was amended, and the\r\ndefinition of RMA was changed to the existing\r\n\"bright line test,\" which excludes the\r\nconsideration of equitable factors.  See Tober\r\nForeign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter Oldsmobile,\r\nInc., 376 Mass. 313, 331-332 (1978); Ricky\r\nSmith, 14 Mass. App. Ct. at 414-415.\r\n\n     The dealers' argument also relies in part\r\non dicta from Ricky Smith that is taken out of\r\ncontext.  In Ricky Smith, 14 Mass. App. Ct. at\r\n421 n.28, after referring to a trial exhibit\r\ndepicting an oversimplified version of the\r\nplaintiff-dealers' RMA's, the court noted in\r\ndicta that \"[i]n fact, of course, each\r\ndealer's area would probably be irregular in\r\nshape.\"  This was not, as the dealers in this\r\ncase argue, a general statement regarding the\r\nmanner in which RMA's should be drawn under\r\nthe amended statute.  Rather, when read in\r\ncontext, this language pertained specifically\r\nto the plaintiff-dealers' RMA's, in that case,\r\nwhich were calculated by the superior court\r\njudge after considering equitable factors\r\nunder the previous statute.  The above-quoted\r\ndicta in Ricky Smith, therefore, does not\r\napply to this case, in which, the dealers'\r\nRMA's must be defined without consideration of\r\nequitable factors and in accordance with the\r\namended statute.\r\n\n     Similarly, the dealers' reliance on the\r\nSubaru case is misplaced.  In Subaru, 1997 WL\r\n572934 at *10 n.4, in dicta in a footnote, the\r\nsuperior court cited to the dicta in Ricky\r\nSmith, 14 Mass. App. Ct. at 421 n. 28, as the\r\nsole support for its statement that a RMA\r\nunder the amended statute need not be a circle\r\nwith the dealer at the center.  For the\r\nreasons previously stated, this court\r\nrespectfully finds that Subaru represents a\r\nmisunderstanding of Ricky Smith.\r\n\nThe district court rebuffed the dealers' contention that,\r\nin addition to a circle, the relevant market area may be depicted\r\nas an oval around a polygon.  It stated:\r\n  The dealers do not, however, deal with the\r\nterm \"immediately\" as it is used in the\r\nstatute to modify the word \"surrounding.\" \r\nWhen the words \"circumscribed\" and\r\n\"immediately surrounding\" are read in context,\r\na circle is the only geometric shape that\r\nsatisfies the terms of the amended statute.\r\n\n     Moreover, defining RMA as a circle is in\r\nharmony with the Massachusetts opinions that\r\nhave held that the amended definition of RMA\r\nwas intended to create a bright line test. \r\nSee Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter\r\nOldsmobile, Inc., 376 Mass. 313, 331-332\r\n(1978) (\"The 1977 revision sets out a quite\r\nsharp definition which may somewhat sacrifice\r\ntheoretical correctness to ease of practical\r\napplication\"); Ricky Smith, 14 Mass. App. Ct.\r\nat 414-415 (\"the formula definition [under the\r\namended statute] creates a bright line test\r\nwhich substantively changes the equitable\r\nprinciples standard in the 1970 statute\").\r\n\nCiting to Beard Motors, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Distrib.,\r\nInc., 395 Mass. 428, 433 (1985), the court acknowledged that the\r\npurpose of the Act was \"to protect motor vehicle franchises from\r\ninjury by their affiliated manufacturers which hold greater power\r\nthan the franchisees.\"  It then stated:\r\n  The 1977 amendment to c. 93B, however, was\r\nintended to make the statute easier to apply,\r\neven if \"theoretical correctness\" was\r\nsacrificed for \"ease of practical\r\napplication.\"  See Tober, 376 Mass. At 331-32. \r\nDefining RMA as a circle is certainly easier\r\nto apply than choosing among any number of\r\npossible \"polygons\" that may represent two-\r\nthirds of a dealers new car or service sales,\r\nand, therefore, is consistent with the intent\r\nof the 1977 amendment. \r\n\nThe court then considered alternative arguments made by\r\nthe dealers.\r\n     Rather than defining RMA as a circle, the\r\ndealers argue that \"the proper method to\r\ndetermine the RMA is to list, in descending\r\norder of frequency, the towns or zip codes in\r\nwhich the dealer sells or services the most\r\nnew cars until two-thirds of those sales or\r\nservice transactions are reached.\"  Moreover,\r\nin their supplemental expert report, the\r\ndealers suggest for the first time that the\r\nnumber of customers may be an appropriate\r\nmethod for determining sales for the purpose\r\nof calculating a dealer's RMA.  The language\r\nof  4(3)(l), however, precludes the dealers'\r\nargument.\r\n\n     Nowhere in  4(3)(l) is there any mention\r\nof an analysis of zip codes.  In addition, the\r\ndealers' methodology for calculating a RMA\r\nresults in highly irregular shapes, which\r\ncannot be reconciled with  4(3)(l)'s language\r\nrequiring a RMA to immediately surround and\r\ncircumscribe a dealer.  Furthermore,\r\nconsideration of the number of customers as a\r\nbasis for computing sales is inconsistent with\r\nthe language of the statute.  Section 4(3)(l), \r\nexpressly requires that a RMA be based upon a\r\ndealer's \"sales of new motor vehicles\" or its\r\n\"service sales,\" and makes no reference to the\r\nnumber of customers of a dealer.  M.G.L. c.\r\n93B,  4(3)(l), par. 5.\r\n\n   . . . .\r\n\n    Although not at issue here, the dealers\r\nargue that a RMA should not be defined as a\r\ncircle because, for a dealer located on the\r\neast coast of Massachusetts, the RMA would\r\nencompass the Atlantic Ocean.  This argument,\r\nhowever, is unconvincing.  For a coastal\r\ndealer, the RMA will still be a circle with\r\nthe dealer at the center.  The radius of the\r\ncircle, however, will extend as far as\r\nnecessary over land until the portion of the\r\ncircle over land circumscribes two-thirds of\r\nthe relevant sales for that dealer.\r\n\nAfter the district court's decision defining the relevant\r\nmarket area of a dealer under the Act, the parties entered into a\r\nconsent judgment providing that under the court's definition the\r\ndealers lacked standing to contest the declaratory judgment action\r\nbrought by Honda.  This, of course, was subject to the dealer's\r\nright to appeal.\r\n                             III.\r\nIn a subsequent opinion, the district court ruled:\r\n  [T]he court concludes that  4(3)(l) is the\r\nsole provision within c. 93B under which an\r\naggrieved dealer may seek relief from an\r\nalleged arbitrary prospective dealership\r\nplacement.\r\n\nIn making this ruling the district court relied on two\r\nMassachusetts cases:  Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. v. General Motors\r\nCorp., 378 Mass. 707 (1979); Richard Lundgren, Inc. v. American\r\nHonda Motor Co., 45 Mass. App. Ct. 410 (1998).  Neither of these\r\ncases explicitly hold as the district court did.  Compare  Subaru\r\nof New England, Inc. v. Subaru of Wakefield, Inc., at 9, No. 96-\r\n01475 (Mass. Super. Ct. Sep. 24, 1999) (establishing an irregularly\r\nshaped relevant market area) with Heritage Jeep-Eagle, Inc. v.\r\nChrysler Corp., at 7, NO. 93-3037-E (Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 26,\r\n1999) (defining relevant market area as a circle around the\r\ndealership).\r\n\n                             IV.\r\nWe are impelled to certify the two issues in this case\r\nfor the following reasons.  We have canvassed all of the relevant\r\nMassachusetts case law pertinent to the interpretation of Mass.\r\nGen. Laws Ann. ch. 94B,  4 and have not found any that decide the\r\ntwo issues before us.  There are no decisions of the Supreme\r\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts that are clear controlling\r\nprecedent.  Accordingly, in the interest of comity we certify the\r\nfollowing two questions to the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\nMassachusetts:\r\n1.  How should the relevant market area of a motor\r\nvehicle dealer be defined under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93B,\r\n4(3)(l)?\r\n2.  Is Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93B,  4(3)(l) the sole\r\nprovision within chapter 93B under which a motor vehicle dealer may\r\nseek relief from a prospective additional dealership which will\r\nsell the same motor vehicles as sold by the established motor\r\nvehicle dealer?\r\nWe, of course, will welcome the advice or comment of the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court on any other question of Massachusetts law\r\nit deems material to this case.\r\nThe clerk will transmit this question and our opinion on\r\nthis case, along with copies of the briefs, exhibits, and appendix\r\nto the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.  \r\nJurisdiction is retained.\n",

At 331-32. Defining RMA as a circle is certainly easier to apply than choosing among any number of possible \"polygons\" that may represent two-thirds of a dealers new car or service sales, and, therefore, is consistent with the intent of the 1977 amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then considered alternative arguments made by the dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than defining RMA as a circle, the dealers argue that \"the proper method to determine the RMA is to list, in descending order of frequency, the towns or zip codes in which the dealer sells or services the most new cars until two-thirds of those sales or service transactions are reached.\" Moreover, in their supplemental expert report, the dealers suggest for the first time that the number of customers may be an appropriate method for determining sales for the purpose of calculating a dealer's RMA.

In addition, the dealers' methodology for calculating a RMA results in highly irregular shapes, which cannot be reconciled with &#167; 4(3)(l)'s language requiring a RMA to immediately surround and circumscribe a dealer. Furthermore, consideration of the number of customers as a basis for computing sales is inconsistent with the language of the statute. Section 4(3)(l), expressly requires that a RMA be based upon a dealer's \"sales of new motor vehicles\" or its \"service sales,\" and makes no reference to the number of customers of a dealer.

This argument, however, is unconvincing. For a coastal dealer, the RMA will still be a circle with the dealer at the center. The radius of the circle, however, will extend as far as necessary over land until the portion of the circle over land circumscribes two-thirds of the relevant sales for that dealer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court's decision defining the relevant market area of a dealer under the Act, the parties entered into a consent judgment providing that under the court's definition the dealers lacked standing to contest the declaratory judgment action brought by Honda.

M.G.L. c. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(l), par. 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not at issue here, the dealers argue that a RMA should not be defined as a circle because, for a dealer located on the east coast of Massachusetts, the RMA would encompass the Atlantic Ocean. This argument, however, is unconvincing. For a coastal dealer, the RMA will still be a circle with the dealer at the center. The radius of the circle, however, will extend as far as necessary over land until the portion of the circle over land circumscribes two-thirds of the relevant sales for that dealer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court's decision defining the relevant market area of a dealer under the Act, the parties entered into a consent judgment providing that under the court's definition the dealers lacked standing to contest the declaratory judgment action brought by Honda. This, of course, was subject to the dealer's right to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a subsequent opinion, the district court ruled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he court concludes that &#167; 4(3)(l) is the sole provision within c. 93B under which an aggrieved dealer may seek relief from an alleged arbitrary prospective dealership placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making this ruling the district court relied on two Massachusetts cases: Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2082748\"><a href=\"/opinion/2082748/reiter-oldsmobile-inc-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span> </a></span>(1979); Richard Lundgren, Inc. v. American Honda Motor Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass. App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span> </span>(1998). Neither of these cases explicitly hold as the district court did. Compare  Subaru of New England, Inc. v. Subaru of Wakefield, Inc., at 9, No. 96-01475 (Mass. Super. Ct. Sep. 24, 1999) (establishing an irregularly shaped relevant market area) with Heritage Jeep-Eagle, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., at 7, NO. 93-3037-E (Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 26, 1999) (defining relevant market area as a circle around the dealership).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are impelled to certify the two issues in this case for the following reasons. We have canvassed all of the relevant Massachusetts case law pertinent to the interpretation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94B, &#167; 4 and have not found any that decide the two issues before us. There are no decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that are clear controlling precedent. Accordingly, in the interest of comity we certify the following two questions to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. How should the relevant market area of a motor vehicle dealer be defined under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(l)?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Is Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(l) the sole provision within chapter 93B under which a motor vehicle dealer may seek relief from a prospective additional dealership which will sell the same motor vehicles as sold by the established motor vehicle dealer?We, of course, will welcome the advice or comment of the Supreme Judicial Court on any other question of Massachusetts law it deems material to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk will transmit this question and our opinion on this case, along with copies of the briefs, exhibits, and appendix to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jurisdiction is retained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The action against Lundgren Honda was brought in the Worcester Division of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
