GREEN, M.D.,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                 v.\n\nJOHN O'LEARY, individually and in his official capacity, and JEFFREY\n      HUTNICK, individually and in his official capacity,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Stahl, Circuit Judge,\n                  Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Harvey A. Schwartz, with whom William C. Taussig and Schwartz,\nShaw and Griffith were on brief, for appellant.\n     Michael J. Akerson, with whom George F. Driscoll, Jr., Office of\nTown Counsel, Austin M. Joyce, and Edward P. Reardon, P.C., were on\nbrief, for appellees John O'Leary and Jeffrey Hutnick.\n\fJune 8, 2000\n\f          Per Curiam. On June 1, 1995, two Brookline police officers\n\nescorted Dr. Mark D. Green to Massachusetts General Hospital where he\n\nunderwent a psychiatric evaluation. Although he was not committed, the\n\nexamination triggered an inquiry into his suitability to practice\n\nmedicine. His license was eventually suspended by the Massachusetts\n\nBoard of Registration in Medicine.      Green brought suit, claiming\n\nviolations of state law and his civil rights.\n\n          Green now appeals from an order of the district court\n\ngranting summary judgment for the defendants on all claims. After a\n\nthorough review of the record and of the parties' submissions, we\n\naffirm.   We do so essentially for the reasons elucidated in the\n\ndistrict court's opinion, as the judges of the panel hold a variety of\n\nviews regarding the proper grounds for affirming summary judgment.\n\n          Affirmed.    Local Rule 27.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f",
