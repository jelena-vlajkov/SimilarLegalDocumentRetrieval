Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\f     Jorge Carazo-Quetglas and Toledo Toledo & Carazo-Quetglas,\nP.S.C. on brief for appellant.\n     Ricardo F. Casellas and Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez, LLP.\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        August 1, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam.        The appellants, Jose Vargas-de-Leon,\n\nd/b/a    Jomar    Packaging    Corp.,       Vargas's    wife,    and   their\n\nconjugal relationship (hereinafter referred to collectively\n\nas   \"Jomar\"),     have   appealed      a    district    court    judgment\n\ndismissing their complaint with prejudice for non-compliance\n\nwith discovery requests and failure timely to comply with a\n\ncourt order forewarning of severe consequences for non-\n\ncompliance.        The    appellee,      Kobel     International,      Inc.\n\n(\"Kobel\"), has moved for summary disposition of this appeal.\n\nUpon review of the parties' brief and the record below, we\n\ngrant the motion and summarily affirm essentially for the\n\nreasons stated by the district court in its opinion and\n\norder,    dated    June    30,    1999,      and   its    order    denying\n\nreconsideration, dated October 25, 1999.\n\n           We add only the following. In its appellate brief,\n\nJomar persists in contending that \"extremely protracted\n\ninaction\" did not exist.         But it focuses solely on what it\n\nterms a \"short\" delay in responding to the court's December\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f 15, 1998 order directing it to comply with the discovery\n\n requests within five days of notice of the order.                         And, it\n\n contends it was denied due process because, it alleges, the\n\n district court failed to consider the reason given for this\n\n \"short\" delay (clerical staff Christmas vacation).                           Jomar\n\n ignores completely, however, its inaction from May 22, 1998,\n\n the    date    by   which      it   promised       to    provide    the    amended\n\n responses,         and    December     31,     1998,       when    it     provided\n\n apparently simply a rehash of its previously inadequate\n\n responses.1         And it ignores its inaction in failing to\n\n respond to Kobel's repeated motions to compel.                      Rather than\n\n fail   to     consider     Jomar's     excuse       for    the    delay   between\n\n December 22 (the due date set by the December 15 order) and\n\n December 31, the district court's opinion more reasonably\n\n suggests      that       the   district      court        found    that     excuse\n\n unpersuasive and largely irrelevant in the face of Jomar's\n\n pattern       of    extended        delay    for        which    Jomar    had   no\n\n explanation.\n\n\n\n\n    1The May 22 date was, itself, an extended deadline.    The\nresponses were due March 9, 1998. That deadline was ignored by\nJomar and the date for amended responses extended at Jomar's\nrequest to May 22.\n\n                                        -4-\n\f             Jomar reiterates that it did not disobey \"repeated\"\n\ncourt orders, but only a single court order.           Apart from the\n\nfact that a litigant has no free pass to violate one court\n\norder, Jomar ignores that its failure timely to comply with\n\nthe court order was but part of the basis for the dismissal.\n\nJomar's contention that the district court was required to\n\nprovide it with a hearing prior to the dismissal of the\n\ncomplaint is frivolous.     Apparently, Jomar refers to an oral\n\nhearing.     But, Jomar was forewarned that failure to comply\n\nwith the discovery requests would result in \"the most severe\n\nsanctions\" and it certainly had a fair chance to be heard on\n\nthe moving papers -- an opportunity which Jomar more often\n\nthan   not   neglected.    It   is    rather    bold   to   thereafter\n\ncriticize the district court for failing to summon the\n\nparties for an oral hearing.         Cf. Spiller v. U.S.V. Labs.,\n\nInc., 842 F.2d 535, 538 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"Lack of a hearing\n\ndoes not offend due process where the plaintiff had ample\n\nwarning of the consequences of his failure to comply with\n\ncourt orders.\").\n\n             Finally, Jomar reiterates that the sanction of\n\ndismissal with prejudice is harsh.              While true, it is,\n\nnonetheless, a permitted sanction.             See Damiani v. Rhode\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fIsland Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1983); Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 37(b)(2)(C).          Jomar contends that the district court was\n\nobliged, and failed, to consider a lesser sanction.                  Jomar,\n\nwhich repeatedly ignored (a) discovery deadlines, even one\n\nto   which    it    had     agreed,    and     (b)   motions   to    compel\n\ncompliance, prompting (c) a court order, which was not\n\ntimely complied with and then apparently not in an adequate\n\nfashion, is in a poor position to argue that a lesser\n\nsanction would have prompted it to take the appropriate\n\ninterest in litigating its case.                There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion     in    the    district     court's     dismissal      of   this\n\ncomplaint.         See   National     Hockey   League   v.   Metropolitan\n\nHockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, 642 (1976) (per curiam).\n\n             The motion for summary disposition is granted and\n\nthe appeal is summarily affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",
