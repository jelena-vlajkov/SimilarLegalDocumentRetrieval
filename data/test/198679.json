Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Begashaw Ayele on brief pro se.\r\n   Andrew C. Pickett, Christopher J. Campbell and Jackson, Lewis,\r\nSchnitzler &amp; Krupman on brief for appellees.\r\n\nOctober 13, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Pro se plaintiff Begashaw Ayele appeals\r\na district court order that granted the defendants summary\r\njudgment on his claim that the defendants violated Title VII by\r\nfailing to reasonably accommodate his request to have Sundays\r\noff from his job as a parking cashier.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-\r\n(a)(2), (j).  Plaintiff further contends that he was unlawfully\r\ndischarged in retaliation for filing a complaint with the EEOC.\r\n          We have thoroughly reviewed the record and the\r\nparties' briefs on appeal.  Where it is undisputed that the\r\ndefendants transferred plaintiff to a position that eliminated\r\nhis religious conflict and that plaintiff rejected the new\r\nposition, we agree with the district court that the issue is\r\nwhether the new position amounted to an accommodation of\r\nAyele's religious beliefs that was reasonable.  See 42 U.S.C.\r\n 2000e(j).  To be reasonable the accommodation, as the\r\ndistrict court explained, need not measure up to plaintiff's\r\npreferences, but it must be sufficiently comparable to the\r\noriginal position to amount to a reasonable alternative.  See,\r\ne.g., Rodriguez v. City of Chicago, 156 F.2d 771, 775-76 (7th\r\nCir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1038 (1999); Wright v.\r\nRunyon, 2 F.3d 214, 217 (7th Cir. 1993); Cook v. Lindsay Olive\r\nGrowers, 911 F.2d 233, 241 (9th Cir. 1990).  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court that, while comparability of two jobs might\r\nusually be a factual issue requiring determination by a\r\nfactfinder, Ayele here has failed to proffer adequate\r\nadmissible evidence so as to create such an issue.  We agree\r\nwith the court that no material factual issue as to a purported\r\npay differential or other purported disadvantages has been\r\nraised. Moreover, the record fails as a matter of law to\r\nsupport plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim.  See, e.g., \r\nGreenberg v. Union Camp Corp., 48 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 1995);\r\nMesnick v. General Electric Co., 950 F.2d 828-29 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).    \r\n          The numerous other claims of error that Ayele\r\nascribes to the district court are patently meritless. \r\nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed\r\nsubstantially for the reasons stated by the district judge. \r\nSee Local Rule 27.1.  \n",
