William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n                       ____________________\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n              and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n                      _____________________\n\n     Owen S. Walker, Federal Defender Office, for appellant.\n     Victor A. Wild, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Donald K.\nStern, United States Attorney, and Paul G. Levenson, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                       ____________________\n\n\n*   Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f    July 12, 2000\n____________________\n\n\n\n\n        -2-\n\f          SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge. Ambrose Devaney appeals\n\nfrom the denial of his § 2255 motion charging ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel in his earlier trial in which he was convicted of conspiracy,\n\nfraud and money laundering charges.     Following affirmance of the\n\nconviction, see United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223 (1st Cir. 1995),\n\nDevaney filed the instant motion.\n\n          Briefly stated, the relevant facts are as follows. Four days\n\nbefore the scheduled trial date, Devaney appeared before the district\n\ncourt and requested leave to change counsel and a continuance of the\n\ntrial to allow his proposed new counsel time to prepare for trial.\n\nDevaney asserted that his present counsel had geared his defense solely\n\nto making a deal with the government, that they did not have an\n\naccurate grasp of the case, and that they could not protect him. The\n\ncourt denied the request to delay the trial, observing that Devaney's\n\ncounsel were competent and skilled attorneys who had adequately\n\nrepresented him up to now and appeared to be well prepared for trial.\n\nThe court noted further that it considered the request to be an effort\n\nto obtain the severance that had previously been denied.\n\n          The case proceeded to trial at which the jury found Devaney\n\nguilty on one count of conspiracy, three counts of bank fraud, and one\n\ncount of money laundering but acquitted him on three bank fraud counts\n\nand three money laundering counts. We affirmed the conviction but did\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fnot rule on Devaney's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See\n\nSmith, 46 F.3d at 1236.\n\n          Devaney then filed the instant motion on the ground of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied the\n\nmotion without a hearing on April 16, 1999, see Devaney v. United\n\nStates, 47 F. Supp. 2d 130 (D. Mass. 1999), and granted a certificate\n\nof appealability. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and\n\n2253, and we affirm.\n\n          Devaney argues first that the district court erred in\n\ndismissing the motion because, in denying his request for a\n\ncontinuance, it had failed to let him explain the substance of his\n\ncomplaints about his counsel.      Devaney cites United States v.\n\nProchilo, 187 F.3d 221 (1st Cir. 1999), in support. Prochilo held that\n\n\"[w]here the accused voices objections to appointed counsel, the trial\n\ncourt should inquire into the reasons for dissatisfaction.\" Id. at\n\n225, citing United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\nBecause the district court in Prochilo denied the motion for a\n\ncontinuance to permit a substitution of counsel without hearing or\n\nother inquiry, the judgment was reversed. Id. Unlike in Prochilo,\n\nhere the district court held a hearing to inquire into Devaney's\n\nrequest and after hearing from Devaney, determined that good cause did\n\nnot exist for continuing the trial date.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          We review the district court's ruling for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.\n\n1986). We take into account the trial court's discretion to balance\n\nthe defendant's interest in retaining counsel of his choice against\n\n\"the public's interest in the prompt, fair and ethical administration\n\nof justice.\" United States v. Richardson, 894 F.2d 492, 495 (1st Cir.\n\n1990). Considering the untimeliness of the request for continuance,\n\nthe fact that the court gave Devaney an opportunity to state the\n\ngrounds for his dissatisfaction, the lack of substance of the stated\n\ngrounds, and the circumstances of Devaney's request which raised a\n\nsuspicion that it was not in good faith, we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          Devaney's second ground of appeal is that, because factual\n\ndisputes existed, the district court erred in denying the motion\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing. \"[E]videntiary hearings on motions are\n\nthe exception, not the rule . . . .       Thus, a party seeking an\n\nevidentiary hearing must carry a fairly heavy burden of demonstrating\n\na need for special treatment.\" United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223,\n\n225 (1st Cir. 1993). The court acted well within its discretion in\n\ndenying the motion without a hearing, particularly considering that\n\nDevaney did not request one. In a thorough opinion, the court reviewed\n\nthe submissions in support of the motion and found that they did not\n\nentitle Devaney to relief. See Devaney, 47 F. Supp. 2d at 132-33. The\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fcourt, moreover, was well-situated to assess the ineffectiveness of\n\ncounsel claim, having presided over the trial. See McGill, 11 F.3d at\n\n225.   We find no error.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the denial of the motion is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
