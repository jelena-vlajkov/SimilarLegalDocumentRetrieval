D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Stahl, Circuit Judge\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thad B.

This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether the district court properly issued a Railway Labor Act\n\n(\"RLA\") injunction barring a wood products company controlled by\n\nowners of a railroad from doing switching work historically\n\nperformed by the railroad's unions.              See 45 U.S.C. ยง 151 and\n\nseq. The district court issued the injunction after finding that\n\nthe      Brotherhood    of     Locomotive        Engineers     and    United\n\nTransportation Union (the \"Unions\") were engaged in a \"major\"\n\ndispute      with      Springfield         Terminal    Railway       Company\n\n(\"Springfield\") and that Springfield was using Aroostook and\n\nBangor    Resources,    Inc.    (\"ABR\")     to   violate     its   collective\n\nbargaining agreement.        Springfield and ABR (the \"appellants\")\n\nargue that ABR, although owned and controlled by Springfield's\n\nowners, is an independent wood products company not subject to\n\nthe RLA and therefore not subject to the district court's order\n\nthat it stop performing switching for Springfield customers\n\nwhile RLA mediation procedures are underway.                  We reject the\n\ncontention that ABR is not subject to the injunctive provisions\n\nof the RLA, and we affirm both the district court's finding that\n\nthere was a \"major\" dispute between Springfield and its Unions\n\nand the district court's injunction against ABR.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f                                         I.\n\nA. The Labor Dispute\n\n            We begin by sketching the facts of this labor dispute,\n\nreserving for later a more detailed discussion of the district\n\ncourt's findings.        In doing so, \"[w]e recite the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the district court's findings of fact.\"\n\nServicos Comerciales Andinos v. General Electric Del Caribe,\n\nInc., 145 F.3d 463, 466 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            In   1995    the    Unions     and   Springfield       negotiated     a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement that governs the rates of pay,\n\nrules,     and   working    conditions         for     Springfield    locomotive\n\nengineers, conductors, and trainmen. The agreement specifically\n\nprovides    that   union       employees      \"shall    perform    any    and   all\n\nservices under the direct control of the Carrier required for\n\nthe make up of trains and/or the movement of cars and trains\n\nover and through the Carrier's trackage and in its business of\n\nservicing industrial sidings.\"\n\n            One such \"business of servicing industrial sidings\" is\n\nswitching, a service that rail carriers often provide for their\n\ncustomers on the customers' properties.                  Springfield employees\n\nwho are union members have historically provided this service to\n\nmany of Springfield's line-haul railway customers.                   Pursuant to\n\nthe   collective        bargaining       agreement,       the     union   members\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fperforming these switching services have been paid and treated\n\nidentically to engineers, conductors, and trainmen involved in\n\nother aspects of Springfield's railway business.\n\n            In 1996 Springfield proposed that the union members\n\nengaged in switching accept a twenty-six percent pay cut and less\n\nfavorable working conditions.              Although the Unions' leaders\n\ninitially resisted, they eventually agreed to submit a proposed\n\npay cut to their respective memberships.         The memberships of both\n\nUnions rejected the changes in August 1996, opting instead to\n\nmaintain the more favorable terms of the collective bargaining\n\nagreement.     Despite the vote, Springfield persisted in seeking a\n\npay cut for switching work.\n\n            Unable to persuade the Unions to accept lower pay for\n\nswitching, Springfield took a series of steps in the spring of\n\n1998   that    resulted   in   ABR    performing    switching   that     had\n\npreviously been done by Springfield's unions.               ABR is a non-\n\nunionized     company   located   along     Springfield's   railway    lines\n\nengaged primarily in the manufacture of clothes pins and other\n\nwood products.      Springfield executed an agreement with ABR in\n\nApril 1998 giving ABR joint use of some railway tracks, and\n\nSpringfield personnel trained two non-union ABR employees to use\n\na leased track-mobile to perform the switching at the ABR wood\n\nproducts mill previously done by Springfield's union employees.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fWhile joint use agreements of this type are fairly common in the\n\nrailway industry, Springfield's next move was unusual.        Shortly\n\nafter executing the joint use agreement, Springfield suggested to\n\nABR that it truck its switching equipment from place to place so\n\nthat it could perform switching work for various Springfield\n\nrailway customers that had previously used Springfield (and the\n\nUnions) for switching.         ABR agreed and by May of 1998 it was\n\nproviding switching services for Springfield customers Lincoln\n\nPulp & Paper (\"Lincoln\") and Passadumkeag Stud Mill, owned by\n\nChampion International, Inc. (\"Champion\"). ABR also investigated\n\nperforming switching work for other Springfield customers.\n\n         Although nominally an independent corporation, ABR is\n\nnot unrelated to Springfield.         Springfield is a wholly owned\n\nsubsidiary      of     Guilford   Transportation   Industries,   Inc.\n\n(\"Guilford\"), a holding company that owns several railroads in\n\nNew England.1        Guilford, in turn, was closely held (at the time\n\nof the dispute) by four individuals who also served as its\n\ndirectors: David Andrew Fink, David Armstrong Fink, Richard Kelso\n\nand Timothy Mellon.        Both of the Finks and Mellon were also the\n\nsole owners of ABR.        The three companies shared the same four\n\ndirectors at the time the dispute arose: all three ABR owners\n\n\n\n    1Guilford's holdings include the Maine Central Railway, the\nPortland Terminal Company and the Boston & Maine Corporation.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fplus Richard Kelso.       While David Andrew Fink served as President\n\nof   Springfield,   his     son,    David       Armstrong   Fink,   served    as\n\nPresident of ABR (as well as a Director of Guilford and, later,\n\nas an Executive Vice-President at Springfield).                   It was David\n\nArmstrong Fink who met with a Springfield vice-president involved\n\nin the failed labor negotiations about the possibility of ABR\n\nperforming the switching work previously done by the Unions.\n\nB. The Railway Labor Act\n\n           The Unions filed suit under the RLA, arguing that\n\nSpringfield was using ABR to violate the terms of its collective\n\nbargaining agreement. Under the RLA, a district court has no\n\njurisdiction to rule on the merits of a labor dispute.                 Rather,\n\nthe court may only decide what type of statutorily mandated\n\ndispute resolution procedure is appropriate, depending on the\n\ncategory of the dispute.       See Elgin, Joilet & E. Ry. v. Burley,\n\n325 U.S. 711, 722-23 (1945).             Minor disputes under the RLA are\n\nthose in which the carrier's challenged policies are at least\n\narguably   permitted   under       the    existing    collective    bargaining\n\nagreement.2    If   the    dispute       is    \"minor,\"   the   district   court\n\n\n     2A minor dispute\n\n     contemplates the existence of a collective agreement\n     already concluded or, at any rate, a situation in\n     which no effort is made to bring about a formal change\n     in terms or to create a new one. The dispute relates\n     either to the meaning or proper application of a\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdismisses the case in favor of binding arbitration.          Major\n\ndisputes, on the other hand, relate to carrier attempts to modify\n\nrates of pay, rules or working conditions in a fashion not even\n\narguably covered by the collective bargaining agreement. 3     See\n\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs v. Boston & Maine Corp., 788\n\nF.2d 794, 797 (1st Cir. 1986); Maine Central R.R., Co. v. United\n\nTransp. Union, 787 F.2d 780, 782 (1st Cir. 1986).   If the dispute\n\nis \"major,\" the Act provides for extensive, non-binding mediation\n\nprocedures.4   In major disputesโ unlike minor disputesโ the RLA\n\n\n\n    particular provision with reference to a specific\n    situation or to an omitted case. . . . In either case\n    the claim is to rights accrued, not merely to have new\n    ones created for the future.\n\nElgin, 325 U.S. at 723.\n    3A major dispute\n\n    relates to disputes over the formation of collective\n    agreements or efforts to secure them. They arise where\n    there is no such agreement or where it is sought to\n    change the terms of one, and therefore the issue is\n    not whether an existing agreement controls the\n    controversy. They look to the acquisition of rights\n    for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to\n    have vested in the past.\n\nElgin, 325 U.S. at 723.\n    4 The dispute resolution procedures for major disputes\ninclude a \"rather elaborate machinery for negotiations,\nmediation, voluntary arbitration, and conciliation.\"     Detroit\nand Toledo Shore Line R.R. Co. v. United Transp. Union, 396 U.S.\n142, 148-49 (1969). For simplicity's sake, we will refer to all\nof these processes as the major dispute \"mediation\" procedures.\n\n                               -7-\n\fbars the carrier from implementing the contested change until the\n\nmediation efforts are exhausted.             See Detroit and Toledo Shore\n\nLine R.R. Co. v.       United Transp. Union, 396 U.S. 142, 150-53\n\n(1969). To invest these status quo requirements with judicial\n\nauthority, the district court is permitted to issue an injunction\n\nordering the parties to maintain the pre-dispute status quo while\n\nthe mediation procedures take place.              See Consolidated Rail Corp.\n\nv. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 491 U.S. 299, 303 (1989)\n\n(\"The district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to enjoin\n\na violation of the status quo pending completion of the required\n\nprocedures . . . .\").\n\nC.   The District Court Proceedings\n\n          The    Unions     argued    to    the    district      court    that   the\n\narrangement between Springfield and ABR created a major dispute\n\nbecause   Springfield       was    seeking    to        modify   the     collective\n\nbargaining agreement's rules on pay and working conditions for\n\nthose engaged in switching.          The Unions claimed that Springfield\n\nwas using ABR to implement this contested change before RLA\n\nmediation procedures were exhausted, thereby violating the RLA's\n\nrequirement that the carrier and union maintain the pre-dispute\n\nstatus quo. The appellants objected, arguing, inter alia, that\n\nSpringfield     had   not   done   anything        to    alter   the     collective\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fbargaining agreement and that ABR was acting independently in\n\nperforming switching work for Springfield customers.\n\n            On the basis of a stipulated record, the district court\n\nruled   that    the    dispute    was     major    under      the   RLA.    In    so\n\nconcluding, the court found that Springfield was attempting to\n\nevade   the    collective      bargaining       agreement     by    \"allow[ing]    a\n\ncorporate      relative   not     bound    by     the   collective     bargaining\n\nagreement to perform work covered by the collective bargaining\n\nagreement.\"      The   court     also   rejected        the   appellants'   other\n\ndefenses:      their assertion that the arrangement with ABR did not\n\nalter the pay or working conditions of the Unions and their\n\nassertion that the arrangement was covered by \"implied terms\" in\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement. The court then enjoined ABR\n\nfrom performing industrial switching for Lincoln, Champion and\n\nany companies for which Springfield currently provided switching\n\nservices, pending the outcome of the RLA mediation procedures.\n\nABR and Springfield appeal.5\n\n\n    5 The Unions have suggested that we lack jurisdiction over\nthis appeal because the Appellants filed their notice of appeal\nbefore the injunction was formally recorded. We disagree.\n     When the district court entered its order on February 5,\n1999, it asked the Unions to prepare the formal language of the\ninjunction, to present that language to the defendants, and to\nfile it with the court by February 19. The Unions did so, and\non March 2, 1999, the district court signed the injunction.\nPrior to the court's approval of the injunction's language,\nSpringfield and ABR filed their notice of appeal.\n     A decision is final if it \"ends the litigation on the merits\n\n                                        -9-\n\f                                       II.\n\n             Appellants assert that there is no major dispute under\n\nthe   RLA   because      Springfield    made    no    changes      at    all   to   the\n\ncollective       bargaining   agreement.        Rather,      appellants        claim,\n\nSpringfield's rail customers simply chose to use ABR for better\n\nservice     of   their    switching    needs.        Since   ABR    is    a    company\n\nindependent from Springfieldโ a wood products shop and not a\n\nrailwayโ the district court erred in attributing ABR's actions to\n\nSpringfield, despite the nearly total overlap in ownership.\n\n\n\n\nand leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the\njudgment.\"   Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S.\n368, 373 (1981) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nThe Supreme Court has allowed appeals even when a district court\nstill anticipated \"[f]urther rulings . . . in administering its\ndecree.\"   Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 308\n(1962); see also Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U.S.\n196, 199 (1988) (\"A question remaining to be decided after an\norder ending litigation on the merits does not prevent finality\nif its resolution will not alter the order or moot or revise\ndecisions embodied in the order.\"). At the time the appeal was\nfiled, the district court had already ruled that the dispute was\nmajor and that a status quo injunction was needed. The fact that\nwording had not been determined did not defeat the judgment's\nfinality.\n     Even if the filing of the appeal were premature, we would\nstill have jurisdiction. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n4(a)(2) provides that a \"notice of appeal filed after the court\nannounces a decision or order but before the entry of the\njudgment or order shall be treated as filed after such entry and\non the day thereof.\" Thus if a party files an appeal\nprematurely, this rule preserves its effect.      See FirstTier\nMortgage Co. v. Investors Mortgage Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273\n(1991); Negran v. Hernandez, 145 F.3d 410,414 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           We agree with Springfield that the dispute cannot be\n\nlabeled   \"major\"      simply     because        the    collective       bargaining\n\nagreement required switching to be performed by the Unions.                       If\n\nABR was truly acting on its own, an injunction against ABR would\n\nhave been improper.          The collective bargaining agreement is\n\nbetween   Springfield       and     the    Unions;      ABR   is   not    a   party.\n\nMoreover, the RLA applies only to carriers; ABR is not a carrier.\n\nSee 45 U.S.C. ยง 151, First.           Unless the district court properly\n\ntreated   ABR    as   the   alter    ego    of    Springfield,      and   properly\n\ndisregarded the separateness of the two corporations by piercing\n\nthe corporate veil of ABR, it could not attribute ABR's conduct\n\nto   Springfield      and   enjoin        ABR    from   switching    Springfield\n\ncustomers.      We must therefore assess whether veil piercing was\n\nappropriate.\n\n           In doing so, we must be clear about the sense in which\n\nwe are using these terms.         See Note, Piercing the Corporate Veil:\n\nThe Alter Ego Doctrine under Federal Common Law, 95 Harv. L. Rev\n\n853 (1982) (noting that the terms are amorphous).                    To pierce a\n\ncorporate veil means to disregard its corporate formalities. See\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary 1168 (7th ed. 1999) (noting that \"piercing\n\nthe corporate veil\" and \"disregarding the corporate entity\" are\n\nthe same thing).       The veil may be pierced if one corporation is\n\nnot an independent entity, but rather the mere \"alter ego\" of\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fanother.    1 James D. Cox, Thomas Lee Hazen & F. Hodge O'Neal,\n\nCorporations ยง 7.8 at 7.17 (1995);cf. Black's Law Dictionary 385\n\n(7th ed. 1999) (defining \"alter ego\" as a \"corporation used by an\n\nindividual to conduct personal business\").        In this case, ABR is\n\nSpringfield's \"alter ego\" in the context of this labor dispute if\n\nABR is acting as a non-union branch of Springfield rather than as\n\nan independent company.        Likewise, when we speak of \"piercing\"\n\nABR's    veil,     we   mean   simply    disregarding   its    corporate\n\nseparateness in the limited context where it is allegedly serving\n\nas an alter ego.\n\nA.    Federal Common Law of Veil Piercing\n\n           We must determine whether state law or federal common\n\nlaw     governs the veil-piercing inquiry.        In federal question\n\ncases, such as this one, we look to federal choice of law\n\nprinciples.      See Texas Indus., Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc.,\n\n451 U.S. 630, 642 (1981); see also Edelmann v. Chase Manhattan\n\nBank, 861 F.2d 1291, 1294 (1st Cir. 1988).              If the federal\n\nstatute in question demands national uniformity, federal common\n\nlaw provides the determinative rules of decision.             See United\n\nStates v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 728 (1979).\n\n           National uniformity is essential in the interpretation\n\nof labor law.      Federal courts have fashioned a body of federal\n\ncommon law to govern labor disputes, recognizing that harmonious\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\flabor relations are essential to interstate commerce.                  See, e.g.,\n\nTextile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 456 (1957).\n\nThis   general     principle    holds    true      for   the   RLA,    a   statute\n\ndescribed as an industry-wide bargain between carriers and their\n\nunions aimed at preventing disruptions to interstate commerce.\n\nSee Shore Line, 396 U.S. at 148-49; Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.\n\nIndependent Fed'n of Flight Attendants, 489 U.S. 426, 432 (1989)\n\n(noting that \"federal common labor law . . . may be helpful in\n\ndeciding    cases    under    the     RLA.\").       National    uniformity       is\n\nparticularly important in those RLA cases, like this one, that\n\n\"implicate the consensual processes which labor law was designed\n\nto promote.\"        International Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace\n\nWorkers v. Aloha Airlines, Inc., 790 F.2d 727, 734 (9th Cir.\n\n1986).\n\n            A common federal standard is particularly needed in RLA\n\nveil-piercing cases.          If courts were to rely on state law to\n\ndetermine when veil piercing was appropriate, RLA collective\n\nbargaining agreements might include some companies in one state\n\nand other companies in a neighboring state.                    A railway with\n\noperations in more than one state could find itself unable to\n\ndetermine    whether    and    when    the   RLA    applied    to     it   at   all.\n\nLikewise, a federal veil-piercing standard is required to prevent\n\ncarriers    from    using    non-carriers       (which   are   not     themselves\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fsubject to the RLA) to circumvent federal labor law requirements.\n\nAlthough state law creates the corporate form, \"the question of\n\nliability [for violation of federal regulations]                      is a federal\n\nquestion.    The policy underlying a federal statute may not be\n\ndefeated by an assertion of state power.\" Anderson v. Abott, 321\n\nU.S. 349, 365 (1944)(piercing the veil); H.P. Lambert Co. v.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury, 354 F.2d 819, 822 (1st Cir. 1965)\n\n(\"However important it may be in other respects, the fiction of\n\nthe   corporate     entity    cannot    stand      athwart    sound     regulatory\n\nprocedure.\").\n\n            To say that federal common law applies in this case\n\ndoes not fully resolve the matter.             As we recently acknowledged,\n\nthe   federal   standard      \"for   when     it   is   proper   to    pierce   the\n\ncorporate    veil    is      notably    imprecise       and   fact-intensive.\"\n\nCrane v. Green & Freedman Baking Co., 134 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); see also Note, supra, 95 Harv. L. Rev. at 852 (noting that\n\nfederal common law on veil piercing is amorphous and must be\n\nflexibly applied).        Federal courts are not bound by \"the strict\n\nstandards of the common law alter ego doctrine which would apply\n\nin a tort or contract action.\"          Capital Tel. Co. v. FCC, 498 F.2d\n\n734, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1974).           Nor is there any \"litmus test in the\n\nfederal courts governing when to disregard corporate form.\"\n\nAlman v. Danin, 801 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1986). Instead, the rule\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fin federal cases is founded only on the broad principle that \"a\n\ncorporate entity may be disregarded in the interests of public\n\nconvenience, fairness and equity.\"           Town of Brookline v. Gorsuch,\n\n667 F.2d 215, 221 (1st. Cir. 1981).\n\n            In Gorsuch we recognized that this principle must be\n\napplied with sensitivity to the demands of the federal statute at\n\nissue:\n\n            In applying this rule, federal courts will\n            look closely to the purpose of the federal\n            statute to determine whether the statute\n            places importance on the corporate form, an\n            inquiry that usually gives less respect to\n            the corporate form than does the strict\n            common law alter ego doctrine.\n\nId.

See Stotter & Co.\n\nv.   Amstar    Corp.,   579    F.2d    13,    18-19   (3rd    Cir.    1978)   (veil\n\npiercing necessary to fulfill purposes of Clayton Act); Capital\n\nTel.

We\n\nmust   therefore     consider     the    RLA    status       quo   provisions    to\n\ndetermine when veil piercing is necessary to prevent frustration\n\nof the RLA's purposes.\n\nB. The Railway Labor Act and Veil Piercing\n\n              \"[T]he major purpose of Congress in passing the Railway\n\nLabor Act was to provide a machinery to prevent strikes.\" Texas\n\n& N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. & S.S. Clerks, 281 U.S. 548,\n\n565 (1930) (internal quotation marks omitted).                        The risk of\n\nstrikes was considered to be \"particularly acute in the area of\n\n'major disputes,' those disputes involving the formation of\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fcollective agreements and efforts to change them.\"             Shore Line\n\n396 U.S. at 148. For these disputes, the railroad and union\n\nrepresentatives     who   drafted     the    Act   favored    non-binding\n\nmediation.    See id. at 148-49.      To prevent strikes from breaking\n\nout while mediation was underway, the Act required that both\n\nparties maintain the pre-dispute status quo. See id. at 149.             As\n\nthe Court noted in Shore Line, the Act's status quo provision was\n\n\"central to its design\":\n\n            Its immediate effect is to prevent the union\n            from striking and management from doing\n            anything that would justify a strike. In the\n            long run, delaying the time when the parties\n            can resort to self-help provides time for\n            tempers to cool, helps create an atmosphere\n            in which rational bargaining can occur, and\n            permits the forces of public opinion to be\n            mobilized in favor of a settlement without a\n            strike or lockout. Moreover, since disputes\n            usually arise when one party wants to change\n            the status quo without undue delay, the power\n            which the Act gives the other party to\n            preserve the status quo for a prolonged\n            period will frequently make it worth while\n            for the moving party to compromise with the\n            interests of the other side and thus reach\n            agreement without interruption to commerce.\n\nId. at 150. The Act fashioned a fundamental compromise: during\n\nthe   RLA   mediation   procedures,    the   union   must    refrain   from\n\nstriking and the carrier must refrain from implementing the\n\ncontested policy.\n\n            The Shore Line Court emphasized that the status quo\n\nprovisions of the RLA must be applied flexibly to fulfill the\n\n                                 -17-\n\fstatute's goal.     In Shore Line, the carrier had argued that the\n\nRLA required it to preserve the status quo only in those working\n\nconditions    explicitly        covered    by   the   parties'    collective\n\nbargaining agreement. See id. at 147-48. Since the collective\n\nbargaining agreement was silent on the challenged practice, the\n\ncarrier   argued    that   it    should   be    allowed   to   continue   this\n\npractice while RLA mediation to modify the agreement was ongoing.\n\nSee id.      The Court rejected this interpretation, calling it\n\n\"fundamentally at odds with the Act's primary objective -- the\n\nprevention of strikes. . . .            If the railroad is free at this\n\nstage to take advantage of the agreement's silence and resort to\n\nself-help, the union cannot be expected to hold back its own\n\neconomic weapons, including the strike.\"              Id. at 154-55.       The\n\nCourt therefore held that the status quo provision must be\n\n\"broadly conceived\" to preserve the \"actual, objective working\n\nconditions    out   of   which    the   dispute   arose,   irrespective     of\n\nwhether these conditions are covered in an existing collective\n\nagreement.\" Id. at 143.\n\n             The Court's effort to give practical meaning to the\n\nstatus quo requirement would be circumvented if carriers could\n\nuse third parties to alter the collective bargaining agreement\n\nwhile the dispute was ongoing.             Thus courts have held that a\n\ncarrier may not hire an independent company to carry out the\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fchanges that the unions protest. See e.g., St. Louis S.W. Ry. v.\n\nBrotherhood of R.R. Signalmen, 665 F.2d 987, 995 (10th Cir. 1981)\n\n(\"There is nothing which leaves room for a suggestion that the\n\n[RLA] can be avoided by employing a contractor to perform the\n\nwork.\").   In the same vein, the RLA is defeated if a carrier uses\n\na related corporation to alter the status quo. The RLA itself\n\nacknowledges the possibility that carriers may attempt to use\n\naffiliates to achieve their goals by giving courts jurisdiction\n\nover railroads and those non-railroads that are \"directly or\n\nindirectly owned or controlled by or under common control with\n\nany carrier by railroad. . . .\" 45 U.S.C. ยง 151. While this\n\nprovision alone does not justify the issuance of an injunction\n\nagainst a non-railroad corporation, it emphasizes that courts\n\nmust   look   beyond   corporate     formalities   if   the   nominally\n\nindependent corporation is serving as the alter ego of the\n\ncarrier.\n\n           In several cases, courts have engaged in veil piercing\n\nwhen the carrier used an affiliate to escape its collective\n\nbargaining agreement and violate the status quo requirements of\n\nthe RLA. In Burlington Northern R.R. Co. v. United Transp. Union,\n\n862 F.2d 1266 (7th Cir. 1988), the railroad, after failing to\n\nconvince a local union to accept smaller crews for a particular\n\ntrain service, transferred the work to a subsidiary, Winona\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fBridge.     Finding that the subsidiary was \"serving as the alter\n\nego\" of the carrier, the court held that \"a carrier cannot evade\n\nits duties under a collective bargaining agreement or the RLA by\n\ndirecting business to an entity within the same corporate family\n\nand   not    obligated   by   the    existing   collective   bargaining\n\nagreement.\"     Id. at 1275.        Similarly, in Butte, Anaconda &\n\nPacific Ry. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,\n\nthe carrier argued that its major dispute mediation procedures\n\ncould be \"terminated\" after a wholly owned subsidiary began\n\nperforming the disputed work. 268 F. 2d 54, 59 (9th Cir. 1959).\n\nThe court acknowledged that there would no longer be a major\n\ndispute if the work was performed by \"an independent shipper, not\n\nacting in concert with its carrier.\" Id.          After assessing the\n\nlinks between carrier and subsidiary, however, the court held\n\nthat the acts of the latter \"must be regarded as the act of the\n\ncarrier. Otherwise, a carrier by interrelation with its shippers\n\nwould always have it within its power to circumvent the mediation\n\nprovision of the Railway Labor Act.\" Id. at 59-60.6\n\n\n      6\n      Other courts have also noted that a carrier cannot evade\nthe requirements of the RLA (which applies to air carriers as\nwell as railroads) by transferring work to a corporate relative\nnot party to the collective bargaining agreement. See Air Line\nPilots Ass'n, Int'l. v. Transamerica Airlines, Inc., 817 F.2d\n510 (9th Cir.1987) (noting that a carrier would violate the RLA\nstatus quo requirements if the union could prove that it\ntransferred work to a subsidiary to evade these requirements);\nAir Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l. v. Texas Intl' Airlines, Inc., 656\n\n                                    -20-\n\f               Noting that neither Burlington nor Butte detail the\n\nstandard that must be applied in an RLA veil-piercing inquiry,\n\nappellants claim that these cases support RLA veil piercing only\n\nwhen the pierced corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of the\n\ncarrier.       We reject this reading.        First, while these cases deal\n\nwith wholly owned subsidiaries, they do not state that veil\n\npiercing is inappropriate for other types of corporate relatives.\n\nIn fact, Burlington speaks of piercing not just subsidiaries, but\n\nof entities in the \"same corporate family.\"                  862 F.2d at 1275.\n\nWhile alter ego liability may be most common in an ordinary\n\nparent-subsidiary context, \"the equitable doctrine of piercing\n\nthe    corporate    veil    is   not   limited    to   the   parent-subsidiary\n\nrelationship.\" C M Corp. v. Oberer Dev. Co., 631 F.2d 536, 538\n\n(7th    Cir.    1980).     Indeed,     \"[t]he    separate    corporateness    of\n\naffiliated corporations owned by the same parent may be equally\n\ndisregarded       under    the   proper   circumstances.\"        In   re   Bowen\n\nTransps., Inc., 551 F.2d 171, 179 (7th Cir. 1977).                 Courts have\n\npierced the veil in cases involving \"sibling\" corporations, and\n\nin cases involving even more intricately arranged corporate\n\nstructures.       See Minnesota Power v. Armco, Inc., 937 F.2d 1363,\n\n\n\nF.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir. 1981) (\"Nor could TXI permissibly transfer\nexisting business flown by ALPA pilots to a newly formed\ncorporate alter ego for the purpose of displacing the work of\nALPA pilots.\").\n\n                                       -21-\n\f1364 (8th Cir. 1991) (complex partnership scheme); cf. Century\n\nOil Tool, Inc. v. Production Specialties, Inc., 737 F.2d 1316,\n\n1317 (5th Cir. 1984) (\"[W]e see no relevant difference between a\n\ncorporation wholly owned by another corporation, two corporations\n\nwholly owned by a third corporation or two corporations wholly\n\nowned by three persons who together manage all affairs of the two\n\ncorporations.\").         The misuse of the corporate form to evade\n\nfederal regulatory requirements may be easier to prove, as an\n\nevidentiary matter, when there is a straightforward parent-\n\nsubsidiary relationship.        However, the RLA status quo provisions\n\ncould    be   thwarted   if   courts    were   categorically   barred   from\n\nconsidering other types of corporate relationships that were\n\nbeing used to avoid a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n              Of course, the corporate ties between the carrier and\n\nthe related corporation provide only a starting point for the\n\nanalysis.\n\nCommon ownership by itself is insufficient to pierce the veil.\n\nSee     United States v. Bestfoods, 118 S. Ct. 1876, 1884 (1998)\n\n(\"[A] parent corporation . . . is not liable for the acts of its\n\nsubsidiaries.\").         The record must include evidence that the\n\ncarrier used the related corporation for the purpose of evading\n\nthe     collective   bargaining        agreement   and   the   status   quo\n\nrequirements of the RLA.       In making this determination, no single\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\ffactor is dispositive.      The district court may consider the\n\nchronology of events: if the carrier only transferred work to the\n\nrelated corporation after unsuccessful union negotiations, that\n\nfact may suggest that the carrier shifted the work in an effort\n\nto avoid the RLA status quo provisions.          See Burlington, 862 F.2d\n\nat 1274 (\"Thus Burlington plainly acknowledged that Winona Bridge\n\nwas Burlington's second choice, an alternative to unsuccessful\n\nunion negotiations.\"). That inference of evasion may be stronger\n\nwhen the work shifted to the related corporation is distinct from\n\nthe   related   corporation's    primary    line    of   business.     Other\n\nfactors may also be relevant, such as whether the carrier and the\n\nrelated   corporation     fail    to     observe     separate     corporate\n\nformalities,     or    whether     the      related      corporation      is\n\nundercapitalized.     See id. at 1276 n.6 (noting that subsidiary\n\nhad \"no equipment or rail-service employees\").\n\n           We emphasize, however, that the record need not portray\n\nthe related corporation as a \"sham\" business, expressly created\n\nor operated primarily to defeat the RLA. In Butte, for example,\n\nthe subsidiary had been created and then operated as a separate,\n\nlegitimate business until the railroad used it to defeat the RLA\n\nobligations.     268 F. 2d at 54.      It would make little sense to\n\nignore    current     relationships        and     arrangements      between\n\ncorporations, and thereby grant the railroad immunity from veil\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fpiercing, in those cases where the related corporation being used\n\nto defeat the RLA was originally formed (or simultaneously used)\n\nfor a legitimate purpose.       It must be remembered that veil\n\npiercing in the RLA context serves a different function than it\n\ndoes in the ordinary state law veil piercing cases.   In a typical\n\ntort or contract case, the primary purpose of the veil-piercing\n\nanalysis is exposure of the assets of one corporation for payment\n\nof the debts or obligations of a related corporation.   In the RLA\n\nmajor dispute proceedings, veil piercing operates only to block\n\nthe related corporation from assisting the carrier in altering\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement before mediation procedures\n\nare exhausted.   Indeed, there is no final judgment on the merits\n\nagainst the related corporation: if the RLA mediation procedures\n\ndo not achieve a negotiated solution, the law will not block the\n\nrelated corporation from engaging in the contested activities.\n\nSee Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n.,\n\n491 U.S. 299, 303 (1989) (\"Once this protracted process ends and\n\nno agreement has been reached, the parties may resort to the use\n\nof economic force.\");   Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v.\n\nBaltimore & Ohio R.R., 372 U.S. 284, 291 (1963).\n\n         In this way, RLA veil piercing is similar to the well-\n\nestablished practice of extending the scope of an injunction to\n\ninclude non-parties acting in concert with parties to defeat the\n\n\n                              -24-\n\finjunction's purpose. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d) (injunctions can\n\nblock activities of non-parties who act \"in active concert or\n\nparticipation\" with enjoined parties).              In RLA cases (unlike in\n\nmost cases where injunctions are sought), the substantive law\n\nitself imposes the duty to maintain the status quo.                  In a major\n\ndispute, the Act requires that \"rates of pay, rules, or working\n\nconditions     shall    not   be    altered   by    the    carrier   until   the\n\ncontroversy    has     finally     been   acted    upon\"   through   the   Act's\n\nmediation procedures.         45 U.S.C. ยง 156; see also Shore Line 396\n\nU.S. at 150-53 (describing various status quo provisions in the\n\nRLA). If in subsequent proceedings the district court determines\n\nthat the carrier is acting in concert with a related corporation\n\nto   violate   these    self-executing        status   quo   provisions,     the\n\ninjunction should be fashioned to reach the related corporation\n\nas well.\n\n           With these principles in mind, we turn to the findings\n\nof the district court.\n\nC. The District Court's Findings\n\n           While we review the district court's legal conclusions\n\nde novo, see Sierra Fria Corp. v. Donald J. Evans, P.C., 127 F.3d\n\n175, 181 (1st Cir. 1997), we accept its factual findings unless\n\nthey are clearly erroneous.          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Moreover,\n\n\"[i]t is now settled beyond peradventure that findings of fact do\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fnot forfeit 'clearly erroneous' deference merely because they\n\nstem from a paper record.\"            RCI Northeast Servs. Div. v. Boston\n\nEdison Co., 822 F.2d 199, 202 (1st Cir. 1987). Whether the\n\nevidence is sufficient to pierce the veil \"is a question of law.\n\nBut given the issue's fact-intensive nature, the legal threshold\n\nof evidentiary sufficiency is a relatively low one.\"              Crane, 134\n\nF.3d at 22.     We must therefore review the record in the light\n\nmost favorable to the district court's findings.              See Servicos\n\nComerciales Andinos v. General Elec. Del Caribe, Inc., 145 F.3d\n\n463, 466 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             The district court decided the case on a stipulated\n\nrecord containing deposition transcripts and affidavits from key\n\nSpringfield,    ABR     and   union    leaders.   Not    surprisingly,    the\n\nparties offered divergent views of the circumstantial evidence.\n\nSpringfield relied on ABR's formal corporate separateness from\n\nthe railroad, and emphasized the undisputed fact that ABR had\n\nbeen formed prior to the labor dispute and was engaged in a\n\nseparate, legitimate business (paper products manufacturing). It\n\nasked the court to view Springfield's suggestion to ABR that it\n\nperform switching as merely a friendly business gesture from one\n\nindependent corporation to another, designed solely to promote\n\neach company's efficiency.        The Unions, by contrast, argued that\n\nthe   same   evidence    showed   that     Springfield   sought   out   ABR's\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fassistance only to thwart the RLA processes.                In support of its\n\ninterpretation,          the    Unions   emphasized    common     ownership    of\n\nSpringfield and ABR, the chronology of events, and the fact that\n\nthe   same    Springfield       managers    involved   in   the   failed   labor\n\nnegotiations were instrumental in persuading ABR to perform\n\nswitching for Lincoln and Champion.                In a case submitted for\n\njudgment on a stipulated record, the district court resolves\n\ndisputed issues of material fact.               See Boston Five Cents Sav.\n\nBank v. Secretary of the Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., 768 F.2d\n\n5, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n             While the appellants (and our dissenting colleague)\n\ncontinue to characterize Springfield's motivation as benign, the\n\ndistrict court plainly rejected the claim that ABR was acting as\n\nan independent corporation.              Rather, the court found that the\n\nconduct of Springfield was analogous to that of the carrier in\n\nBurlington, a case in which the carrier used a subsidiary alter\n\nego to violate its collective bargaining agreement and the RLA.\n\nNoting that it could \"look beyond the surface . . . to see\n\nwhether the disputed practice is in reality an attempt to evade\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement,\" the court concluded that\n\nSpringfield's arrangement with ABR was an \"attempt[] to change\n\nunilaterally the terms\" of its deal with the Unions.                  The court\n\npointed      to   both    the   \"close    family   relationship\"     among    the\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fcorporations and the fact that the transfer of switching came\n\nonly   after    Springfield's    \"failed    attempt     to   negotiate   more\n\nfavorable terms for the work that ABR is now doing on a nonunion\n\nbasis.\"   The     court   drew   a    distinction      between    Springfield\n\nassisting ABR in taking over its own switching -- a fairly common\n\nindustry practice -- and Springfield's suggestion that ABR should\n\ntravel to other Springfield customers and perform the switching\n\nwork that the Unions had refused to do for lower pay.\n\n           While the evidence supporting the district court's\n\nfinding that Springfield used ABR to circumvent its collective\n\nbargaining agreement with the Unions was circumstantial, there\n\nwas,   contrary    to   the   insistence    of   the   dissent,   sufficient\n\nevidence to support that conclusion.             First, the district court\n\nproperly noted that the overlap in ownership between Springfield\n\nand ABR was almost total.            Three of the four individuals who\n\nowned Springfield (through the Guilford holding company) were the\n\nsole owners of ABR.       At the time the dispute arose, the three\n\ncorporations (Guilford, Springfield and ABR) had the same four\n\ndirectors: specifically, the three owners of ABR, plus Richard\n\nKelso.\n\n           Although the \"close family relationship\" between ABR\n\nand Springfield is not dispositive of the veil-piercing inquiry,\n\nthe district court also properly relied upon a chronology of\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fevents which supports an inference that Springfield was using ABR\n\nto violate its collective bargaining agreement and defeat the RLA\n\nstatus quo requirements.   Notably, Springfield only invited ABR\n\nto start performing switching for its customers after Springfield\n\nwas unable to convince the Unions to accept wage concessions.\n\nAlso, the Springfield vice-president who approached ABR, Sydney\n\nCulliford, was described by one union leader as the key player in\n\nthe failed labor negotiations.   Likewise, the ABR executive who\n\ndecided that the wood products shop should start switching for\n\nSpringfield customers was David Armstrong Fink, who in addition\n\nto being President of ABR was also an owner of Guilford and\n\ndirector of Springfield (and several months later, Springfield's\n\nexecutive vice-president).    It was not unreasonable for the\n\ndistrict court to conclude that the work was shifted to ABR after\n\nthe first round of failed negotiations as a way of pressuring the\n\nUnions to accept wage concessions, and circumventing the RLA\n\nstrictures that bar these unilateral changes.7\n\n\n\n    7The dissent insists that RLA veil piercing requires\n\"fraudulent intent\" or \"moral culpability.\" Post at 40.\nWithout necessarily accepting that specific formulation of the\nrequirement, there is no question that a manipulation of the\ncorporate form to circumvent a federal regulatory scheme is\nsufficiently blameworthy to meet this standard. See First Nat'l\nCity Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S.\n611, 630 (1983) (\"[T]he Court has consistently refused to give\neffect to the corporate form where it is interposed to defeat\nlegislative policies.\")\n\n                              -29-\n\f            The dissent argues that this reading of the evidence\n\nmust   be   rejected        because     ABR      only    performed       switching    for\n\nSpringfield customers Lincoln and Champion after they had already\n\n(and    independently)           decided    to    stop        using    Springfield    for\n\nswitching.      However, the only evidence that Lincoln and Champion\n\nhad chosen to end their switching agreement with Springfield\n\nbefore ABR was presented as an alternative comes from assertions\n\nby Springfield managers and officers.                   The district court did not\n\ncredit   this       version      of   events     in     its    opinion,    and   nothing\n\ncompelled      it    to     do    so.       Springfield          and    ABR   officials\n\nparticipated together in discussions with Lincoln and Champion\n\nover who should perform the switching.                    ABR President David Fink\n\n(an    owner    of    Springfield       through         Guilford)       stated   at   his\n\ndeposition that he and Springfield's Culliford met together with\n\nLincoln managers to discuss how ABR could fulfill switching needs\n\npreviously performed by the Unions. Other evidence indicates that\n\neven after ABR took over the day-to-day switching work, Lincoln\n\nsaw ABR as simply the non-union switching arm of Springfield.                          On\n\none    occasion      when     Lincoln      needed       to    change    its   switching\n\nschedule, it wrote a letter to Springfield, not ABR, informing it\n\nof its needs.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -30-\n\f                Moreover, even after Springfield directed8 switching\n\nwork       to   ABR,    and   even   after      this    litigation     was     filed,    it\n\ncontinued to seek wage concessions on switching from the Unions.\n\nSee    Burlington,        862     F.2d     at    1276    n.6    (\"If   [carrier]        and\n\n[subsidiary] were truly distinct entities, further negotiation\n\nwould have been moot\" following the decision to transfer work to\n\nthe subsidiary.).             One union leader, Michael Twombley, claims\n\nthat Cullifordโ the Springfield Vice-President who had suggested\n\nthat ABR take over switching work to begin withโ                        approached him\n\nand    asked      the    Unions      to   make     a    reasonable     offer    so    that\n\nSpringfield could perform switching for International Paper mill\n\nplants. A second union leader, Michael Maloof, was told by\n\nSpringfield's           labor    relations       head,     Roland      Dinsdale,      that\n\nSpringfield        wanted       union     concessions      so   that    it   could      win\n\nswitching business from the independent contractor, Rail Link.\n\n                Given that Springfield was still actively looking for\n\nswitching work, it is difficult to fathom why Springfield would\n\nwant to assist ABR if the latter were truly independent.                             Union\n\n\n       8\n     The dissent claims that it is wrong to suggest that\nSpringfield \"directed\" work to ABR, arguing that the district\ncourt's opinion and record only prove that \"Springfield\nfacilitated ABR's obtaining outside switching work.\" Post at 35\nn.5. However, the district court plainly determined that\nSpringfield had directed the business to ABR, finding that\n\"Springfield Terminal's claim that it is not attempting to\nchange unilaterally the terms of the collective bargaining\nagreement is totally implausible.\"     As discussed above, the\nrecord supports a finding that Springfield transferred some of\nits switching to ABR.\n\n                                            -31-\n\fnegotiator Maloof asked this very question when Dinsdale told the\n\nUnions to accept wage concessions so that Springfield could\n\ncompete against switching bids being made by various independent\n\ncontractors.        According     to   Maloof,   Dinsdale     told   him   that\n\nSpringfield was concerned with independent contractor bids, but\n\nnot with ABR, because Springfield controlled ABR.\n\n            Taken     together,    this    evidence   amply    supports      the\n\nconclusions that ABR was not acting as an independent company in\n\nproviding switching services, that Springfield was attempting to\n\nconvert two of ABR's thirty-four employees into its non-union\n\nswitching arm, and that Springfield was using ABR as a lever\n\nagainst the Unions, pressuring them to accept lower pay by\n\nchanging the status quo in the middle of negotiations.                     Given\n\nthat a central purpose of the RLA is to block such tactics, see\n\nShore Line, 396 U.S. at 148, the district court did not err in\n\nenjoining     ABR   from     switching    Springfield   consignees         while\n\nSpringfield     and    the    Unions      completed   the     RLA    mediation\n\nprocedures.\n\n                                       III.\n\n            In addition to the claims of improper veil piercing,\n\nthe appellants raise several miscellaneous objections to the\n\ndistrict court's major dispute determination.\n\nA. Change in Pay, Rules or Working Conditions\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\f          The appellants argue that the dispute was not major\n\nbecause it failed to produce a change in \"pay, rules or working\n\nconditions\" for the Unions. 45 U.S.C. ยง 152.                    According to\n\nappellants, the Unions did not provide \"any documented evidence\n\nof any actual loss\" and instead pointed only to \"theoretical loss\n\nof wages\" and minor changes in the working conditions.              Moreover,\n\nthe appellants claim that the Unions have actually benefitted\n\nfrom any changes because Springfield's railway business has\n\nincreased and it has hired new union employees.\n\n          The appellants demand more loss than the law requires.\n\nThe mere \"prospect of having work shifted to a replacement\n\nsubsidiary would constitute a change in the working conditions\n\nand practices\" sufficient to trigger a major dispute.                Air Line\n\nPilots Ass'n Int'l v. Transamerica, 817 F.2d 510, 516 (9th Cir.\n\n1987).    In fact, even the loss of completely \"new business,\"\n\nnever performed by the unions, may be considered a change in the\n\nworking conditions if the unions traditionally performed work of\n\nthis type.     See Burlington, 862 F.2d at 1276.             Here, the Unions\n\nhave shown far more than the prospective loss of new switching\n\nbusiness. The exact switching work previously performed by Union\n\nworkers   is   now   being    performed     by   non-union    ABR   employees.\n\nMoreover, because the Unions no longer perform this switching,\n\nsome   members   have   had    to   report   to   different     locations   at\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fdifferent times than they otherwise would have, a manifest change\n\nin \"working conditions.\"9\n\nB.   Implicit Term\n\n           The appellants claim that the district court erred in\n\nrejecting its argument that the collective bargaining agreement\n\n\"implicitly\" allowed the arrangement between Springfield and ABR.\n\nIf a carrier presents evidence that the challenged labor practice\n\nhas been knowingly acquiesced in by the union, the challenged\n\npractice   is    treated   as   an   implicit   term   of   the   collective\n\nbargaining agreement and any dispute over the meaning of that\n\nterm is minor.        See Maine Central R.R. Co. v. United Transp.\n\nUnion, 787 F. 2d 780, 782 (1st Cir. 1986). To take advantage of\n\nthe minor dispute provision, the carrier need only show that the\n\nimplicit contractual term defense is not \"totally implausible.\"\n\nId. at 783.\n\n           The appellants argue that the Unions had previously\n\nacquiesced      to   Springfield     allowing   several     of   its   freight\n\ncustomers to perform their own switching.          The dissent too makes\n\n\n\n     9\n     The appellants also claim that any changes in pay, rules or\nworking conditions were caused by ABR, and that Springfield\ncannot be held responsible for ABR's activities. As we stated\nabove, the district court properly concluded that Springfield\nwas using ABR to modify its collective bargaining agreement and\ndefeat the status quo provisions of the RLA.       Springfield,\ntherefore, is responsible for changes in pay, rules and working\nconditions.\n\n                                     -34-\n\fmuch of this point, noting that even before ABR started switching\n\nfor Lincoln and Champion, Springfield had assisted several mill\n\ncustomers (including ABR) in taking over their own switching. The\n\ndistrict court, however, ruled that Union acquiescence in those\n\ninstances was totally inapposite:\n\n            The companies have pointed only to past\n            practices where Springfield Terminal has\n            helped its customers take over their own\n            switching work.    The unions, however, no\n            longer quarrel with ABR doing its own\n            switching.    Instead, the unions complain\n            because Springfield Terminal, they say, is\n            essentially assisting ABR to act as a\n            railroad in doing nonunion switching work for\n            customers, specifically Terminal's customers,\n            who would otherwise be using Springfield\n            Terminal's union crews.    There is not even\n            arguably any such past practice.      I agree\n            with the unions that any purported reliance\n            on past practices to justify this new\n            arrangement    is,    therefore,    obviously\n            insubstantial; this is not a minor dispute.\n\n\nThe record amply supports the district court's past practice\n\nfindings.      The   Unions   have   never   accepted   the   idea   that\n\nSpringfield could use ABR as its non-union switching arm.10\n\n\n    10Springfield also points out that on the one occasion it\nused non-union employees to perform switching work, one union\nignored it and the other treated it as only a minor dispute.\nThis argument does nothing to prove union acquiescence to an\narrangement like that between Springfield and ABR.      From the\nrecord, it appears that the case Springfield points to involved\nwhich employees (engineers or \"carmen\") were allowed to perform\nthe switching on one specific track, not whether a party related\nto Springfield could essentially act as the carrier's non-union\nswitching arm.\n\n                                 -35-\n\f                                  IV.\n\n            For all of the above reasons, the judgment below is\n\naffirmed.\n\n                      Dissenting Opinion Follows\n\n            STAHL,   Circuit   Judge,    dissenting.   I   believe   the\n\nmajority misreads the record and misapprehends the federal law on\n\npiercing the corporate veil.      Consequently, I disagree with the\n\nmajority's conclusion that the lower court properly pierced\n\nSpringfield's corporate veil to enjoin ABR from doing switching\n\nwork   previously    performed   by   Springfield.     Accordingly,    I\n\ndissent.\n\n            The majority's determination that ABR is subject to the\n\nRLA depends necessarily on its affirming the district court's\n\nholding that โthe close family relationshipโ between ABR and\n\nSpringfield, Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs v. Springfield\n\nTerminal Ry., Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 9 (D. Me. Feb. 5,\n\n1999), justifies the conclusion that Springfield unilaterally\n\nbrought about a change in working conditions in violation of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement by โdirect[ing]โ the Lincoln and\n\nChampion switching work to ABR.          See ante at 26.   The majority\n\nacknowledges, as do the Unions, that without finding ABR to be an\n\n\n\n\n                                  -36-\n\falter ego -- for which there is no record evidence 1 -- or a\n\npiercing of the corporate veil, it could not hold ABR liable\n\nunder the RLA.         In my view, the district court's conclusion is\n\nnot sustainable.\n\n              Before proceeding to discuss the issues before us, I\n\nmust       contend    with   how   the   majority   couches    its    factual\n\nrecitation.          The majority states its intention to โbegin by\n\nsketching the facts of this labor dispute, reserving for later a\n\nmore detailed discussion of the district court's findings.โ Ante\n\nat 2.      What follows, however, intermixes predicate facts in the\n\nevidence with the actual findings the district court made.                 To an\n\nuninformed reader, this intermixing of facts and the district\n\ncourt's findings might well be quite confusing.             The effect is to\n\nbolster      the     majority's    ultimate   conclusion,     which   is    not\n\nsustainable based solely on the district court's findings, with\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      The burden of proof is on the party seeking to disregard\nthe corporate form. See National Soffit & Escutcheons, Inc. v.\nSuperior Sys., Inc., 98 F.3d 262, 265 (7th Cir. 1996); Publicker\nIndus., Inc. v. Roman Ceramics Corp., 603 F.2d 1065, 1069 (3d\nCir. 1979) (โThe burden of proof on this issue rests with the\nparty attempting to negate the existence of a separate\nentity.โ). In this case, aside from drawing the trial court's\nattention to the overlap in ownership, the Unions failed to\npresent evidence that the court should pierce the corporate\nveil. There is no evidence in the record, for example, as to\nwhether the various individuals' ownership shares in Guilford\nand ABR are the same, similar, or very different.\n\n                                      -37-\n\fbits and pieces of evidence from the record.                I believe this\n\napproach is unfortunate.2\n\n         The     majority   suggests    that   ABR   made   each   decision\n\nrelating to switching solely to satisfy Springfield's goals.\n\nNeither the district court's findings nor the record supports\n\nsuch a contention.     In early 1998, because its operations were\n\ngrowing, ABR decided it needed to provide additional trackage for\n\nthe storing, loading, unloading, and switching of railroad cars\n\nover the two sidetracks that it owned and over which it had\n\nexclusive use.    To satisfy its operational needs, it negotiated\n\nwith its line-hauling carrier, Springfield, a standard joint use\n\nagreement, which is a contract by which a company obtains the use\n\nof a railroad's tracks for its own operations.                 Under this\n\n\n    2This case was before the district court on a stipulated\nrecord.   When parties stipulate a record for decision, the\ndistrict judge must โdecide any significant issues of material\nfact that he discovers.โ      Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v.\nSecretary of the Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev., 768 F.2d 5, 11-12\n(1st Cir. 1985). Under such circumstances, we โreceive[] the\ndecision under a 'clearly erroneous' factfinding standard.โ Id.\nat 12. We take the findings of the district judge, and compare\nthem with the record only to discover clear error. See Strahan\nv. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 172 (1st Cir. 1997).\n       Because the majority agrees with the district court that\npiercing the corporate veil in the case of a close family\nrelationship is appropriate, it is bound by the findings of the\ndistrict court, which it may review only for clear error.\nHowever, this is not a case in which it is appropriate to scan\nthe entire record to bolster the district court's ultimate\nconclusion. Based on the limited facts found by the district\ncourt, I believe that its ultimate conclusion that piercing the\ncorporate veil was proper is in error.\n\n                                 -38-\n\fagreement, ABR to complement its own two tracks obtained the\n\nright to use four contiguous tracks owned and controlled by\n\nSpringfield.\n\n           It is evident from the record that ABR received no\n\nspecial treatment from Springfield because this agreement was\n\nidentical to joint use agreements the railroad previously had\n\nnegotiated with other customers.           Long before ABR negotiated its\n\nagreement,      Springfield   had   entered     into    similar   joint   use\n\nagreements with S.D. Warren of Westbrook, Maine in August 1992;\n\nSpecialty Minerals, Inc. of Adams, Massachusetts in October 1996;\n\nand Turners Island LLC of South Portland, Maine in October 1997.\n\nIn addition, Springfield had assisted several companies without\n\njoint use agreements -- Merrill's Terminal of Portland, Maine in\n\n1990; Hampshire Chemical of Nashua, New Hampshire in 1995; and\n\nFort James of Old Town, Maine in 1996 -- in taking over their own\n\nswitching.      Like ABR, each company is a freight customer of\n\nSpringfield's, each had ceased using Springfield for intraplant\n\nswitching, and each had begun to perform its own switching.\n\nMoreover, in each of these instances, the shipper made the\n\ndecision   to    do   its   own   switching,    and    Springfield   trained\n\nemployees of each company in the operation of the trackmobile, a\n\ndevice used to move rail cars between tracks.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\f              In April 1998, ABR, motivated by a desire to increase\n\nits flexibility and efficiency in switching, decided to do its\n\nown intraplant switching.3           The district court found that to\n\naccomplish its goals, ABR leased from Maine Central Railway a\n\ntrackmobile, and two of ABR's employees received training in its\n\noperation from two Springfield employees.

The\n\nrecord is clear that this assistance was neither unusual nor\n\nimproper because it followed Springfield's normal practice when\n\ncurrent line-haul customers elected to do their own switching.\n\nFrom       Springfield's     point   of   view,    this   assistance    had     a\n\nlegitimate business purpose because the more efficient a customer\n\nbecame at switching, the more line-haul business that customer\n\ncould give to Springfield.\n\n              Around   the    time   that    ABR   decided   to   do   its    own\n\nswitching, Lincoln and Champion complained that Springfield was\n\nunable to meet their scheduling needs for switching.              Lincoln and\n\nChampion discussed with Springfield their intention to perform\n\ntheir own switching.           The majority contends that Springfield\n\n\n\n       3\n      When they filed their initial complaint, the Unions argued\nthat the court should enjoin ABR from engaging in switching even\nat its own facility. The Unions later dropped this contention\nand focused solely on ABR's switching for Springfield's\nconsignees. See Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, Civil No. 98-\n284-P-H, slip op. at 1 n.1.\n\n                                      -40-\n\fโdirectedโ or โtransferredโ switching work to ABR.       Ante at 26 &\n\nn.8.       Respectfully, I think this assertion misstates the record.4\n\nIt was only after Lincoln and Champion had decided to leave\n\nSpringfield5       that   Sydney   Culliford,   Vice   President   of\n\n\n       4\n     I believe it is accurate in some sense to say that\nSpringfield facilitated ABR's obtaining outside switching work.\nCulliford assisted ABR in its efforts to get Lincoln's and\nChampion's business only after they made it clear to Springfield\nthat they intended to perform the work on their own.         The\nmajority, however, uses the term โdirectedโ in a pejorative\nmanner and states that Springfield โtransferredโ its switching\nwork to ABR. See ante at 26 n.8. Neither the findings of the\ndistrict court nor the record supports this assertion.\n       5\n      The district court indicated that Culliford โsuggested that\nABR pursue switching contracts with Springfield Terminal's\ncustomers.โ     Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, Civil No.\n98-284-P-H, slip op. at 9.       But the district court never\nexplicitly found that Lincoln or Champion would have used\nSpringfield for their switching absent ABR's entry into the\nmarket.\n     To the extent the district court implicitly found that\nLincoln and Champion would have remained customers of\nSpringfield absent Culliford's suggestion, it committed clear\nerror. See Strahan, 127 F.3d at 172. Because of the undisputed\nevidence in the record that Lincoln and Champion already had\ndecided to discontinue Springfield's switching services, any\nfinding or implication to the contrary by the district court or\nby the majority is not based on record evidence.\n     The majority notes that โthe only evidence that Lincoln and\nChampion had chosen to end their switching agreement with\nSpringfield before ABR was presented as an alternative comes\nfrom assertions by Springfield managers and officersโ and that\nโ[t]he district court did not credit this version of events in\nits opinion.โ Ante at 25-26. While it is true that only David\nArmstrong Fink and Culliford testified that Lincoln and Champion\nalready had decided to cease the use of Springfield for\nswitching, the Unions neither attempted to discredit them in\ncross-examination nor presented evidence to the contrary.\nIndeed, the district court never expressed doubt about the\nveracity of this testimony. Therefore, the only conclusion the\n\n                                   -41-\n\fTransportation for Springfield, suggested to David Armstrong Fink\n\nthat if ABR were not using its trackmobile to full capacity, it\n\ncould maximize its use by also performing switching services for\n\nother industries that wished to do their own switching.   Because\n\nLincoln and Champion already had decided that Springfield could\n\nnot meet their switching needs when they began to use ABR, it is\n\nillogical to suggest that Springfield โdirectedโ or โtransferredโ\n\nthis business to ABR.    After all, a company cannot transfer\n\nbusiness it does not have.6\n\n         The Unions and the majority make much of Culliford's\n\nsuggestion. This suggestion, however, is unremarkable because it\n\ndoes not indicate that either Springfield or ABR were using the\n\ncorporate form as a ruse.     The record is devoid of evidence to\n\nindicate that Culliford acted at the instruction of any of the\n\nowners of Guilford or ABR when he made his suggestion to ABR\n\nmanagement.   Culliford is neither an owner nor a director of\n\nGuilford, Springfield, or ABR.   More importantly, his suggestion\n\nmade legitimate business sense for both companies because ABR\n\n\nrecord supports is that Lincoln and Champion already had decided\nto leave Springfield.\n    6Taking the majority's logic to its ultimate conclusion, and\ngiven the breadth of the injunction now in force, if a shipper\non the line were to call ABR and request that it do the\ncompany's switching, that too would be prohibited under the\nterms of the injunction simply because of the overlap in\nownership.\n\n                               -42-\n\fcould   maximize       its   use   of   switching     capabilities    otherwise\n\nunderutilized, and Springfield could ensure an expansion of its\n\nline-hauling business.           A helpful suggestion from one company to\n\nanother does not create an alter ego relationship or provide a\n\nbasis for piercing the corporate veil.7\n\n             The majority's assertion that the railroad's attempt to\n\nrenegotiate       is   further     proof    of   collusion   misses   the    mark.\n\nRather, Springfield's continued attempts to renegotiate its union\n\ncontract indicate that the railroad desired to save its switching\n\nbusiness if it could, but recognized the need to decrease its\n\ncosts   to   be    competitive.         A   more   realistic   view   than    that\n\nadvanced by the majority is that if Springfield and ABR truly\n\nwere colluding, once Springfield โtransferredโ its switching work\n\nto what the majority says is its alter ego, ABR, it would have\n\ngiven up on trying to renegotiate the Union contract because its\n\ngoals already would have been realized.\n\n             The majority also misconstrues the applicable legal\n\nstandards. After explaining that federal law controls whether to\n\n\n\n    7The majority argues that because Springfield still engages\nin switching work, โit is difficult to fathom why Springfield\nwould want to assist ABR if the latter were truly independent.โ\nAnte at 27. The majority sees collusion. Rather, and quite to\nthe contrary, Springfield did nothing to harm its switching\nbusiness by suggesting that ABR seek Lincoln's and Champion's\nbusiness because Springfield, which was unable to meet their\nscheduling needs, already had lost them as customers.\n\n                                        -43-\n\fdisregard    the   corporate   form,    the    majority   misreads   and\n\noverstates    that law.   The majority contends that federal common\n\nlaw allows courts in cases involving federal statutes to fashion\n\nnew, statute-specific rules for disregarding the corporate form.\n\nI do not agree.\n\n             While the majority is correct that in ERISA cases, we\n\nhave crafted โa 'less rigorous' veil-piercing standard,โ ante at\n\n13, we have not crafted one that is standardless.           Contrary to\n\nthe majority, which contends that veil piercing typically is\n\nappropriate to effectuate legislation,8 this court always has\n\nengaged in a more searching inquiry.          See United Elec., Radio &\n\nMach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1092-93\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).      Common ownership alone is insufficient to\n\n\n    8 The majority uses the purpose of the RLA, which is to\nprevent strikes, to conclude that it is appropriate to pierce\nthe corporate veil to render the RLA applicable to nonrailroads.\nBut the majority fails logically to connect these ideas.      It\ncites Detroit & Toledo Shore Line Railroad v. United\nTransportation Union, 396 U.S. 142 (1969), and implies that its\nstrong statements about the importance of the RLA justify\npiercing the veil in all RLA cases.     Shore Line, however, is\ninapposite because that decision has nothing to do with piercing\nthe corporate veil. Rather, it involved a railroad and a union\nthat already were in mediation under the major dispute rules of\nthe Act. See id. at 145. During mediation, the railroad itself\nimplemented a new policy that changed a previously uncovered\ncondition in the collective bargaining agreement. See id. at\n146-47.    The Court's strong statements that allowing the\nrailroad's actions would defeat the Act's purposes, see id. at\n155, neither bear weight in deciding whether to pierce the\ncorporate veil nor help to articulate what the federal standard\nis.\n\n                                 -44-\n\fjustify piercing the veil.   See United Paperworkers Int'l Union\n\nv. T.P. Property Corp., 583 F.2d 33, 35-36 (1st Cir. 1978); ante\n\nat 19.   Moreover, the mere existence of a parent-subsidiary\n\nrelationship is insufficient to justify piercing the veil.9   See\n\nAmerican Bell Inc. v. Federation of Tel. Workers, 736 F.2d 879,\n\n887 (3d Cir. 1984) (โAs [the First Circuit] has explained, there\n\nis no policy of federal labor law, either legislative or judge-\n\nmade, that a parent corporation is bound by its subsidiary's\n\n\n\n    9 The district court, and the majority, relied on Burlington\nNorthern Railroad v. United Transportation Union, 862 F.2d 1266\n(7th Cir. 1988), for the proposition that courts โcan look\nbeyond the surface of purportedly similar transactions to see\nwhether the disputed practice before it is in reality an attempt\nto evade the collective bargaining agreement.โ Brotherhood of\nLocomotive Eng'rs, Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 9. I read\nBurlington differently.\n     In that case, to implement a new program, Burlington, the\nrailroad, negotiated with the unions to change their collective\nbargaining agreement, but the unions refused. See Burlington,\n862 F.2d at 1269.      In response, Burlington entered into a\ntrackage rights agreement with Winona Bridge, its wholly owned\nsubsidiary, which was not a party to the collective bargaining\nagreement, and the unions sued to enjoin them.     See id.   The\nissue was not whether the court should pierce Winona Bridge's\ncorporate veil; rather, it was whether the unions had acquiesced\nin similar past activities. See id. at 1273. Such acquiescence\ncan be used to show that a dispute is โminorโ under the RLA.\nSee Maine Cent. R.R. v. United Transp. Union, 787 F.2d 780, 782-\n83 (1st Cir. 1986). The court found that while the unions had\nacquiesced   in   Burlington's  granting   of  trackage   rights\ngenerally, they never had acquiesced in its granting them โto a\nwholly owned, five-employee subsidiary which utterly lack[ed]\nany of the necessary equipment to service such a line.โ\nBurlington, 862 F.2d at 1273. The court, in other words, merely\nnarrowed the scope of the unions' previous acquiescence without\nengaging in any alter ego analysis.\n\n                              -45-\n\flabor contracts simply because it controls the subsidiary's stock\n\nand participates in the subsidiary's management.โ (citing United\n\nPaperworkers, 583 F.2d at 35-36)).       Instead,\n\n           [a] court using the federal standard should\n           consider (1) whether the parent and the\n           subsidiary ignored the independence of their\n           separate   operations,   (2)   whether   some\n           fraudulent intent existed on the principals'\n           part, and (3) whether a substantial injustice\n           would be visited on the proponents of the\n           veil pierce should the court validate the\n           corporate shield.\n\n163 Pleasant, 960 F.2d at 1092-93.

See ante at 18 (citing C.M.\nCorp. v. Oberer Dev. Co, 631 F.2d 536 (7th Cir. 1980); Central\nNat'l Bank of Mattoon v. Bowen Transps., Inc. (In re Bowen\nTransps., Inc.), 551 F.2d 171 (7th Cir. 1977)). These cases,\nhowever, lend no assistance. In In re Bowen, the court stated\nthat it did โnot believe that the equitable doctrine of piercing\nthe corporate veil is limited to the parent-subsidiary\nrelationship.โ 551 F.2d at 179; accord C.M. Corp., 631 F.2d at\n539.   The In re Bowen court then noted that โ[t]he separate\ncorporateness of affiliated corporations owned by the same\nparent    may  be   equally   disregarded   under   the   proper\ncircumstances.โ   551 F.2d at 179 (emphasis supplied); accord\nC.M. Corp., 631 F.2d at 539.     These cases refer not to the\ncircumstance presented -- that is, companies with mere ownership\ncongruence -- but to one in which a parent corporation owns many\naffiliated corporations.    Moreover, both cases make it very\nclear that overlap in ownership alone is insufficient to pierce\nthe corporate veil.   See C.M. Corp., 631 F.2d at 539 (noting\nthat stock control and common officers and directors โare not\nsufficient by themselves to invoke the doctrineโ because they\nโexist in most parent and subsidiary relationshipsโ (internal\ncitation and quotation marks omitted)); In re Bowen, 551 F.2d at\n179 (โ[A]lthough stock control and common directors and officers\nare generally prerequisites for application of the doctrine\npermitting the corporate veil to be pierced, that is not by\nitself sufficient to bring the doctrine into operation.โ).\n\n                                -48-\n\fwith mere ownership overlap, the majority relies entirely on\n\ncases that involve wholly owned subsidiaries.

For example, in Butte, the railway was โa\n\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Anaconda, and both corporations [were]\n\nmanaged by the same staff of officers from president down to\n\nsecretary-treasurer.โ    Butte, 268 F.2d at 55.          ABR is not a\n\nsubsidiary of Springfield or Guilford, and the companies are not\n\nmanaged by the same personnel.       In Butte, the officers who made\n\nall major policy decisions for the subsidiary were also officers\n\nof the parent, and as one might expect, their โcontrolling\n\nconsiderationโ always was โthe        ultimate effectโ the decision\n\nwould have on the parent's profits.       Id.   No officers of ABR are\n\nofficers   of   Springfield   or    Guilford.    While   the   majority\n\nspeculates that ABR's decisions were made for the sole benefit of\n\nSpringfield, no record evidence supports that conclusion.\n\n           The majority attempts to extend the rule from these\n\nparent-subsidiary cases to this case, but does not satisfactorily\n\njustify or explain the extension.

While arguably there may be\n\ncases in which stockholders of a railroad form a nonsubsidiary\n\nfor the sole purpose of circumventing the collective bargaining\n\nagreement, there is no record support for the contention that\n\nthis is such a case, nor should the parent-subsidiary argument be\n\n\n                                -51-\n\fused to extend the doctrine here.\n\n           The majority cites Minnesota Power v.

Minnesota Power, however, does not\n\nsupport the majority's contention even though it did involve a\n\ncomplex partnership scheme.        From 1978 through 1982, the Reserve\n\nMining Co.

In\n\n1982, Armco and Republic Steel changed Reserve into a partnership\n\nand each took an equal share.       See id.   Armco then transferred to\n\nits   wholly   owned   corporate    subsidiary,   First   Taconite,   its\n\npartnership interest.     See id.     The Eighth Circuit saw no clear\n\nerror in the district court's findings that (1) from 1978 through\n\n1982, Reserve, which was Armco's and Republic Steel's wholly\n\nowned corporate subsidiary, was Armco's alter ego and (2) from\n\n1982 through 1986, First Taconite, which as Armco's wholly owned\n\ncorporate subsidiary owned a partnership interest in Reserve, was\n\nArmco's alter ego.       See id. at 1364, 1368.      That court merely\n\nheld wholly owned corporate subsidiaries to be the alter ego of\n\ntheir parent.\n\n           The majority also cites Century Oil Tool, Inc. v.\n\nProduction Specialties, Inc., 737 F.2d 1316 (5th Cir. 1984),\n\n\n                                   -52-\n\fquoting language that โwe see no relevant difference between a\n\ncorporation wholly owned by another corporation . . . or two\n\ncorporations wholly owned by three persons who together manage\n\nall affairs of the two corporations.โ     Id. at 1317.    This case\n\ndealt not with the RLA, but with whether two corporations with\n\nthe same ownership and control constituted a single entity under\n\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act.    See id. at 1316.   In Century Oil,\n\nthe same three men owned and controlled both Gas Lift, which\n\nmanufactured โwireline tools and gas lift valves,โ and Production\n\nSpecialties, which sold them.   Id. at 1317.    Each company existed\n\nsolely to benefit the other.    In addition, โ[b]oth corporations\n\noperated from the same physical plant.โ   Id.    The Unions concede\n\nthat ABR's principal business is unrelated to the railroad's and\n\nthat switching is incidental to its main business.       And, while\n\nthe majority thinks it immaterial that ownership and control\n\nbetween Springfield and ABR is not identical, the Century Oil\n\ncourt would disagree.   See id. at 1317 n.1 (โWe address only the\n\nquestion of the independence of two corporations under common\n\nownership.   The point at which the ownership of two or more\n\ncorporations so loses its commonality as to furnish a plurality\n\nof actors . . . is not before us.โ).   I remain unpersuaded by the\n\nmajority's expansion    of responsibility to companies with only\n\nsome ownership congruence.\n\n\n                                -53-\n\f            Finally, the import of the court's decision today has\n\nmuch significance for ABR.         The RLA sets up separate procedures\n\ndepending on whether a dispute is major or minor.           If the dispute\n\nis minor, it will be resolved quickly through โcompulsory and\n\nbinding arbitration.โ         Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor\n\nExecutives' Ass'n, 491 U.S. 299, 303 (1989).          In contrast, major\n\ndisputes endure โa lengthy process of bargaining and mediationโ\n\nduring which โthe parties are obligated to maintain the status\n\nquo.โ       Id.   at   302.     Congress   designed   the   major-dispute\n\nprocedures to prevent strikes.         See Elgin, Joliet & E. Ry. v.\n\nBurley, 325 U.S. 711, 725-26 (1945).         The majority's resolution\n\nof the major-minor issue will have little or no impact on the\n\nUnions because no Union jobs have been lost as a result of\n\nshippers doing their own switching; rather, Springfield in fact\n\nhas provided more Union jobs since losing some of its switching\n\nbusiness.     The majority's conclusion, however, does not allow\n\nABR, a nonrailroad and a legitimate business, the right to expand\n\nits switching operations to other entities that also desire\n\ntimely and flexible switching, nor does it regain for Springfield\n\nthe switching business it already has lost.\n\n            I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\f",

See 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151 and seq. The district court issued the injunction after finding that the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and United Transportation Union (the \"Unions\") were engaged in a \"major\" dispute with Springfield Terminal Railway Company (\"Springfield\") and that Springfield was using Aroostook and Bangor Resources, Inc. (\"ABR\") to violate its collective bargaining agreement. Springfield and ABR (the \"appellants\") argue that ABR, although owned and controlled by Springfield's owners, is an independent wood products company not subject to the RLA and therefore not subject to the district court's order that it stop performing switching for Springfield customers while RLA mediation procedures are underway. We reject the contention that ABR is not subject to the injunctive provisions of the RLA, and we affirm both the district court's finding that there was a \"major\" dispute between Springfield and its Unions and the district court's injunction against ABR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Labor Dispute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by sketching the facts of this labor dispute, reserving for later a more detailed discussion of the district court's findings. In doing so, \"[w]e recite the facts in the light most favorable to the district court's findings of fact.\" Servicos Comerciales Andinos v. General Electric Del Caribe, Inc., 145 F.3d 463, 466 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995 the Unions and Springfield negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that governs the rates of pay, rules, and working conditions for Springfield locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. The agreement specifically provides that union employees \"shall perform any and all services under the direct control of the Carrier required for the make up of trains and/or the movement of cars and trains over and through the Carrier's trackage and in its business of servicing industrial sidings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One such \"business of servicing industrial sidings\" is switching, a service that rail carriers often provide for their customers on the customers' properties. Springfield employees who are union members have historically provided this service to many of Springfield's line-haul railway customers. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the union members performing these switching services have been paid and treated identically to engineers, conductors, and trainmen involved in other aspects of Springfield's railway business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996 Springfield proposed that the union members engaged in switching accept a twenty-six percent pay cut and less favorable working conditions. Although the Unions' leaders initially resisted, they eventually agreed to submit a proposed pay cut to their respective memberships. The memberships of both Unions rejected the changes in August 1996, opting instead to maintain the more favorable terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Despite the vote, Springfield persisted in seeking a pay cut for switching work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unable to persuade the Unions to accept lower pay for switching, Springfield took a series of steps in the spring of 1998 that resulted in ABR performing switching that had previously been done by Springfield's unions. ABR is a non-unionized company located along Springfield's railway lines engaged primarily in the manufacture of clothes pins and other wood products. Springfield executed an agreement with ABR in April 1998 giving ABR joint use of some railway tracks, and Springfield personnel trained two non-union ABR employees to use a leased track-mobile to perform the switching at the ABR wood products mill previously done by Springfield's union employees. While joint use agreements of this type are fairly common in the railway industry, Springfield's next move was unusual. Shortly after executing the joint use agreement, Springfield suggested to ABR that it truck its switching equipment from place to place so that it could perform switching work for various Springfield railway customers that had previously used Springfield (and the Unions) for switching. ABR agreed and by May of 1998 it was providing switching services for Springfield customers Lincoln Pulp &amp; Paper (\"Lincoln\") and Passadumkeag Stud Mill, owned by Champion International, Inc. (\"Champion\"). ABR also investigated performing switching work for other Springfield customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although nominally an independent corporation, ABR is not unrelated to Springfield. Springfield is a wholly owned subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries, Inc. (\"Guilford\"), a holding company that owns several railroads in New England.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Guilford, in turn, was closely held (at the time of the dispute) by four individuals who also served as its directors: David Andrew Fink, David Armstrong Fink, Richard Kelso and Timothy Mellon. Both of the Finks and Mellon were also the sole owners of ABR. The three companies shared the same four directors at the time the dispute arose: all three ABR owners plus Richard Kelso. While David Andrew Fink served as President of Springfield, his son, David Armstrong Fink, served as President of ABR (as well as a Director of Guilford and, later, as an Executive Vice-President at Springfield). It was David Armstrong Fink who met with a Springfield vice-president involved in the failed labor negotiations about the possibility of ABR performing the switching work previously done by the Unions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Railway Labor Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Unions filed suit under the RLA, arguing that Springfield was using ABR to violate the terms of its collective bargaining agreement. Under the RLA, a district court has no jurisdiction to rule on the merits of a labor dispute. Rather, the court may only decide what type of statutorily mandated dispute resolution procedure is appropriate, depending on the category of the dispute. See Elgin, Joilet &amp; E. Ry. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 722-23 (1945). Minor disputes under the RLA are those in which the carrier's challenged policies are at least arguably permitted under the existing collective bargaining agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> If the dispute is \"minor,\" the district court dismisses the case in favor of binding arbitration. Major disputes, on the other hand, relate to carrier attempts to modify rates of pay, rules or working conditions in a fashion not even arguably covered by the collective bargaining agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs v. Boston &amp; Maine Corp., 788 F.2d 794, 797 (1st Cir. 1986); Maine Central R.R., Co. v. United Transp. Union, 787 F.2d 780, 782 (1st Cir. 1986). If the dispute is \"major,\" the Act provides for extensive, non-binding mediation procedures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In major disputes- unlike minor disputes- the RLA bars the carrier from implementing the contested change until the mediation efforts are exhausted. See Detroit and Toledo Shore Line R.R. Co. v. United Transp. Union, 396 U.S. 142, 150-53 (1969). To invest these status quo requirements with judicial authority, the district court is permitted to issue an injunction ordering the parties to maintain the pre-dispute status quo while the mediation procedures take place. See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 491 U.S. 299, 303 (1989) (\"The district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to enjoin a violation of the status quo pending completion of the required procedures....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Unions argued to the district court that the arrangement between Springfield and ABR created a major dispute because Springfield was seeking to modify the collective bargaining agreement's rules on pay and working conditions for those engaged in switching. The Unions claimed that Springfield was using ABR to implement this contested change before RLA mediation procedures were exhausted, thereby violating the RLA's requirement that the carrier and union maintain the pre-dispute status quo. The appellants objected, arguing, inter alia, that Springfield had not done anything to alter the collective bargaining agreement and that ABR was acting independently in performing switching work for Springfield customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of a stipulated record, the district court ruled that the dispute was major under the RLA. In so concluding, the court found that Springfield was attempting to evade the collective bargaining agreement by \"allow[ing] a corporate relative not bound by the collective bargaining agreement to perform work covered by the collective bargaining agreement.\" The court also rejected the appellants' other defenses: their assertion that the arrangement with ABR did not alter the pay or working conditions of the Unions and their assertion that the arrangement was covered by \"implied terms\" in the collective bargaining agreement. The court then enjoined ABR from performing industrial switching for Lincoln, Champion and any companies for which Springfield currently provided switching services, pending the outcome of the RLA mediation procedures. ABR and Springfield appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that there is no major dispute under the RLA because Springfield made no changes at all to the collective bargaining agreement. Rather, appellants claim, Springfield's rail customers simply chose to use ABR for better service of their switching needs. Since ABR is a company independent from Springfield- a wood products shop and not a railway- the district court erred in attributing ABR's actions to Springfield, despite the nearly total overlap in ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Springfield that the dispute cannot be labeled \"major\" simply because the collective bargaining agreement required switching to be performed by the Unions. If ABR was truly acting on its own, an injunction against ABR would have been improper. The collective bargaining agreement is between Springfield and the Unions; ABR is not a party. Moreover, the RLA applies only to carriers; ABR is not a carrier. See 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151, First. Unless the district court properly treated ABR as the alter ego of Springfield, and properly disregarded the separateness of the two corporations by piercing the corporate veil of ABR, it could not attribute ABR's conduct to Springfield and enjoin ABR from switching Springfield customers. We must therefore assess whether veil piercing was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In doing so, we must be clear about the sense in which we are using these terms. See Note, Piercing the Corporate Veil: The Alter Ego Doctrine under Federal Common Law, 95 Harv. L. Rev 853 (1982) (noting that the terms are amorphous). To pierce a corporate veil means to disregard its corporate formalities. See Black's Law Dictionary 1168 (7th ed. 1999) (noting that \"piercing the corporate veil\" and \"disregarding the corporate entity\" are the same thing). The veil may be pierced if one corporation is not an independent entity, but rather the mere \"alter ego\" of another. 1 James D. Cox, Thomas Lee Hazen &amp; F. Hodge O'Neal, Corporations &#167; 7.8 at 7.17 (1995);cf. Black's Law Dictionary 385 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \"alter ego\" as a \"corporation used by an individual to conduct personal business\"). In this case, ABR is Springfield's \"alter ego\" in the context of this labor dispute if ABR is acting as a non-union branch of Springfield rather than as an independent company. Likewise, when we speak of \"piercing\" ABR's veil, we mean simply disregarding its corporate separateness in the limited context where it is allegedly serving as an alter ego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Federal Common Law of Veil Piercing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must determine whether state law or federal common law governs the veil-piercing inquiry. In federal question cases, such as this one, we look to federal choice of law principles. See Texas Indus., Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 642 (1981); see also Edelmann v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 861 F.2d 1291, 1294 (1st Cir. 1988). If the federal statute in question demands national uniformity, federal common law provides the determinative rules of decision. See United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 728 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National uniformity is essential in the interpretation of labor law. Federal courts have fashioned a body of federal common law to govern labor disputes, recognizing that harmonious labor relations are essential to interstate commerce. See, e.g., Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 456 (1957). This general principle holds true for the RLA, a statute described as an industry-wide bargain between carriers and their unions aimed at preventing disruptions to interstate commerce. See Shore Line, 396 U.S. at 148-49; Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Independent Fed'n of Flight Attendants, 489 U.S. 426, 432 (1989) (noting that \"federal common labor law... may be helpful in deciding cases under the RLA.\"). National uniformity is particularly important in those RLA cases, like this one, that \"implicate the consensual processes which labor law was designed to promote.\" International Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Aloha Airlines, Inc., 790 F.2d 727, 734 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A common federal standard is particularly needed in RLA veil-piercing cases. If courts were to rely on state law to determine when veil piercing was appropriate, RLA collective bargaining agreements might include some companies in one state and other companies in a neighboring state. A railway with operations in more than one state could find itself unable to determine whether and when the RLA applied to it at all. Likewise, a federal veil-piercing standard is required to prevent carriers from using non-carriers (which are not themselves subject to the RLA) to circumvent federal labor law requirements. Although state law creates the corporate form, \"the question of liability [for violation of federal regulations] is a federal question. The policy underlying a federal statute may not be defeated by an assertion of state power.\" Anderson v. Abott, 321 U.S. 349, 365 (1944)(piercing the veil); H.P. Lambert Co. v. Secretary of the Treasury, 354 F.2d 819, 822 (1st Cir. 1965) (\"However important it may be in other respects, the fiction of the corporate entity cannot stand athwart sound regulatory procedure.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say that federal common law applies in this case does not fully resolve the matter. As we recently acknowledged, the federal standard \"for when it is proper to pierce the corporate veil is notably imprecise and fact-intensive.\" Crane v. Green &amp; Freedman Baking Co., 134 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Note, supra, 95 Harv. L. Rev. at 852 (noting that federal common law on veil piercing is amorphous and must be flexibly applied). Federal courts are not bound by \"the strict standards of the common law alter ego doctrine which would apply in a tort or contract action.\" Capital Tel. Co. v. FCC, 498 F.2d 734, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Nor is there any \"litmus test in the federal courts governing when to disregard corporate form.\" Alman v. Danin, 801 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1986). Instead, the rule in federal cases is founded only on the broad principle that \"a corporate entity may be disregarded in the interests of public convenience, fairness and equity.\" Town of Brookline v. Gorsuch, 667 F.2d 215, 221 (1st. Cir. 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gorsuch we recognized that this principle must be applied with sensitivity to the demands of the federal statute at issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying this rule, federal courts will look closely to the purpose of the federal statute to determine whether the statute places importance on the corporate form, an inquiry that usually gives less respect to the corporate form than does the strict common law alter ego doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.

Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, 630 (1983) (\"[T]he Court has consistently refused to give effect to the corporate form where it is interposed to defeat legislative policies.\"); United Elect., Radio and Mach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1091 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[I]n federal question cases, courts are wary of allowing the corporate form to stymie legislative policies\"). Given the need to consider the purposes of the federal statute, we have crafted what we termed a \"less rigorous\" veil-piercing standard tailored to ERISA cases in order to fulfill that statute's goals. 163 Pleasant St., 960 F.2d at 1092 (\"The rationale for encouraging a modicum of corporate disregard in ERISA cases is grounded on congressional intent.\"); see also Alman v. Danin, 801 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Indeed, deferring too readily to the corporate identity may run contrary to the explicit purposes of [ERISA].\") Other Circuits too have considered the specific legislative policies at issue and whether piercing the corporate veil is necessary to further those policies. See Stotter &amp; Co. v. Amstar Corp., 579 F.2d 13, 18-19 (3rd Cir. 1978) (veil piercing necessary to fulfill purposes of Clayton Act); Capital Tel. Co., 498 F.2d at 738 (liberal veil piercing to fulfill purposes of Communications Act of 1934); Kavanaugh v. Ford Motor Co., 353 F.2d 710, 716-17 (7th Cir. 1965) (veil piercing necessary to fulfill purposes of Dealers' Day in Court Act). We must therefore consider the RLA status quo provisions to determine when veil piercing is necessary to prevent frustration of the RLA's purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Railway Labor Act and Veil Piercing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he major purpose of Congress in passing the Railway Labor Act was to provide a machinery to prevent strikes.\" Texas &amp; N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; S.S. Clerks, 281 U.S. 548, 565 (1930) (internal quotation marks omitted). The risk of strikes was considered to be \"particularly acute in the area of 'major disputes,' those disputes involving the formation of collective agreements and efforts to change them.\" Shore Line 396 U.S. at 148. For these disputes, the railroad and union representatives who drafted the Act favored non-binding mediation. See id. at 148-49. To prevent strikes from breaking out while mediation was underway, the Act required that both parties maintain the pre-dispute status quo. See id. at 149. As the Court noted in Shore Line, the Act's status quo provision was \"central to its design\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Its immediate effect is to prevent the union from striking and management from doing anything that would justify a strike. In the long run, delaying the time when the parties can resort to self-help provides time for tempers to cool, helps create an atmosphere in which rational bargaining can occur, and permits the forces of public opinion to be mobilized in favor of a settlement without a strike or lockout. Moreover, since disputes usually arise when one party wants to change the status quo without undue delay, the power which the Act gives the other party to preserve the status quo for a prolonged period will frequently make it worth while for the moving party to compromise with the interests of the other side and thus reach agreement without interruption to commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 150. The Act fashioned a fundamental compromise: during the RLA mediation procedures, the union must refrain from striking and the carrier must refrain from implementing the contested policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Shore Line Court emphasized that the status quo provisions of the RLA must be applied flexibly to fulfill the statute's goal. In Shore Line, the carrier had argued that the RLA required it to preserve the status quo only in those working conditions explicitly covered by the parties' collective bargaining agreement. See id. at 147-48. Since the collective bargaining agreement was silent on the challenged practice, the carrier argued that it should be allowed to continue this practice while RLA mediation to modify the agreement was ongoing. See id. The Court rejected this interpretation, calling it \"fundamentally at odds with the Act's primary objective -- the prevention of strikes.... If the railroad is free at this stage to take advantage of the agreement's silence and resort to self-help, the union cannot be expected to hold back its own economic weapons, including the strike.\" Id. at 154-55. The Court therefore held that the status quo provision must be \"broadly conceived\" to preserve the \"actual, objective working conditions out of which the dispute arose, irrespective of whether these conditions are covered in an existing collective agreement.\" Id. at 143.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court's effort to give practical meaning to the status quo requirement would be circumvented if carriers could use third parties to alter the collective bargaining agreement while the dispute was ongoing. Thus courts have held that a carrier may not hire an independent company to carry out the changes that the unions protest. See e.g., St. Louis S.W. Ry. v. Brotherhood of R.R. Signalmen, 665 F.2d 987, 995 (10th Cir. 1981) (\"There is nothing which leaves room for a suggestion that the [RLA] can be avoided by employing a contractor to perform the work.\"). In the same vein, the RLA is defeated if a carrier uses a related corporation to alter the status quo. The RLA itself acknowledges the possibility that carriers may attempt to use affiliates to achieve their goals by giving courts jurisdiction over railroads and those non-railroads that are \"directly or indirectly owned or controlled by or under common control with any carrier by railroad....\" 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151. While this provision alone does not justify the issuance of an injunction against a non-railroad corporation, it emphasizes that courts must look beyond corporate formalities if the nominally independent corporation is serving as the alter ego of the carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In several cases, courts have engaged in veil piercing when the carrier used an affiliate to escape its collective bargaining agreement and violate the status quo requirements of the RLA. In Burlington Northern R.R. Co. v. United Transp. Union, 862 F.2d 1266 (7th Cir. 1988), the railroad, after failing to convince a local union to accept smaller crews for a particular train service, transferred the work to a subsidiary, Winona Bridge. Finding that the subsidiary was \"serving as the alter ego\" of the carrier, the court held that \"a carrier cannot evade its duties under a collective bargaining agreement or the RLA by directing business to an entity within the same corporate family and not obligated by the existing collective bargaining agreement.\" Id. at 1275. Similarly, in Butte, Anaconda &amp; Pacific Ry. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the carrier argued that its major dispute mediation procedures could be \"terminated\" after a wholly owned subsidiary began performing the disputed work. 268 F. 2d 54, 59 (9th Cir. 1959). The court acknowledged that there would no longer be a major dispute if the work was performed by \"an independent shipper, not acting in concert with its carrier.\" Id. After assessing the links between carrier and subsidiary, however, the court held that the acts of the latter \"must be regarded as the act of the carrier. Otherwise, a carrier by interrelation with its shippers would always have it within its power to circumvent the mediation provision of the Railway Labor Act.\" Id. at 59-60.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting that neither Burlington nor Butte detail the standard that must be applied in an RLA veil-piercing inquiry, appellants claim that these cases support RLA veil piercing only when the pierced corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of the carrier. We reject this reading. First, while these cases deal with wholly owned subsidiaries, they do not state that veil piercing is inappropriate for other types of corporate relatives. In fact, Burlington speaks of piercing not just subsidiaries, but of entities in the \"same corporate family.\" 862 F.2d at 1275. While alter ego liability may be most common in an ordinary parent-subsidiary context, \"the equitable doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is not limited to the parent-subsidiary relationship.\" C M Corp. v. Oberer Dev. Co., 631 F.2d 536, 538 (7th Cir. 1980). Indeed, \"[t]he separate corporateness of affiliated corporations owned by the same parent may be equally disregarded under the proper circumstances.\" In re Bowen Transps., Inc., 551 F.2d 171, 179 (7th Cir. 1977). Courts have pierced the veil in cases involving \"sibling\" corporations, and in cases involving even more intricately arranged corporate structures. See Minnesota Power v. Armco, Inc., 937 F.2d 1363, 1364 (8th Cir. 1991) (complex partnership scheme); cf. Century Oil Tool, Inc. v. Production Specialties, Inc., 737 F.2d 1316, 1317 (5th Cir. 1984) (\"[W]e see no relevant difference between a corporation wholly owned by another corporation, two corporations wholly owned by a third corporation or two corporations wholly owned by three persons who together manage all affairs of the two corporations.\"). The misuse of the corporate form to evade federal regulatory requirements may be easier to prove, as an evidentiary matter, when there is a straightforward parent-subsidiary relationship. However, the RLA status quo provisions could be thwarted if courts were categorically barred from considering other types of corporate relationships that were being used to avoid a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the corporate ties between the carrier and the related corporation provide only a starting point for the analysis. Common ownership by itself is insufficient to pierce the veil. See United States v. Bestfoods, 118 S. Ct. 1876, 1884 (1998) (\"[A] parent corporation... is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.\"). The record must include evidence that the carrier used the related corporation for the purpose of evading the collective bargaining agreement and the status quo requirements of the RLA. In making this determination, no single factor is dispositive. The district court may consider the chronology of events: if the carrier only transferred work to the related corporation after unsuccessful union negotiations, that fact may suggest that the carrier shifted the work in an effort to avoid the RLA status quo provisions. See Burlington, 862 F.2d at 1274 (\"Thus Burlington plainly acknowledged that Winona Bridge was Burlington's second choice, an alternative to unsuccessful union negotiations.\"). That inference of evasion may be stronger when the work shifted to the related corporation is distinct from the related corporation's primary line of business. Other factors may also be relevant, such as whether the carrier and the related corporation fail to observe separate corporate formalities, or whether the related corporation is undercapitalized. See id. at 1276 n.6 (noting that subsidiary had \"no equipment or rail-service employees\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize, however, that the record need not portray the related corporation as a \"sham\" business, expressly created or operated primarily to defeat the RLA. In Butte, for example, the subsidiary had been created and then operated as a separate, legitimate business until the railroad used it to defeat the RLA obligations. 268 F. 2d at 54. It would make little sense to ignore current relationships and arrangements between corporations, and thereby grant the railroad immunity from veil piercing, in those cases where the related corporation being used to defeat the RLA was originally formed (or simultaneously used) for a legitimate purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must be remembered that veil piercing in the RLA context serves a different function than it does in the ordinary state law veil piercing cases. In a typical tort or contract case, the primary purpose of the veil-piercing analysis is exposure of the assets of one corporation for payment of the debts or obligations of a related corporation. In the RLA major dispute proceedings, veil piercing operates only to block the related corporation from assisting the carrier in altering the collective bargaining agreement before mediation procedures are exhausted. Indeed, there is no final judgment on the merits against the related corporation: if the RLA mediation procedures do not achieve a negotiated solution, the law will not block the related corporation from engaging in the contested activities. See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n., 491 U.S. 299, 303 (1989) (\"Once this protracted process ends and no agreement has been reached, the parties may resort to the use of economic force.\"); Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 372 U.S. 284, 291 (1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this way, RLA veil piercing is similar to the well-established practice of extending the scope of an injunction to include non-parties acting in concert with parties to defeat the injunction's purpose. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d) (injunctions can block activities of non-parties who act \"in active concert or participation\" with enjoined parties). In RLA cases (unlike in most cases where injunctions are sought), the substantive law itself imposes the duty to maintain the status quo. In a major dispute, the Act requires that \"rates of pay, rules, or working conditions shall not be altered by the carrier until the controversy has finally been acted upon\" through the Act's mediation procedures. 45 U.S.C. &#167; 156; see also Shore Line 396 U.S. at 150-53 (describing various status quo provisions in the RLA). If in subsequent proceedings the district court determines that the carrier is acting in concert with a related corporation to violate these self-executing status quo provisions, the injunction should be fashioned to reach the related corporation as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the findings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The District Court's Findings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we review the district court's legal conclusions de novo, see Sierra Fria Corp. v. Donald J. Evans, P.C., 127 F.3d 175, 181 (1st Cir. 1997), we accept its factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Moreover, \"[i]t is now settled beyond peradventure that findings of fact do not forfeit 'clearly erroneous' deference merely because they stem from a paper record.\" RCI Northeast Servs. Div. v. Boston Edison Co., 822 F.2d 199, 202 (1st Cir. 1987). Whether the evidence is sufficient to pierce the veil \"is a question of law. But given the issue's fact-intensive nature, the legal threshold of evidentiary sufficiency is a relatively low one.\" Crane, 134 F.3d at 22. We must therefore review the record in the light most favorable to the district court's findings. See Servicos Comerciales Andinos v. General Elec. Del Caribe, Inc., 145 F.3d 463, 466 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided the case on a stipulated record containing deposition transcripts and affidavits from key Springfield, ABR and union leaders. Not surprisingly, the parties offered divergent views of the circumstantial evidence. Springfield relied on ABR's formal corporate separateness from the railroad, and emphasized the undisputed fact that ABR had been formed prior to the labor dispute and was engaged in a separate, legitimate business (paper products manufacturing). It asked the court to view Springfield's suggestion to ABR that it perform switching as merely a friendly business gesture from one independent corporation to another, designed solely to promote each company's efficiency. The Unions, by contrast, argued that the same evidence showed that Springfield sought out ABR's assistance only to thwart the RLA processes. In support of its interpretation, the Unions emphasized common ownership of Springfield and ABR, the chronology of events, and the fact that the same Springfield managers involved in the failed labor negotiations were instrumental in persuading ABR to perform switching for Lincoln and Champion. In a case submitted for judgment on a stipulated record, the district court resolves disputed issues of material fact. See Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Secretary of the Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., 768 F.2d 5, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the appellants (and our dissenting colleague) continue to characterize Springfield's motivation as benign, the district court plainly rejected the claim that ABR was acting as an independent corporation. Rather, the court found that the conduct of Springfield was analogous to that of the carrier in Burlington, a case in which the carrier used a subsidiary alter ego to violate its collective bargaining agreement and the RLA. Noting that it could \"look beyond the surface... to see whether the disputed practice is in reality an attempt to evade the collective bargaining agreement,\" the court concluded that Springfield's arrangement with ABR was an \"attempt[] to change unilaterally the terms\" of its deal with the Unions. The court pointed to both the \"close family relationship\" among the corporations and the fact that the transfer of switching came only after Springfield's \"failed attempt to negotiate more favorable terms for the work that ABR is now doing on a nonunion basis.\" The court drew a distinction between Springfield assisting ABR in taking over its own switching -- a fairly common industry practice -- and Springfield's suggestion that ABR should travel to other Springfield customers and perform the switching work that the Unions had refused to do for lower pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the evidence supporting the district court's finding that Springfield used ABR to circumvent its collective bargaining agreement with the Unions was circumstantial, there was, contrary to the insistence of the dissent, sufficient evidence to support that conclusion. First, the district court properly noted that the overlap in ownership between Springfield and ABR was almost total. Three of the four individuals who owned Springfield (through the Guilford holding company) were the sole owners of ABR. At the time the dispute arose, the three corporations (Guilford, Springfield and ABR) had the same four directors: specifically, the three owners of ABR, plus Richard Kelso.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the \"close family relationship\" between ABR and Springfield is not dispositive of the veil-piercing inquiry, the district court also properly relied upon a chronology of events which supports an inference that Springfield was using ABR to violate its collective bargaining agreement and defeat the RLA status quo requirements. Notably, Springfield only invited ABR to start performing switching for its customers after Springfield was unable to convince the Unions to accept wage concessions. Also, the Springfield vice-president who approached ABR, Sydney Culliford, was described by one union leader as the key player in the failed labor negotiations. Likewise, the ABR executive who decided that the wood products shop should start switching for Springfield customers was David Armstrong Fink, who in addition to being President of ABR was also an owner of Guilford and director of Springfield (and several months later, Springfield's executive vice-president). It was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the work was shifted to ABR after the first round of failed negotiations as a way of pressuring the Unions to accept wage concessions, and circumventing the RLA strictures that bar these unilateral changes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent argues that this reading of the evidence must be rejected because ABR only performed switching for Springfield customers Lincoln and Champion after they had already (and independently) decided to stop using Springfield for switching. However, the only evidence that Lincoln and Champion had chosen to end their switching agreement with Springfield before ABR was presented as an alternative comes from assertions by Springfield managers and officers. The district court did not credit this version of events in its opinion, and nothing compelled it to do so. Springfield and ABR officials participated together in discussions with Lincoln and Champion over who should perform the switching. ABR President David Fink (an owner of Springfield through Guilford) stated at his deposition that he and Springfield's Culliford met together with Lincoln managers to discuss how ABR could fulfill switching needs previously performed by the Unions. Other evidence indicates that even after ABR took over the day-to-day switching work, Lincoln saw ABR as simply the non-union switching arm of Springfield. On one occasion when Lincoln needed to change its switching schedule, it wrote a letter to Springfield, not ABR, informing it of its needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even after Springfield directed<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> switching work to ABR, and even after this litigation was filed, it continued to seek wage concessions on switching from the Unions. See Burlington, 862 F.2d at 1276 n.6 (\"If [carrier] and [subsidiary] were truly distinct entities, further negotiation would have been moot\" following the decision to transfer work to the subsidiary.). One union leader, Michael Twombley, claims that Culliford- the Springfield Vice-President who had suggested that ABR take over switching work to begin with-approached him and asked the Unions to make a reasonable offer so that Springfield could perform switching for International Paper mill plants. A second union leader, Michael Maloof, was told by Springfield's labor relations head, Roland Dinsdale, that Springfield wanted union concessions so that it could win switching business from the independent contractor, Rail Link.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that Springfield was still actively looking for switching work, it is difficult to fathom why Springfield would want to assist ABR if the latter were truly independent. Union negotiator Maloof asked this very question when Dinsdale told the Unions to accept wage concessions so that Springfield could compete against switching bids being made by various independent contractors. According to Maloof, Dinsdale told him that Springfield was concerned with independent contractor bids, but not with ABR, because Springfield controlled ABR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken together, this evidence amply supports the conclusions that ABR was not acting as an independent company in providing switching services, that Springfield was attempting to convert two of ABR's thirty-four employees into its non-union switching arm, and that Springfield was using ABR as a lever against the Unions, pressuring them to accept lower pay by changing the status quo in the middle of negotiations. Given that a central purpose of the RLA is to block such tactics, see Shore Line, 396 U.S. at 148, the district court did not err in enjoining ABR from switching Springfield consignees while Springfield and the Unions completed the RLA mediation procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the claims of improper veil piercing, the appellants raise several miscellaneous objections to the district court's major dispute determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Change in Pay, Rules or Working Conditions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that the dispute was not major because it failed to produce a change in \"pay, rules or working conditions\" for the Unions. 45 U.S.C. &#167; 152. According to appellants, the Unions did not provide \"any documented evidence of any actual loss\" and instead pointed only to \"theoretical loss of wages\" and minor changes in the working conditions. Moreover, the appellants claim that the Unions have actually benefitted from any changes because Springfield's railway business has increased and it has hired new union employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants demand more loss than the law requires. The mere \"prospect of having work shifted to a replacement subsidiary would constitute a change in the working conditions and practices\" sufficient to trigger a major dispute. Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l v. Transamerica, 817 F.2d 510, 516 (9th Cir. 1987). In fact, even the loss of completely \"new business,\" never performed by the unions, may be considered a change in the working conditions if the unions traditionally performed work of this type. See Burlington, 862 F.2d at 1276. Here, the Unions have shown far more than the prospective loss of new switching business. The exact switching work previously performed by Union workers is now being performed by non-union ABR employees. Moreover, because the Unions no longer perform this switching, some members have had to report to different locations at different times than they otherwise would have, a manifest change in \"working conditions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Implicit Term</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants claim that the district court erred in rejecting its argument that the collective bargaining agreement \"implicitly\" allowed the arrangement between Springfield and ABR. If a carrier presents evidence that the challenged labor practice has been knowingly acquiesced in by the union, the challenged practice is treated as an implicit term of the collective bargaining agreement and any dispute over the meaning of that term is minor. See Maine Central R.R. Co. v. United Transp. Union, 787 F. 2d 780, 782 (1st Cir. 1986). To take advantage of the minor dispute provision, the carrier need only show that the implicit contractual term defense is not \"totally implausible.\" Id. at 783.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that the Unions had previously acquiesced to Springfield allowing several of its freight customers to perform their own switching. The dissent too makes much of this point, noting that even before ABR started switching for Lincoln and Champion, Springfield had assisted several mill customers (including ABR) in taking over their own switching. The district court, however, ruled that Union acquiescence in those instances was totally inapposite:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The companies have pointed only to past practices where Springfield Terminal has helped its customers take over their own switching work. The unions, however, no longer quarrel with ABR doing its own switching. Instead, the unions complain because Springfield Terminal, they say, is essentially assisting ABR to act as a railroad in doing nonunion switching work for customers, specifically Terminal's customers, who would otherwise be using Springfield Terminal's union crews. There is not even arguably any such past practice. I agree with the unions that any purported reliance on past practices to justify this new arrangement is, therefore, obviously insubstantial; this is not a minor dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record amply supports the district court's past practice findings.

Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., 486 U.S. 196, 199 (1988) (\"A question remaining to be decided after an order ending litigation on the merits does not prevent finality if its resolution will not alter the order or moot or revise decisions embodied in the order.\").

Without necessarily accepting that specific formulation of the requirement, there is no question that a manipulation of the corporate form to circumvent a federal regulatory scheme is sufficiently blameworthy to meet this standard. See First Nat'l City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, 630 (1983) (\"[T]he Court has consistently refused to give effect to the corporate form where it is interposed to defeat legislative policies.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  The dissent claims that it is wrong to suggest that Springfield \"directed\" work to ABR, arguing that the district court's opinion and record only prove that \"Springfield facilitated ABR's obtaining outside switching work.\" Post at 35 n.5. However, the district court plainly determined that Springfield had directed the business to ABR, finding that \"Springfield Terminal's claim that it is not attempting to change unilaterally the terms of the collective bargaining agreement is totally implausible.\" As discussed above, the record supports a finding that Springfield transferred some of its switching to ABR.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  The appellants also claim that any changes in pay, rules or working conditions were caused by ABR, and that Springfield cannot be held responsible for ABR's activities.

Springfield, therefore, is responsible for changes in pay, rules and working conditions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  Springfield also points out that on the one occasion it used non-union employees to perform switching work, one union ignored it and the other treated it as only a minor dispute. This argument does nothing to prove union acquiescence to an arrangement like that between Springfield and ABR. From the record, it appears that the case Springfield points to involved which employees (engineers or \"carmen\") were allowed to perform the switching on one specific track, not whether a party related to Springfield could essentially act as the carrier's non-union switching arm.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe the majority misreads the record and misapprehends the federal law on piercing the corporate veil.

Springfield Terminal Ry., Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 9 (D. Me. Feb. 5, 1999), justifies the conclusion that Springfield unilaterally brought about a change in working conditions in violation of the collective bargaining agreement by \"direct[ing]\" the Lincoln and Champion switching work to ABR. See ante at 26. The majority acknowledges, as do the Unions, that without finding ABR to be an alter ego -- for which there is no record evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> -- or a piercing of the corporate veil, it could not hold ABR liable under the RLA. In my view, the district court's conclusion is not sustainable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before proceeding to discuss the issues before us, I must contend with how the majority couches its factual recitation. The majority states its intention to \"begin by sketching the facts of this labor dispute, reserving for later a more detailed discussion of the district court's findings.\" Ante at 2. What follows, however, intermixes predicate facts in the evidence with the actual findings the district court made. To an uninformed reader, this intermixing of facts and the district court's findings might well be quite confusing. The effect is to bolster the majority's ultimate conclusion, which is not sustainable based solely on the district court's findings, with bits and pieces of evidence from the record. I believe this approach is unfortunate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority suggests that ABR made each decision relating to switching solely to satisfy Springfield's goals. Neither the district court's findings nor the record supports such a contention. In early 1998, because its operations were growing, ABR decided it needed to provide additional trackage for the storing, loading, unloading, and switching of railroad cars over the two sidetracks that it owned and over which it had exclusive use. To satisfy its operational needs, it negotiated with its line-hauling carrier, Springfield, a standard joint use agreement, which is a contract by which a company obtains the use of a railroad's tracks for its own operations. Under this agreement, ABR to complement its own two tracks obtained the right to use four contiguous tracks owned and controlled by Springfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from the record that ABR received no special treatment from Springfield because this agreement was identical to joint use agreements the railroad previously had negotiated with other customers. Long before ABR negotiated its agreement, Springfield had entered into similar joint use agreements with S.D. Warren of Westbrook, Maine in August 1992; Specialty Minerals, Inc. of Adams, Massachusetts in October 1996; and Turners Island LLC of South Portland, Maine in October 1997. In addition, Springfield had assisted several companies without joint use agreements -- Merrill's Terminal of Portland, Maine in 1990; Hampshire Chemical of Nashua, New Hampshire in 1995; and Fort James of Old Town, Maine in 1996 -- in taking over their own switching. Like ABR, each company is a freight customer of Springfield's, each had ceased using Springfield for intraplant switching, and each had begun to perform its own switching. Moreover, in each of these instances, the shipper made the decision to do its own switching, and Springfield trained employees of each company in the operation of the trackmobile, a device used to move rail cars between tracks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1998, ABR, motivated by a desire to increase its flexibility and efficiency in switching, decided to do its own intraplant switching.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> The district court foundthat to accomplish its goals, ABR leased from Maine Central Railway a trackmobile, and two of ABR's employees received training in its operation from two Springfield employees. See Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 4. The record is clear that this assistance was neither unusual nor improper because it followed Springfield's normal practice when current line-haul customers elected to do their own switching. From Springfield's point of view, this assistance had a legitimate business purpose because the more efficient a customer became at switching, the more line-haul business that customer could give to Springfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the time that ABR decided to do its own switching, Lincoln and Champion complained that Springfield was unable to meet their scheduling needs for switching. Lincoln and Champion discussed with Springfield their intention to perform their own switching. The majority contends that Springfield \"directed\" or \"transferred\" switching work to ABR. Ante at 26 &amp; n.8. Respectfully, I think this assertion misstates the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> It was only after Lincoln and Champion had decided to leave Springfield<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> that Sydney Culliford, Vice President of Transportation for Springfield, suggested to David Armstrong Fink that if ABR were not using its trackmobile to full capacity, it could maximize its use by also performing switching services for other industries that wished to do their own switching. Because Lincoln and Champion already had decided that Springfield could not meet their switching needs when they began to use ABR, it is illogical to suggest that Springfield \"directed\" or \"transferred\" this business to ABR. After all, a company cannot transfer business it does not have.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Unions and the majority make much of Culliford's suggestion. This suggestion, however, is unremarkable because it does not indicate that either Springfield or ABR were using the corporate form as a ruse. The record is devoid of evidence to indicate that Culliford acted at the instruction of any of the owners of Guilford or ABR when he made his suggestion to ABR management. Culliford is neither an owner nor a director of Guilford, Springfield, or ABR. More importantly, his suggestion made legitimate business sense for both companies because ABR could maximize its use of switching capabilities otherwise underutilized, and Springfield could ensure an expansion of its line-hauling business. A helpful suggestion from one company to another does not create an alter ego relationship or provide a basis for piercing the corporate veil.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's assertion that the railroad's attempt to renegotiate is further proof of collusion misses the mark. Rather, Springfield's continued attempts to renegotiate its union contract indicate that the railroad desired to save its switching business if it could, but recognized the need to decrease its costs to be competitive. A more realistic view than that advanced by the majority is that if Springfield and ABR truly were colluding, once Springfield \"transferred\" its switching work to what the majority says is its alter ego, ABR, it would have given up on trying to renegotiate the Union contract because its goals already would have been realized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also misconstrues the applicable legal standards. After explaining that federal law controls whether to disregard the corporate form, the majority misreads and overstates that law. The majority contends that federal common law allows courts in cases involving federal statutes to fashion new, statute-specific rules for disregarding the corporate form. I do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the majority is correct that in ERISA cases, we have crafted \"a 'less rigorous' veil-piercing standard,\" ante at 13, we have not crafted one that is standardless. Contrary to the majority, which contends that veil piercing typically is appropriate to effectuate legislation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> this court always has engaged in a more searching inquiry. See United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1092-93 (1st Cir. 1992). Common ownership alone is insufficient to justify piercing the veil. See United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. T.P. Property Corp., 583 F.2d 33, 35-36 (1st Cir. 1978); ante at 19.

ABR was formed to operate a sawmill and a wood products plant. See Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 2. It is not a shill. It began its operations not after, or as a result of, the railroad's failed negotiations with the Unions, but in 1994, which was two years before the labor contract even began. It began switching to satisfy its own production needs. It shares with Springfield neither books, funds, nor offices. It shares with Springfield no corporate officers and with the exception of David Armstrong Fink, who is the president of ABR and a vice-president of Springfield, no common employees. Indeed, all it does share with Springfield is some ownership congruence, but the record is silent on the degree of that overlap because it fails to indicate what percentages of each company the Finks and Mellon own.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority buttresses its decision to pierce the corporate veil with cases that are inapplicable to the facts before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> To justify disregarding the corporate form in a case with mere ownership overlap, the majority relies entirely on cases that involve wholly owned subsidiaries. See ante at 17-19 (discussing Burlington, 862 F.2d 1266; Butte, Anaconda &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen, 268 F.2d 54 (9th Cir. 1959)). For example, in Butte, the railway was \"a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anaconda, and both corporations [were] managed by the same staff of officers from president down to secretary-treasurer.\" Butte, 268 F.2d at 55. ABR is not a subsidiary of Springfield or Guilford, and the companies are not managed by the same personnel. In Butte, the officers who made all major policy decisions for the subsidiary were also officers of the parent, and as one might expect, their \"controlling consideration\" always was \"the ultimate effect\" the decision would have on the parent's profits. Id. No officers of ABR are officers of Springfield or Guilford. While the majority speculates that ABR's decisions were made for the sole benefit of Springfield, no record evidence supports that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority attempts to extend the rule from these parent-subsidiary cases to this case, but does not satisfactorily justify or explain the extension. The majority uses the fact that Burlington, a Seventh Circuit case, employs the phrase \"the same corporate family\" to justify piercing the veil in this case. See ante at 18. All of the cases Burlington cites after this language, however, involve wholly owned subsidiaries. See Burlington, 862 F.2d at 1275 (citing Burlington N. R.R. v. United Transp. Union, 688 F. Supp. 1261, 1266-67 (N.D. Ill. 1988) (the district court opinion); International Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Eastern Airlines, No. 87-1720, 1988 WL 25506 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 1988), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 849 F.2d 1481 (D.C. Cir. 1988); Butte, 268 F.2d 54). Moreover, every time the term \"corporate family\" has appeared in a Seventh Circuit opinion, it has referred not to a mere overlap in ownership, but to corporations within a parent-subsidiary relationship. See In re Meyer, 120 F.3d 66, 69 (7th Cir. 1997); Fitzgerald v. Chrysler Corp., 116 F.3d 225, 228 (7th Cir. 1997); Northern Ind. Pub. Serv. Co. v.

Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1998); Donatelli v. National Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459, 466 (1st Cir. 1990); Barrett v. Continental Ill.

The majority thus has little basis upon which to hold that Burlington's use of the phrase \"corporate family\" was meant to refer to anything other than the wholly owned subsidiary at issue in that case. While arguably there may be cases in which stockholders of a railroad form a nonsubsidiary for the sole purpose of circumventing the collective bargaining agreement, there is no record support for the contention that this is such a case, nor should the parent-subsidiary argument be used to extend the doctrine here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority cites Minnesota Power v. Armco, Inc., 937 F.2d 1363 (8th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that courts have pierced the corporate veil in cases involving complex partnership schemes. See ante at 18-19. Minnesota Power, however, does not support the majority's contention even though it did involve a complex partnership scheme. From 1978 through 1982, the Reserve Mining Co. (\"Reserve\") was the wholly owned subsidiary of Armco and Republic Steel. See Minnesota Power, 937 F.2d at 1364. In 1982, Armco and Republic Steel changed Reserve into a partnership and each took an equal share. See id. Armco then transferred to its wholly owned corporate subsidiary, First Taconite, its partnership interest. See id. The Eighth Circuit saw no clear error in the district court's findings that (1) from 1978 through 1982, Reserve, which was Armco's and Republic Steel's wholly owned corporate subsidiary, was Armco's alter ego and (2) from 1982 through 1986, First Taconite, which as Armco's wholly owned corporate subsidiary owned a partnership interest in Reserve, was Armco's alter ego. See id. at 1364, 1368. That court merely held wholly owned corporate subsidiaries to be the alter ego of their parent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also cites Century Oil Tool, Inc. v. Production Specialties, Inc., 737 F.2d 1316 (5th Cir. 1984), quoting language that \"we see no relevant difference between a corporation wholly owned by another corporation... or two corporations wholly owned by three persons who together manage all affairs of the two corporations.\"Id. at 1317. This case dealt not with the RLA, but with whether two corporations with the same ownership and control constituted a single entity under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See id. at 1316. In Century Oil, the same three men owned and controlled both Gas Lift, which manufactured \"wireline tools and gas lift valves,\" and Production Specialties, which sold them. Id. at 1317. Each company existed solely to benefit the other. In addition, \"[b]oth corporations operated from the same physical plant.\" Id. The Unions concede that ABR's principal business is unrelated to the railroad's and that switching is incidental to its main business. And, while the majority thinks it immaterial that ownership and control between Springfield and ABR is not identical, the Century Oil court would disagree. See id. at 1317 n.1 (\"We address only the question of the independence of two corporations under common ownership. The point at which the ownership of two or more corporations so loses its commonality as to furnish a plurality of actors... is not before us.\"). I remain unpersuaded by the majority's expansion of responsibility to companies with only some ownership congruence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the import of the court's decision today has much significance for ABR. The RLA sets up separate procedures depending on whether a dispute is major or minor. If the dispute is minor, it will be resolved quickly through \"compulsory and binding arbitration.\" Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 491 U.S. 299, 303 (1989). In contrast, major disputes endure \"a lengthy process of bargaining and mediation\" during which \"the parties are obligated to maintain the status quo.\" Id. at 302. Congress designed the major-dispute procedures to prevent strikes. See Elgin, Joliet &amp; E. Ry. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 725-26 (1945). The majority's resolution of the major-minor issue will have little or no impact on the Unions because no Union jobs have been lost as a result of shippers doing their own switching; rather, Springfield in fact has provided more Union jobs since losing some of its switching business. The majority's conclusion, however, does not allow ABR, a nonrailroad and a legitimate business, the right to expand its switching operations to other entities that also desire timely and flexible switching, nor does it regain for Springfield the switching business it already has lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The burden of proof is on the party seeking to disregard the corporate form.

In this case, aside from drawing the trial court's attention to the overlap in ownership, the Unions failed to present evidence that the court should pierce the corporate veil.

Based on the limited facts found by the district court, I believe that its ultimate conclusion that piercing the corporate veil was proper is in error.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  When they filed their initial complaint, the Unions argued that the court should enjoin ABR from engaging in switching even at its own facility. The Unions later dropped this contention and focused solely on ABR's switching for Springfield's consignees.

Culliford assisted ABR in its efforts to get Lincoln's and Champion's business only after they made it clear to Springfield that they intended to perform the work on their own. The majority, however, uses the term \"directed\" in a pejorative manner and states that Springfield \"transferred\" its switching work to ABR. See ante at 26 n.8. Neither the findings of the district court nor the record supports this assertion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  The district court indicated that Culliford \"suggested that ABR pursue switching contracts with Springfield Terminal's customers.\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 9. But the district court never explicitly found that Lincoln or Champion would have used Springfield for their switching absent ABR's entry into the market.</p>\n        <p>To the extent the district court implicitly found that Lincoln and Champion would have remained customers of Springfield absent Culliford's suggestion, it committed clear error. See Strahan, 127 F.3d at 172. Because of the undisputed evidence in the record that Lincoln and Champion already had decided to discontinue Springfield's switching services, any finding or implication to the contrary by the district court or by the majority is not based on record evidence.</p>\n        <p>The majority notes that \"the only evidence that Lincoln and Champion had chosen to end their switching agreement with Springfield before ABR was presented as an alternative comes from assertions by Springfield managers and officers\" and that \"[t]he district court did not credit this version of events in its opinion.\" Ante at 25-26. While it is true that only David Armstrong Fink and Culliford testified that Lincoln and Champion already had decided to cease the use of Springfield for switching, the Unions neither attempted to discredit them in cross-examination nor presented evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the district court never expressed doubt about the veracity of this testimony. Therefore, the only conclusion the record supports is that Lincoln and Champion already had decided to leave Springfield.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Taking the majority's logic to its ultimate conclusion, and given the breadth of the injunction now in force, if a shipper on the line were to call ABR and request that it do the company's switching, that too would be prohibited under the terms of the injunction simply because of the overlap in ownership.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  The majority argues that because Springfield still engages in switching work, \"it is difficult to fathom why Springfield would want to assist ABR if the latter were truly independent.\" Ante at 27.

But the majority fails logically to connect these ideas. It cites Detroit &amp; Toledo Shore Line Railroad v. United Transportation Union, 396 U.S. 142 (1969), and implies that its strong statements about the importance of the RLA justify piercing the veil in all RLA cases. Shore Line, however, is inapposite because that decision has nothing to do with piercing the corporate veil. Rather, it involved a railroad and a union that already were in mediation under the major dispute rules of the Act. See id. at 145. During mediation, the railroad itself implemented a new policy that changed a previously uncovered condition in the collective bargaining agreement. See id. at 146-47. The Court's strong statements that allowing the railroad's actions would defeat the Act's purposes, see id. at 155, neither bear weight in deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil nor help to articulate what the federal standard is.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  The district court, and the majority, relied on Burlington Northern Railroad v. United Transportation Union, 862 F.2d 1266 (7th Cir. 1988), for the proposition that courts \"can look beyond the surface of purportedly similar transactions to see whether the disputed practice before it is in reality an attempt to evade the collective bargaining agreement.\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 9. I read Burlington differently.</p>\n        <p>In that case, to implement a new program, Burlington, the railroad, negotiated with the unions to change their collective bargaining agreement, but the unions refused. See Burlington, 862 F.2d at 1269. In response, Burlington entered into a trackage rights agreement with Winona Bridge, its wholly owned subsidiary, which was not a party to the collective bargaining agreement, and the unions sued to enjoin them. See id. The issue was not whether the court should pierce Winona Bridge's corporate veil; rather, it was whether the unions had acquiesced in similar past activities. See id. at 1273. Such acquiescence can be used to show that a dispute is \"minor\" under the RLA. See Maine Cent. R.R. v. United Transp. Union, 787 F.2d 780, 782-83 (1st Cir. 1986). The court found that while the unions had acquiesced in Burlington's granting of trackage rights generally, they never had acquiesced in its granting them \"to a wholly owned, five-employee subsidiary which utterly lack[ed] any of the necessary equipment to service such a line.\" Burlington, 862 F.2d at 1273. The court, in other words, merely narrowed the scope of the unions' previous acquiescence without engaging in any alter ego analysis.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  For example, in Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway v.

See ante at 18 (citing C.M. Corp. v. Oberer Dev. Co, 631 F.2d 536 (7th Cir. 1980); Central Nat'l Bank of Mattoon v. Bowen Transps., Inc. (In re Bowen Transps., Inc.), 551 F.2d 171 (7th Cir. 1977)). These cases, however, lend no assistance. In In re Bowen, the court stated that it did \"not believe that the equitable doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is limited to the parent-subsidiary relationship.\" 551 F.2d at 179; accord C.M. Corp., 631 F.2d at 539. The In re Bowen court then noted that \"[t]he separate corporateness of affiliated corporations owned by the same parent may be equally disregarded under the proper circumstances.\" 551 F.2d at 179 (emphasis supplied); accord C.M. Corp., 631 F.2d at 539. These cases refer not to the circumstance presented -- that is, companies with mere ownership congruence -- but to one in which a parent corporation owns many affiliated corporations. Moreover, both cases make it very clear that overlap in ownership alone is insufficient to pierce the corporate veil. See C.M. Corp., 631 F.2d at 539 (noting that stock control and common officers and directors \"are not sufficient by themselves to invoke the doctrine\" because they \"exist in most parent and subsidiary relationships\" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); In re Bowen, 551 F.2d at 179 (\"[A]lthough stock control and common directors and officers are generally prerequisites for application of the doctrine permitting the corporate veil to be pierced, that is not by itself sufficient to bring the doctrine into operation.\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

See 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151 and seq. The district court issued the injunction after finding that the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and United Transportation Union (the \"Unions\") were engaged in a \"major\" dispute with Springfield Terminal Railway Company (\"Springfield\") and that Springfield was using Aroostook and Bangor Resources, Inc. (\"ABR\") to violate its collective bargaining agreement. Springfield and ABR (the \"appellants\") argue that ABR, although owned and controlled by Springfield's owners, is an independent wood products company not subject to the RLA and therefore not subject to the district court's order that it stop performing switching for Springfield customers while RLA mediation procedures are underway. We reject the contention that ABR is not subject to the injunctive provisions of the RLA, and we affirm both the district court's finding that there was a \"major\" dispute between Springfield and its Unions and the district court's injunction against ABR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Labor Dispute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by sketching the facts of this labor dispute, reserving for later a more detailed discussion of the district court's findings. In doing so, \"[w]e recite the facts in the light most favorable to the district court's findings of fact.\" Servicos Comerciales Andinos v. General Electric Del Caribe, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198009\"><a href=\"/opinion/198009/servicios-commercial-v-general-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 466 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995 the Unions and Springfield negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that governs the rates of pay, rules, and working conditions for Springfield locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. The agreement specifically provides that union employees \"shall perform any and all services under the direct control of the Carrier required for the make up of trains and/or the movement of cars and trains over and through the Carrier's trackage and in its business of servicing industrial sidings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One such \"business of servicing industrial sidings\" is switching, a service that rail carriers often provide for their customers on the customers' properties. Springfield employees who are union members have historically provided this service to many of Springfield's line-haul railway customers. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the union members performing these switching services have been paid and treated identically to engineers, conductors, and trainmen involved in other aspects of Springfield's railway business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996 Springfield proposed that the union members engaged in switching accept a twenty-six percent pay cut and less favorable working conditions. Although the Unions' leaders initially resisted, they eventually agreed to submit a proposed pay cut to their respective memberships. The memberships of both Unions rejected the changes in August 1996, opting instead to maintain the more favorable terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Despite the vote, Springfield persisted in seeking a pay cut for switching work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unable to persuade the Unions to accept lower pay for switching, Springfield took a series of steps in the spring of 1998 that resulted in ABR performing switching that had previously been done by Springfield's unions. ABR is a non-unionized company located along Springfield's railway lines engaged primarily in the manufacture of clothes pins and other wood products. Springfield executed an agreement with ABR in April 1998 giving ABR joint use of some railway tracks, and Springfield personnel trained two non-union ABR employees to use a leased track-mobile to perform the switching at the ABR wood products mill previously done by Springfield's union employees. While joint use agreements of this type are fairly common in the railway industry, Springfield's next move was unusual. Shortly after executing the joint use agreement, Springfield suggested to ABR that it truck its switching equipment from place to place so that it could perform switching work for various Springfield railway customers that had previously used Springfield (and the Unions) for switching. ABR agreed and by May of 1998 it was providing switching services for Springfield customers Lincoln Pulp &amp; Paper (\"Lincoln\") and Passadumkeag Stud Mill, owned by Champion International, Inc. (\"Champion\"). ABR also investigated performing switching work for other Springfield customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although nominally an independent corporation, ABR is not unrelated to Springfield. Springfield is a wholly owned subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries, Inc. (\"Guilford\"), a holding company that owns several railroads in New England.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Guilford, in turn, was closely held (at the time of the dispute) by four individuals who also served as its directors: David Andrew Fink, David Armstrong Fink, Richard Kelso and Timothy Mellon. Both of the Finks and Mellon were also the sole owners of ABR. The three companies shared the same four directors at the time the dispute arose: all three ABR owners plus Richard Kelso. While David Andrew Fink served as President of Springfield, his son, David Armstrong Fink, served as President of ABR (as well as a Director of Guilford and, later, as an Executive Vice-President at Springfield). It was David Armstrong Fink who met with a Springfield vice-president involved in the failed labor negotiations about the possibility of ABR performing the switching work previously done by the Unions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Railway Labor Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Unions filed suit under the RLA, arguing that Springfield was using ABR to violate the terms of its collective bargaining agreement. Under the RLA, a district court has no jurisdiction to rule on the merits of a labor dispute. Rather, the court may only decide what type of statutorily mandated dispute resolution procedure is appropriate, depending on the category of the dispute. See Elgin, Joilet &amp; E. Ry. v. Burley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104170\"><a href=\"/opinion/104170/elgin-j-e-ry-co-v-burley/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, 722-23 (1945). Minor disputes under the RLA are those in which the carrier's challenged policies are at least arguably permitted under the existing collective bargaining agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> If the dispute is \"minor,\" the district court dismisses the case in favor of binding arbitration. Major disputes, on the other hand, relate to carrier attempts to modify rates of pay, rules or working conditions in a fashion not even arguably covered by the collective bargaining agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs v. Boston &amp; Maine Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468726\"><a href=\"/opinion/468726/brotherhood-of-locomotive-engineers-v-boston-maine-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span>, 797 (1st Cir. 1986); Maine Central R.R., Co. v.

If the dispute is \"major,\" the Act provides for extensive, non-binding mediation procedures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In major disputes- unlike minor disputes- the RLA bars the carrier from implementing the contested change until the mediation efforts are exhausted.

To invest these status quo requirements with judicial authority, the district court is permitted to issue an injunction ordering the parties to maintain the pre-dispute status quo while the mediation procedures take place. See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112300\"><a href=\"/opinion/112300/consolidated-rail-corporation-v-railway-labor-executives-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 303 (1989) (\"The district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to enjoin a violation of the status quo pending completion of the required procedures....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Unions argued to the district court that the arrangement between Springfield and ABR created a major dispute because Springfield was seeking to modify the collective bargaining agreement's rules on pay and working conditions for those engaged in switching. The Unions claimed that Springfield was using ABR to implement this contested change before RLA mediation procedures were exhausted, thereby violating the RLA's requirement that the carrier and union maintain the pre-dispute status quo. The appellants objected, arguing, inter alia, that Springfield had not done anything to alter the collective bargaining agreement and that ABR was acting independently in performing switching work for Springfield customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of a stipulated record, the district court ruled that the dispute was major under the RLA. In so concluding, the court found that Springfield was attempting to evade the collective bargaining agreement by \"allow[ing] a corporate relative not bound by the collective bargaining agreement to perform work covered by the collective bargaining agreement.\" The court also rejected the appellants' other defenses: their assertion that the arrangement with ABR did not alter the pay or working conditions of the Unions and their assertion that the arrangement was covered by \"implied terms\" in the collective bargaining agreement. The court then enjoined ABR from performing industrial switching for Lincoln, Champion and any companies for which Springfield currently provided switching services, pending the outcome of the RLA mediation procedures. ABR and Springfield appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that there is no major dispute under the RLA because Springfield made no changes at all to the collective bargaining agreement. Rather, appellants claim, Springfield's rail customers simply chose to use ABR for better service of their switching needs. Since ABR is a company independent from Springfield- a wood products shop and not a railway- the district court erred in attributing ABR's actions to Springfield, despite the nearly total overlap in ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Springfield that the dispute cannot be labeled \"major\" simply because the collective bargaining agreement required switching to be performed by the Unions. If ABR was truly acting on its own, an injunction against ABR would have been improper. The collective bargaining agreement is between Springfield and the Unions; ABR is not a party. Moreover, the RLA applies only to carriers; ABR is not a carrier. See 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151, First. Unless the district court properly treated ABR as the alter ego of Springfield, and properly disregarded the separateness of the two corporations by piercing the corporate veil of ABR, it could not attribute ABR's conduct to Springfield and enjoin ABR from switching Springfield customers. We must therefore assess whether veil piercing was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In doing so, we must be clear about the sense in which we are using these terms. See Note, Piercing the Corporate Veil: The Alter Ego Doctrine under Federal Common Law, 95 Harv. L. Rev 853 (1982) (noting that the terms are amorphous). To pierce a corporate veil means to disregard its corporate formalities. See Black's Law Dictionary 1168 (7th ed. 1999) (noting that \"piercing the corporate veil\" and \"disregarding the corporate entity\" are the same thing). The veil may be pierced if one corporation is not an independent entity, but rather the mere \"alter ego\" of another. 1 James D. Cox, Thomas Lee Hazen &amp; F. Hodge O'Neal, Corporations &#167; 7.8 at 7.17 (1995);cf. Black's Law Dictionary 385 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \"alter ego\" as a \"corporation used by an individual to conduct personal business\"). In this case, ABR is Springfield's \"alter ego\" in the context of this labor dispute if ABR is acting as a non-union branch of Springfield rather than as an independent company. Likewise, when we speak of \"piercing\" ABR's veil, we mean simply disregarding its corporate separateness in the limited context where it is allegedly serving as an alter ego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Federal Common Law of Veil Piercing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must determine whether state law or federal common law governs the veil-piercing inquiry. In federal question cases, such as this one, we look to federal choice of law principles. See Texas Indus., Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110484\"><a href=\"/opinion/110484/texas-industries-inc-v-radcliff-materials-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span>, 642 (1981); see also Edelmann v.

If the federal statute in question demands national uniformity, federal common law provides the determinative rules of decision. See United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110048\"><a href=\"/opinion/110048/united-states-v-kimbell-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 728 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National uniformity is essential in the interpretation of labor law. Federal courts have fashioned a body of federal common law to govern labor disputes, recognizing that harmonious labor relations are essential to interstate commerce. See, e.g., Textile Workers Union v.

Likewise, a federal veil-piercing standard is required to prevent carriers from using non-carriers (which are not themselves subject to the RLA) to circumvent federal labor law requirements.

In the long run, delaying the time when the parties can resort to self-help provides time for tempers to cool, helps create an atmosphere in which rational bargaining can occur, and permits the forces of public opinion to be mobilized in favor of a settlement without a strike or lockout. Moreover, since disputes usually arise when one party wants to change the status quo without undue delay, the power which the Act gives the other party to preserve the status quo for a prolonged period will frequently make it worth while for the moving party to compromise with the interests of the other side and thus reach agreement without interruption to commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108012\"><a href=\"/opinion/108012/detroit-toledo-shore-line-r-co-v-transportation-union/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 150. </a></span>The Act fashioned a fundamental compromise: during the RLA mediation procedures, the union must refrain from striking and the carrier must refrain from implementing the contested policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Shore Line Court emphasized that the status quo provisions of the RLA must be applied flexibly to fulfill the statute's goal. In Shore Line, the carrier had argued that the RLA required it to preserve the status quo only in those working conditions explicitly covered by the parties' collective bargaining agreement. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108012\"><a href=\"/opinion/108012/detroit-toledo-shore-line-r-co-v-transportation-union/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 147-48. </a></span>Since the collective bargaining agreement was silent on the challenged practice, the carrier argued that it should be allowed to continue this practice while RLA mediation to modify the agreement was ongoing.

Thus courts have held that a carrier may not hire an independent company to carry out the changes that the unions protest. See e.g., St. Louis S.W. Ry. v. Brotherhood of R.R. Signalmen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397452\"><a href=\"/opinion/397452/st-louis-southwestern-railway-company-v-brotherhood-of-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 995 (10th Cir. 1981) (\"There is nothing which leaves room for a suggestion that the [RLA] can be avoided by employing a contractor to perform the work.\"). In the same vein, the RLA is defeated if a carrier uses a related corporation to alter the status quo. The RLA itself acknowledges the possibility that carriers may attempt to use affiliates to achieve their goals by giving courts jurisdiction over railroads and those non-railroads that are \"directly or indirectly owned or controlled by or under common control with any carrier by railroad....\" 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151. While this provision alone does not justify the issuance of an injunction against a non-railroad corporation, it emphasizes that courts must look beyond corporate formalities if the nominally independent corporation is serving as the alter ego of the carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In several cases, courts have engaged in veil piercing when the carrier used an affiliate to escape its collective bargaining agreement and violate the status quo requirements of the RLA.

The misuse of the corporate form to evade federal regulatory requirements may be easier to prove, as an evidentiary matter, when there is a straightforward parent-subsidiary relationship.

The record must include evidence that the carrier used the related corporation for the purpose of evading the collective bargaining agreement and the status quo requirements of the RLA. In making this determination, no single factor is dispositive. The district court may consider the chronology of events: if the carrier only transferred work to the related corporation after unsuccessful union negotiations, that fact may suggest that the carrier shifted the work in an effort to avoid the RLA status quo provisions. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515490\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Burlington,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/515490/burlington-northern-railroad-company-v-united-transportation-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1274</span> </a></span>(\"Thus Burlington plainly acknowledged that Winona Bridge was Burlington's second choice, an alternative to unsuccessful union negotiations.\"). That inference of evasion may be stronger when the work shifted to the related corporation is distinct from the related corporation's primary line of business. Other factors may also be relevant, such as whether the carrier and the related corporation fail to observe separate corporate formalities, or whether the related corporation is undercapitalized. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515490\"><a href=\"/opinion/515490/burlington-northern-railroad-company-v-united-transportation-union/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1276 </a></span>n.6 (noting that subsidiary had \"no equipment or rail-service employees\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize, however, that the record need not portray the related corporation as a \"sham\" business, expressly created or operated primarily to defeat the RLA.

It would make little sense to ignore current relationships and arrangements between corporations, and thereby grant the railroad immunity from veil piercing, in those cases where the related corporation being used to defeat the RLA was originally formed (or simultaneously used) for a legitimate purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must be remembered that veil piercing in the RLA context serves a different function than it does in the ordinary state law veil piercing cases. In a typical tort or contract case, the primary purpose of the veil-piercing analysis is exposure of the assets of one corporation for payment of the debts or obligations of a related corporation. In the RLA major dispute proceedings, veil piercing operates only to block the related corporation from assisting the carrier in altering the collective bargaining agreement before mediation procedures are exhausted. Indeed, there is no final judgment on the merits against the related corporation: if the RLA mediation procedures do not achieve a negotiated solution, the law will not block the related corporation from engaging in the contested activities.

Not surprisingly, the parties offered divergent views of the circumstantial evidence. Springfield relied on ABR's formal corporate separateness from the railroad, and emphasized the undisputed fact that ABR had been formed prior to the labor dispute and was engaged in a separate, legitimate business (paper products manufacturing). It asked the court to view Springfield's suggestion to ABR that it perform switching as merely a friendly business gesture from one independent corporation to another, designed solely to promote each company's efficiency. The Unions, by contrast, argued that the same evidence showed that Springfield sought out ABR's assistance only to thwart the RLA processes. In support of its interpretation, the Unions emphasized common ownership of Springfield and ABR, the chronology of events, and the fact that the same Springfield managers involved in the failed labor negotiations were instrumental in persuading ABR to perform switching for Lincoln and Champion. In a case submitted for judgment on a stipulated record, the district court resolves disputed issues of material fact. See Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Secretary of the Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455854\"><a href=\"/opinion/455854/the-boston-five-cents-savings-bank-v-secretary-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the appellants (and our dissenting colleague) continue to characterize Springfield's motivation as benign, the district court plainly rejected the claim that ABR was acting as an independent corporation. Rather, the court found that the conduct of Springfield was analogous to that of the carrier in Burlington, a case in which the carrier used a subsidiary alter ego to violate its collective bargaining agreement and the RLA. Noting that it could \"look beyond the surface... to see whether the disputed practice is in reality an attempt to evade the collective bargaining agreement,\" the court concluded that Springfield's arrangement with ABR was an \"attempt[] to change unilaterally the terms\" of its deal with the Unions. The court pointed to both the \"close family relationship\" among the corporations and the fact that the transfer of switching came only after Springfield's \"failed attempt to negotiate more favorable terms for the work that ABR is now doing on a nonunion basis.\" The court drew a distinction between Springfield assisting ABR in taking over its own switching -- a fairly common industry practice -- and Springfield's suggestion that ABR should travel to other Springfield customers and perform the switching work that the Unions had refused to do for lower pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the evidence supporting the district court's finding that Springfield used ABR to circumvent its collective bargaining agreement with the Unions was circumstantial, there was, contrary to the insistence of the dissent, sufficient evidence to support that conclusion. First, the district court properly noted that the overlap in ownership between Springfield and ABR was almost total. Three of the four individuals who owned Springfield (through the Guilford holding company) were the sole owners of ABR. At the time the dispute arose, the three corporations (Guilford, Springfield and ABR) had the same four directors: specifically, the three owners of ABR, plus Richard Kelso.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the \"close family relationship\" between ABR and Springfield is not dispositive of the veil-piercing inquiry, the district court also properly relied upon a chronology of events which supports an inference that Springfield was using ABR to violate its collective bargaining agreement and defeat the RLA status quo requirements. Notably, Springfield only invited ABR to start performing switching for its customers after Springfield was unable to convince the Unions to accept wage concessions. Also, the Springfield vice-president who approached ABR, Sydney Culliford, was described by one union leader as the key player in the failed labor negotiations. Likewise, the ABR executive who decided that the wood products shop should start switching for Springfield customers was David Armstrong Fink, who in addition to being President of ABR was also an owner of Guilford and director of Springfield (and several months later, Springfield's executive vice-president). It was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the work was shifted to ABR after the first round of failed negotiations as a way of pressuring the Unions to accept wage concessions, and circumventing the RLA strictures that bar these unilateral changes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent argues that this reading of the evidence must be rejected because ABR only performed switching for Springfield customers Lincoln and Champion after they had already (and independently) decided to stop using Springfield for switching. However, the only evidence that Lincoln and Champion had chosen to end their switching agreement with Springfield before ABR was presented as an alternative comes from assertions by Springfield managers and officers. The district court did not credit this version of events in its opinion, and nothing compelled it to do so. Springfield and ABR officials participated together in discussions with Lincoln and Champion over who should perform the switching. ABR President David Fink (an owner of Springfield through Guilford) stated at his deposition that he and Springfield's Culliford met together with Lincoln managers to discuss how ABR could fulfill switching needs previously performed by the Unions. Other evidence indicates that even after ABR took over the day-to-day switching work, Lincoln saw ABR as simply the non-union switching arm of Springfield. On one occasion when Lincoln needed to change its switching schedule, it wrote a letter to Springfield, not ABR, informing it of its needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even after Springfield directed<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> switching work to ABR, and even after this litigation was filed, it continued to seek wage concessions on switching from the Unions. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515490\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Burlington,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/515490/burlington-northern-railroad-company-v-united-transportation-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1276</span> </a></span>n.6 (\"If [carrier] and [subsidiary] were truly distinct entities, further negotiation would have been moot\" following the decision to transfer work to the subsidiary.). One union leader, Michael Twombley, claims that Culliford- the Springfield Vice-President who had suggested that ABR take over switching work to begin with-approached him and asked the Unions to make a reasonable offer so that Springfield could perform switching for International Paper mill plants. A second union leader, Michael Maloof, was told by Springfield's labor relations head, Roland Dinsdale, that Springfield wanted union concessions so that it could win switching business from the independent contractor, Rail Link.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that Springfield was still actively looking for switching work, it is difficult to fathom why Springfield would want to assist ABR if the latter were truly independent. Union negotiator Maloof asked this very question when Dinsdale told the Unions to accept wage concessions so that Springfield could compete against switching bids being made by various independent contractors. According to Maloof, Dinsdale told him that Springfield was concerned with independent contractor bids, but not with ABR, because Springfield controlled ABR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken together, this evidence amply supports the conclusions that ABR was not acting as an independent company in providing switching services, that Springfield was attempting to convert two of ABR's thirty-four employees into its non-union switching arm, and that Springfield was using ABR as a lever against the Unions, pressuring them to accept lower pay by changing the status quo in the middle of negotiations. Given that a central purpose of the RLA is to block such tactics, see Shore <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108012\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Line,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/108012/detroit-toledo-shore-line-r-co-v-transportation-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, the district court did not err in enjoining ABR from switching Springfield consignees while Springfield and the Unions completed the RLA mediation procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the claims of improper veil piercing, the appellants raise several miscellaneous objections to the district court's major dispute determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The mere \"prospect of having work shifted to a replacement subsidiary would constitute a change in the working conditions and practices\" sufficient to trigger a major dispute.

In fact, even the loss of completely \"new business,\" never performed by the unions, may be considered a change in the working conditions if the unions traditionally performed work of this type. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515490\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Burlington,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/515490/burlington-northern-railroad-company-v-united-transportation-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span>. Here, the Unions have shown far more than the prospective loss of new switching business. The exact switching work previously performed by Union workers is now being performed by non-union ABR employees. Moreover, because the Unions no longer perform this switching, some members have had to report to different locations at different times than they otherwise would have, a manifest change in \"working conditions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Implicit Term</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants claim that the district court erred in rejecting its argument that the collective bargaining agreement \"implicitly\" allowed the arrangement between Springfield and ABR. If a carrier presents evidence that the challenged labor practice has been knowingly acquiesced in by the union, the challenged practice is treated as an implicit term of the collective bargaining agreement and any dispute over the meaning of that term is minor. See Maine Central R.R. Co. v. United Transp. Union, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468106\"><a href=\"/opinion/468106/maine-central-railroad-company-portland-terminal-company-and-guilford/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 782 (1st Cir. 1986). To take advantage of the minor dispute provision, the carrier need only show that the implicit contractual term defense is not \"totally implausible.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468106\"><a href=\"/opinion/468106/maine-central-railroad-company-portland-terminal-company-and-guilford/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 783.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that the Unions had previously acquiesced to Springfield allowing several of its freight customers to perform their own switching. The dissent too makes much of this point, noting that even before ABR started switching for Lincoln and Champion, Springfield had assisted several mill customers (including ABR) in taking over their own switching. The district court, however, ruled that Union acquiescence in those instances was totally inapposite:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The companies have pointed only to past practices where Springfield Terminal has helped its customers take over their own switching work. The unions, however, no longer quarrel with ABR doing its own switching. Instead, the unions complain because Springfield Terminal, they say, is essentially assisting ABR to act as a railroad in doing nonunion switching work for customers, specifically Terminal's customers, who would otherwise be using Springfield Terminal's union crews. There is not even arguably any such past practice. I agree with the unions that any purported reliance on past practices to justify this new arrangement is, therefore, obviously insubstantial; this is not a minor dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record amply supports the district court's past practice findings.

However, the district court plainly determined that Springfield had directed the business to ABR, finding that \"Springfield Terminal's claim that it is not attempting to change unilaterally the terms of the collective bargaining agreement is totally implausible.\" As discussed above, the record supports a finding that Springfield transferred some of its switching to ABR.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  The appellants also claim that any changes in pay, rules or working conditions were caused by ABR, and that Springfield cannot be held responsible for ABR's activities. As we stated above, the district court properly concluded that Springfield was using ABR to modify its collective bargaining agreement and defeat the status quo provisions of the RLA. Springfield, therefore, is responsible for changes in pay, rules and working conditions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  Springfield also points out that on the one occasion it used non-union employees to perform switching work, one union ignored it and the other treated it as only a minor dispute. This argument does nothing to prove union acquiescence to an arrangement like that between Springfield and ABR. From the record, it appears that the case Springfield points to involved which employees (engineers or \"carmen\") were allowed to perform the switching on one specific track, not whether a party related to Springfield could essentially act as the carrier's non-union switching arm.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe the majority misreads the record and misapprehends the federal law on piercing the corporate veil. Consequently, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the lower court properly pierced Springfield's corporate veil to enjoin ABR from doing switching work previously performed by Springfield. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's determination that ABR is subject to the RLA depends necessarily on its affirming the district court's holding that \"the close family relationship\" between ABR and Springfield, Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs v. Springfield Terminal Ry., Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 9 (D. Me. Feb. 5, 1999), justifies the conclusion that Springfield unilaterally brought about a change in working conditions in violation of the collective bargaining agreement by \"direct[ing]\" the Lincoln and Champion switching work to ABR. See ante at 26. The majority acknowledges, as do the Unions, that without finding ABR to be an alter ego -- for which there is no record evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> -- or a piercing of the corporate veil, it could not hold ABR liable under the RLA. In my view, the district court's conclusion is not sustainable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before proceeding to discuss the issues before us, I must contend with how the majority couches its factual recitation. The majority states its intention to \"begin by sketching the facts of this labor dispute, reserving for later a more detailed discussion of the district court's findings.\" Ante at 2. What follows, however, intermixes predicate facts in the evidence with the actual findings the district court made. To an uninformed reader, this intermixing of facts and the district court's findings might well be quite confusing. The effect is to bolster the majority's ultimate conclusion, which is not sustainable based solely on the district court's findings, with bits and pieces of evidence from the record. I believe this approach is unfortunate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority suggests that ABR made each decision relating to switching solely to satisfy Springfield's goals. Neither the district court's findings nor the record supports such a contention. In early 1998, because its operations were growing, ABR decided it needed to provide additional trackage for the storing, loading, unloading, and switching of railroad cars over the two sidetracks that it owned and over which it had exclusive use. To satisfy its operational needs, it negotiated with its line-hauling carrier, Springfield, a standard joint use agreement, which is a contract by which a company obtains the use of a railroad's tracks for its own operations. Under this agreement, ABR to complement its own two tracks obtained the right to use four contiguous tracks owned and controlled by Springfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from the record that ABR received no special treatment from Springfield because this agreement was identical to joint use agreements the railroad previously had negotiated with other customers. Long before ABR negotiated its agreement, Springfield had entered into similar joint use agreements with S.D. Warren of Westbrook, Maine in August 1992; Specialty Minerals, Inc. of Adams, Massachusetts in October 1996; and Turners Island LLC of South Portland, Maine in October 1997. In addition, Springfield had assisted several companies without joint use agreements -- Merrill's Terminal of Portland, Maine in 1990; Hampshire Chemical of Nashua, New Hampshire in 1995; and Fort James of Old Town, Maine in 1996 -- in taking over their own switching. Like ABR, each company is a freight customer of Springfield's, each had ceased using Springfield for intraplant switching, and each had begun to perform its own switching. Moreover, in each of these instances, the shipper made the decision to do its own switching, and Springfield trained employees of each company in the operation of the trackmobile, a device used to move rail cars between tracks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1998, ABR, motivated by a desire to increase its flexibility and efficiency in switching, decided to do its own intraplant switching.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> The district court foundthat to accomplish its goals, ABR leased from Maine Central Railway a trackmobile, and two of ABR's employees received training in its operation from two Springfield employees. See Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng'rs, Civil No. 98-284-P-H, slip op. at 4. The record is clear that this assistance was neither unusual nor improper because it followed Springfield's normal practice when current line-haul customers elected to do their own switching. From Springfield's point of view, this assistance had a legitimate business purpose because the more efficient a customer became at switching, the more line-haul business that customer could give to Springfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the time that ABR decided to do its own switching, Lincoln and Champion complained that Springfield was unable to meet their scheduling needs for switching. Lincoln and Champion discussed with Springfield their intention to perform their own switching. The majority contends that Springfield \"directed\" or \"transferred\" switching work to ABR. Ante at 26 &amp; n.8. Respectfully, I think this assertion misstates the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> It was only after Lincoln and Champion had decided to leave Springfield<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> that Sydney Culliford, Vice President of Transportation for Springfield, suggested to David Armstrong Fink that if ABR were not using its trackmobile to full capacity, it could maximize its use by also performing switching services for other industries that wished to do their own switching. Because Lincoln and Champion already had decided that Springfield could not meet their switching needs when they began to use ABR, it is illogical to suggest that Springfield \"directed\" or \"transferred\" this business to ABR. After all, a company cannot transfer business it does not have.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Unions and the majority make much of Culliford's suggestion. This suggestion, however, is unremarkable because it does not indicate that either Springfield or ABR were using the corporate form as a ruse. The record is devoid of evidence to indicate that Culliford acted at the instruction of any of the owners of Guilford or ABR when he made his suggestion to ABR management. Culliford is neither an owner nor a director of Guilford, Springfield, or ABR. More importantly, his suggestion made legitimate business sense for both companies because ABR could maximize its use of switching capabilities otherwise underutilized, and Springfield could ensure an expansion of its line-hauling business. A helpful suggestion from one company to another does not create an alter ego relationship or provide a basis for piercing the corporate veil.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's assertion that the railroad's attempt to renegotiate is further proof of collusion misses the mark. Rather, Springfield's continued attempts to renegotiate its union contract indicate that the railroad desired to save its switching business if it could, but recognized the need to decrease its costs to be competitive. A more realistic view than that advanced by the majority is that if Springfield and ABR truly were colluding, once Springfield \"transferred\" its switching work to what the majority says is its alter ego, ABR, it would have given up on trying to renegotiate the Union contract because its goals already would have been realized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also misconstrues the applicable legal standards. After explaining that federal law controls whether to disregard the corporate form, the majority misreads and overstates that law. The majority contends that federal common law allows courts in cases involving federal statutes to fashion new, statute-specific rules for disregarding the corporate form. I do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the majority is correct that in ERISA cases, we have crafted \"a 'less rigorous' veil-piercing standard,\" ante at 13, we have not crafted one that is standardless. Contrary to the majority, which contends that veil piercing typically is appropriate to effectuate legislation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> this court always has engaged in a more searching inquiry.

It began its operations not after, or as a result of, the railroad's failed negotiations with the Unions, but in 1994, which was two years before the labor contract even began. It began switching to satisfy its own production needs. It shares with Springfield neither books, funds, nor offices. It shares with Springfield no corporate officers and with the exception of David Armstrong Fink, who is the president of ABR and a vice-president of Springfield, no common employees. Indeed, all it does share with Springfield is some ownership congruence, but the record is silent on the degree of that overlap because it fails to indicate what percentages of each company the Finks and Mellon own.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority buttresses its decision to pierce the corporate veil with cases that are inapplicable to the facts before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> To justify disregarding the corporate form in a case with mere ownership overlap, the majority relies entirely on cases that involve wholly owned subsidiaries.

ABR is not a subsidiary of Springfield or Guilford, and the companies are not managed by the same personnel.

The majority's resolution of the major-minor issue will have little or no impact on the Unions because no Union jobs have been lost as a result of shippers doing their own switching; rather, Springfield in fact has provided more Union jobs since losing some of its switching business.

While it is true that only David Armstrong Fink and Culliford testified that Lincoln and Champion already had decided to cease the use of Springfield for switching, the Unions neither attempted to discredit them in cross-examination nor presented evidence to the contrary.

These cases, however, lend no assistance. In In re Bowen, the court stated that it did \"not believe that the equitable doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is limited to the parent-subsidiary <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343627\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">relationship.\"</span> <a href=\"/opinion/343627/in-the-matter-of-bowen-transports-inc-an-illinois-corporation-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>; accord C.M. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382362\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/382362/c-m-corporation-continental-manors-inc-and-commercial-management-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>. The In re Bowen court then noted that \"[t]he separate corporateness of affiliated corporations owned by the same parent may be equally disregarded under the proper <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343627\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">circumstances.\"</span> <a href=\"/opinion/343627/in-the-matter-of-bowen-transports-inc-an-illinois-corporation-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">179</span> </a></span>(emphasis supplied); accord C.M. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382362\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/382362/c-m-corporation-continental-manors-inc-and-commercial-management-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>. These cases refer not to the circumstance presented -- that is, companies with mere ownership congruence -- but to one in which a parent corporation owns many affiliated corporations. Moreover, both cases make it very clear that overlap in ownership alone is insufficient to pierce the corporate veil. See C.M. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382362\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Corp.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/382362/c-m-corporation-continental-manors-inc-and-commercial-management-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">539</span> </a></span>(noting that stock control and common officers and directors \"are not sufficient by themselves to invoke the doctrine\" because they \"exist in most parent and subsidiary relationships\" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); In re <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343627\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bowen,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/343627/in-the-matter-of-bowen-transports-inc-an-illinois-corporation-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">179</span> </a></span>(\"[A]lthough stock control and common directors and officers are generally prerequisites for application of the doctrine permitting the corporate veil to be pierced, that is not by itself sufficient to bring the doctrine into operation.\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
