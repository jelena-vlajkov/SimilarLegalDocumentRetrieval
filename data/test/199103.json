Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Alfredo Ugarte-Castro on brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E.

Appellant Ugarte-Castro appeals a\n\ndenial of his motion for a second resentencing under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).      Appellant now seeks a reduction in his\n\nterm of imprisonment under the \"safety valve\" provision.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).         He says that in 1996, when a\n\nlowering of his guidelines' sentencing range eventuated in\n\nhis being resentenced to a 188-month term of imprisonment,\n\nhis attorneys \"should have also moved for a reduction in his\n\nsentence under the safety valve provision.\"        The district\n\ncourt denied the current motion on the merits of the safety\n\nvalve factors.\n\n            The district court correctly denied the motion,\n\nalthough it need not have reached the merits.          The court\n\nlacked authority under § 3582(c)(2) to modify the previously\n\nimposed sentence.    Appellant did not appeal from the 1996\n\nresentencing judgment.      His current motion is not based on\n\na \"subsequently\" lowered guidelines range, nor on any of the\n\nother   \"limited   circumstances\"    which   trigger   a   court's\n\nauthority, under § 3582(c), to modify a previously imposed\n\nsentence.    United States v. Jordan, 162 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1105 (1999).\n\n            As the government points out, a district court is\n\nvested with the authority to entertain motions to correct a\n\fsentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.           However, we do not\n\nconstrue this motion as one brought under § 2255, since it\n\nappears   to   have   been   filed    well   beyond   the     statute's\n\nlimitations    period,   appellant     insists   that    it    was   not\n\nintended as a § 2255 petition, and neither the court nor the\n\nparties addressed the complexities of § 2255 below.\n\n           For these reasons, we also need not reach the\n\nparties' arguments about the temporal applicability of the\n\nsafety    valve   provision     to     appellant's      sentence      or\n\nresentence.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
