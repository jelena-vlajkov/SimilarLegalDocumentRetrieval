While reserving the right\n\nto appeal the district court ruling rejecting his pretrial\n\nmotion to suppress the fruits of a warrantless arrest, see Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(a)(2), appellant Ola Bashorun entered conditional\n\nguilty pleas to various criminal charges stemming from his\n\nparticipation in a drug-distribution conspiracy.                   We now affirm\n\nthe district court ruling.\n\n                                         I\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n             On November 7, 1997, United States Customs authorities\n\nintercepted an Express Mail package containing concealed heroin\n\nen   route   from     Thailand   and    addressed      to   one   “Keisha     (sic)\n\nBarrows” at 1019 Beacon Street, Apartment 43, in Brookline,\n\nMassachusetts.        Customs    agents      promptly       contacted     Timothy\n\nLeighton, the landlord at 1019 Beacon Street, and learned that\n\na man named Tony Johnson — identified following his arrest as\n\nBashorun — had rented Apartment 43 continuously since January\n\n1997.   Leighton described Tony Johnson as a black man in his\n\nthirties, with an accent, who drove a late model car and wore\n\nexpensive jewelry, but had no apparent means of employment.\n\nLeighton     stated    that   Tony     Johnson   had    introduced      him   to    a\n\nfriend, also named “Tony,” who lived in Cambridge [hereinafter:\n\n“Tony   from   Cambridge,”       identified      following        his   arrest     as\n\n\n                                         3\n\fBashorun’s codefendant Anthony Junaid], whom Leighton likewise\n\ndescribed as a black man, with an accent, who wore expensive\n\njewelry.\n\n             When Tony Johnson left Apartment 43 in September 1997,\n\nLeighton allowed Johnson’s girlfriend, Keesha Barrows, to move\n\nin    for   two       weeks,    followed    by     Felicia    Brown   (“Tony   from\n\nCambridge”’s          girlfriend)    and    her     mother.      Throughout    this\n\nperiod, Tony Johnson remained the only tenant of record and his\n\nname continued to appear on the doorbell directory to Apartment\n\n43.    The apartment telephone number, however, had been listed\n\nunder such names as “Gubril Abediran” and “Tashema Beard,” but\n\nnever in Tony Johnson’s name.                   In addition, telephone company\n\nrecords revealed that one Desmond Bartley, under investigation\n\nby the United States Drug Enforcement Agency in Baltimore for\n\nhaving received packages of heroin from a “Tony Johnson,” had\n\nplaced ten telephone calls to Apartment 43 during February and\n\nMarch, 1997.\n\nA.    The Events of November 11\n\n             While the package addressed to “Keisha (sic) Barrows”\n\nremained with customs authorities, it had been fitted with an\n\nelectronic monitoring device before being delivered to Apartment\n\n43 on November 11, 1997.            As U.S. Postal Inspector Nicole Gray,\n\nposing      as    a    postal    carrier,       entered   1019   Beacon   Street,\n\n\n                                            4\n\fundercover agents were maintaining surveillance from both inside\n\nand outside the building.          These agents observed that Inspector\n\nGray was being followed by a black male who kept looking at the\n\npackage Inspector Gray was carrying.\n\n            The landlord met the black male and promptly alerted\n\nthe surveillance agents that he recognized him as Tony Johnson’s\n\nfriend, “Tony from Cambridge.”                This information was radioed to\n\nagents outside the apartment building, who then observed the\n\nblack   male    (i.e.,    “Tony    from       Cambridge”)   as    he   exited    the\n\napartment building and entered a blue Dodge Caravan parked\n\nimmediately in front of the apartment building.\n\n            While “Tony from Cambridge” was still inside 1019\n\nBeacon Street, customs agents stationed outside the building,\n\nincluding      Agents    McGrath   and        Donald    Lenzie,   observed      that\n\nanother black male, with a moustache, was using a pay phone on\n\nthe opposite side of Beacon Street.                    At about the same time,\n\nLeighton received a phone call from Tony Johnson, who said he\n\nwould be dropping by the apartment later to pay the rent.\n\nSurveillance agents watched the caller hang up the payphone,\n\ncross Beacon Street, and enter the blue Dodge Caravan on the\n\npassenger side.\n\n            The   blue     Dodge    Caravan,       tailed    by    agents,      then\n\nproceeded      behind    the   Brookline        post    office    building   where\n\n\n                                          5\n\fInspector Gray had driven the postal truck after unsuccessfully\n\nattempting to make the controlled delivery of the “Keisha (sic)\n\nBarrows” package at 1019 Beacon Street.      Massachusetts Bay\n\nTransportation Authority Detective Peter Pasciucco continued to\n\ntail the blue Caravan for an hour after it left the post office,\n\nand at one point observed that one of the two black males was\n\nusing a cellular phone.\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\f          Meantime, back at 1019 Beacon Street, Leighton made and\n\nreceived a series of telephone calls.           Fifteen minutes after the\n\nblue Caravan left 1019 Beacon Street, “Tony from Cambridge”\n\ncalled to learn the identities of the people who had been in the\n\nlobby   earlier      (viz.,    the    undercover    surveillance    agents).\n\nLeighton told him they were electricians.\n\n          More than two hours later, at the direction of law\n\nenforcement agents, Leighton called Tony Johnson’s cellular\n\nphone and “Tony from Cambridge” answered.               When Leighton told\n\nhim about the attempt to deliver the package to Apartment 43\n\nearlier that morning, “Tony from Cambridge” repeatedly asked\n\nLeighton to sign for the package the next time a delivery was\n\nattempted, and advised Leighton that Tony Johnson would pick it\n\nup later from Leighton.          At this point, “Tony from Cambridge”\n\nvolunteered    the    information      that   Keesha   Barrows     owed   Tony\n\nJohnson money and that the package probably was a birthday gift\n\nto Barrows.    Leighton again refused to sign for the package.\n\n          Within      the     next   half   hour,   Leighton   received    two\n\ntelephone calls from Tony Johnson, requesting that he sign for\n\nthe package and parroting “Tony from Cambridge”’s earlier phone\n\nconversation with Leighton by stating that Keesha Barrows owed\n\nTony Johnson money and that the package must be a birthday gift\n\nfor Barrows.      Leighton again refused to sign for the package\n\n\n                                        7\n\faddressed to Barrows.\n\n\n\n\n                        8\n\fB.   The Events of November 12\n\n            At 8:45 the following morning, agents spotted the same\n\nblue Caravan parked near 1019 Beacon Street, and later near the\n\nBrookline post office.        At about the same time, the post office\n\nreceived    two   anonymous    telephone   calls   inquiring   about   the\n\npackage addressed to Barrows.           When the blue Caravan left the\n\npost office, the agents tailing it observed what appeared to be\n\nevasive maneuvers, such as U-turns and driving against traffic\n\non one-way streets.\n\n            Shortly, Inspector Gray left the post office and drove\n\nto 1019 Beacon Street in an effort to attempt another controlled\n\ndelivery.    At the time, Detective Pasciucco was parked on Park\n\nDrive, around the corner from, though not in direct line of\n\nsight of, 1019 Beacon Street.        At this point Pasciucco observed\n\nthe blue Caravan as it turned onto Park Drive, passed his\n\nvehicle, and turned onto Beacon Street heading toward No. 1019.\n\nPasciucco identified the occupants as the same two men whom he\n\nhad seen in the blue Caravan the previous morning.              When the\n\nblue Caravan parked across the street from 1019 Beacon, Agent\n\nLenzie identified its two occupants as the same two black men he\n\nhad seen in the blue Caravan on November 11.\n\n            A short time later, Keesha Barrows arrived and parked\n\nher vehicle behind the postal delivery truck.         As Inspector Gray\n\n\n                                    9\n\fleft the apartment building with the undelivered package, Keesha\n\nBarrows approached her, signed for the package, then placed it\n\nin her vehicle.   The blue Caravan made a U-turn and pulled up\n\nbehind the Barrows vehicle.     At that point, Bashorun (aka “Tony\n\nJohnson”),   Junaid   (aka   “Tony   from   Cambridge”),   and   Keesha\n\nBarrows were arrested pursuant to Agent McGrath’s instruction.\n\n          A subsequent search of the blue Caravan, conducted\n\nincident to the warrantless arrests, disclosed several pieces of\n\ninculpatory evidence, including a cellular phone, documents\n\nreflecting the telephone numbers of Keesha Barrows and the\n\nBrookline post office, as well as the Express Mail tracking\n\nnumber for the package containing the contraband heroin.\n\n          In due course, Bashorun and Junaid were indicted for\n\nconspiring to possess heroin, with intent to distribute, see 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846; possessing heroin, with intent to distribute, see\n\nid. § 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2; five counts of utilizing a\n\ntelephone to facilitate a drug offense, see 21 U.S.C. § 843(b);\n\nand one count of immigration fraud, see 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a).\n\n          Thereafter, Bashorun moved to suppress all evidence\n\nseized incident to his warrantless arrest, on the ground that\n\n“law enforcement officers did not have probable cause to arrest\n\n[him.]”   Following a six-day evidentiary hearing, during which\n\nseveral law enforcement agents testified, the district court\n\n\n                                 10\n\fdenied the motion to suppress.\n\n           Subsequently, Bashorun arrived at a plea agreement with\n\nthe government and entered a conditional guilty plea, pursuant\n\nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), reserving the\n\nright to appeal the district court order denying the motion to\n\nsuppress the evidence seized pursuant to his warrantless arrest.\n\n                                  II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n           Bashorun now contends that his warrantless arrest was\n\ninvalid because the record unequivocally demonstrates that Agent\n\nMcGrath,   who    ordered   the   arrest,    lacked   contemporaneous\n\nknowledge of the critical fact that would have established\n\nprobable cause to arrest the passenger in the blue Caravan on\n\nNovember 12:     namely, that the same two persons were in the blue\n\nCaravan on both November 11 and 12.         Instead, Bashorun argues,\n\nthe record reveals that the only officer arguably in a position\n\nto make such an identification – Detective Pasciucco – did not\n\ncommunicate that information to Agent McGrath prior to the\n\narrest.\n\n           Accordingly, Bashorun       maintains that the evidence\n\nshowed, at most, that he was “merely present” —           i.e., a s a\n\npassenger — in the blue Caravan on November 12.            Since the\n\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\fpresent claim was never presented to the district court,1 we will\n\nnot entertain it on appeal.      See United States v. Torres, 162\n\nF.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1057 (1999);\n\nUnited States v. Nuñez, 19 F.3d 719, 721-23 (1st Cir. 1994); see\n\nalso United States v. Meraz-Peru, 24 F.3d 1197, 1198 (10th Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n           As Bashorun points out, the precise contours of the\n\nfellow-officer rule have never been limned by this court:         for\n\nexample, as to whether the “directing” officer (viz., Agent\n\nMcGrath)   personally    need   have   known   —   through   personal\n\nobservation or verifiable information communicated by fellow\n\nofficers — all facts necessary to demonstrate probable cause, or\n\nwhether the cumulative knowledge of all participating officers\n\nmay be considered.      See United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190,\n\n\n\n\n     1Instead, in a January 8, 1998, memorandum of law supporting\nthe motion to suppress, Bashorun simply set forth the so-called\n“fellow-officer” rule, which merely requires that the district\ncourt “determine whether ‘at the moment the arrest was made’ the\n‘facts and circumstances within [the officers’] knowledge and of\nwhich   they   had  reasonably   trustworthy   information   were\nsufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that [the\nsuspect] had committed or was committing an offense.’”\n(Emphasis added.)      Thus, in the district court Bashorun\nessentially contended simply that none of the officers involved\nin his arrest possessed sufficient evidence to establish\nprobable cause. At no point did he contend that Agent McGrath\n— qua “directing” law enforcement officer — lacked the requisite\ninformation to support the probable cause assessment.\n\n                                 12\n\f194 (1st Cir. 1997).2        Bashorun nonetheless urges that we now\n\nreach out for the controversial question bypassed in Meade and\n\nadopt the rule that the prosecution must establish that the\n\nsupervising officer possessed all the requisite probable-cause\n\ndata, rather than simply presume that subordinate officers would\n\nhave       communicated   their   collective   knowledge   to   their\n\n\n       2Meade states in dicta:\n\n                   The fellow officer rule underlies the\n              well-worn   maxim    that  \"the    collective\n              knowledge   and   information   of   all  the\n              officers involved establishes probable cause\n              for the arrest.\" The \"collective knowledge\"\n              or \"pooled knowledge\" principle has been\n              used to validate arrests in two ways: (1) by\n              tracing the arresting officer's action back\n              to an individual in a law enforcement agency\n              who possessed information sufficient to\n              establish probable cause, and (2) by finding\n              that the directing agency as a whole\n              possessed the necessary facts.\n                   A sensible argument has been made that\n              looking to the agency's knowledge as a whole\n              is unwise because it may \"encourage the\n              dissemination of arrest orders based upon\n              nothing more than the hope that the\n              unevaluated bits and pieces in the hands of\n              several different officers may turn out to\n              add up to probable cause.\"       In the same\n              vein, the collective-knowledge corollary of\n              the fellow officer rule would seem to\n              require, or at least presuppose, the flow of\n              information from the officers with knowledge\n              of facts tending to establish probable cause\n              to those lacking that knowledge (or, at\n              least,   to  the   directing  or    arresting\n              officer).\n\nMeade, 110 F.3d at 194.\n\n                                   13\n\fsupervisor.\n\n            The legal theories Bashorun advances on appeal were\n\nnever raised in the district court, where he neither cited Meade\n\nnor the controversy it identified, instead simply asserting that\n\nthe “officers” involved did not have probable cause for the\n\narrest.    Now, however, he attempts to rely upon the altogether\n\ndifferent theory that even assuming the subordinate officers\n\npossessed the requisite information to establish probable cause,\n\nit   was   never    communicated    to     Agent    McGrath,      who   made    the\n\nprobable-cause assessment.\n\n            Given these lapses and the consequent absence of a\n\nsufficiently       developed   evidentiary         record,      the   Meade-based\n\nclaims asserted on appeal are deemed waived.                 See Nuñez, 19 F.3d\n\nat   722   (holding,    pursuant    to     Fed.    R.   Crim.    P    12(f),   that\n\nlitigant waives issue not raised in pretrial motion to suppress,\n\nexcept for “cause” shown); see also United States v. Collazo-\n\nAponte, 216 F.3d 163, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-1808, 2000 WL\n\n801271, at *15 (1st Cir. June 27, 2000)]; Torres, 162 F.3d at 11\n\n(\"A litigant [seeking to suppress evidence] cannot jump from\n\ntheory to theory like a bee buzzing from flower to flower.”).\n\n            Bashorun    offers     various    rejoinders         to   the   waiver\n\nsuggestion.    First, he asserts that “the issue of which person\n\nhad knowledge of the facts constituting probable cause was\n\n\n                                      14\n\falways     before   the   district    court,”     citing   the   following\n\nstatement by the Assistant United States Attorney:\n\n            We started this [suppression hearing] with\n            the notion that we were going to ask this\n            witness [Agent McGrath], who made the arrest\n            decision, what he knew.    And we were very\n            focused that what he knew was the focus of\n            this hearing. . . . The only issue, [] it\n            seems to me, is what this witness [Agent\n            McGrath] knew and the cross-examination of\n            that witness. . . . What the defense wants\n            to do now is find out every witness who ever\n            made an observation, apparently whether or\n            not it was communicated to McGrath.\n\nThe quoted excerpt is unavailing, however, for two principal\n\nreasons.\n\n            First, we enforce Rule 12(f) waivers even though the\n\ndistrict court ultimately did address the waived issue on the\n\nmerits, unless the appellant can show “cause” for failing to\n\nraise it in a pretrial motion.            See Nuñez, 19 F.3d at 722.\n\nBashorun has attempted no such showing.\n\n            Second, Bashorun wrenches the prosecutor’s remarks from\n\ntheir context.       During the McGrath cross-examination at the\n\nsuppression hearing, defense counsel represented to the district\n\ncourt:     “[T]his witness knows some things that some people have\n\ntold him but doesn’t know a lot about what those people, in\n\nfact, saw.”     Further, defense counsel suggested that other law\n\nenforcement    officers,    such     as   Agent   Lenzie   and   Detective\n\nPasciucco, should be called as witnesses so that “the Court can\n\n                                     15\n\fadequately assess the reliability of the tremendous amount of\n\nhearsay evidence that [Agent McGrath] has provided.”\n\n               Over the government’s objection, the district court\n\nagreed,    explaining     that    if   one    of   Agent    McGrath’s   fellow\n\nofficers were to offer testimony — concerning his observations\n\non November 11 or 12 — which was not consistent with Agent\n\nMcGrath’s testimony as to what that officer had told him, then\n\nMcGrath’s credibility could be called into question.                    Fairly\n\nviewed in context, therefore, the prosecutor’s objection went\n\nsimply    to    the   unanticipated    expansion     of    the   witness   list\n\nbecause “the defense has been trying mightily to discover the\n\nentire case two weeks before trial,” and because the prosecutor\n\nbelieved       that   defense    counsel     had   been    afforded   adequate\n\nopportunity to test Agent McGrath’s credibility through cross-\n\nexamination.\n\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f            Moreover,   at   no   point    in    the   entire   exchange   did\n\ncounsel suggest that the defense was interested in calling\n\nadditional witnesses to determine whether they had communicated\n\ntheir observations to Agent McGrath, but rather to determine\n\nwhat they had observed.        Thus, the defense not only failed to\n\npresent even a subliminal Meade claim, but left entirely open\n\nthe clear impression imparted in its pretrial motion that its\n\nprincipal contention was that none of the individual officers\n\npossessed    sufficient      facts    to   establish      probable    cause.\n\nAccordingly, the ensuing statements by the prosecutor and the\n\ndistrict court fairly cannot be construed as concessions that\n\nprobable cause properly could be established only through the\n\nknowledge possessed by Agent McGrath.\n\n            Next,   Bashorun      points   out    that    he    proposed   the\n\nfollowing findings of fact following the suppression hearing:\n\n                 1. The only two law enforcement agents\n            involved in the investigation on both\n            November 11 and 12, 1997 who had an\n            opportunity to see the occupants of the blue\n            Dodge Caravan before the arrest were Agents\n            Lenzie and Pasciucco. Agent McGrath did not\n            see the occupants of the Caravan until after\n            the arrest on November 12.\n\n                 2. Prior to the arrest, Agent Pasciucco\n            made   no  radio   transmissions   that   the\n            occupants were the same on November 12 as he\n            had observed on November 11.            Agent\n            Pasciucco did not testify that he was aware\n            prior to the arrest of any observations of\n            “evasive” driving by the Caravan on November\n\n                                     17\n\f            12.\n\n                 3. By the time he discontinued his\n            surveillance on November 11, 1997, Agent\n            Lenzie had only observed one of the two\n            occupants of the Dodge Caravan. He did not\n            see the other, if in fact there was another,\n            occupant of the Caravan on November 11.\n            Because he only saw one person in the\n            Caravan on November 11, he was in no\n            position to say that the two occupants of\n            the Caravan were the same on November 11 and\n            12.\n\nConsequently,      Bashorun   argues,     “[t]here   would   have   been   no\n\nreason [to ask] for such findings if all of the information\n\nknown to the surveillance agents could be added together to\n\ndetermine if probable cause to make an arrest existed.”\n\n            Once again we disagree, for the simple reason that the\n\ncredibility of Agent Lenzie and Detective Pasciucco regarding\n\ntheir observations was at least as relevant to the non-Meade\n\ndefense    theory    asserted   in   Bashorun’s      pretrial   motion     to\n\nsuppress.    That is, if Detective Pasciucco did in fact make the\n\nNovember    12    observation   to   which    he   testified,   Bashorun’s\n\npretrial contention that none of the officers involved had\n\nsufficient       facts   to   establish      probable   cause   would      be\n\nundermined.\n\n            Thus, for example, the district court reasonably may\n\nhave construed Proposed Finding 2 — viz., that “[p]rior to the\n\narrest, Agent Pasciucco made no radio transmissions that the\n\n\n                                     18\n\foccupants were the same on November 12 as he had observed on\n\nNovember 11\" — as a challenge to the credibility of Detective\n\nPasciucco’s observation (as contrasted from his communication of\n\nit to McGrath), since it would be reasonable to expect that if\n\nPasciucco truthfully testified that he had made so crucial an\n\nobservation, in all likelihood he would have communicated it to\n\nhis fellow officers.       As Pasciucco did not communicate it,\n\nhowever, Bashorun invited the district court to find that he\n\nnever made the observation at all.\n\n         Importantly, the district court interpreted Proposed\n\nFinding 2 in precisely this fashion, as demonstrated by the fact\n\nthat it made no finding whatsoever as to whether either Agent\n\nLenzie or Detective Pasciucco had communicated their respective\n\nobservations to fellow officers.       See United States v. Bashorun,\n\nNo. 97-CR-10318, at 16-17 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999) (expressly\n\n“credit[ing]”    Agent   Lenzie’s      and   Detective   Pasciucco’s\n\nobservations of November 12 that the same two men were in the\n\nblue Caravan on November 11 and 12, but making no mention or\n\nfinding as to whether they communicated their observations to\n\nfellow officers).\n\n         Quite   clearly    and   understandably,    therefore,   the\n\ndistrict court did not consider the issue of inter-officer\n\ncommunication material to the proffered defense, except as it\n\n\n                                  19\n\fmight pertain to the entirely discrete matter of the credibility\n\nof the testimony provided by Lenzie and Pasciucco regarding\n\ntheir observations.3\n\n            Bashorun nevertheless argues that any waiver must be\n\nexcused since the district court addressed the Meade issue on\n\nthe merits, as reflected in the following statement in its\n\nopinion:\n\n            [E]vidence supporting probable cause can be\n            cumulative: “[L]aw enforcement officials\n            cooperating in an investigation are entitled\n            to rely upon each other’s knowledge of facts\n            when forming the conclusion that a suspect\n            has committed or is committing a crime.”\n            United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193\n            (1st Cir. 1993) . . . .\n\nUnited States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-10318, at 18 (D. Mass. Jan.\n\n5, 1999).     This claim fails as well.\n\n            First, as previously noted, Rule 12(f) waivers are not\n\nexcused simply because the district court may have addressed the\n\nwaived issue on the merits. See Nuñez, 19 F.3d at 722.\n\n            Second,   it   strains   credulity   to   suggest   that   the\n\ndistrict court meant to resolve the controversial Meade issue in\n\na   single,   unelaborated,    prefatory    sentence.      Instead,     as\n\nevidenced by its appearance at the very outset of the district\n\n\n\n     3\n     Moreover, in addition to the initial waiver, Bashorun\nsubmitted proposed conclusions of law following the evidentiary\nhearing, without once mentioning or citing Meade.\n\n                                     20\n\fcourt’s legal analysis, this sentence simply set forth the\n\nprobable      cause     precepts   applicable          where    multiple       law-\n\nenforcement officers are involved in a warrantless search or\n\nseizure.\n\n              Third, at no point did the district court even remotely\n\npurport to acknowledge that the defense intended to litigate any\n\ninter-officer communication claim.           Were it otherwise, we think\n\nit would be reasonable to expect that the district court would\n\nhave quoted the Meade dicta presently touted by Bashorun on\n\nappeal, in which we discussed whether communication of the\n\nknowledge acquired by individual officers may be presumed, or\n\nwhether proof of inter-officer communications is even required\n\nunder   the    “fellow-officer”     rule.        See    supra    note   2.      The\n\ndistrict      court’s    silence   on    these    weighty       matters      speaks\n\nvolumes.\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f            Finally, Bashorun argues that for us to find a Rule\n\n12(f) waiver would breach the promise made in the plea agreement\n\nthat he could appeal the denial of the suppression motion.                As\n\nthis argument rests on the incorrect assumption that “[t]he\n\ndistrict court’s order squarely addresses the issue raised on\n\nappeal[,]” it fails as well.\n\n            When the government entered into the plea agreement\n\nwith Bashorun, it was entitled to assume, as the law plainly\n\nprovides, that only arguments duly presented to the district\n\ncourt would be deemed preserved for appeal.             Although Bashorun\n\ncites case law holding that the government must scrupulously\n\nperform all promises made in its plea agreements, there is no\n\nauthority for the view that it implicitly promises that a Rule\n\n11(a)(2) appellant shall have the legal right to insist that\n\nlegal theories waived below are nevertheless to be considered\n\npreserved for appeal.\n\n            As we have done in the past, we now bypass the issue\n\nas to whether “plain error” review is available, see Nuñez, 19\n\nF.3d   at   723    n.10   (bypassing   question   and   finding   no   plain\n\nerror), and instead accord Bashorun the benefit of that standard\n\nof review.        See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33\n\n(1993)) (requiring that appellant prove that error is “plain” or\n\n“obvious” and affects substantial rights, and that appellate\n\n\n                                       22\n\fcourt   determine,   in   its    discretion,     that   error   ”seriously\n\naffected   the   fairness,      integrity   or   public   reputation    of\n\njudicial proceedings”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\f            We have noted the difficulty confronting defendants\n\n“where   reliable        review     has    been     rendered   impossible     by\n\ninadequate [factual] development at the district court level.”\n\nNuñez, 19 F.3d at 723 n.10.               More to the present point, the\n\ndefense failure to invite the district court’s attention to the\n\ninter-officer communications issue resulted in a virtually total\n\nabsence of essential factual findings relating to the merits.\n\nConsequently, critical factual questions remain both ambiguous\n\nand conflicted.\n\n            For example, Detective Pasciucco ambiguously testified\n\ninitially that he had made no radio communication on November 12\n\nafter observing the blue Caravan on Park Drive.                Later, however,\n\nhe allowed that he could not remember.                 Agent McGrath, on the\n\nother hand, initially testified that Detective Pasciucco had\n\nreported to him that the occupants in the blue Caravan were “the\n\nsame persons as the day before.”               Later, however, Agent McGrath\n\ntestified    that   he    had     received     a   radio   communication    from\n\nsomeone after the blue Caravan pulled up in front of 1019 Beacon\n\nStreet on November 12, advising that the blue Caravan occupants\n\nwere “the two black males that had been in it for two days.”\n\nThe latter communication would have taken place immediately\n\nafter Detective Pasciucco observed the blue Caravan turn from\n\nPark Drive onto Beacon Street.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f            Thus, it cannot be seriously suggested that the present\n\nrecord    makes    it   either   “obvious”      or   “clear”    whether   these\n\npivotal communications took place. Accordingly, Bashorun cannot\n\ndemonstrate plain error under any scenario.                 See Nuñez, 19 F.3d\n\nat 723 n.10       (“‘[E]rror cannot be “clear” or “obvious” unless\n\nthe desired factual finding is the only one supported by the\n\nrecord below.’”) (citation omitted).\n\n            Finally, ample additional grounds preclude any “plain\n\nerror” finding.         See United States v. Diallo, 29 F.3d 23, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (“[P]robable cause should be determined under a\n\n‘totality-of-the-circumstances’ test . . . [and] ‘is a fluid\n\nconcept     –    turning    on   the    assessment     of   probabilities     in\n\nparticular factual contexts.’ . . . ‘The substance of all the\n\ndefinitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief\n\nof guilt.       And this means less than evidence which would justify\n\ncondemnation or conviction.’\") (citations omitted).\n\n            The argument advanced by Bashorun on appeal rests\n\nentirely on the premise that the visual identifications of the\n\npassengers in the blue Caravan on two successive days was the\n\ncritical    evidence       without     which   there   could    have   been   no\n\nprobable cause for their arrests.              As the district court aptly\n\nobserved, however, and the record amply demonstrates, see supra\n\nSection I, Agent McGrath was in possession of a far broader web\n\n\n                                        25\n\fof   inculpatory   evidence    having    little    to     do    with    whether\n\nBashorun (aka “Tony Johnson”) was the passenger in the blue\n\nCaravan on November 11 and 12.            For instance, there was no\n\ndispute that the blue Caravan made highly suspicious movements\n\non both days, traveling from 1019 Beacon Street to the Brookline\n\npost office, then making evasive maneuvers while followed by law\n\nenforcement officers.     See United States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-\n\n10318, at 16-17 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999) (noting “suspicious”\n\nmovements of blue Caravan).       Consequently, the very least that\n\ncan be said is that a finding that the passenger in the blue\n\nCaravan on November 12 was “merely present” most certainly was\n\nnot compelled.     See, e.g., Meade, 110 F.3d at 198-99 (affirming\n\nfinding   of   probable   cause   to    arrest   passenger       in    vehicle,\n\noccupied by attempted-robbery suspects, which made suspicious\n\nmaneuvers;     noting     as   well     that     “these        facts     reveal\n\n‘substantially more than a momentary, random, or apparently\n\ninnocent association’”); United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64\n\nF.3d 719, 729 (1st Cir. 1995) (affirming finding of probable\n\ncause to arrest defendants who were members of large group\n\nselling drugs in park).4\n\n\n      4\n     The district court identified several other factors\nmaterial to the common-sense probable cause determination: (1)\nLeighton positively identified “Tony from Cambridge” as the man\nwho tried to receive the package on November 11, and drove the\nblue Caravan that day; (2) Tony Johnson, the apartment lessee,\n\n                                   26\n\f         Accordingly, it simply cannot be seriously suggested\n\nthat the probable-cause calculus indulged by the district court\n\nconstituted plain error.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nhad introduced “Tony from Cambridge” as his friend; and (3) both\n“Tony from Cambridge” and Tony Johnson spoke with Leighton by\nphone on November 11.       As their conversations turned on\nuncannily similar and unorthodox themes (    e.g., Barrows owed\nJohnson money, and the package was a birthday gift for Barrows)\nthat it would have been entirely reasonable to infer that the\ntwo Tonys, i.e., the two occupants of the blue Caravan, were in\nclose consultation.\n\n                              27\n\f",

Customs agents promptly contacted Timothy Leighton, the landlord at 1019 Beacon Street, and learned that a man named Tony Johnson -- identified following his arrest as Bashorun -- had rented Apartment 43 continuously since January 1997.  Leighton described Tony Johnson as a black man in his thirties, with an accent, who drove a late model car and wore expensive jewelry, but had no apparent means of employment.  Leighton stated that Tony Johnson had introduced him to a friend, also named \"Tony,\" who lived in Cambridge [hereinafter: \"Tony from Cambridge,\" identified following his arrest as Bashorun's codefendant Anthony Junaid], whom Leighton likewise described as a black man, with an accent, who wore expensive jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Tony Johnson left Apartment 43 in September 1997, Leighton allowed Johnson's girlfriend, Keesha Barrows, to move in for two weeks, followed by Felicia Brown (\"Tony from Cambridge\"'s girlfriend) and her mother.  Throughout this period, Tony Johnson remained the only tenant of record and his name continued to appear on the doorbell directory to Apartment 43.  The apartment telephonenumber, however, had been listed under such names as \"Gubril Abediran\" and \"Tashema Beard,\" but never in Tony Johnson's name. In addition, telephone company records revealed that one Desmond Bartley, under investigation by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency in Baltimore for having received packages of heroin from a \"Tony Johnson,\" had placed ten telephone calls to Apartment 43 during February and March, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Events of November 11</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the package addressed to \"Keisha (sic) Barrows\" remained with customs authorities, it had been fitted with an electronic monitoring device before being delivered to Apartment 43 on November 11, 1997.  As U.S. Postal Inspector Nicole Gray, posing as a postal carrier, entered 1019 Beacon Street, undercover agents were maintaining surveillance from both inside and outside the building.  These agents observed that Inspector Gray was being followed by a black male who kept looking at the package Inspector Gray was carrying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The landlord met the black male and promptly alerted the surveillance agents that he recognized him as Tony Johnson's friend, \"Tony from Cambridge.\"  This information was radioed to agents outside the apartment building, who then observed the black male (i.e., \"Tony from Cambridge\") as he exited the apartment building and entered a blue Dodge Caravan parked immediately in front of the apartment building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"Tony from Cambridge\" was still inside 1019 Beacon Street, customs agents stationed outside the building, including Agents McGrath and Donald Lenzie, observed that another black male, with a moustache, was using a pay phone on the opposite side of Beacon Street.  At about the same time, Leighton received a phone call from Tony Johnson, who said he would be dropping by the apartment later to pay the rent.  Surveillance agents watched the caller hang up the payphone, cross Beacon Street, and enter the blue Dodge Caravan on the passenger side.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The blue Dodge Caravan, tailed by agents, then proceeded behind the Brookline post office building where Inspector Gray had driven the postal truck after unsuccessfully attempting to make the controlled delivery of the \"Keisha (sic) Barrows\" package at 1019 Beacon Street.  Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Detective Peter Pasciucco continued to tail the blue Caravan for an hour after it left the post office, and at one point observed that one of the two black males was using a cellular phone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meantime, back at 1019 Beacon Street, Leighton made and received a series of telephone calls.  Fifteen minutes after the blue Caravan left 1019 Beacon Street, \"Tony from Cambridge\" called to learn the identities of the people who had been in the lobby earlier (viz., the undercover surveillance agents).  Leighton told him they were electricians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than two hours later, at the direction of law enforcement agents, Leighton called Tony Johnson's cellular phone and \"Tony from Cambridge\" answered.  When Leighton told him about the attempt to deliver the package to Apartment 43 earlier that morning, \"Tony from Cambridge\" repeatedly asked Leighton to sign for the package the next time a delivery was attempted, and advised Leighton that Tony Johnson would pick it up later from Leighton. At this point, \"Tony from Cambridge\" volunteered the information that Keesha Barrows owed Tony Johnson money and that the package probably was a birthday gift to Barrows.  Leighton again refused to sign for the package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the next half hour, Leighton received two telephone calls from Tony Johnson, requesting that he sign for the package and parroting \"Tony from Cambridge\"'s earlier phone conversation with Leighton by stating that Keesha Barrows owed Tony Johnson money and that the package must be a birthday gift for Barrows.  Leighton again refused to sign for the package addressed to Barrows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Events of November 12</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 8:45 the following morning, agents spotted the same blue Caravan parked near 1019 Beacon Street, and later near the Brookline post office.  At about the same time, the post office received two anonymous telephone calls inquiring about the package addressed to Barrows.  When the blue Caravan left the post office, the agents tailing it observed what appeared to be evasive maneuvers, such as U-turns and driving against traffic on one-way streets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly, Inspector Gray left the post office and drove to 1019 Beacon Street in an effort to attempt another controlled delivery.  At the time, Detective Pasciucco was parked on Park Drive, around the corner from, though not in direct line of sight of, 1019 Beacon Street.  At this point Pasciucco observed the blue Caravan as it turned onto Park Drive, passed his vehicle, and turned onto Beacon Street heading toward No. 1019.  Pasciucco identified the occupants as the same two men whom he had seen in the blue Caravan the previous morning.  When the blue Caravan parked across the street from 1019 Beacon, Agent Lenzie identified its two occupants as the same two black men he had seen in the blue Caravan on November 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A short time later, Keesha Barrows arrived and parked her vehicle behind the postal delivery truck.  As Inspector Gray left the apartment building with the undelivered package, Keesha Barrows approached her, signed for the package, then placed it in her vehicle.  The blue Caravan made a U-turn and pulled up behind the Barrows vehicle.  At that point, Bashorun (aka \"Tony Johnson\"), Junaid (aka \"Tony from Cambridge\"), and Keesha Barrows were arrested pursuant to Agent McGrath's instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A subsequent search of the blue Caravan, conducted incident to the warrantless arrests, disclosed several pieces of inculpatory evidence, including a cellular phone, documents reflecting the telephone numbers of Keesha Barrows and the Brookline post office, as well as the Express Mail tracking number for the package containing the contraband heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Bashorun and Junaid were indicted for conspiring to possess heroin, with intent to distribute, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846; possessing heroin, with intent to distribute, see id.&#167; 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2; five counts of utilizing a telephone to facilitate a drug offense, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b); and one count of immigration fraud, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1546(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Bashorun moved to suppress all evidence seized incident to his warrantless arrest, on the ground that \"law enforcement officers did not have probable cause to arrest [him.]\" Following a six-day evidentiary hearing, during which several law enforcement agents testified, the district court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Bashorun arrived at a plea agreement with the government and entered a conditional guilty plea, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), reserving the right to appeal the district court order denying the motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to his warrantless arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bashorun now contends that his warrantless arrest was invalid because the record unequivocally demonstrates that Agent McGrath, who ordered the arrest, lacked contemporaneous knowledge of the critical fact that would have established probable cause to arrest the passenger in the blue Caravan on November 12:  namely, that the same two persons were in the blue Caravan on both November 11 and 12.  Instead, Bashorun argues, the record reveals that the only officer arguably in a position to make such an identification - Detective Pasciucco - did not communicate that information to Agent McGrath prior to the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, Bashorun  maintains that the evidence showed, at most, that he was \"merely present\" -- i.e., as a passenger -- in the blue Caravan on November 12.  Since the present claim was never presented to the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we will not entertain it on appeal.  See United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1057 (1999); United States v. Nunez, 19 F.3d 719, 721-23 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Meraz-Peru, 24 F.3d 1197, 1198 (10th Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Bashorun points out, the precise contours of the fellow-officer rule have never been limned by this court:  for example, as to whether the \"directing\" officer (viz., Agent McGrath) personally need have known -- through personal observation or verifiable information communicated by fellow officers -- all facts necessary to demonstrate probable cause, or whether the cumulative knowledge of all participating officers may be considered.  See United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 194 (1st Cir. 1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   Bashorun nonetheless urges that we now reach out for the controversial question bypassed in Meade and adopt the rule that the prosecution must establish that the supervising officer possessed all the requisite probable-cause data, rather than simply presume that subordinate officers would have communicated their collective knowledge to their supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal theories Bashorun advances on appeal were never raised in the district court, where he neither cited Meade nor the controversy it identified, instead simply asserting that the \"officers\" involved did not have probable cause for the arrest. Now, however, he attempts to rely upon the altogether different theory that even assuming the subordinate officers possessed the requisite information to establish probable cause, it was never communicated to Agent McGrath, who made the probable-cause assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these lapses and the consequent absence of a sufficiently developed evidentiary record, the Meade-based claims asserted on appeal are deemed waived.  See Nunez, 19 F.3d at 722 (holding, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P 12(f), that litigant waives issue not raised in pretrial motion to suppress, except for \"cause\" shown); see also United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 185 (1st Cir. 2000); Torres, 162 F.3d at 11 (\"A litigant [seeking to suppress evidence] cannot jump from theory to theory like a bee buzzing from flower to flower.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bashorun offers various rejoinders to the waiver suggestion.  First, he asserts that \"the issue of which person had knowledge of the facts constituting probable cause was always before the district court,\" citing the following statement by the Assistant United States Attorney:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We started this [suppression hearing] with the notion that we were going to ask this witness [Agent McGrath], who made the arrest decision, what he knew.  And we were very focused that what he knew was the focus of this hearing. . . . The only issue, [] it seems to me, is what this witness [Agent McGrath] knew and the cross-examination of that witness. . . . What the defense wants to do now is find out every witness who ever made an observation, apparently whether or not it was communicated to McGrath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quoted excerpt is unavailing, however, for two principal reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we enforce Rule 12(f) waivers even though the district court ultimately did address the waived issue on the merits, unless the appellant can show \"cause\" for failing to raise it in a pretrial motion.  See Nunez, 19 F.3d at 722.  Bashorun has attempted no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Bashorun wrenches the prosecutor's remarks from their context.  During the McGrath cross-examination at the suppression hearing, defense counsel represented to the district court:  \"[T]his witness knows some things that some people have told him but doesn't know a lot about what those people, in fact, saw.\"  Further, defense counsel suggested that other law enforcement officers, such as Agent Lenzie and Detective Pasciucco, should be called as witnesses so that \"the Court can adequately assess the reliability of the tremendous amount of hearsay evidence that [Agent McGrath] has provided.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the government's objection, the district court agreed, explaining that if one of Agent McGrath's fellow officers were to offer testimony -- concerning his observations on November 11 or 12 -- which was not consistent with Agent McGrath's testimony as to what that officer had told him, then McGrath's credibility could be called into question.  Fairly viewed in context, therefore, the prosecutor's objection went simply to the unanticipated expansion of the witness list because \"the defense has been trying mightily to discover the entire case two weeks before trial,\" and because the prosecutor believed that defense counsel had been afforded adequate opportunity to test Agent McGrath's credibility through cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, at no point in the entire exchange did counsel suggest that the defense was interested in calling additional witnesses to determine whether they had communicated their observations to Agent McGrath, but rather to determine what they had observed.  Thus, the defense not only failed to present even a subliminal Meade claim, but left entirely open the clear impression imparted in its pretrial motion that its principal contention was that none of the individual officers possessed sufficient facts to establish probable cause. Accordingly, the ensuing statements by the prosecutor and the district court fairly cannot be construed as concessions that probable cause properly could be established only through the knowledge possessed by Agent McGrath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bashorun points out that he proposed the following findings of fact following the suppression hearing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The only two law enforcement agents involved in the investigation on both November 11 and 12, 1997 who had an opportunity to see the occupants of the blue Dodge Caravan before the arrest were Agents Lenzie and Pasciucco. Agent McGrath did not see the occupants of the Caravan until after the arrest on November 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Prior to the arrest, Agent Pasciucco made no radio transmissions that the occupants were the same on November 12 as he had observed on November 11.  Agent Pasciucco did not testify that he was aware prior to the arrest of any observations of \"evasive\" driving by the Caravan on November 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. By the time he discontinued his surveillance on November 11, 1997, Agent Lenzie had only observed one of the two occupants of the Dodge Caravan.  He did not see the other, if in fact there was another, occupant of the Caravan on November 11. Because he only saw one person in the Caravan on November 11, he was in no position to say that the two occupants of the Caravan were the same on November 11 and 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, Bashorun argues, \"[t]here would have been no reason [to ask] for such findings if all of the information known to the surveillance agents could be added together to determine if probable cause to make an arrest existed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again we disagree, for the simple reason that the credibility of Agent Lenzie and Detective Pasciucco regarding their observations was at least as relevant to the non-Meade defense theory asserted in Bashorun's pretrial motion to suppress.  That is, if Detective Pasciucco did in fact make the November 12 observation to which he testified, Bashorun's pretrial contention that none of the officers involved had sufficient facts to establish probable cause would be undermined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, for example, the district court reasonably may have construed Proposed Finding 2 -- viz., that \"[p]rior to the arrest, Agent Pasciucco made no radio transmissions that the occupants were the same on November 12 as he had observed on November 11\" -- as a challenge to the credibility of Detective Pasciucco's observation (as contrasted from his communication of it to McGrath), since it would be reasonable to expect that if Pasciucco truthfully testified that he had made so crucial an observation, in all likelihood he would have communicated it to his fellow officers. As Pasciucco did not communicate it, however, Bashorun invited the district court to find that he never made the observation at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, the district court interpreted Proposed Finding 2 in precisely this fashion, as demonstrated by the fact that it made no finding whatsoever as to whether either Agent Lenzie or Detective Pasciucco had communicated their respective observations to fellow officers.  See United States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-10318, at 16-17 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999) (expressly \"credit[ing]\" Agent Lenzie's and Detective Pasciucco's observations of November 12 that the same two men were in the blue Caravan on November 11 and 12, but making no mention or finding as to whether they communicated their observations to fellow officers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite clearly and understandably, therefore, the district court did not consider the issue of inter-officer communication material to the proffered defense, except as it might pertain to the entirely discrete matter of the credibility of the testimony provided by Lenzie and Pasciucco regarding their observations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bashorun nevertheless argues that any waiver must be excused since the district court addressed the Meade issue on the merits, as reflected in the following statement in its opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[E]vidence supporting probable cause can be cumulative: \"[L]aw enforcement officials cooperating in an investigation are entitled to rely upon each other's knowledge of facts when forming the conclusion that a suspect has committed or is committing a crime.\"   United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir. 1997)  . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-10318, at 18 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999).   This claim fails as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as previously noted, Rule 12(f) waivers are not excused simply because the district court may have addressed the waived issue on the merits. See Nunez, 19 F.3d at 722.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, it strains credulity to suggest that the district court meant to resolve the controversial Meade issue in a single, unelaborated, prefatory sentence.  Instead, as evidenced by its appearance at the very outset of the district court's legal analysis, this sentence simply set forth the probable cause precepts applicable where multiple law-enforcement officers are involved in a warrantless search or seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, at no point did the district court even remotely purport to acknowledge that the defense intended to litigate any inter-officer communication claim.  Were it otherwise, we think it would be reasonable to expect that the district court would have quoted the Meade dicta presently touted by Bashorun on appeal, in which we discussed whether communication of the knowledge acquired by individual officers may be presumed, or whether proof of inter-officer communications is even required under the \"fellow-officer\" rule.  See supra note 2.  The district court's silence on these weighty matters speaks volumes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bashorun argues that for us to find a Rule 12(f) waiver would breach the promise made in the plea agreement that he could appeal the denial of the suppression motion.  As this argument rests on the incorrect assumption that \"[t]he district court's order squarely addresses the issue raised on appeal[,]\" it fails as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the government entered into the plea agreement with Bashorun, it was entitled to assume, as the law plainly provides, that only arguments duly presented to the district court would be deemed preserved for appeal.  Although Bashorun cites case law holding that the government must scrupulously perform all promises made in its plea agreements, there is no authority for the view that it implicitly promises that a Rule 11(a)(2) appellant shall have the legal right to insist that legal theories waived below are nevertheless to be considered preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have done in the past, we now bypass the issue as to whether \"plain error\" review is available, see Nunez, 19 F.3d at 723 n.10 (bypassing question and finding no plain error), and instead accord Bashorun the benefit of that standard of review. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33 (1993)) (requiring that appellant prove that error is \"plain\" or \"obvious\" and affects substantial rights, and that appellate court determine, in its discretion, that error \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\"); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted the difficulty confronting defendants \"where reliable review has been rendered impossible by inadequate [factual] development at the district court level.\"  Nunez, 19 F.3d at 723 n.10.  More to the present point, the defense failure to invite the district court's attention to the inter-officer communications issue resulted in a virtually total absence of essential factual findings relating to the merits.  Consequently, critical factual questions remain both ambiguous and conflicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, Detective Pasciucco ambiguously testified initially that he had made no radio communication on November 12 after observing the blue Caravan on Park Drive.  Later, however, he allowed that he could not remember.  Agent McGrath, on the other hand, initially testified that Detective Pasciucco had reported to him that the occupants in the blue Caravan were \"the same persons as the day before.\"  Later, however, Agent McGrath testified that he had received a radio communication from someone after the blue Caravan pulled up in front of 1019 Beacon Street on November 12, advising that the blue Caravan occupants were \"the two black males that had been in it for two days.\"  The latter communication would have taken place immediately after Detective Pasciucco observed the blue Caravan turn from Park Drive onto Beacon Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it cannot be seriously suggested that the present record makes it either \"obvious\" or \"clear\" whether these pivotal communications took place.  Accordingly, Bashorun cannot demonstrate plain error under any scenario.  See Nunez, 19 F.3d at 723 n.10  (\"'[E]rror cannot be \"clear\" or \"obvious\" unless the desired factual finding is the only one supported by the record below.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, ample additional grounds preclude any \"plain error\" finding.  See United States v. Diallo, 29 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[P]robable cause should be determined under a 'totality-of-the-circumstances' test . . . [and] 'is a fluid concept - turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts.' . . . 'The substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.  And this means less than evidence which would justify condemnation or conviction.'\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument advanced by Bashorun on appeal rests entirely on the premise that the visual identifications of the passengers in the blue Caravan on two successive days was the critical evidence without which there could have been no probable cause for their arrests.  As the district court aptly observed, however, and the record amply demonstrates, see supra Section I, Agent McGrath was in possession of a far broader web of inculpatory evidence having little to do with whether Bashorun (aka \"Tony Johnson\") was the passenger in the blue Caravan on November 11 and 12.  For instance, there was no dispute that the blue Caravan made highly suspicious movements on both days, traveling from 1019 Beacon Street to the Brookline post office, then making evasive maneuvers while followed by law enforcement officers.  See United States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-10318, at 16-17 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999) (noting \"suspicious\" movements of blue Caravan). Consequently, the very least that can be said is that a finding that the passenger in the blue Caravan on November 12 was \"merely present\" most certainly was not compelled.  See, e.g., Meade, 110 F.3d at 198-99 (affirming finding of probable cause to arrest passenger in vehicle, occupied by attempted-robbery suspects, which made suspicious maneuvers; noting as well that \"these facts reveal 'substantially more than a momentary, random, or apparently innocent association'\"); United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 729 (1st Cir. 1995) (affirming finding of probable cause to arrest defendants who were members of large group selling drugs in park).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, it simply cannot be seriously suggested that the probable-cause calculus indulged by the district court constituted plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Instead, in a January 8, 1998, memorandum of law supporting the motion to suppress, Bashorun simply set forth the so-called \"fellow-officer\" rule, which merely requires that the district court \"determine whether 'at the moment the arrest was made' the 'facts and circumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that [the suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.'\"  (Emphasis added.)  Thus, in the district court Bashorun essentially contended simply that none of the officers involved in his arrest possessed sufficient evidence to establish probable cause.  At no point did he contend that Agent McGrath -- qua \"directing\" law enforcement officer -- lacked the requisite information to support the probable cause assessment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Meade states in dicta:</p>\n        <p>The fellow officer rule underlies the well-worn maxim that \"the collective knowledge and information of all the officers involved establishes probable cause for the arrest.\" The \"collective knowledge\" or \"pooled knowledge\" principle has been used to validate arrests in two ways: (1) by tracing the arresting officer's action back to an individual in a law enforcement agency who possessed information sufficient to establish probable cause, and (2) by finding that the directing agency as a whole possessed the necessary facts.</p>\n        <p>A sensible argument has been made that looking to the agency's knowledge as a whole is unwise because it may \"encourage the dissemination of arrest orders based upon nothing more than the hope that the unevaluated bits and pieces in the hands of several different officers may turn out to add up to probable cause.\"  In the same vein, the collective-knowledge corollary of the fellow officer rule would seem to require, or at least presuppose, the flow of information from the officers with knowledge of facts tending to establish probable cause to those lacking that knowledge (or, at least, to the directing or arresting officer).</p>\n        <p>Meade, 110 F.3d at 194.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Moreover, in addition to the initial waiver, Bashorun submitted proposed conclusions of law following the evidentiary hearing, without once mentioning or citing Meade.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court identified several other factors material to the common-sense probable cause determination: (1) Leighton positively identified \"Tony from Cambridge\" as the man who tried to receive the package on November 11, and drove the blue Caravan that day; (2) Tony Johnson, the apartment lessee, had introduced \"Tony from Cambridge\" as his friend; and (3) both \"Tony from Cambridge\" and Tony Johnson spoke with Leighton by phone on November 11.  As their conversations turned on uncannily similar and unorthodox themes (e.g., Barrows owed Johnson money, and the package was a birthday gift for Barrows) that it would have been entirely reasonable to infer that the two Tonys, i.e., the two occupants of the blue Caravan, were in close consultation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Customs agents promptly contacted Timothy Leighton, the landlord at 1019 Beacon Street, and learned that a man named Tony Johnson -- identified following his arrest as Bashorun -- had rented Apartment 43 continuously since January 1997.  Leighton described Tony Johnson as a black man in his thirties, with an accent, who drove a late model car and wore expensive jewelry, but had no apparent means of employment.  Leighton stated that Tony Johnson had introduced him to a friend, also named \"Tony,\" who lived in Cambridge [hereinafter: \"Tony from Cambridge,\" identified following his arrest as Bashorun's codefendant Anthony Junaid], whom Leighton likewise described as a black man, with an accent, who wore expensive jewelry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Tony Johnson left Apartment 43 in September 1997, Leighton allowed Johnson's girlfriend, Keesha Barrows, to move in for two weeks, followed by Felicia Brown (\"Tony from Cambridge\"'s girlfriend) and her mother.  Throughout this period, Tony Johnson remained the only tenant of record and his name continued to appear on the doorbell directory to Apartment 43.  The apartment telephonenumber, however, had been listed under such names as \"Gubril Abediran\" and \"Tashema Beard,\" but never in Tony Johnson's name. In addition, telephone company records revealed that one Desmond Bartley, under investigation by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency in Baltimore for having received packages of heroin from a \"Tony Johnson,\" had placed ten telephone calls to Apartment 43 during February and March, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Events of November 11</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the package addressed to \"Keisha (sic) Barrows\" remained with customs authorities, it had been fitted with an electronic monitoring device before being delivered to Apartment 43 on November 11, 1997.  As U.S. Postal Inspector Nicole Gray, posing as a postal carrier, entered 1019 Beacon Street, undercover agents were maintaining surveillance from both inside and outside the building.  These agents observed that Inspector Gray was being followed by a black male who kept looking at the package Inspector Gray was carrying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The landlord met the black male and promptly alerted the surveillance agents that he recognized him as Tony Johnson's friend, \"Tony from Cambridge.\"  This information was radioed to agents outside the apartment building, who then observed the black male (i.e., \"Tony from Cambridge\") as he exited the apartment building and entered a blue Dodge Caravan parked immediately in front of the apartment building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"Tony from Cambridge\" was still inside 1019 Beacon Street, customs agents stationed outside the building, including Agents McGrath and Donald Lenzie, observed that another black male, with a moustache, was using a pay phone on the opposite side of Beacon Street.  At about the same time, Leighton received a phone call from Tony Johnson, who said he would be dropping by the apartment later to pay the rent.  Surveillance agents watched the caller hang up the payphone, cross Beacon Street, and enter the blue Dodge Caravan on the passenger side.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The blue Dodge Caravan, tailed by agents, then proceeded behind the Brookline post office building where Inspector Gray had driven the postal truck after unsuccessfully attempting to make the controlled delivery of the \"Keisha (sic) Barrows\" package at 1019 Beacon Street.  Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Detective Peter Pasciucco continued to tail the blue Caravan for an hour after it left the post office, and at one point observed that one of the two black males was using a cellular phone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meantime, back at 1019 Beacon Street, Leighton made and received a series of telephone calls.  Fifteen minutes after the blue Caravan left 1019 Beacon Street, \"Tony from Cambridge\" called to learn the identities of the people who had been in the lobby earlier (viz., the undercover surveillance agents).  Leighton told him they were electricians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than two hours later, at the direction of law enforcement agents, Leighton called Tony Johnson's cellular phone and \"Tony from Cambridge\" answered.  When Leighton told him about the attempt to deliver the package to Apartment 43 earlier that morning, \"Tony from Cambridge\" repeatedly asked Leighton to sign for the package the next time a delivery was attempted, and advised Leighton that Tony Johnson would pick it up later from Leighton. At this point, \"Tony from Cambridge\" volunteered the information that Keesha Barrows owed Tony Johnson money and that the package probably was a birthday gift to Barrows.  Leighton again refused to sign for the package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the next half hour, Leighton received two telephone calls from Tony Johnson, requesting that he sign for the package and parroting \"Tony from Cambridge\"'s earlier phone conversation with Leighton by stating that Keesha Barrows owed Tony Johnson money and that the package must be a birthday gift for Barrows.  Leighton again refused to sign for the package addressed to Barrows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Events of November 12</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 8:45 the following morning, agents spotted the same blue Caravan parked near 1019 Beacon Street, and later near the Brookline post office.  At about the same time, the post office received two anonymous telephone calls inquiring about the package addressed to Barrows.  When the blue Caravan left the post office, the agents tailing it observed what appeared to be evasive maneuvers, such as U-turns and driving against traffic on one-way streets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly, Inspector Gray left the post office and drove to 1019 Beacon Street in an effort to attempt another controlled delivery.  At the time, Detective Pasciucco was parked on Park Drive, around the corner from, though not in direct line of sight of, 1019 Beacon Street.  At this point Pasciucco observed the blue Caravan as it turned onto Park Drive, passed his vehicle, and turned onto Beacon Street heading toward No. 1019.  Pasciucco identified the occupants as the same two men whom he had seen in the blue Caravan the previous morning.  When the blue Caravan parked across the street from 1019 Beacon, Agent Lenzie identified its two occupants as the same two black men he had seen in the blue Caravan on November 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A short time later, Keesha Barrows arrived and parked her vehicle behind the postal delivery truck.  As Inspector Gray left the apartment building with the undelivered package, Keesha Barrows approached her, signed for the package, then placed it in her vehicle.  The blue Caravan made a U-turn and pulled up behind the Barrows vehicle.  At that point, Bashorun (aka \"Tony Johnson\"), Junaid (aka \"Tony from Cambridge\"), and Keesha Barrows were arrested pursuant to Agent McGrath's instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A subsequent search of the blue Caravan, conducted incident to the warrantless arrests, disclosed several pieces of inculpatory evidence, including a cellular phone, documents reflecting the telephone numbers of Keesha Barrows and the Brookline post office, as well as the Express Mail tracking number for the package containing the contraband heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Bashorun and Junaid were indicted for conspiring to possess heroin, with intent to distribute, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846; possessing heroin, with intent to distribute, see id.&#167; 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2; five counts of utilizing a telephone to facilitate a drug offense, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b); and one count of immigration fraud, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1546(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Bashorun moved to suppress all evidence seized incident to his warrantless arrest, on the ground that \"law enforcement officers did not have probable cause to arrest [him.]\" Following a six-day evidentiary hearing, during which several law enforcement agents testified, the district court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Bashorun arrived at a plea agreement with the government and entered a conditional guilty plea, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), reserving the right to appeal the district court order denying the motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to his warrantless arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bashorun now contends that his warrantless arrest was invalid because the record unequivocally demonstrates that Agent McGrath, who ordered the arrest, lacked contemporaneous knowledge of the critical fact that would have established probable cause to arrest the passenger in the blue Caravan on November 12:  namely, that the same two persons were in the blue Caravan on both November 11 and 12.  Instead, Bashorun argues, the record reveals that the only officer arguably in a position to make such an identification - Detective Pasciucco - did not communicate that information to Agent McGrath prior to the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, Bashorun  maintains that the evidence showed, at most, that he was \"merely present\" -- i.e., as a passenger -- in the blue Caravan on November 12.  Since the present claim was never presented to the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we will not entertain it on appeal.  See United States v.

See United States v. Meade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 194 (1st Cir. 1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   Bashorun nonetheless urges that we now reach out for the controversial question bypassed in Meade and adopt the rule that the prosecution must establish that the supervising officer possessed all the requisite probable-cause data, rather than simply presume that subordinate officers would have communicated their collective knowledge to their supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal theories Bashorun advances on appeal were never raised in the district court, where he neither cited Meade nor the controversy it identified, instead simply asserting that the \"officers\" involved did not have probable cause for the arrest. Now, however, he attempts to rely upon the altogether different theory that even assuming the subordinate officers possessed the requisite information to establish probable cause, it was never communicated to Agent McGrath, who made the probable-cause assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these lapses and the consequent absence of a sufficiently developed evidentiary record, the Meade-based claims asserted on appeal are deemed waived.

First, he asserts that \"the issue of which person had knowledge of the facts constituting probable cause was always before the district court,\" citing the following statement by the Assistant United States Attorney:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We started this [suppression hearing] with the notion that we were going to ask this witness [Agent McGrath], who made the arrest decision, what he knew.  And we were very focused that what he knew was the focus of this hearing. . . . The only issue, [] it seems to me, is what this witness [Agent McGrath] knew and the cross-examination of that witness. . . . What the defense wants to do now is find out every witness who ever made an observation, apparently whether or not it was communicated to McGrath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quoted excerpt is unavailing, however, for two principal reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we enforce Rule 12(f) waivers even though the district court ultimately did address the waived issue on the merits, unless the appellant can show \"cause\" for failing to raise it in a pretrial motion.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195254\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nunez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195254/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>.  Bashorun has attempted no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Bashorun wrenches the prosecutor's remarks from their context.  During the McGrath cross-examination at the suppression hearing, defense counsel represented to the district court:  \"[T]his witness knows some things that some people have told him but doesn't know a lot about what those people, in fact, saw.\"  Further, defense counsel suggested that other law enforcement officers, such as Agent Lenzie and Detective Pasciucco, should be called as witnesses so that \"the Court can adequately assess the reliability of the tremendous amount of hearsay evidence that [Agent McGrath] has provided.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the government's objection, the district court agreed, explaining that if one of Agent McGrath's fellow officers were to offer testimony -- concerning his observations on November 11 or 12 -- which was not consistent with Agent McGrath's testimony as to what that officer had told him, then McGrath's credibility could be called into question.  Fairly viewed in context, therefore, the prosecutor's objection went simply to the unanticipated expansion of the witness list because \"the defense has been trying mightily to discover the entire case two weeks before trial,\" and because the prosecutor believed that defense counsel had been afforded adequate opportunity to test Agent McGrath's credibility through cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, at no point in the entire exchange did counsel suggest that the defense was interested in calling additional witnesses to determine whether they had communicated their observations to Agent McGrath, but rather to determine what they had observed.  Thus, the defense not only failed to present even a subliminal Meade claim, but left entirely open the clear impression imparted in its pretrial motion that its principal contention was that none of the individual officers possessed sufficient facts to establish probable cause. Accordingly, the ensuing statements by the prosecutor and the district court fairly cannot be construed as concessions that probable cause properly could be established only through the knowledge possessed by Agent McGrath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bashorun points out that he proposed the following findings of fact following the suppression hearing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The only two law enforcement agents involved in the investigation on both November 11 and 12, 1997 who had an opportunity to see the occupants of the blue Dodge Caravan before the arrest were Agents Lenzie and Pasciucco. Agent McGrath did not see the occupants of the Caravan until after the arrest on November 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Prior to the arrest, Agent Pasciucco made no radio transmissions that the occupants were the same on November 12 as he had observed on November 11.  Agent Pasciucco did not testify that he was aware prior to the arrest of any observations of \"evasive\" driving by the Caravan on November 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. By the time he discontinued his surveillance on November 11, 1997, Agent Lenzie had only observed one of the two occupants of the Dodge Caravan.  He did not see the other, if in fact there was another, occupant of the Caravan on November 11. Because he only saw one person in the Caravan on November 11, he was in no position to say that the two occupants of the Caravan were the same on November 11 and 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, Bashorun argues, \"[t]here would have been no reason [to ask] for such findings if all of the information known to the surveillance agents could be added together to determine if probable cause to make an arrest existed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again we disagree, for the simple reason that the credibility of Agent Lenzie and Detective Pasciucco regarding their observations was at least as relevant to the non-Meade defense theory asserted in Bashorun's pretrial motion to suppress.  That is, if Detective Pasciucco did in fact make the November 12 observation to which he testified, Bashorun's pretrial contention that none of the officers involved had sufficient facts to establish probable cause would be undermined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, for example, the district court reasonably may have construed Proposed Finding 2 -- viz., that \"[p]rior to the arrest, Agent Pasciucco made no radio transmissions that the occupants were the same on November 12 as he had observed on November 11\" -- as a challenge to the credibility of Detective Pasciucco's observation (as contrasted from his communication of it to McGrath), since it would be reasonable to expect that if Pasciucco truthfully testified that he had made so crucial an observation, in all likelihood he would have communicated it to his fellow officers. As Pasciucco did not communicate it, however, Bashorun invited the district court to find that he never made the observation at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, the district court interpreted Proposed Finding 2 in precisely this fashion, as demonstrated by the fact that it made no finding whatsoever as to whether either Agent Lenzie or Detective Pasciucco had communicated their respective observations to fellow officers.  See United States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-10318, at 16-17 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999) (expressly \"credit[ing]\" Agent Lenzie's and Detective Pasciucco's observations of November 12 that the same two men were in the blue Caravan on November 11 and 12, but making no mention or finding as to whether they communicated their observations to fellow officers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite clearly and understandably, therefore, the district court did not consider the issue of inter-officer communication material to the proffered defense, except as it might pertain to the entirely discrete matter of the credibility of the testimony provided by Lenzie and Pasciucco regarding their observations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bashorun nevertheless argues that any waiver must be excused since the district court addressed the Meade issue on the merits, as reflected in the following statement in its opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[E]vidence supporting probable cause can be cumulative: \"[L]aw enforcement officials cooperating in an investigation are entitled to rely upon each other's knowledge of facts when forming the conclusion that a suspect has committed or is committing a crime.\"   United States v. Meade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 193 (1st Cir. 1997)  . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-10318, at 18 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999).   This claim fails as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as previously noted, Rule 12(f) waivers are not excused simply because the district court may have addressed the waived issue on the merits. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195254\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nunez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195254/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, it strains credulity to suggest that the district court meant to resolve the controversial Meade issue in a single, unelaborated, prefatory sentence.  Instead, as evidenced by its appearance at the very outset of the district court's legal analysis, this sentence simply set forth the probable cause precepts applicable where multiple law-enforcement officers are involved in a warrantless search or seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, at no point did the district court even remotely purport to acknowledge that the defense intended to litigate any inter-officer communication claim.  Were it otherwise, we think it would be reasonable to expect that the district court would have quoted the Meade dicta presently touted by Bashorun on appeal, in which we discussed whether communication of the knowledge acquired by individual officers may be presumed, or whether proof of inter-officer communications is even required under the \"fellow-officer\" rule.  See supra note 2.  The district court's silence on these weighty matters speaks volumes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bashorun argues that for us to find a Rule 12(f) waiver would breach the promise made in the plea agreement that he could appeal the denial of the suppression motion.  As this argument rests on the incorrect assumption that \"[t]he district court's order squarely addresses the issue raised on appeal[,]\" it fails as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the government entered into the plea agreement with Bashorun, it was entitled to assume, as the law plainly provides, that only arguments duly presented to the district court would be deemed preserved for appeal.  Although Bashorun cites case law holding that the government must scrupulously perform all promises made in its plea agreements, there is no authority for the view that it implicitly promises that a Rule 11(a)(2) appellant shall have the legal right to insist that legal theories waived below are nevertheless to be considered preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have done in the past, we now bypass the issue as to whether \"plain error\" review is available, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195254\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nunez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195254/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">723</span> </a></span>n.10 (bypassing question and finding no plain error), and instead accord Bashorun the benefit of that standard of review. See United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732-33 (1993)) (requiring that appellant prove that error is \"plain\" or \"obvious\" and affects substantial rights, and that appellate court determine, in its discretion, that error \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\"); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted the difficulty confronting defendants \"where reliable review has been rendered impossible by inadequate [factual] development at the district court level.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195254\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nunez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195254/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">723</span> </a></span>n.10.  More to the present point, the defense failure to invite the district court's attention to the inter-officer communications issue resulted in a virtually total absence of essential factual findings relating to the merits.  Consequently, critical factual questions remain both ambiguous and conflicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, Detective Pasciucco ambiguously testified initially that he had made no radio communication on November 12 after observing the blue Caravan on Park Drive.  Later, however, he allowed that he could not remember.  Agent McGrath, on the other hand, initially testified that Detective Pasciucco had reported to him that the occupants in the blue Caravan were \"the same persons as the day before.\"  Later, however, Agent McGrath testified that he had received a radio communication from someone after the blue Caravan pulled up in front of 1019 Beacon Street on November 12, advising that the blue Caravan occupants were \"the two black males that had been in it for two days.\"  The latter communication would have taken place immediately after Detective Pasciucco observed the blue Caravan turn from Park Drive onto Beacon Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it cannot be seriously suggested that the present record makes it either \"obvious\" or \"clear\" whether these pivotal communications took place.  Accordingly, Bashorun cannot demonstrate plain error under any scenario.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195254\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nunez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195254/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">723</span> </a></span>n.10  (\"'[E]rror cannot be \"clear\" or \"obvious\" unless the desired factual finding is the only one supported by the record below.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, ample additional grounds preclude any \"plain error\" finding.  See United States v. Diallo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195489\"><a href=\"/opinion/195489/united-states-v-diallo/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[P]robable cause should be determined under a 'totality-of-the-circumstances' test . . . [and] 'is a fluid concept - turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts.' . . . 'The substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.  And this means less than evidence which would justify condemnation or conviction.'\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument advanced by Bashorun on appeal rests entirely on the premise that the visual identifications of the passengers in the blue Caravan on two successive days was the critical evidence without which there could have been no probable cause for their arrests.  As the district court aptly observed, however, and the record amply demonstrates, see supra Section I, Agent McGrath was in possession of a far broader web of inculpatory evidence having little to do with whether Bashorun (aka \"Tony Johnson\") was the passenger in the blue Caravan on November 11 and 12.  For instance, there was no dispute that the blue Caravan made highly suspicious movements on both days, traveling from 1019 Beacon Street to the Brookline post office, then making evasive maneuvers while followed by law enforcement officers.  See United States v. Bashorun, No. 97-CR-10318, at 16-17 (D. Mass. Jan. 5, 1999) (noting \"suspicious\" movements of blue Caravan). Consequently, the very least that can be said is that a finding that the passenger in the blue Caravan on November 12 was \"merely present\" most certainly was not compelled.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Meade,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">198-99</span> </a></span>(affirming finding of probable cause to arrest passenger in vehicle, occupied by attempted-robbery suspects, which made suspicious maneuvers; noting as well that \"these facts reveal 'substantially more than a momentary, random, or apparently innocent association'\"); United States v. Martinez-Molina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196268\"><a href=\"/opinion/196268/united-states-v-martinez-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 729 (1st Cir. 1995) (affirming finding of probable cause to arrest defendants who were members of large group selling drugs in park).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, it simply cannot be seriously suggested that the probable-cause calculus indulged by the district court constituted plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Instead, in a January 8, 1998, memorandum of law supporting the motion to suppress, Bashorun simply set forth the so-called \"fellow-officer\" rule, which merely requires that the district court \"determine whether 'at the moment the arrest was made' the 'facts and circumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that [the suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.'\"  (Emphasis added.)  Thus, in the district court Bashorun essentially contended simply that none of the officers involved in his arrest possessed sufficient evidence to establish probable cause.  At no point did he contend that Agent McGrath -- qua \"directing\" law enforcement officer -- lacked the requisite information to support the probable cause assessment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Meade states in dicta:</p>\n        <p>The fellow officer rule underlies the well-worn maxim that \"the collective knowledge and information of all the officers involved establishes probable cause for the arrest.\" The \"collective knowledge\" or \"pooled knowledge\" principle has been used to validate arrests in two ways: (1) by tracing the arresting officer's action back to an individual in a law enforcement agency who possessed information sufficient to establish probable cause, and (2) by finding that the directing agency as a whole possessed the necessary facts.</p>\n        <p>A sensible argument has been made that looking to the agency's knowledge as a whole is unwise because it may \"encourage the dissemination of arrest orders based upon nothing more than the hope that the unevaluated bits and pieces in the hands of several different officers may turn out to add up to probable cause.\"  In the same vein, the collective-knowledge corollary of the fellow officer rule would seem to require, or at least presuppose, the flow of information from the officers with knowledge of facts tending to establish probable cause to those lacking that knowledge (or, at least, to the directing or arresting officer).</p>\n        <p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Meade,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Moreover, in addition to the initial waiver, Bashorun submitted proposed conclusions of law following the evidentiary hearing, without once mentioning or citing Meade.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court identified several other factors material to the common-sense probable cause determination: (1) Leighton positively identified \"Tony from Cambridge\" as the man who tried to receive the package on November 11, and drove the blue Caravan that day; (2) Tony Johnson, the apartment lessee, had introduced \"Tony from Cambridge\" as his friend; and (3) both \"Tony from Cambridge\" and Tony Johnson spoke with Leighton by phone on November 11.  As their conversations turned on uncannily similar and unorthodox themes (e.g., Barrows owed Johnson money, and the package was a birthday gift for Barrows) that it would have been entirely reasonable to infer that the two Tonys, i.e., the two occupants of the blue Caravan, were in close consultation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
