Plaintiff-appellant Davric Maine\n\nCorporation (“Davric”) seeks to overturn a grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of defendants-appellees Craig Rancourt, Ival\n\nR. Cianchette, and William Faucher (the \"defendants\").1               Davric\n\ncontends that a fact-finder reasonably could conclude that the\n\ndefendants    violated     federal     and    state   antitrust    laws   and\n\ntortiously    interfered    with     its     contractual   relations.     We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                Background\n\n            Joseph J. Ricci owns a holding company which owns\n\nDavric.     Davric, in turn, owns and operates Scarborough Downs\n\n(\"Scarborough\"), a harness racetrack in Scarborough, Maine.\n\nScarborough hosts races, which attract horses and gamblers from\n\nMaine and other states, and also simulcasts other tracks' races.\n\nThe facility is subject to regulation by Maine's Harness Racing\n\nCommission (the “Commission”).\n\n            Davric   alleges    that   in     1994,   several   individuals,\n\nincluding     defendants     Cianchette,        Faucher,    and   Rancourt,\n\n\n    1Two other individuals were named as defendants and granted\nsummary judgment, but Davric's appeal as to these defendants has\nbeen dismissed with prejudice.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fconspired    to   destroy    Scarborough's      business      in    order    to\n\nestablish a new dominant track or to facilitate a takeover of\n\nScarborough.      Cianchette    owned     a   stake   in    the    only    other\n\nracetrack in Maine, Faucher was Director of Operations for\n\nFoxboro Park in Massachusetts, and Rancourt was an attorney who\n\nrepresented the Maine Harness Horsemen's Association (“MHHA”) in\n\ndealings with Scarborough.      The MHHA, as well as the New England\n\nHarness Horsemen's Association (“NEHHA”), supplied the horses\n\nthat raced at Scarborough.\n\n            Though   we   believe    that     summary      judgment   in    the\n\ndefendants' favor was fully warranted, we review Davric's record\n\nevidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to it.                    The\n\nfollowing inferences are supportable: In 1994, the defendants\n\nagreed that they would act in concert to undermine Scarborough's\n\nbusiness and to wrest control of harness racing in southern\n\nMaine from Davric.        In early 1994, defendant Faucher spoke of\n\nthese efforts with Lou Giuliano, the president of the NEHHA, and\n\nsolicited Giuliano's help.2         Faucher informed Giuliano that he\n\n\n    2The lower court excluded from its consideration much of the\nevidence regarding Faucher's statements to Giuliano, on the\nground that this evidence, which was presented via Giuliano's\naffidavit and deposition testimony, constituted hearsay.      We\nthink it is clear that a defendant's own alleged statements to\nGiuliano were admissible against that defendant; if made, they\nwere classic admissions and are excepted from the hearsay rule.\nTo simplify this appeal, we will assume arguendo that each\ndefendant's statements were admissible against all of the\n\n                                    -3-\n\fand several partners intended to bring about the foreclosure of\n\na mortgage Ricci had taken on Scarborough.                      Some time later,\n\nFaucher told Giuliano that this plan had failed,3 and that the\n\nanti-Davric       group   now   planned         either    (1)   to    persuade    the\n\nCommission to deny race dates to Scarborough or (2) to \"bury\n\n[Ricci] in the [Maine] legislature.\"                     According to Giuliano,\n\nafter    this   conversation,        he   also       \"understood\"     that   Faucher\n\nintended    the    MHHA   to    be   able       to   prevent    its   members    from\n\nsupplying horses to Scarborough without other organizations,\n\nsuch as the NEHHA, filling the resulting void.4\n\n            Giuliano opted not to participate in the defendants'\n\nplans.    Representing the MHHA at a public hearing in late 1994,\n\nRancourt urged that Scarborough be denied racing dates for 1995.\n\nThe NEHHA did not follow the MHHA's lead, and Giuliano in fact\n\ntestified in favor of race dates for Scarborough.                        Rancourt,\n\nCianchette and Faucher all attended this hearing.                      Immediately\n\nfollowing the hearing, Rancourt and Giuliano became involved in\n\n\n\ndefendants, though this is a much more debatable question.\n    3 As discussed below, there is no evidence that any party\never attempted to implement a plan to secure foreclosure of\nScarborough's mortgage.\n    4Giuliano's affidavit does not state that Faucher told him\nthat his confederates actually intended to employ such a\nstranglehold.    Rather, the affidavit attests only to the\ninference Giuliano drew from the conversation.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fa verbal altercation concerning Giuliano's testimony favorable\n\nto Davric.5\n\n          In June or July of 1996, approximately two years after\n\nthe conversations between Faucher and Giuliano, MHHA leaders\n\napparently      tried     to     force     member      horsemen       to    boycott\n\nScarborough.6     As a result, for several days, Davric ran fewer\n\nraces than it ordinarily would have run.\n\n          In March 1997, the MHHA's Executive Secretary, Ken\n\nRonco,   was    served    with    notice       to   vacate   the   association's\n\noffices at Scarborough, despite a 1996 contract requiring Davric\n\nto   provide    the     MHHA   with      office     space    there.        Rancourt\n\nsubsequently filed suit against Davric on behalf of the MHHA,\n\nalleging wrongful eviction, conversion of MHHA property, and\n\nassault against Ronco.            The wrongful eviction and conversion\n\nclaims   were   submitted        to   arbitration      pursuant    to      the   1996\n\ncontract, and the arbitrator found in favor of the MHHA.                          The\n\nevidence suggests that the assault claim remains pending.\n\n          Davric's summary judgment evidence further suggests\n\nthat the defendants have continued to pursue business interests\n\n\n\n     5\n     Davric was granted racing dates, but as a condition, the\nCommission imposed restrictions on Ricci's involvement with\nScarborough's management.\n     6\n     No evidence presented, however, links this \"boycott\" to any\nScarborough competitor.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fadverse to Davric's in furtherance of the purported conspiracy.\n\nFor instance during 1994, Cianchette apparently negotiated with\n\nthird parties to establish a new racing location in Southern\n\nMaine.   In 1997, Rancourt urged horsemen to frequent racetracks\n\nother than Scarborough.             That year, with Rancourt's help, the\n\nMHHA formed a “Steering Committee” to investigate opportunities\n\nfor establishing a competitor track.                 Faucher was named to the\n\ncommittee, as was Cianchette's son.                 Rancourt then proposed to\n\nthe   Maine     legislature        measures      designed   to   facilitate       the\n\nformation of the new track.                 Later in 1997, these efforts\n\nresulted in the enactment of such legislation.\n\n            On June 24, 1998, based on the foregoing claims, Davric\n\nfiled    suit     in   federal       district      court    against     Rancourt,\n\nCianchette, Faucher, Joseph M. Molnar, and Ken Ronco.                          Davric\n\ncharged that the defendants had violated federal and state\n\nantitrust       laws   and     tortiously         interfered     with     Davric's\n\ncontractual      relations.          The    defendants      moved   for    summary\n\njudgment on all counts.             A magistrate judge recommended that\n\nsummary judgment be granted, and the district court concurred.\n\nDavric appeals.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n            We   review      the    grant   of    summary   judgment      de    novo,\n\nconstruing the record in the light most favorable to Davric and\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fresolving all reasonable inferences in its favor.                      See Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st\n\nCir.    1999).         Summary    judgment      is     appropriate     if   Davric's\n\nevidence     is       \"merely    colorable,       or     is   not    significantly\n\nprobative\"       to    conjure     a    genuine      issue    of    material   fact.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986)\n\n(citations omitted).            We will not “accept [Davric's] subjective\n\ncharacterizations         of     events,    unless      the   underlying       events\n\nthemselves are revealed.”              Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit\n\nUnion, 170 F.3d 37, 50 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Liberty Lobby,\n\n477 U.S. at 256; Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\nI.     Federal Antitrust Claims\n\n            Davric alleges, first, that the defendants' actions\n\nviolated section one of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1.    In support of this claim, Davric targets three classes of\n\nbehavior, which we address in turn.\n\n            A.          The Scarborough \"Boycott\"\n\n            The heart of Davric's claim is its contention that\n\nRancourt, Faucher, and Cianchette organized a boycott against\n\nScarborough.          The parties dispute whether such a boycott would\n\nbe per se invalid or subject to rule of reason review, see\n\nNorthwest Wholesale Stationers v. Pacific Stationery & Printing\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fCo., 472 U.S. 284, 298 (1985);         Klor's Inc. v. Broadway-Hale\n\nStores, 359 U.S. 207, 212 (1959), but we need not address this\n\nissue of antitrust law.    Whichever standard obtains, Davric has\n\nfailed to submit adequate evidence to establish a genuine issue\n\nof material fact.\n\n           The evidence regarding the MHHA boycott is presented\n\nalmost entirely via the affidavits submitted by Giuliano and\n\nseveral MHHA horsemen.    Giuliano testified as follows: In early\n\n1994, Faucher approached him and described various means whereby\n\nFaucher,   Cianchette,   and   several   partners   planned   to   wrest\n\ncontrol of Scarborough from Ricci.           Faucher later informed\n\nGiuliano that Cianchette had connections with the MHHA.            After\n\nwhat appears to have been a third conversation, during the\n\nsummer of 1994, Giuliano \"understood that [Faucher] wanted the\n\nMHHA to be able to cut off its members from supplying horses [to\n\nScarborough] without the risk that the lack of horses could be\n\nmade up through other horses which could have been brought . .\n\n.    by      the     [NEHHA]\"            (emphasis      added).\n\n           The remaining evidence is derived from the horsemen's\n\naffidavits: In late June or early July, 1996 -- some two years\n\nafter the conversations just described -- several MHHA members\n\nnoticed activity which suggested to them that certain MHHA\n\nleaders were trying to implement a boycott of Scarborough.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fStanley Whittemore and Gary Mosher, two trainers with the MHHA,\n\napparently asked various MHHA members to keep their horses out\n\nof Scarborough races.              But the horsemen's testimony regarding\n\nthe boycott does not in any way suggest that anyone other than\n\nhorsemen members of the MHHA was involved.\n\n           In light of the record evidence, there is no genuine\n\nissue of fact regarding a conspiracy among Davric's competitors\n\nto withhold horses from Scarborough.                  Davric can show only that\n\nGiuliano thought that Faucher would have liked to engineer a\n\nboycott in 1994 and that the MHHA tried to impose one on its own\n\nin 1996.     Davric thus has provided insufficient evidence of a\n\nlink between the defendants and the MHHA's actions in 1996.\n\n\"The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the\n\nplaintiff's      position       will    be     insufficient;       there    must    be\n\nevidence   on    which       the     jury    could    reasonably     find   for    the\n\nplaintiff.\"     Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252 (citations omitted).\n\nHere,   there    is     no    such    evidence,      and   summary   judgment      was\n\nproper.\n\n           B.         Defendants' Activities Before the Commission,\n                      the Legislature, and the Courts\n\n           Davric also alleges that the defendants' efforts before\n\nthe   Commission,       the    Maine    Legislature,        and   the   courts     are\n\nactionable      under    federal       and    state    antitrust     law.     These\n\nendeavors,      however,       are    protected       by   the    Noerr-Pennington\n\n                                            -9-\n\fantitrust immunity doctrine.            That doctrine, which derives from\n\nthe First Amendment's guarantee of \"the right . . . to petition\n\nthe government for redress of grievances,\" U.S. Const. amend. I,\n\nshields from antitrust liability entities who join together to\n\ninfluence government action -- even if they seek to restrain\n\ncompetition or to damage competitors.              See, e.g., United Mine\n\nWorkers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670 (1965); Eastern R.R.\n\nConference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 135-38 (1961);\n\nSandy River Nursing Care v. Aetna Cas., 985 F.2d 1138, 1141 (1st\n\nCir.    1993).      The   doctrine      applies   to    \"petitions\"      before\n\nlegislatures, administrative agencies, and courts.                   See, e.g.,\n\nOtter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 379-80\n\n(1973); California Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S.\n\n508, 510 (1972).          Even false statements presented to support\n\nsuch petitions are protected.             See, e.g., Pennington, 381 U.S.\n\nat 670.\n\n              Davric seeks refuge in the Noerr-Pennington doctrine's\n\n“sham” exception, which exempts a party's resort to governmental\n\nprocess from antitrust immunity when such resort is objectively\n\nbaseless      and   intended     only    to    burden   a    rival    with   the\n\ngovernmental decision-making process itself.                See, e.g., City of\n\nColumbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 380 (1991).\n\nBut    this    exception    is   unavailable      here,     because    it    only\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f“encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental\n\nprocess -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an\n\nanticompetitive weapon.”   Id.; see also Professional Real Estate\n\nInvestors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49,\n\n60-61 (1993).    Moreover, \"a successful 'effort to influence\n\ngovernmental action . . . certainly cannot be characterized as\n\na sham.'\" Id. at 58 (quoting Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v.\n\nIndian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 502 (1988)) (alteration in\n\noriginal).\n\n          In this case, it is apparent that the defendants sought\n\nto benefit from the outcomes of the processes at issue and that,\n\nin any case, they cannot be considered \"objectively baseless.\"\n\nFirst, the defendants' efforts to lobby the Commission and the\n\nlegislature were, in part, successful.   They therefore cannot be\n\nconsidered shams, and are immune from federal or state antitrust\n\nscrutiny.7   The litigation arising out of Davric's expulsion of\n\n\n     7Courts have differed as to whether the Noerr-Pennington\ndoctrine is a creature of the First Amendment, in which case it\nwould apply of its own force to state antitrust claims, or\nwhether it instead constitutes a mere interpretation of the\nSherman Act, in which case it would not necessarily apply to\nstate antitrust statutes that failed to mirror their federal\ncounterparts. Compare Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., 168\nF.3d 119 (3d Cir. 1999) (firmly establishing Noerr-Pennington as\nan outgrowth of the First Amendment), and Kottle v. Northwest\nKidney Ctrs., 146 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir. 1998) (same), with\nCardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Assoc., 208\nF.3d 885, 890 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"Antitrust cases that grant\nNoerr-Pennington immunity do so based upon both the Sherman Act\n\n                              -11-\n\fthe MHHA from Scarborough also satisfies the requirements for\n\nNoerr-Pennington immunity.           \"The existence of probable cause to\n\ninstitute     legal    proceedings         precludes   a    finding     that     an\n\nantitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation,\" and such\n\nprobable cause \"requires no more than a reasonable belief that\n\nthere    is   a    chance    that    a   claim   may   be   held   valid       upon\n\nadjudication.\"       Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at\n\n62-63.    Davric cannot prove that the MHHA or Ronco lacked such\n\na reasonable belief.          As noted above, an arbitrator who heard\n\nall but one of the claims against Davric found Davric liable on\n\neach of the claims it adjudicated, demonstrating that they were\n\nhardly baseless.            The remaining charge -- alleging assault\n\nagainst Ronco -- is apparently still pending, but in light of\n\nthe     evidence    presented       regarding    the   details     of   Ronco's\n\nexpulsion from Scarborough, we believe that Ronco, the MHHA, and\n\nRancourt certainly could have harbored a reasonable expectation\n\n\n\n\nand the right to petition.\"), and Coastal States Marketing, Inc.\nv. Hunt, 694 F.2d 1358, 1364-65 (5th Cir. 1983) (\"Noerr was\nbased on a construction of the Sherman Act. It was not a first\namendment decision.\").   We need not address this controversy\nbecause \"Maine antitrust statutes parallel the Sherman Act\" and\nare analyzed pursuant to federal antitrust doctrine. Tri-State\nRubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1081\n(1st Cir. 1993).     Thus, regardless of whether the Noerr-\nPennington protections are constitutional or statutory in\nnature, they will apply with equal force to Davric's claims\nunder state and federal antitrust law.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fof success on the merits of that charge.                 The MHHA litigation,\n\ntherefore, also is immune from antitrust scrutiny.8\n\n            C.          Defendants' Attempts To Secure Foreclosure on\n                        Ricci's Mortgage\n\n            Davric also argues that the defendants' attempt to take\n\nadvantage     of       contacts   with    Ricci's     banker     to    effect    a\n\nforeclosure        on    the   Scarborough     mortgage        constituted      an\n\nactionable violation of antitrust law.              Like the district court,\n\nwe see inadequate evidence to support this contention.\n\n            To prevail with respect to this claim, Davric would\n\nhave to demonstrate that it suffered antitrust injury as a\n\nresult   of      the    defendants'      attempt    to   have    the    mortgage\n\nforeclosed.      See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429\n\nU.S. 477, 484-89 (1977); Caribe BMW, Inc. v. Bayerische Motoren\n\nWerke Aktiengesellschaft, 19 F.3d 745, 752 (1st Cir. 1994); CVD,\n\n\n    8 Davric's papers also allude to a separate suit in which\nRancourt represented a creditor of Giuliano's. It is unclear\nhow   litigation against Giuliano, who is not a party to this\ncase, could ground an antitrust claim set forth by Davric alone,\nbut even if it could, this litigation is also protected by\nNoerr-Pennington. As Giuliano concedes, that suit resulted in\na judgment against him.    It thus does not matter whether, as\nDavric suggests, Rancourt pursued the matter more vigorously\nthan he otherwise might have due to animosity toward Giuliano.\nCf. City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 380 (labeling a party's\nmotives in pursuing petition \"irrelevant\").      The successful\nlitigation did not lack an objective basis, and therefore was\nnot a sham under Noerr-Pennington. See, e.g., Professional Real\nEstate Investors, 508 U.S. at 60 (\"Only if a challenged\nlitigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the\nlitigant's subjective motivation.\").\n\n                                      -13-\n\fInc. v. Raytheon Co., 769 F.2d 842, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1985).                But\n\nDavric    appears   unable   to   demonstrate     any    injury     at    all.\n\nAccording to Davric's own evidence -- presented in Giuliano's\n\naffidavit -- Faucher told Giuliano that the planned attempt to\n\nforce a foreclosure had failed.        Davric submitted no evidence of\n\nany   actual     foreclosure.        Indeed,   Ricci    admitted    at     his\n\ndeposition that he had not even approached Key Bank to determine\n\nwhether    any   attempt   ever   actually     was     made   to   effect     a\n\nforeclosure.     Further, at his deposition, Cianchette denied ever\n\ndiscussing Ricci or Scarborough with Key Bank personnel.                 In the\n\nabsence of any antitrust injury stemming from the defendants'\n\npurported attempt to have the Key Bank foreclose on the track's\n\nmortgage, summary judgment on this claim was appropriate.\n\nII.   Maine Antitrust Claims\n\n           Davric also claims that the defendants violated Maine's\n\nantitrust laws.     See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1101 et seq.\n\nThe   Maine    statute   prohibits    \"[e]very   contract,     combination\n\n. . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce,\" id.\n\n§ 1101, and provides that \"[w]hoever shall monopolize or attempt\n\nto monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fpersons to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of this\n\nState shall be guilty of a Class C crime,\" id. § 1102.9\n\n          As described at length above, Davric cannot prevail on\n\nits   conspiracy-based    claims.     Davric's   flawed   arguments\n\nconcerning the alleged boycott, the defendants' attempts to\n\ninterfere with Scarborough's mortgage, and their efforts before\n\nthe Commission, the Maine legislature, and the courts similarly\n\ndoom any recovery under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1101.\n\nMoreover, Davric concedes that the defendants have not actually\n\nmonopolized its market pursuant to § 1102.       In fact, Davric's\n\nbrief strongly suggests that it remains the dominant player in\n\nthe appropriate market:\n\n          Of the $18 million wagered on live racing in\n          Maine in 1993, $10.8 million was wagered at\n          Scarborough Downs.     No other facilities\n          offer the racing opportunities and purses\n          available   at  Scarborough   Downs.     For\n          decades, Scarborough Downs had been the\n          principal extended racing meet in the State\n          of Maine and since the late 1980s it had\n          been the only such facility in Central or\n          Southern Maine.\n\nFurther, as Davric notes, \"a new track would first have to\n\noperate for two consecutive years in order to qualify for a\n\nshare of the off-track betting . . . revenue.\"\n\n\n\n      9\n     Despite the use of the word \"crime,\" the Maine statute\nexplicitly permits \"any person\" to seek redress for a violation.\nSee Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1104.\n\n                               -15-\n\f           The only remaining question, then, is whether Davric\n\ncan demonstrate that the defendants attempted to monopolize any\n\nparticular market.          We have noted that the \"Maine antitrust\n\nstatutes parallel the Sherman Act,\" and thus have analyzed\n\nclaims   thereunder        according    to    the    doctrines    developed     in\n\nrelation to federal law.           Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v.               Waste\n\nManagement, Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1081 (1st Cir. 1993).                      Those\n\ndoctrines justify summary judgment in this case.                 \"[A] plaintiff\n\ncharging       attempted    monopolization       must    prove    a    dangerous\n\nprobability      of   actual    monopolization,         which    has    generally\n\nrequired a definition of the relevant market and examination of\n\nmarket power.\"        Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S.\n\n447, 455 (1993) (emphasis added); see also Springfield Terminal\n\nRy. Co. v. Canadian Pac. Ltd., 133 F.3d 103, 107-08 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)    (recognizing       requirement       that   plaintiff     who    alleges\n\nattempted monopolization must demonstrate defendant's market\n\npower    and    \"dangerous     probability      of    success\");       George   R.\n\nWhitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., 508 F.2d 547,\n\n550 (1st Cir. 1974) (\"[W]e . . . think that [an attempted\n\nmonopolization] case, like a monopolization case, requires a\n\ndefinition of the relevant market.\").                   Davric, however, has\n\nfailed to set forth any evidence establishing power in any\n\nparticular geographic or product-based market, and certainly has\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fnot produced evidence suggesting a \"dangerous probability\" of\n\nmonopolization.    On the contrary, the most Davric can show is\n\nthat for a period of several days, it was forced to run fewer\n\nraces than it otherwise would have.         Because Davric has provided\n\nnot even \"a scintilla of evidence in support of [its] position,\"\n\nLiberty   Lobby,   477   U.S.   at   252,    summary   judgment   on   its\n\nattempted monopolization claim was proper.\n\nIII.   Tortious Interference Claims\n\n          Finally, Davric contends that a jury might have found\n\nthat the defendants tortiously interfered with relations both\n\nbetween   Davric   and   the    horsemen     and   between   Davric    and\n\nadministrative authorities.       In Maine, \"[i]nterference with an\n\nadvantageous relationship requires the existence of a valid\n\ncontract or prospective economic advantage, interference with\n\nthat contract or advantage through fraud or intimidation, and\n\ndamages proximately caused by the interference.\"              Barnes v.\n\nZappia, 658 A.2d 1086, 1090 (Me. 1995); see also DiPietro v.\n\nCasco N. Bank, 490 A.2d 215, 219 (Me. 1985); MacKerron v.\n\nMadura, 445 A.2d 680, 683 (Me. 1982); Harmon v. Harmon, 404 A.2d\n\n1020, 1025 (Me. 1979).\n\n          Davric's assertion of tortious interference cannot\n\nsurvive summary judgment. Although Davric declares conclusorily\n\nthat the defendants impeded its relationship with \"horsemen and\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fhorsemen groups\" and with the Commission, it nowhere explains\n\nspecifically     how    the        defendants'     conduct      affected      those\n\nrelationships.         It    has    produced     no   evidence       of    fraud    or\n\nintimidation directed at either the MHHA or the Commission, and\n\nwhile it claims that the defendants attempted to intimidate\n\nNEHHA president Giuliano, it concedes that Giuliano refused to\n\nalter that organization's relationship with Scarborough.                       This\n\nconcession precludes the requisite showing of damages.                             All\n\nDavric has provided us with, then, is innuendo and conjecture.\n\nAs noted above, we will not “accept the nonmovant's subjective\n\ncharacterizations       of    events,     unless      the    underlying      events\n\nthemselves are revealed.”              Simas, 170 F.3d at 50.               Summary\n\njudgment   therefore        was    appropriate    with      regard    to   Davric's\n\ntortious interference claims.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f",

Cianchette, and William Faucher (the \"defendants\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Davric contends that a fact-finder reasonably could conclude that the defendants violated federal and state antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with its contractual relations. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph J. Ricci owns a holding company which owns Davric. Davric, in turn, owns and operates Scarborough Downs (\"Scarborough\"), a harness racetrack in Scarborough, Maine. Scarborough hosts races, which attract horses and gamblers from Maine and other states, and also simulcasts other tracks' races. The facility is subject to regulation by Maine's Harness Racing Commission (the \"Commission\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric alleges that in 1994, several individuals, including defendants Cianchette, Faucher, and Rancourt, conspired to destroy Scarborough's business in order to establish a new dominant track or to facilitate a takeover of Scarborough. Cianchette owned a stake in the only other racetrack in Maine, Faucher was Director of Operations for Foxboro Park in Massachusetts, and Rancourt was an attorney who represented the Maine Harness Horsemen's Association (\"MHHA\") in dealings with Scarborough. The MHHA, as well as the New England Harness Horsemen's Association (\"NEHHA\"), supplied the horses that raced at Scarborough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we believe that summary judgment in the defendants' favor was fully warranted, we review Davric's record evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to it. The following inferences are supportable: In 1994, the defendants agreed that they would act in concert to undermine Scarborough's business and to wrest control of harness racing in southern Maine from Davric. In early 1994, defendant Faucher spoke of these efforts with Lou Giuliano, the president of the NEHHA, and solicited Giuliano's help.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Faucher informed Giuliano that he and several partners intended to bring about the foreclosure of a mortgage Ricci had taken on Scarborough. Some time later, Faucher told Giuliano that this plan had failed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that the anti-Davric group now planned either (1) to persuade the Commission to deny race dates to Scarborough or (2) to \"bury [Ricci] in the [Maine] legislature.\" According to Giuliano, after this conversation, he also \"understood\" that Faucher intended the MHHA to be able to prevent its members from supplying horses to Scarborough without other organizations, such as the NEHHA, filling the resulting void.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giuliano opted not to participate in the defendants' plans. Representing the MHHA at a public hearing in late 1994, Rancourt urged that Scarborough be denied racing dates for 1995. The NEHHA did not follow the MHHA's lead, and Giuliano in fact testified in favor of race dates for Scarborough. Rancourt, Cianchette and Faucher all attended this hearing. Immediately following the hearing, Rancourt and Giuliano became involved in a verbal altercation concerning Giuliano's testimony favorable to Davric.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June or July of 1996, approximately two years after the conversations between Faucher and Giuliano, MHHA leaders apparently tried to force member horsemen to boycott Scarborough.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As a result, for several days, Davric ran fewer races than it ordinarily would have run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1997, the MHHA's Executive Secretary, Ken Ronco, was served with notice to vacate the association's offices at Scarborough, despite a 1996 contract requiring Davric to provide the MHHA with office space there. Rancourt subsequently filed suit against Davric on behalf of the MHHA, alleging wrongful eviction, conversion of MHHA property, and assault against Ronco. The wrongful eviction and conversion claims were submitted to arbitration pursuant to the 1996 contract, and the arbitrator found in favor of the MHHA. The evidence suggests that the assault claim remains pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric's summary judgment evidence further suggests that the defendants have continued to pursue business interests adverse to Davric's in furtherance of the purported conspiracy. For instance during 1994, Cianchette apparently negotiated with third parties to establish a new racing location in Southern Maine. In 1997, Rancourt urged horsemen to frequent racetracks other than Scarborough. That year, with Rancourt's help, the MHHA formed a \"Steering Committee\" to investigate opportunities for establishing a competitor track. Faucher was named to the committee, as was Cianchette's son. Rancourt then proposed to the Maine legislature measures designed to facilitate the formation of the new track. Later in 1997, these efforts resulted in the enactment of such legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 24, 1998, based on the foregoing claims, Davric filed suit in federal district court against Rancourt, Cianchette, Faucher, Joseph M. Molnar, and Ken Ronco. Davric charged that the defendants had violated federal and state antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with Davric's contractual relations. The defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. A magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted, and the district court concurred. Davric appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to Davric and resolving all reasonable inferences in its favor. See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999). Summary judgment is appropriate if Davric's evidence is \"merely colorable, or is not significantly probative\" to conjure a genuine issue of material fact. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986) (citations omitted). We will not \"accept [Davric's] subjective characterizations of events, unless the underlying events themselves are revealed.\" Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 50 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 256; Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Federal Antitrust Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric alleges, first, that the defendants' actions violated section one of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1. In support of this claim, Davric targets three classes of behavior, which we address in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Scarborough \"Boycott\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The heart of Davric's claim is its contention that Rancourt, Faucher, and Cianchette organized a boycott against Scarborough. The parties dispute whether such a boycott would be per se invalid or subject to rule of reason review, see Northwest Wholesale Stationers v. Pacific Stationery &amp; Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 298 (1985); Klor's Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 212 (1959), but we need not address this issue of antitrust law. Whichever standard obtains, Davric has failed to submit adequate evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence regarding the MHHA boycott is presented almost entirely via the affidavits submitted by Giuliano and several MHHA horsemen. Giuliano testified as follows: In early 1994, Faucher approached him and described various means whereby Faucher, Cianchette, and several partners planned to wrest control of Scarborough from Ricci. Faucher later informed Giuliano that Cianchette had connections with the MHHA. After what appears to have been a third conversation, during the summer of 1994, Giuliano \"understood that [Faucher] wanted the MHHA to be able to cut off its members from supplying horses [to Scarborough] without the risk that the lack of horses could be made up through other horses which could have been brought... by the [NEHHA]\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining evidence is derived from the horsemen's affidavits: In late June or early July, 1996 -- some two years after the conversations just described -- several MHHA members noticed activity which suggested to them that certain MHHA leaders were trying to implement a boycott of Scarborough. Stanley Whittemore and Gary Mosher, two trainers with the MHHA, apparently asked various MHHA members to keep their horses out of Scarborough races. But the horsemen's testimony regarding the boycott does not in any way suggest that anyone other than horsemen members of the MHHA was involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the record evidence, there is no genuine issue of fact regarding a conspiracy among Davric's competitors to withhold horses from Scarborough. Davric can show only that Giuliano thought that Faucher would have liked to engineer a boycott in 1994 and that the MHHA tried to impose one on its own in 1996. Davric thus has provided insufficient evidence of a link between the defendants and the MHHA's actions in 1996. \"The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\" Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252 (citations omitted). Here, there is no such evidence, and summary judgment was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Defendants' Activities Before the Commission, the Legislature, and the Courts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric also alleges that the defendants' efforts before the Commission, the Maine Legislature, and the courts are actionable under federal and state antitrust law. These endeavors, however, are protected by the Noerr-Pennington antitrust immunity doctrine. That doctrine, which derives from the First Amendment's guarantee of \"the right... to petition the government for redress of grievances,\" U.S. Const. amend. I, shields from antitrust liability entities who join together to influence government action -- even if they seek to restrain competition or to damage competitors. See, e.g., United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670 (1965); Eastern R.R. Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 135-38 (1961); Sandy River Nursing Care v. Aetna Cas., 985 F.2d 1138, 1141 (1st Cir. 1993). The doctrine applies to \"petitions\" before legislatures, administrative agencies, and courts. See, e.g., Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 379-80 (1973); California Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510 (1972). Even false statements presented to support such petitions are protected. See, e.g., Pennington, 381 U.S. at 670.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric seeks refuge in the Noerr-Pennington doctrine's \"sham\" exception, which exempts a party's resort to governmental process from antitrust immunity when such resort is objectively baseless and intended only to burden a rival with the governmental decision-making process itself. See, e.g., City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 380 (1991). But this exception is unavailable here, because it only \"encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental process -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an anticompetitive weapon.\" Id.; see also Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60-61 (1993). Moreover, \"a successful 'effort to influence governmental action... certainly cannot be characterized as a sham.'\" Id. at 58 (quoting Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 502 (1988)) (alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it is apparent that the defendants sought to benefit from the outcomes of the processes at issue and that, in any case, they cannot be considered \"objectively baseless.\" First, the defendants' efforts to lobby the Commission and the legislature were, in part, successful. They therefore cannot be considered shams, and are immune from federal or state antitrust scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The litigation arising out of Davric's expulsion of the MHHA from Scarborough also satisfies the requirements for Noerr-Pennington immunity. \"The existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation,\" and such probable cause \"requires no more than a reasonable belief that there is a chance that a claim may be held valid upon adjudication.\" Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 62-63. Davric cannot prove that the MHHA or Ronco lacked such a reasonable belief. As noted above, an arbitrator who heard all but one of the claims against Davric found Davric liable on each of the claims it adjudicated, demonstrating that they were hardly baseless. The remaining charge -- alleging assault against Ronco -- is apparently still pending, but in light of the evidence presented regarding the details of Ronco's expulsion from Scarborough, we believe that Ronco, the MHHA, and Rancourt certainly could have harbored a reasonable expectation of success on the merits of that charge. The MHHA litigation, therefore, also is immune from antitrust scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Defendants' Attempts To Secure Foreclosure on Ricci's Mortgage</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric also argues that the defendants' attempt to take advantage of contacts with Ricci's banker to effect a foreclosure on the Scarborough mortgage constituted an actionable violation of antitrust law. Like the district court, we see inadequate evidence to support this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail with respect to this claim, Davric would have to demonstrate that it suffered antitrust injury as a result of the defendants' attempt to have the mortgage foreclosed. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 484-89 (1977); Caribe BMW, Inc. v. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, 19 F.3d 745, 752 (1st Cir. 1994); CVD, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 769 F.2d 842, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1985). But Davric appears unable to demonstrate any injury at all. According to Davric's own evidence -- presented in Giuliano's affidavit -- Faucher told Giuliano that the planned attempt to force a foreclosure had failed. Davric submitted no evidence of any actual foreclosure. Indeed, Ricci admitted at his deposition that he had not even approached Key Bank to determine whether any attempt ever actually was made to effect a foreclosure. Further, at his deposition, Cianchette denied ever discussing Ricci or Scarborough with Key Bank personnel. In the absence of any antitrust injury stemming from the defendants' purported attempt to have the Key Bank foreclose on the track's mortgage, summary judgment on this claim was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Maine Antitrust Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric also claims that the defendants violated Maine's antitrust laws. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 1101 et seq. The Maine statute prohibits \"[e]very contract, combination..., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce,\" id. &#167; 1101, and provides that \"[w]hoever shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of this State shall be guilty of a Class C crime,\" id. &#167; 1102.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As described at length above, Davric cannot prevail on its conspiracy-based claims. Davric's flawed arguments concerning the alleged boycott, the defendants' attempts to interfere with Scarborough's mortgage, and their efforts before the Commission, the Maine legislature, and the courts similarly doom any recovery under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 1101. Moreover, Davric concedes that the defendants have not actually monopolized its market pursuant to &#167; 1102. In fact, Davric's brief strongly suggests that it remains the dominant player in the appropriate market:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Of the $18 million wagered on live racing in Maine in 1993, $10.8 million was wagered at Scarborough Downs. No other facilities offer the racing opportunities and purses available at Scarborough Downs. For decades, Scarborough Downs had been the principal extended racing meet in the State of Maine and since the late 1980s it had been the only such facility in Central or Southern Maine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, as Davric notes, \"a new track would first have to operate for two consecutive years in order to qualify for a share of the off-track betting... revenue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining question, then, is whether Davric can demonstrate that the defendants attempted to monopolize any particular market. We have noted that the \"Maine antitrust statutes parallel the Sherman Act,\" and thus have analyzed claims thereunder according to the doctrines developed in relation to federal law. Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1081 (1st Cir. 1993). Those doctrines justify summary judgment in this case. \"[A] plaintiff charging attempted monopolization must prove a dangerous probability of actual monopolization, which has generally required a definition of the relevant market and examination of market power.\" Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 455 (1993) (emphasis added); see also Springfield Terminal Ry. Co. v. Canadian Pac. Ltd., 133 F.3d 103, 107-08 (1st Cir. 1997) (recognizing requirement that plaintiff who alleges attempted monopolization must demonstrate defendant's market power and \"dangerous probability of success\"); George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., 508 F.2d 547, 550 (1st Cir. 1974) (\"[W]e... think that [an attempted monopolization] case, like a monopolization case, requires a definition of the relevant market.\"). Davric, however, has failed to set forth any evidence establishing power in any particular geographic or product-based market, and certainly has not produced evidence suggesting a \"dangerous probability\" of monopolization. On the contrary, the most Davric can show is that for a period of several days, it was forced to run fewer races than it otherwise would have. Because Davric has provided not even \"a scintilla of evidence in support of [its] position,\" Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252, summary judgment on its attempted monopolization claim was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Tortious Interference Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Davric contends that a jury might have found that the defendants tortiously interfered with relations both between Davric and the horsemen and between Davric and administrative authorities. In Maine, \"[i]nterference with an advantageous relationship requires the existence of a valid contract or prospective economic advantage, interference with that contract or advantage through fraud or intimidation, and damages proximately caused by the interference.\" Barnes v. Zappia, 658 A.2d 1086, 1090 (Me. 1995); see also DiPietro v. Casco N. Bank, 490 A.2d 215, 219 (Me. 1985); MacKerron v. Madura, 445 A.2d 680, 683 (Me. 1982); Harmon v. Harmon, 404 A.2d 1020, 1025 (Me. 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric's assertion of tortious interference cannot survive summary judgment. Although Davric declares conclusorily that the defendants impeded its relationship with \"horsemen and horsemen groups\" and with the Commission, it nowhere explains specifically how the defendants' conduct affected those relationships. It has produced no evidence of fraud or intimidation directed at either the MHHA or the Commission, and while it claims that the defendants attempted to intimidate NEHHA president Giuliano, it concedes that Giuliano refused to alter that organization's relationship with Scarborough. This concession precludes the requisite showing of damages. All Davric has provided us with, then, is innuendo and conjecture. As noted above, we will not \"accept the non-movant's subjective characterizations of events, unless the underlying events themselves are revealed.\" Simas, 170 F.3d at 50. Summary judgment therefore was appropriate with regard to Davric's tortious interference claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Two other individuals were named as defendants and granted summary judgment, but Davric's appeal as to these defendants has been dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The lower court excluded from its consideration much of the evidence regarding Faucher's statements to Giuliano, on the ground that this evidence, which was presented via Giuliano's affidavit and deposition testimony, constituted hearsay.

Compare Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., 168 F.3d 119 (3d Cir. 1999) (firmly establishing Noerr-Pennington as an outgrowth of the First Amendment), and Kottle v. Northwest Kidney Ctrs., 146 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir. 1998) (same), with Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Assoc., 208 F.3d 885, 890 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"Antitrust cases that grant Noerr-Pennington immunity do so based upon both the Sherman Act and the right to petition.\"), and Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, 694 F.2d 1358, 1364-65 (5th Cir. 1983) (\"Noerr was based on a construction of the Sherman Act. It was not a first amendment decision.\"). We need not address this controversy because \"Maine antitrust statutes parallel the Sherman Act\" and are analyzed pursuant to federal antitrust doctrine. Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1081 (1st Cir. 1993). Thus, regardless of whether the Noerr-Pennington protections are constitutional or statutory in nature, they will apply with equal force to Davric's claims under state and federal antitrust law.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Davric's papers also allude to a separate suit in which Rancourt represented a creditor of Giuliano's. It is unclear how litigation against Giuliano, who is not a party to this case, could ground an antitrust claim set forth by Davric alone, but even if it could, this litigation is also protected by Noerr-Pennington. As Giuliano concedes, that suit resulted in a judgment against him. It thus does not matter whether, as Davric suggests, Rancourt pursued the matter more vigorously than he otherwise might have due to animosity toward Giuliano. Cf. City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 380 (labeling a party's motives in pursuing petition \"irrelevant\"). The successful litigation did not lack an objective basis, and therefore was not a sham under Noerr-Pennington.

Cianchette, and William Faucher (the \"defendants\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Davric contends that a fact-finder reasonably could conclude that the defendants violated federal and state antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with its contractual relations. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph J. Ricci owns a holding company which owns Davric. Davric, in turn, owns and operates Scarborough Downs (\"Scarborough\"), a harness racetrack in Scarborough, Maine. Scarborough hosts races, which attract horses and gamblers from Maine and other states, and also simulcasts other tracks' races. The facility is subject to regulation by Maine's Harness Racing Commission (the \"Commission\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric alleges that in 1994, several individuals, including defendants Cianchette, Faucher, and Rancourt, conspired to destroy Scarborough's business in order to establish a new dominant track or to facilitate a takeover of Scarborough. Cianchette owned a stake in the only other racetrack in Maine, Faucher was Director of Operations for Foxboro Park in Massachusetts, and Rancourt was an attorney who represented the Maine Harness Horsemen's Association (\"MHHA\") in dealings with Scarborough. The MHHA, as well as the New England Harness Horsemen's Association (\"NEHHA\"), supplied the horses that raced at Scarborough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we believe that summary judgment in the defendants' favor was fully warranted, we review Davric's record evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to it. The following inferences are supportable: In 1994, the defendants agreed that they would act in concert to undermine Scarborough's business and to wrest control of harness racing in southern Maine from Davric. In early 1994, defendant Faucher spoke of these efforts with Lou Giuliano, the president of the NEHHA, and solicited Giuliano's help.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Faucher informed Giuliano that he and several partners intended to bring about the foreclosure of a mortgage Ricci had taken on Scarborough. Some time later, Faucher told Giuliano that this plan had failed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that the anti-Davric group now planned either (1) to persuade the Commission to deny race dates to Scarborough or (2) to \"bury [Ricci] in the [Maine] legislature.\" According to Giuliano, after this conversation, he also \"understood\" that Faucher intended the MHHA to be able to prevent its members from supplying horses to Scarborough without other organizations, such as the NEHHA, filling the resulting void.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giuliano opted not to participate in the defendants' plans. Representing the MHHA at a public hearing in late 1994, Rancourt urged that Scarborough be denied racing dates for 1995. The NEHHA did not follow the MHHA's lead, and Giuliano in fact testified in favor of race dates for Scarborough. Rancourt, Cianchette and Faucher all attended this hearing. Immediately following the hearing, Rancourt and Giuliano became involved in a verbal altercation concerning Giuliano's testimony favorable to Davric.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June or July of 1996, approximately two years after the conversations between Faucher and Giuliano, MHHA leaders apparently tried to force member horsemen to boycott Scarborough.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As a result, for several days, Davric ran fewer races than it ordinarily would have run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1997, the MHHA's Executive Secretary, Ken Ronco, was served with notice to vacate the association's offices at Scarborough, despite a 1996 contract requiring Davric to provide the MHHA with office space there. Rancourt subsequently filed suit against Davric on behalf of the MHHA, alleging wrongful eviction, conversion of MHHA property, and assault against Ronco. The wrongful eviction and conversion claims were submitted to arbitration pursuant to the 1996 contract, and the arbitrator found in favor of the MHHA. The evidence suggests that the assault claim remains pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric's summary judgment evidence further suggests that the defendants have continued to pursue business interests adverse to Davric's in furtherance of the purported conspiracy. For instance during 1994, Cianchette apparently negotiated with third parties to establish a new racing location in Southern Maine. In 1997, Rancourt urged horsemen to frequent racetracks other than Scarborough. That year, with Rancourt's help, the MHHA formed a \"Steering Committee\" to investigate opportunities for establishing a competitor track. Faucher was named to the committee, as was Cianchette's son. Rancourt then proposed to the Maine legislature measures designed to facilitate the formation of the new track. Later in 1997, these efforts resulted in the enactment of such legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 24, 1998, based on the foregoing claims, Davric filed suit in federal district court against Rancourt, Cianchette, Faucher, Joseph M. Molnar, and Ken Ronco. Davric charged that the defendants had violated federal and state antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with Davric's contractual relations. The defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. A magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted, and the district court concurred. Davric appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to Davric and resolving all reasonable inferences in its favor.

Whichever standard obtains, Davric has failed to submit adequate evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence regarding the MHHA boycott is presented almost entirely via the affidavits submitted by Giuliano and several MHHA horsemen. Giuliano testified as follows: In early 1994, Faucher approached him and described various means whereby Faucher, Cianchette, and several partners planned to wrest control of Scarborough from Ricci. Faucher later informed Giuliano that Cianchette had connections with the MHHA. After what appears to have been a third conversation, during the summer of 1994, Giuliano \"understood that [Faucher] wanted the MHHA to be able to cut off its members from supplying horses [to Scarborough] without the risk that the lack of horses could be made up through other horses which could have been brought... by the [NEHHA]\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining evidence is derived from the horsemen's affidavits: In late June or early July, 1996 -- some two years after the conversations just described -- several MHHA members noticed activity which suggested to them that certain MHHA leaders were trying to implement a boycott of Scarborough. Stanley Whittemore and Gary Mosher, two trainers with the MHHA, apparently asked various MHHA members to keep their horses out of Scarborough races. But the horsemen's testimony regarding the boycott does not in any way suggest that anyone other than horsemen members of the MHHA was involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the record evidence, there is no genuine issue of fact regarding a conspiracy among Davric's competitors to withhold horses from Scarborough. Davric can show only that Giuliano thought that Faucher would have liked to engineer a boycott in 1994 and that the MHHA tried to impose one on its own in 1996. Davric thus has provided insufficient evidence of a link between the defendants and the MHHA's actions in 1996. \"The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\" Liberty <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lobby,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">252</span> </a></span>(citations omitted).

These endeavors, however, are protected by the Noerr-Pennington antitrust immunity doctrine. That doctrine, which derives from the First Amendment's guarantee of \"the right... to petition the government for redress of grievances,\" U.S. Const. amend.

See, e.g., City of Columbia v.

They therefore cannot be considered shams, and are immune from federal or state antitrust scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The litigation arising out of Davric's expulsion of the MHHA from Scarborough also satisfies the requirements for Noerr-Pennington immunity. \"The existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation,\" and such probable cause \"requires no more than a reasonable belief that there is a chance that a claim may be held valid upon adjudication.\" Professional Real Estate <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112855\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Investors,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112855/professional-real-estate-investors-inc-v-columbia-pictures-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">62-63</span></a></span>. Davric cannot prove that the MHHA or Ronco lacked such a reasonable belief. As noted above, an arbitrator who heard all but one of the claims against Davric found Davric liable on each of the claims it adjudicated, demonstrating that they were hardly baseless. The remaining charge -- alleging assault against Ronco -- is apparently still pending, but in light of the evidence presented regarding the details of Ronco's expulsion from Scarborough, we believe that Ronco, the MHHA, and Rancourt certainly could have harbored a reasonable expectation of success on the merits of that charge. The MHHA litigation, therefore, also is immune from antitrust scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Like the district court, we see inadequate evidence to support this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail with respect to this claim, Davric would have to demonstrate that it suffered antitrust injury as a result of the defendants' attempt to have the mortgage foreclosed. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109586\"><a href=\"/opinion/109586/brunswick-corp-v-pueblo-bowl-o-mat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 484-89 (1977); Caribe BMW, Inc. v.

But Davric appears unable to demonstrate any injury at all. According to Davric's own evidence -- presented in Giuliano's affidavit -- Faucher told Giuliano that the planned attempt to force a foreclosure had failed. Davric submitted no evidence of any actual foreclosure. Indeed, Ricci admitted at his deposition that he had not even approached Key Bank to determine whether any attempt ever actually was made to effect a foreclosure. Further, at his deposition, Cianchette denied ever discussing Ricci or Scarborough with Key Bank personnel. In the absence of any antitrust injury stemming from the defendants' purported attempt to have the Key Bank foreclose on the track's mortgage, summary judgment on this claim was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Maine Antitrust Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davric also claims that the defendants violated Maine's antitrust laws. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 1101 et seq. The Maine statute prohibits \"[e]very contract, combination..., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce,\" id. &#167; 1101, and provides that \"[w]hoever shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of this State shall be guilty of a Class C crime,\" id. &#167; 1102.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As described at length above, Davric cannot prevail on its conspiracy-based claims. Davric's flawed arguments concerning the alleged boycott, the defendants' attempts to interfere with Scarborough's mortgage, and their efforts before the Commission, the Maine legislature, and the courts similarly doom any recovery under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 1101. Moreover, Davric concedes that the defendants have not actually monopolized its market pursuant to &#167; 1102. In fact, Davric's brief strongly suggests that it remains the dominant player in the appropriate market:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Of the $18 million wagered on live racing in Maine in 1993, $10.8 million was wagered at Scarborough Downs. No other facilities offer the racing opportunities and purses available at Scarborough Downs. For decades, Scarborough Downs had been the principal extended racing meet in the State of Maine and since the late 1980s it had been the only such facility in Central or Southern Maine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, as Davric notes, \"a new track would first have to operate for two consecutive years in order to qualify for a share of the off-track betting... revenue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining question, then, is whether Davric can demonstrate that the defendants attempted to monopolize any particular market. We have noted that the \"Maine antitrust statutes parallel the Sherman Act,\" and thus have analyzed claims thereunder according to the doctrines developed in relation to federal law. Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611561\"><a href=\"/opinion/611561/tri-state-rubbish-inc-v-waste-management-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1081 (1st Cir. 1993). Those doctrines justify summary judgment in this case. \"[A] plaintiff charging attempted monopolization must prove a dangerous probability of actual monopolization, which has generally required a definition of the relevant market and examination of market power.\" Spectrum Sports, Inc. v.

Davric, however, has failed to set forth any evidence establishing power in any particular geographic or product-based market, and certainly has not produced evidence suggesting a \"dangerous probability\" of monopolization. On the contrary, the most Davric can show is that for a period of several days, it was forced to run fewer races than it otherwise would have.

In Maine, \"[i]nterference with an advantageous relationship requires the existence of a valid contract or prospective economic advantage, interference with that contract or advantage through fraud or intimidation, and damages proximately caused by the interference.\" Barnes v.

Although Davric declares conclusorily that the defendants impeded its relationship with \"horsemen and horsemen groups\" and with the Commission, it nowhere explains specifically how the defendants' conduct affected those relationships. It has produced no evidence of fraud or intimidation directed at either the MHHA or the Commission, and while it claims that the defendants attempted to intimidate NEHHA president Giuliano, it concedes that Giuliano refused to alter that organization's relationship with Scarborough. This concession precludes the requisite showing of damages. All Davric has provided us with, then, is innuendo and conjecture. As noted above, we will not \"accept the non-movant's subjective characterizations of events, unless the underlying events themselves are revealed.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762262\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Simas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/762262/victor-e-simas-v-first-citizens-federal-credit-union-and-barbara-mw/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>.
