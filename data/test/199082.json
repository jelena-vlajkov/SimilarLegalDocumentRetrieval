This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform\n\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No.\n\n104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996), repeal the jurisdiction of\n\nthe federal district courts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 to\n\nreview      statutory   interpretation            and    constitutional     claims\n\nasserted by aliens convicted of one or more crimes specified in\n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") on a petition for a\n\nwrit   of    habeas   corpus.        We    have    previously      held   that   the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"),\n\nPub.   L.    No.   104-132,    110    Stat.       1214   (1996),    and   IIRIRA's\n\ntransition rules eliminated our jurisdiction to review on direct\n\nappeal a deportation order entered against an alien convicted of\n\ncertain crimes, see Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 117 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (construing IIRIRA transition rules); Kolster v. INS,\n\n101 F.3d 785, 786 (1st Cir. 1996) (construing AEDPA), but that\n\nneither AEDPA nor IIRIRA's transition rules revoked the district\n\ncourts' historical power pursuant to the general federal habeas\n\ncorpus statute to review statutory or constitutional challenges\n\nto immigration decisions, see Mattis v. Reno, 212 F.3d 31, 35\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fn.6 (1st Cir. 2000); Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 285 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 113.                     We hold today that\n\nIIRIRA's permanent rules likewise do not divest the federal\n\ncourts of their traditional jurisdiction to grant writs of\n\nhabeas corpus pursuant to § 2241.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              A   native   of     Trinidad    and   Tobago,    Soondar     Mahadeo\n\nimmigrated to the United States with his family twenty-six years\n\nago.       In 1984, and again in 1991, Mahadeo was convicted of\n\npossession        of   marijuana     with     intent   to     distribute;     each\n\nconviction constitutes an \"aggravated felony\" as defined by the\n\nINA.       See INA § 101(a)(43)(B); 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(B).1                 On\n\nMay 30, 1997, the INS commenced removal proceedings against\n\nMahadeo.      The immigration judge found him removable and ordered\n\nhim deported.\n\n              Mahadeo appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\"),       arguing     that    he   was    entitled       to   apply   for    a\n\ndiscretionary waiver of the removal order pursuant to former INA\n\n§ 212(c), as it stood before it was amended by AEDPA and\n\n\n       1  An \"aggravated felony\" falls in the category of crimes\nthat precludes judicial review under INA § 242(a)(2)(C), AEDPA\n§ 440(a), IIRIRA transition rule § 309(c)(4)(G), and IIRIRA\npermanent rule § 304(a), which adds new INA § 240A. We refer to\nthe aliens whose convictions place them within this category,\nsee infra note 4, variously as \"criminal aliens,\" or \"aliens\nwith a criminal conviction.\"\n\n                                        -3-\n\frepealed by IIRIRA.2   In particular, he argued that denying him\n\naccess to former INA § 212(c) would violate the presumption\n\nagainst retroactivity in statutory interpretation because his\n\nconvictions pre-dated the enactment of AEDPA and IIRIRA.   In the\n\nalternative, Mahadeo asserted that retroactive application of\n\nIIRIRA's repeal of § 212(c) relief would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe BIA rejected Mahadeo's arguments.\n\n         Mahadeo then petitioned the district court for habeas\n\ncorpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, contending that the\n\n\n\n    2     Before AEDPA amended § 212(c) in 1996, it provided in\nrelevant part:\n\n    Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence . .\n    . who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished\n    domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted\n    in the discretion of the Attorney General. . . . The\n    first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to\n    an alien who has been convicted of one or more\n    aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or\n    felonies a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.\n\nCodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995). The second sentence does\nnot apply to Mahadeo because he did not serve five years for\neither of his felony convictions. Despite the literal language\nof § 212(c), which speaks only of aliens \"returning,\" it had\nbeen construed to apply not only to aliens seeking discretionary\nrelief from exclusion, but also to aliens, like Mahadeo, seeking\ndiscretionary relief from deportation. See Joseph v. INS, 909\nF.2d 605, 606 n.1 (1st Cir. 1990); Francis v. INS, 532 F.2d 268,\n273 (2d Cir. 1976). IIRIRA's permanent rules repeal § 212(c)\nentirely, replacing it with a new discretionary relief\nprovision, see IIRIRA § 304(a) (adding INA § 240A, codified at\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b (authorizing the INS to \"cancel\" removal in\ncertain circumstances, but not when an alien has been convicted\nof an \"aggravated felony\")).\n\n                               -4-\n\fBIA erred in concluding that it lacked the authority to consider\n\nhis request for discretionary relief pursuant to former INA §\n\n212(c).    He reiterated both his constitutional arguments and his\n\nstatutory interpretation challenge premised on the presumption\n\nagainst retroactivity.     The district court did not address the\n\nmerits of Mahadeo's petition because it concluded that IIRIRA's\n\npermanent    rules   revoked   the   subject    matter   jurisdiction   of\n\nfederal district courts to entertain § 2241 petitions brought by\n\naliens seeking review of immigration proceedings.            Mahadeo now\n\nappeals.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            Although the parties agree that IIRIRA's permanent\n\nrules govern Mahadeo's removal proceedings, we think it is\n\nuseful for the analysis that follows to explain why that is so.\n\nCongress enacted AEPDA in April 1996.          Among other things, AEDPA\n\nexpanded the category of criminal convictions that would render\n\nan alien ineligible to apply for § 212(c) discretionary relief.3\n\n\n    3     AEDPA § 440 replaced the prohibition on discretionary\nrelief for aliens \"convicted of one or more aggravated\nfelonies,\" with a prohibition on such relief for aliens\n\"deportable by reason of having committed any criminal offense\ncovered in section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated felony],\n(B)[controlled substance], (C)[certain firearm offenses], or (D)\n[miscellaneous national security or defense crimes], or any\noffense covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) [multiple criminal\nconvictions] for which both predicate offenses are covered by\nsection 241(a)(2)(A)(i) [crimes of moral turpitide].\" In Almon\nv. Reno, 192 F.3d 28, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1999), we concluded that\n\n                                     -5-\n\fSignificantly, for criminal aliens like Mahadeo, AEDPA § 440(d)\n\nmade all \"aggravated felons\" ineligible for relief, even if the\n\nalien had not been required to serve a \"term of imprisonment of\n\nat least 5 years.\"    Compare INA § 212(c) (1995) (pre-AEDPA) with\n\nINA § 212(c), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1997) (post-AEDPA).      Just a\n\nfew months after Congress enacted AEDPA, it enacted IIRIRA,\n\naltering the immigration laws yet again.       IIRIRA's permanent\n\nrules repealed former INA § 212(c) and created a new form of\n\ndiscretionary relief, \"cancellation of removal.\"     See IIRIRA §\n\n304 (adding new INA § 240A, codified at 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229b (West\n\nSupp. 1998)).   \"Cancellation,\" like § 212(c) relief both before\n\nand after AEDPA's amendments, is not available to aliens whose\n\ncriminal convictions qualify as \"aggravated felonies.\"         See\n\nIIRIRA § 304(a).     Like the AEDPA amendments, the \"cancellation\"\n\nprovision continues to make all aggravated felons ineligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief, irrespective of whether the alien was\n\nrequired to serve five years in prison.4    Having been convicted\n\nof an aggravated felony, Mahadeo is ineligible for cancellation\n\nof removal.\n\n\n§ 440(d)'s   limitation on access to discretionary relief for\n\"deportable,\" but not \"excludable,\" aliens did not violate equal\nprotection.\n    4     In addition, both AEDPA and IIRIRA expanded          the\ndefinition of \"aggravated felony\" to encompass more crimes.    See\nAEDPA § 440(e); IIRIRA § 321.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f             IIRIRA provided for a phase-in period during which\n\ndeportation proceedings would be governed by transition rules.\n\nSee IIRIRA § 309(c)(4).             The transition rules treat aliens as\n\nsubject to the judicial review provisions contained in former\n\nINA § 106, 8 U.S.C. § 1105a (1994), as modified by AEDPA, but\n\nnot     as   further    modified       by    IIRIRA       except      for     certain\n\ntransitional        changes,    see     IIRIRA       §§    309(a),       309(c)(1),\n\n309(c)(4); see also Wallace, 194 F.3d at 283; Prado v. Reno, 198\n\nF.3d 286, 288 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999).               One IIRIRA rule included in\n\nthe transition regime was new INA § 242(g), see IIRIRA § 306(c),\n\nwhich     strips     courts    of    jurisdiction         to   review         certain\n\nimmigration actions except as provided in INA § 242, 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252.    See Reno v. American Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525\n\nU.S. 471, 482 (1999).           Significantly for the jurisdictional\n\nissue in this case, IIRIRA's permanent rules add to INA § 242(g)\n\nseveral      new   jurisdiction-stripping           provisions.         See    INA   §\n\n242(a)(1) (providing that \"review of a final order of removal .\n\n. . is governed only by [the Administrative Procedures Act\n\n(\"APA\")]\"); INA § 242(b)(9) (consolidating judicial review of\n\nimmigration        decisions   in     INA    §   242);     INA   §    242(a)(2)(C)\n\n(limiting the availability of judicial review for aliens ordered\n\nremoved for specified categories of criminal convictions).\n\n             IIRIRA's     transition        rules     apply      to     deportation\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fproceedings       commenced     before       April    1,    1997;   proceedings\n\ncommenced    on    or   after   that     date   are     governed    by    IIRIRA's\n\npermanent rules.         See Prado, 198 F.3d at 288 n.2; IIRIRA §\n\n309(a).     Although Mahadeo’s convictions occurred in 1984 and\n\n1996, prior to the enactment of AEDPA and IIRIRA, the INS did\n\nnot commence removal proceedings against him until May 30, 1997.\n\nConsequently,      IIRIRA's     permanent       rules      govern   his    removal\n\nproceeding.\n\n                                       III.\n\n            In Goncalves v. Reno, we held that, although AEDPA and\n\nIIRIRA's transition rules \"divested the United States Courts of\n\nAppeals of their former statutory jurisdiction\" to hear claims\n\nbrought by aliens seeking discretionary relief from deportation,\n\n\"Congress neither explicitly nor by implication repealed the\n\ngrant of jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. § 2241 to issue writs of\n\nhabeas corpus to persons in federal custody which the federal\n\ndistrict courts have had since 1789 and which has always been\n\navailable in immigration cases.\" 144 F.3d at 113 (emphasis\n\nadded). 5     After     carefully   analyzing        the    provisions     of   the\n\n\n     5     Since we decided Goncalves, nine other circuits have\nagreed that IIRIRA's transition rules do not repeal access to §\n2241 habeas relief for aliens seeking review of legal or\nconstitutional questions raised by immigration proceedings. See\nWallace, 194 F.3d at 285 n.6 (collecting cases from the Second,\nThird, Fifth, Sixth, Eight, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits);\nMagana-Pizano v. INS, 200 F.3d 603 (9th Cir. 1999); Bowrin v.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fpermanent rules relied upon by the Attorney General, we conclude\n\nthat our holding in   Goncalves controls here.    As a criminal\n\nalien, Mahadeo was precluded by IIRIRA from obtaining judicial\n\nreview in the court of appeals of the BIA's determination that\n\nhe was ineligible for a discretionary waiver pursuant to former\n\nINA § 212(c).   See INA § 242(a)(2)(C).   Mahadeo's only avenue\n\nfor relief, therefore, was to petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.   Although the jurisdiction-stripping provisions in the\n\npermanent rules are more numerous than those contained in the\n\ntransition rules, IIRIRA's permanent rules--like the transition\n\nrules--lack the kind of explicit language Congress must use if\n\nit wants to repeal the availability of § 2241.6\n\n           A. Availability of Review Under INA § 242\n\n\n\nINS, 194 F.3d 483 (4th Cir. 1999).   But see La Guerre v. Reno,\n164 F.3d 1035 (7th Cir. 1998).\n    6     Because Mahadeo's petition asserts purely statutory\ninterpretation and constitutional questions, it falls squarely\nwithin with ambit of § 2241's jurisdictional grant.       As the\nplain language makes clear, § 2241 \"contemplates challenges\nbased on the 'Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates,'\" See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 123-24 (quoting 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2241(c)(3)); see also Wallace, 194 F.3d at 284 (observing that\n§ 2241 provides \"a general grant of authority to issue habeas\nwrits for persons held in violation of the Constitution or laws,\nunless such jurisdiction has been limited or withdrawn by\nCongress\"). Although Goncalves left for future cases \"the task\nof defining the precise limit of the jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 2241 in immigration cases,\" we held that the scope of\n§ 2241 review extends to both constitutional and statutory\ninterpretation questions. Id. at 125.\n\n                              -9-\n\f            The Attorney General argues that Mahadeo's sole avenue\n\nfor review of his statutory and constitutional challenges to the\n\nBIA decision is new INA § 242, the judicial review provisions\n\nenacted as part of IIRIRA's permanent rules.                For criminal\n\naliens like Mahadeo, however, judicial review by the courts of\n\nappeal   pursuant   to     INA   §    242    is   unavailable.      INA   §\n\n242(a)(2)(C),    enacted   as    part   of   IIRIRA's   permanent   rules,\n\nprovides:\n\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\n            no court shall have jurisdiction to review\n            any final order of removal against an alien\n            who is removable by reason of having\n            committed a criminal offense covered in\n            section . . . 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated\n            felony] of this title . . . .\n\nWe found similar provisions included in AEDPA7 and IIRIRA's\n\ntransition rules 8 to preclude access to appellate review for\n\n\n    7       Section 440(a) of AEDPA provides:\n\n    (a) JUDICIAL REVIEW.--Section 106 of the Immigration\n    and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)(10)) is amended\n    to read as follows: \"(10) Any final order of\n    deportation against an alien who is deportable by\n    reason of having committed a criminal offense covered\n    in section 241(a)(2) (A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D), or\n    any offense covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) for\n    which both predicate offenses are covered by section\n    241(a)(2)(A)(i), shall not be subject to review by any\n    court.\".\n\n    8       IIRIRA § 309(c)(4)(G) provides:\n\n            [N]otwithstanding any provision of section\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcriminal aliens.        See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 117 (construing\n\nIIRIRA transition rule § 309(c)(4)(G)); Kolster v. INS, 101 F.3d\n\n785, 786 (1st Cir. 1996) (construing AEDPA § 440(a)).                 A plain\n\nreading of § 242(a)(2)(C) suggests the same result.              The phrase,\n\n\"no court shall have jurisdiction to review,\" is functionally\n\nindistinguishable from \"shall not be subject to review by any\n\ncourt,\" the language in AEDPA § 440(a) that we previously found\n\nto preclude direct appeal to the circuit courts, see Kolster,\n\n101 F.3d at 786, and not unlike, \"no appeal permitted,\" the\n\nlanguage in § 309(c)(4)(G) of IIRIRA's transition rules that we\n\nalso       found   preclusive,   see   Goncalves,   144   F.3d   at   117-18.\n\nBecause IIRIRA's permanent rules prevent Mahadeo from bringing\n\na direct appeal to this court, therefore, his only remaining\n\nalternative is to file for a writ of habeas corpus in the\n\ndistrict court.9\n\n\n              106 of the Immigration an Nationality Act .\n              . . to the contrary--\n\n                                  * * *\n              There shall be no appeal permitted in the\n              case of an alien who is inadmissible or\n              deportable by reason of having committed a\n              criminal offense covered in . . . section\n              241(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated felony] . . .\n              of the Immigration and Nationality Act [as\n              codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] .\n              . . .\n       9  In Goncalves, the Attorney General                 claimed that\nnotwithstanding the plain language of INA §                  242(a)(2)(C),\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           The Attorney General responds that, notwithstanding\n\n§ 242(a)(2)(C)'s jurisdictional bar, several types of judicial\n\nreview remain available to Mahadeo.         According to the Attorney\n\nGeneral, \"[t]he court of appeals can review the petition of a\n\ncriminal   alien   subject   to    §     242(a)(2)(C)   who    raises     a\n\nsubstantial constitutional claim.\"          She also urges that \"the\n\nCourt has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction\"--that\n\nis, \"a court of appeals has jurisdiction to determine (i) if the\n\npetitioner is an alien, (ii) if he is removable; and (iii) if he\n\nis removable because of a conviction for a qualifying crime.\"\n\nShe clarifies, however, that \"[o]nce the Court has determined\n\nthat a petitioner is an alien who has been ordered removed for\n\na qualifying criminal conviction[,] it lacks jurisdiction to\n\nreview any other challenge that the petitioner might raise to\n\nhis removal proceedings.\"\n\n           The Attorney General's position is similar to the\n\nposition she took in Goncalves.        There, she suggested that this\n\ncourt   could   review   substantial      constitutional      claims    and\n\ndetermine whether the alien had, in fact, been convicted of the\n\ntype of crime that invokes the statutory bar to judicial review.\n\n\njudicial review by the court of appeals was required by INA §\n242(g). See 144 F.3d at 117-18. We rejected the notion there\nthat § 242(g) provides an affirmative grant of jurisdiction for\nthe courts of appeals to hear appeals of criminal aliens that\nare otherwise precluded. See id.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fSee Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 118-19.              Because we concluded that\n\nCongress had not repealed access to habeas relief under § 2241,\n\nwe     took   no    position    on    whether   or     to   what      extent   the\n\nConstitution might require IIRIRA to preserve jurisdiction over\n\nsome    types      of   questions    absent   the    ability     to   raise    such\n\nquestions in a habeas petition.               See id. at 118 n.8.         We did\n\nobserve, however, that \"IIRIRA itself makes no provisions for .\n\n. . review as to [criminal] aliens.\"                Id. at 119. Other courts\n\nare divided on whether and to what extent to read IIRIRA's\n\njurisdictional bar on judicial review as containing inherent\n\nexceptions for certain types of claims.               Compare Liang v. INS,\n\n206 F.3d 308, 322 (3d Cir. 2000) (declining to find exceptions);\n\nwith Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 F.3d 1133, 1135 (9th Cir.\n\n2000) (concluding that § 242(a)(2)(C) permits review over only\n\nthe narrow question of whether the alien is removable by reason\n\nof having been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses); and\n\nwith Richardson v.          Reno, 180 F.3d 1311, 1316 n.5 (11th Cir.\n\n1999) (construing § 242(a)(2)(C) as allowing judicial review\n\nover not only the statutory predicates to removal, but also\n\nstatutory interpretation and constitutional questions).\n\n              We agree that § 242(a)(2)(C) would not preclude us from\n\nreviewing       that    provision's    applicability        to   Mahadeo--i.e.,\n\nwhether Mahadeo is an alien, removable, and removable because of\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fa conviction for a qualifying crime.                See Fierro v. Reno, 217\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"This court's authority to review\n\nremoval orders based on an aliens's commission of an aggravated\n\nfelony has recently been restricted, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C) .\n\n. . , but this does not bar         Fierro's claim on review that he is\n\na citizen rather than an alien . . . .\"); see also Maghsoudi v.\n\nINS, 181 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1999) (asserting jurisdiction to\n\ndetermine whether alien's criminal convictions precluded review\n\nof his immigration proceedings under IIRIRA transition rule §\n\n309(c)(4)(G)).        The availability of review on these limited\n\nthreshold    issues    is   of   little     moment    to   Mahadeo,   however,\n\nbecause the crux of his petition is a challenge to the BIA's\n\ninterpretation of IIRIRA as precluding discretionary relief, not\n\na challenge to the applicability of § 242(a)(2)(C).\n\n            We need not address many of the other issues that the\n\nparties   attempt     to    raise   because    we    conclude   that   habeas\n\njurisdiction remains available to Mahadeo, in conformity with\n\nour preference stated in Goncalves for grounding jurisdiction\n\n\"directly on [the] statutory authority\" found in § 2241.                  See\n\nGoncalves, 144 F.3d at 119.         Our conclusion that IIRIRA does not\n\nrepeal the availability of § 2241 relief in immigration cases\n\nalso avoids the \"serious, novel, and complex\" constitutional\n\nconcerns raised by the elimination of aliens' historic access to\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fgeneral      federal     habeas    corpus      jurisdiction       when   no      other\n\njudicial review remains.10             See Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106,\n\n119   (2d    Cir.   1998);      Goncalves,     144   F.3d   at    122;     see   also\n\nKolster, 101 F.3d at 786 (emphasizing that AEDPA's restrictions\n\non judicial review \"do[] not offend the Constitution,\" because\n\n\"at least the habeas corpus review provided by the Constitution\n\nremains available to aliens\").               But see Richardson v. Reno, 180\n\nF.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that IIRIRA limits\n\nhabeas review and that such limitations are constitutional).                        As\n\nwe    demonstrate      below,     we   are    able   to   avoid    these    serious\n\nconstitutional         concerns    because      we   conclude     that     IIRIRA's\n\npermanent rules lack the clear statement of the congressional\n\nintent necessary to eliminate habeas review.                      Cf. Edward J.\n\nDeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades\n\nCouncil, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (court must adopt reasonable\n\ninterpretation      of    statute      when    necessary    to     avoid    serious\n\nconstitutional problems).\n\n        B.   Congress's Intent to Repeal Habeas Jurisdiction\n\n             Relying on the Supreme Court's decisions in Felker v.\n\n\n\n       10 We gratefully acknowledge briefing from amicus curiae,\nprofessors    from  a    number   of   law    schools,   on   the\nconstitutionality   of    construing   IIRIRA   to   repeal   the\navailability of § 2241 habeas jurisdiction for aliens\npetitioning   for  review    of  statutory   and   constitutional\nchallenges to their removal proceedings.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fTurpin, 518 U.S. 651 (1996), and Ex Parte Yerger, 75 U.S. (8\n\nWall.) 85 (1869), we held in Goncalves that \"any repeal of the\n\nfederal courts' historic habeas jurisdiction . . . must be\n\nexplicit and make express reference specifically to the statute\n\ngranting jurisdiction.\"        144 F.3d at 120.      That is, we will not\n\nconclude that Congress intended to repeal the availability of §\n\n2241 \"merely by implication.\"            Id. at 119.       Our task in the\n\ninstant case, therefore, is to discern whether Congress has\n\nlegislated in IIRIRA with the explicitness necessary to divest\n\nthe federal courts of § 2241 habeas jurisdiction.\n\n          The     Attorney    General   relies    upon    several   specific\n\nprovisions in INA § 242.          She insists that these provisions\n\nindividually,     and   viewed   in     their    \"entirety,\"   make    clear\n\nCongress's intent that, under IIRIRA's permanent rules, judicial\n\nreview for aliens like Mahadeo is available, if at all, only\n\npursuant to INA § 242.\n\n          First, the Attorney General directs our attention to\n\n§   242(g),   a   provision    that     was   effective    under    IIRIRA's\n\ntransition rules, and which we determined previously did not\n\nrepeal the availability of habeas jurisdiction.             See Goncalves,\n\n144 F.3d at 122.11      Section 242(g) provides:\n\n\n     11   Although the scope of § 242(g) was narrowed by a\nsubsequent Supreme Court decision, see Reno v. American Arab\nAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999) (holding\n\n                                   -16-\n\f           EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. Except as provided\n           in   this   section    [INA   §   242]   and\n           notwithstanding any other provision of law,\n           no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any\n           cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien\n           arising from the decision or action by the\n           Attorney General to commence proceedings,\n           adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders\n           against any alien under this chapter.\n\nAlthough   we   characterized   the    \"notwithstanding\"   clause   as\n\n\"sweeping,\" we concluded that it does not contain an express\n\nintent to repeal the availability of § 2241.      See Goncalves, 144\n\nF.3d at 122.    We find no warrant for a different conclusion now.\n\nAs we noted in Goncalves, to read § 242(g) as prohibiting all\n\nreview of immigration cases except as available under § 242\n\nwould lead to the \"enormous consequence[]\" of precluding review\n\nunder the judicial review provisions contained in old INA § 106,\n\na result that would \"clearly conflict\" with Congress's intent to\n\npreserve review in the transition period under old INA § 106.\n\nSee id.    (noting that without access to old INA § 106, aliens\n\nwhose proceedings were governed by IIRIRA's transition rules\n\nwould be entirely without access to judicial review since the\n\njudicial review prescribed by INA § 242 only took effect with\n\nIIRIRA's permanent rules).      If § 242(g)'s \"sweeping\" language\n\n\nthat by its own terms § 242(g) applied only to \"three discrete\nactions\"--a decision or action to (i) commence proceedings, (ii)\nadjudicate cases, or (iii) execute removal orders), we had\nassumed in Goncalves that it governed judicial review of the\nclaim asserted in that case.\n\n                                -17-\n\fdoes not repeal judicial review under old INA § 106, it is\n\ndifficult    to    see   how    it   repeals     the    availability    of   \"so\n\nsignificant a provision as the general habeas statute.\"                Flores-\n\nMiramontes, 212 F.3d at 1138.\n\n            Second, the Attorney General draws our attention to INA\n\n§ 242(a)(1), which provides that \"[j]udicial review of a final\n\norder of removal . . . is governed only by [the APA].\"                 The APA,\n\nin turn, vests courts of appeals with \"exclusive jurisdiction\"\n\nto review certain agency orders.             See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2341-2351.\n\nShe also    points to INA § 242(b)(9):\n\n            Judicial review of all questions of law or\n            fact,    including    interpretation     and\n            application of constitutional and statutory\n            provisions, arising from any action taken or\n            proceeding brought to remove an alien from\n            the United States under this subchapter\n            shall be available only in judicial review\n            of a final order under this section.\n\nShe urges that these provisions read in conjunction channel\n\n\"judicial    review\"     of    all   questions    relating    to   immigration\n\nproceedings into the APA. Neither § 242(a)(1) nor § 242(b)(9),\n\nhowever, contains an express reference to § 2241.                  Indeed, both\n\nprovisions speak only of \"judicial review.\"                \"'Judicial review'\n\nand   'habeas     corpus'     have   important    and     distinct   technical\n\nmeanings in the immigration context.\"                  Flores-Miramontes, 212\n\nF.3d at 1140 (citing Sandoval v. Reno, 166 F.3d 225, 235 (3d\n\nCir. 1999)).       \"[I]n the immigration context, the Court has\n\n                                      -18-\n\fhistorically      drawn      a       sharp    distinction      between     'judicial\n\nreview'--meaning APA review--and the courts' power to entertain\n\npetitions for writs of habeas corpus.\"                     Sandoval, 166 F.3d at\n\n235;    see also Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 235 (1953)\n\n(noting that a statute that eliminated judicial review over\n\nimmigration proceedings to the maximum extent permissible under\n\nthe Constitution did not eliminate habeas corpus); Liang, 206\n\nF.3d at 320; Jurado-Gutierrez v. Greene, 190 F.3d 1135, 1146\n\n(10th Cir. 1999).           We read \"judicial review\" to mean access to\n\nreview under the APA, rather than access to a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\n              The Attorney General contends that in Reno v. American\n\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471 (1999), the Supreme\n\nCourt   construed      INA       §   242--and       especially    §    242(b)(9)--to\n\nrequire that all review of immigration proceedings be channeled\n\nthrough   §    242    and    the      APA,    precluding      habeas   relief.    In\n\nAmerican-Arab, the Court held that INA § 242(g) deprived the\n\nfederal courts of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain a\n\ndirect appeal brought by an alien claiming that he had been\n\nselectively      chosen       for      deportation       in    violation    of   the\n\nConstitution.        See id. at 482-83.             Although the principal focus\n\nwas on § 242(g), the Court also stated that § 242(b)(9) is an\n\n\"unmistakable 'zipper' clause\" that \"channels judicial review of\n\n\n                                             -19-\n\fall [decisions and actions.]\"               See id.        Relying on American-\n\nArab,   the    district     court   ruled     that    it    was    \"compelled\"       to\n\ndismiss    Mahadeo's      habeas    petition    for    lack       of   jurisdiction\n\nbecause, to the extent he sought to declare the removal order\n\ncontrary to the law, his claim was barred by the INA's \"zipper\n\nclause,\" § 242(b)(9).         See Mahadeo v. Reno, 52 F. Supp. 2d 203,\n\n204 (D. Mass. 1999).\n\n              Both the district court and the Attorney General read\n\nAmerican-Arab too broadly.            As we stated recently: \"nothing in\n\nAmerican-Arab      directly    precludes       deportees      governed         by   the\n\nIIRIRA's       transition     rules     from    challenging            their    final\n\ndeportation orders through habeas where they have no other way\n\nto assert in court that their deportation is contrary to the\n\nConstitution or laws of the United States.\"                       Wallace v. Reno,\n\n194 F.3d 279, 286 (1st Cir. 1999).              Our reason for declining to\n\nfind    that    American-Arab       disturbed    habeas       jurisdiction          was\n\nsimple: American-Arab \"was concerned with a different issue\"--\n\nnamely, whether the court had the subject matter jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 to hear the case on direct appeal.\n\nWallace, 194 F.3d at 283.           Nothing in American-Arab, therefore,\n\nalters the rule announced in Felker and followed in Goncalves\n\nthat repeal of § 2241 habeas jurisdiction can be achieved only\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fby an express reference to that statute.                     See id.12\n\n           Our     conclusion         that      §   242(b)(9)    does    not    affect\n\njurisdiction under § 2241 is consistent with the Supreme Court's\n\ndescription      of     §   242(b)(9)      as   a   \"zipper     clause.\"       Section\n\n242(b)(9) is entitled \"Consolidation of questions for judicial\n\nreview.\"      It      is    a   \"zipper      clause\"    in    the   sense      that   it\n\nconsolidates       or       \"zips\"    \"judicial        review\"      of   immigration\n\nproceedings into one action in the court of appeals.                                  See\n\nFlores-Miramontes, 212 F.3d at 1140 (clarifying that before §\n\n242(b)(9), some direct appeals from immigration proceedings were\n\nin the courts of appeals, while others were in the district\n\ncourts).   Section 242(b)(9) applies only \"with respect to review\n\nof an order of removal under subsection (a)(1),\" and review\n\nunder subsection (a)(1), in turn, occurs only under \"chapter 158\n\nof Title 28, [the APA].\"             Id.   Although the APA governs judicial\n\nreview of certain agency actions, it does not govern habeas\n\nproceedings brought under § 2241.                   See id.      It follows that §\n\n242(b)(9) \"does not apply to actions brought in habeas corpus,\n\nand certainly does not serve to repeal in whole or in part the\n\n\n\n    12    Indeed, American-Arab noted that the habeas issue was\nbefore the circuit courts and, a few days after issuing\nAmerican-Arab, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in Goncalves,\nsee Reno v. Pereira Goncalves, 526 U.S. 1004 (1999), and the\nSecond Circuit's decision in Henderson, see Navas v. Reno, 526\nU.S. 1004 (1999).\n\n                                           -21-\n\fgeneral habeas statute.\"          Id.    But see Richardson v. Reno, 180\n\nF.3d   1311,    1315      (11th    Cir.        1999)     (holding    that    \"the\n\n'unmistakable zipper clause' of INA § 242(b)(9), along with the\n\noverall revisions to the judicial review scheme enacted by INA\n\n§ 242 et seq., constitute a sufficiently broad and general\n\nlimitation     on    federal      jurisdiction          to    preclude   §   2241\n\njurisdiction over challenges to removal orders\").\n\n          Third, the Attorney General also contends that the\n\naforementioned      bar   on   judicial        review   for   criminal   aliens,\n\n§ 242(a)(2)(C), repeals habeas jurisdiction--and indeed all\n\njudicial review for criminal aliens like Mahadeo (except for the\n\nnarrow categories discussed above).               We disagree.\n\n          Section 242(a)(2)(C) provides that:\n\n          [n]otwithstanding any other provision of\n          law, no court shall have jurisdiction to\n          review any final order of removal against an\n          alien who is removable by reason of having\n          committed a criminal offense covered in . .\n          . 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated felony] of\n          this title.\n\nThis provision is similar to its predecessor under IIRIRA's\n\ntransition rules, which stated:\n\n          [N]otwithstanding any provision of section\n          106 of the Immigration and Nationality Act .\n          . . to the contrary--\n\n                                    * * *\n\n          there shall be no appeal permitted in the\n          case of an alien who is . . . deportable by\n\n                                        -22-\n\f               reason   of   having  committed                 [certain]\n               criminal offense[s] . . . .\n\nIIRIRA § 309(c)(4).               Neither § 309(c)(4) nor § 242(a)(2)(C)\n\ncontain an express reference to § 2241.                 In Goncalves, we found\n\nthe phrase, \"shall be no appeal permitted,\" indistinguishable\n\nfrom the limiting language in AEDPA, \"shall not be appealable,\"\n\nwhich the Supreme Court held in Felker to lack the explicitness\n\nnecessary to repeal habeas jurisdiction.                   See 144 F.3d at 120-\n\n21.13    We concluded, therefore, that § 309(c)(4) merely restricts\n\none avenue of relief--an appeal under the APA--but does not\n\nabrogate habeas jurisdiction.               See id.     We fail to see how INA\n\n§ 242(a)(2)(C)'s limitation, \"no court shall have jurisdiction\n\nto review,\" is significantly more explicit with respect to the\n\nelimination of habeas relief than the analogous bar on judicial\n\nreview        for     criminal    aliens    in    IIRIRA   §    309(c)(4).        The\n\nprohibition contained in § 242(a)(2)(C) on \"review\" of \"any\n\nfinal        order\"    is,   in   one   sense,    not   even    as   broad   as   the\n\nprohibition in § 242(g) on \"jurisdiction to hear any cause or\n\nclaim\" that we previously held to be inadequate to repeal habeas\n\njurisdiction.           See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 122; see also Flores-\n\n\n\n        13The AEDPA provision addressed in Felker provided that\n\"[t]he grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals\nto file a second or successive application shall not be\nappealable.\"    AEDPA § 106(b), codified at 28 U.S.C. §\n2244(b)(3)(E).\n\n                                           -23-\n\fMiramontes, 212 F.3d at 1137.               But see Max-George v. Reno, 205\n\nF.3d 194, 199 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that § 242(a)(2)(C)\n\neliminates § 2241 habeas jurisdiction for those cases that fall\n\nwithin its scope).\n\n              Finally, the Attorney General attempts to distinguish\n\nthis case from Goncalves by insisting that § 242, viewed in its\n\nentirety, conveys an intent to make its provisions the exclusive\n\navenue for judicial review of immigration proceedings.                           That\n\nreasoning,      however,       would       turn     Felker   on   its     head     by\n\n\"requir[ing] a specific reference to § 2241 to preserve such\n\njurisdiction, rather than a specific reference to abolish it.\"\n\nGoncalves,      144    F.3d    at   122.      In     Goncalves,   we    explicitly\n\ndeclined the Attorney General's invitation to find that in\n\napplying the APA to immigration decisions, Congress intended to\n\ncreate   an    exclusive       forum   for    immigration      appeals,      thereby\n\neliminating habeas jurisdiction. See id. (explaining that former\n\nINA § 106 made immigration decisions appealable under the APA).\n\nWe emphasized that to infer an intent to repeal the availability\n\nof § 2241 from \"Congress' decision to make available another\n\navenue for judicial review\" was \"precisely what Felker and Ex\n\nparte Yerger do not permit.\"                Id. at 120.       The existence of\n\n\"another      available       avenue   for        judicial   review\"    is    simply\n\ninsufficient      to     communicate         an     intent   to   repeal      habeas\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fjurisdiction.         See id. at 120.\n\n               Most decisively, none of the provisions relied upon by\n\nthe Attorney General contain the kind of \"express reference\" to\n\n§ 2241 habeas jurisdiction required by Goncalves and Felker.\n\nAbsent explicit language repealing the availability of § 2241,\n\nwe    are     not    at   liberty    to       reach   a    result     different      than\n\nGoncalves.          It is axiomatic that a panel of this court cannot\n\noverrule a prior panel, see Wallace, 194 F.3d at 283.                            Moreover,\n\nCongress has shown in enacting IRRIRA that it knows how to use\n\nexplicit       language     when    it    intends     to     place    limitations        on\n\njudicial review under particular statutes.                      See Goncalves, 144\n\nF.3d at 121 (\"IIRIRA contains numerous provisions restricting or\n\naltering various avenues for judicial review, but in none of\n\nthese provisions does IIRIRA mention § 2241.\").                         For example,\n\nIIRIRA § 306, which enacts new INA § 242, contains provisions\n\nthat refer specifically to the judicial review provision of the\n\nAPA and the Declaratory Judgment Act.                      See id.     Yet, IIRIRA's\n\npermanent rules do not mention habeas corpus jurisdiction under\n\n§    2241.      The    lack   of    any   express         reference    to    §    2241   is\n\nparticularly revealing because the Supreme Court decided Felker\n\njust three months before IIRIRA was enacted, placing Congress on\n\nnotice       that   any   repeal    of    §    2241   jurisdiction          requires     an\n\nexpress reference to that statute.\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\f            To be sure, the permanent rules do not affirmatively\n\nauthorize    habeas       review   under     §   2241.    But    an      affirmative\n\nauthorization       has   never    been    deemed    necessary.           Even    when\n\nlimited    habeas    review    was   available       pursuant       to   old     INA   §\n\n106(a)(10), it was well-recognized that this alternative basis\n\nfor seeking a writ of habeas corpus did not \"supplant[] the\n\ngeneral federal habeas statute.\"            Flores-Miramontes, 212 F.3d at\n\n1138-39 (citing Foti v. INS, 375 U.S. 217, 231 (1963));                            see\n\nGoncalves, 144 F.3d at 121 (noting that in AEDPA § 401(e),\n\nCongress    expressly        repealed       former       INA    §     106(a)(10)'s\n\nauthorization that \"any alien held in custody pursuant to an\n\norder of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by\n\nhabeas corpus proceedings\").              Although § 2241 and § 106(a)(10)\n\nwere independent bases for habeas review, Congress repealed only\n\n§ 106(a)(10), creating the basis for an inference that Congress\n\nintended § 2241 to remain available.14\n\n            In   short,       IIRIRA's       permanent         rules--like         the\n\ntransitional rules before them--lack a clear statement of intent\n\nto repeal § 2241 jurisdiction.              The district court, therefore,\n\n\n\n    14    Because jurisdiction under § 2241 for aliens does not\ndepend on any statutory provision of the INA, we do not read\nIIRIRA's express authorization of certain limited habeas corpus\nreview for determinations made under INA § 235(b)(1) (dealing\nwith screening aliens for admission and claims for asylum) as\nevidence of an intent to repeal the availability of § 2241.\n\n                                      -26-\n\ferred in dismissing Mahadeo's habeas corpus petition for want of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n           In his habeas petition, Mahadeo asserts his right to\n\napply to the BIA for a discretionary waiver of the removal order\n\npursuant   to    the     pre-AEDPA    version    of   INA     §   212(c).      In\n\nparticular,      he      asserts     that     the     presumption         against\n\nretroactivity in statutory interpretation requires IIRIRA to be\n\nconstrued as preserving the availability of pre-AEDPA INA §\n\n212(c) relief for aliens whose criminal convictions pre-dated\n\nthe enactment of AEDPA and IIRIRA.              Alternatively, he asserts\n\nthat denying him access to relief under pre-AEDPA INA § 212(c)\n\nwould be unconstitutional.            The district court did not reach\n\nthese issues because it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to\n\nentertain the habeas petition.\n\n           On appeal, Mahadeo argued in his initial brief only\n\nconstitutional grounds for his entitlement to the availability\n\nof   section    212(c)    relief.      Not    surprisingly,       the   Attorney\n\nGeneral responded in her brief only to these constitutional\n\nclaims.    In his reply brief, however, Mahadeo took a different\n\napproach, stating that his principal claim to the continuing\n\navailability      of     section     212(c)    relief    is       \"a    statutory\n\nretroactivity challenge--that the repeal of section 212(c) does\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fnot apply to cases where, as here, the criminal conduct and\n\nconviction   (by   plea)   occurred    before   passage   of   the   1996\n\namendments.\"   Not surprisingly, the government insisted at oral\n\nargument that this statutory retroactivity challenge cannot be\n\nraised for the first time in a reply brief.\n\n           We agree.   So, apparently, does Mahadeo, who focuses\n\nin his reply brief on the availability of § 2241 jurisdiction in\n\nthe district court and asks for the opportunity to develop there\n\nhis statutory and constitutional arguments about the continuing\n\navailability of § 212(c) relief.       Specifically, he requests the\n\nfollowing:\n\n           If this court concludes that the district\n           court had habeas jurisdiction to review Mr.\n           Mahadeo's   statutory   and  constitutional\n           claims, Mr. Mahadeo respectfully requests\n           that the court remand his case to allow him\n           to develop those claims in the district\n           court in the first instance    and to brief\n           them fully in light of this court's\n           intervening retroactivity decision in Mattis\n           v. Reno, 2000 WL 554957 (1st Cir. May 8,\n           2000).\n\nIn the peculiar circumstances of this case, this approach makes\n\nsense.   Given the district court's decision to dismiss Mahadeo's\n\nhabeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it\n\nnever addressed his claim on the merits about the continuing\n\navailability of section 212(c) relief.          We have concluded that\n\nthis opinion was wrong, and that the district court should have\n\n\n                                -28-\n\faddressed the statutory and constitutional claims raised in\n\nMahadeo's petition.   We now remand for that purpose.\n\n         Judgment vacated.   Remanded to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n                              -29-\n\f",

In 1984, and again in 1991, Mahadeo was convicted of\n\npossession        of   marijuana     with     intent   to     distribute;     each\n\nconviction constitutes an \"aggravated felony\" as defined by the\n\nINA.

The immigration judge found him removable and ordered\n\nhim deported.\n\n              Mahadeo appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\"),       arguing     that    he   was    entitled       to   apply   for    a\n\ndiscretionary waiver of the removal order pursuant to former INA\n\n§ 212(c), as it stood before it was amended by AEDPA and\n\n\n       1  An \"aggravated felony\" falls in the category of crimes\nthat precludes judicial review under INA § 242(a)(2)(C), AEDPA\n§ 440(a), IIRIRA transition rule § 309(c)(4)(G), and IIRIRA\npermanent rule § 304(a), which adds new INA § 240A. We refer to\nthe aliens whose convictions place them within this category,\nsee infra note 4, variously as \"criminal aliens,\" or \"aliens\nwith a criminal conviction.\"\n\n                                        -3-\n\frepealed by IIRIRA.2   In particular, he argued that denying him\n\naccess to former INA § 212(c) would violate the presumption\n\nagainst retroactivity in statutory interpretation because his\n\nconvictions pre-dated the enactment of AEDPA and IIRIRA.   In the\n\nalternative, Mahadeo asserted that retroactive application of\n\nIIRIRA's repeal of § 212(c) relief would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe BIA rejected Mahadeo's arguments.\n\n         Mahadeo then petitioned the district court for habeas\n\ncorpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, contending that the\n\n\n\n    2     Before AEDPA amended § 212(c) in 1996, it provided in\nrelevant part:\n\n    Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence . .\n    . who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished\n    domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted\n    in the discretion of the Attorney General. . . . The\n    first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to\n    an alien who has been convicted of one or more\n    aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or\n    felonies a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.\n\nCodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995). The second sentence does\nnot apply to Mahadeo because he did not serve five years for\neither of his felony convictions. Despite the literal language\nof § 212(c), which speaks only of aliens \"returning,\" it had\nbeen construed to apply not only to aliens seeking discretionary\nrelief from exclusion, but also to aliens, like Mahadeo, seeking\ndiscretionary relief from deportation.

He reiterated both his constitutional arguments and his\n\nstatutory interpretation challenge premised on the presumption\n\nagainst retroactivity.     The district court did not address the\n\nmerits of Mahadeo's petition because it concluded that IIRIRA's\n\npermanent    rules   revoked   the   subject    matter   jurisdiction   of\n\nfederal district courts to entertain § 2241 petitions brought by\n\naliens seeking review of immigration proceedings.

Just a\n\nfew months after Congress enacted AEDPA, it enacted IIRIRA,\n\naltering the immigration laws yet again.       IIRIRA's permanent\n\nrules repealed former INA § 212(c) and created a new form of\n\ndiscretionary relief, \"cancellation of removal.\"     See IIRIRA §\n\n304 (adding new INA § 240A, codified at 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229b (West\n\nSupp. 1998)).   \"Cancellation,\" like § 212(c) relief both before\n\nand after AEDPA's amendments, is not available to aliens whose\n\ncriminal convictions qualify as \"aggravated felonies.\"         See\n\nIIRIRA § 304(a).     Like the AEDPA amendments, the \"cancellation\"\n\nprovision continues to make all aggravated felons ineligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief, irrespective of whether the alien was\n\nrequired to serve five years in prison.4    Having been convicted\n\nof an aggravated felony, Mahadeo is ineligible for cancellation\n\nof removal.\n\n\n§ 440(d)'s   limitation on access to discretionary relief for\n\"deportable,\" but not \"excludable,\" aliens did not violate equal\nprotection.\n    4     In addition, both AEDPA and IIRIRA expanded          the\ndefinition of \"aggravated felony\" to encompass more crimes.

In\n\nparticular,      he      asserts     that     the     presumption         against\n\nretroactivity in statutory interpretation requires IIRIRA to be\n\nconstrued as preserving the availability of pre-AEDPA INA §\n\n212(c) relief for aliens whose criminal convictions pre-dated\n\nthe enactment of AEDPA and IIRIRA.              Alternatively, he asserts\n\nthat denying him access to relief under pre-AEDPA INA § 212(c)\n\nwould be unconstitutional.            The district court did not reach\n\nthese issues because it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to\n\nentertain the habeas petition.\n\n           On appeal, Mahadeo argued in his initial brief only\n\nconstitutional grounds for his entitlement to the availability\n\nof   section    212(c)    relief.      Not    surprisingly,       the   Attorney\n\nGeneral responded in her brief only to these constitutional\n\nclaims.    In his reply brief, however, Mahadeo took a different\n\napproach, stating that his principal claim to the continuing\n\navailability      of     section     212(c)    relief    is       \"a    statutory\n\nretroactivity challenge--that the repeal of section 212(c) does\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fnot apply to cases where, as here, the criminal conduct and\n\nconviction   (by   plea)   occurred    before   passage   of   the   1996\n\namendments.\"   Not surprisingly, the government insisted at oral\n\nargument that this statutory retroactivity challenge cannot be\n\nraised for the first time in a reply brief.\n\n           We agree.   So, apparently, does Mahadeo, who focuses\n\nin his reply brief on the availability of § 2241 jurisdiction in\n\nthe district court and asks for the opportunity to develop there\n\nhis statutory and constitutional arguments about the continuing\n\navailability of § 212(c) relief.       Specifically, he requests the\n\nfollowing:\n\n           If this court concludes that the district\n           court had habeas jurisdiction to review Mr.\n           Mahadeo's   statutory   and  constitutional\n           claims, Mr. Mahadeo respectfully requests\n           that the court remand his case to allow him\n           to develop those claims in the district\n           court in the first instance    and to brief\n           them fully in light of this court's\n           intervening retroactivity decision in Mattis\n           v.
