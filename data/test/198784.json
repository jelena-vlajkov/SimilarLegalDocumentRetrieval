MCLAUGHLIN, SR.,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n             WARDEN, NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE PRISON,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n     [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Robert A. McLaughlin, Sr. on brief pro se.\r\n   Steven M. Houran, Deputy Attorney General, Daniel J. Mullen,\r\nSenior Assistant Attorney General, and Andrew B. Livernois,\r\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 28, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Robert A. McLaughlin appeals pro se from\r\nthe district court order granting defendant's motion for\r\nsummary judgment.  Having conducted a careful, de novo review\r\nof the record, we affirm for essentially the reasons stated in\r\nthe district court's detailed and well-reasoned Order, dated\r\nFebruary 26, 1999.  We add only the following comment.  \r\n          McLaughlin made reference in his Opposition to the\r\nMotion for Summary Judgment to his treatment by the authorities\r\nat the North Florida Reception Center where he was held for\r\nthree months in 1994, including the alleged refusal to provide\r\nhim with his legal files or to allow him to contact the court\r\nwhere his state habeas petition was pending.  McLaughlin's\r\nbrief focuses on those allegations, although they were not\r\nincluded in his complaint.  Treating McLaughlin's new\r\nallegations in his Opposition to the Motion for Summary\r\nJudgment as a motion to amend the complaint, there was no abuse\r\nof discretion in the failure of the district court to allow the\r\namendment. See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253\r\n(1st Cir. 1994) (where motion to amend is filed while summary\r\njudgment motion is pending, plaintiff is \"required to\r\ndemonstrate to the district court that the proposed amendments\r\nwere supported by 'substantial and convincing evidence'\").  \r\n          The district court order granting defendant's motion\r\nfor summary judgment is affirmed.\n",
