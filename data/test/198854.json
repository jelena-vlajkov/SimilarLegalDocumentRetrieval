Joseph L.

Appellant Anthony Martin, a tenured professor\n\nat Wellesley College, claims that he was denied a merit pay\n\nincrease because he is black and in retaliation for his protests\n\nover racist practices by the school and its faculty.                       The\n\ndistrict court concluded that Martin failed to produce evidence\n\nthat could support a finding of racial discrimination, and it\n\nconsequently granted summary judgment for Wellesley.                 We affirm\n\nfor the reasons articulated by the district court and add only\n\nthe following comments.\n\n      Martin emphasizes his strengths in the categories deemed\n\nrelevant by Wellesley in determining merit increases, and he\n\nurges comparisons with other faculty members whose records in\n\nsupport of such increases were far less substantial than his\n\nown. He asserts that the quantity of his writing and other work\n\nand     his     superior   student    evaluations      show   such    a   high\n\nperformance level that the only plausible reason for his being\n\nthe sole eligible professor not to receive merit pay is his\n\nrace.         This   argument   ignores,    however,   that   the    college’s\n\nrationale was that -- notwithstanding the substance and quantity\n\nof other materials in his file -- the content and tone of his\n\nwork related to The Secret Relationship \"warrant a statement of\n\ndisapproval and concern and certainly do not warrant a merit\n\nincrease.\"       See Letter of President Diana Chapman Walsh.             Thus,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdiscrepancies between the quantitative strength of his record\n\nand those of other faculty members do not demonstrate pretext in\n\nthe college’s judgment that the quality of Martin’s work had\n\ndeteriorated, as evidenced by The Jewish Onslaught and related\n\nmaterials.\n\n    We appreciate the difficulty faced by a plaintiff who seeks\n\nto prove discrimination when the evidence contains no \"smoking\n\ngun,\" and we recognize the subtlety in appellant’s argument that\n\nracism is implicit in the backlash against his work during the\n\nrelevant time period.      The record, however, contains no evidence\n\nthat could support a jury finding that the denial of merit pay\n\nstemmed from racial animus rather than from the college’s stated\n\nreasons relating to the tone and approach of his scholarship.\n\nThe opinions of plaintiff’s expert witnesses that the college’s\n\nactions were racially motivated are presumptions themselves\n\nbased    primarily    on   his    race     and   do   not    strengthen   his\n\ndiscrimination       claim,     particularly     in    the    face   of   the\n\nsubstantial evidence of widespread distress about the quality of\n\nplaintiff’s work among his colleagues at Wellesley.                  A fact\n\nfinder    would   have     to    engage     in   wholly      unsubstantiated\n\nspeculation to conclude that the college’s asserted reason for\n\nits action was pretextual and that plaintiff’s race was the true\n\nreason for denying the raise.        Liability may not be premised on\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fconjecture alone.   On this record, therefore, the defendants\n\nwere entitled to summary judgment.*\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    *  The widespread concern expressed about plaintiff’s more\nrecent scholarship among his colleagues at Wellesley is a\nsignificant factual difference distinguishing this case from\nHarrington v. Harris, 118 F.3d 359 (5th Cir. 1997), which was\nemphasized by plaintiff at oral argument. In Harrington, the\nplaintiffs, who were white professors at a predominantly black\nlaw school, showed not only that defendants \"intentionally or\nrecklessly failed to give white professors equal credit and\nconsideration for their scholarship, research, community\nservice, and publications,\" id. at 368, but also offered\ntestimony from other faculty members stating that a racially\ndiscriminatory environment existed at the school, see id. The\nplaintiffs in Harrington also were able to demonstrate\nconsistently    adverse   treatment   of   white   professors,\nstrengthening the inference that discrimination rather than\nindividual performance motivated the disparate actions.\n\n                              -5-\n\f",
