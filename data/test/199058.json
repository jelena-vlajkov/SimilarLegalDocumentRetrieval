Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n\n                and Casellas,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for\nappellant.\n     Jean B.

Defendant-appellant Alan Lee\n\nAmirault pled guilty to possessing three items containing visual\n\ndepictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.                  See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B) (1994) (current version at 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252(a)(4)(B)) (Supp. IV 1998)).                After the district court\n\nsentenced him to serve sixty months in prison, we vacated the\n\nsentence.     See United States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).       At   resentencing,    the       district   court   corrected   its\n\noriginal error, departed upward under USSG §5K2.0, and imposed\n\na forty-six month incarcerative term.1              Amirault appeals anew,\n\nthis time contesting the upward departure.                We affirm.\n\n                                         I\n\n             We review departure decisions for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nWhen a departure occurs under the aegis of section 5K2.0, we\n\nmount    a   tripartite   inquiry.            \"First,   we   determine   as    a\n\ntheoretical matter whether the stated ground for departure is\n\npermissible       under   the     guidelines.           If   the   ground     is\n\ntheoretically appropriate, we next examine whether it finds\n\nadequate factual support in the record.                 If so, we must probe\n\n\n\n    1The court appropriately employed the 1998 edition of the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines.    See United States v.\nHarotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).       All\nreferences herein are to that version.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe   degree    of     the   departure      in   order   to     verify    its\n\nreasonableness.\"      United States v. Dethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 43-44\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (footnote and internal citations omitted).\n\n           In the case at hand, the lower court premised its\n\nupward departure on a finding that the appellant had sexually\n\nassaulted two of his sisters-in-law during their minority.                The\n\nappellant contests each of the elements of the Dethlefs inquiry.\n\nWe consider those three arguments seriatim.              We then confront\n\nthe tag end of the appellant's asseverational array.\n\n                                     II\n\n           We deal expeditiously with the appellant's thesis that,\n\neven if the sexual assaults occurred, they cannot support an\n\nupward departure.       This thesis rests on the premise that the\n\nassaults happened many years before the offense of conviction\n\nand, thus, were not \"relevant conduct\" under USSG §1B1.3.                This\n\nargument is a red herring.\n\n           In this case, the district court did not rest its\n\ndecision   on   a    determination   that    the   sexual     assaults   were\n\nrelevant conduct, but, rather, concluded that the acts warranted\n\nan upward departure under section 5K2.0.           In doing so, the court\n\ndrew an analogy to USSG §2G2.2, the guideline that deals with\n\ntrafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a\n\nminor.     One of the specific offense characteristics of the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\ftrafficking guideline mandates a five-level increase in the base\n\noffense    level      \"[i]f     the    defendant   engaged        in   a      pattern   of\n\nactivity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\"\n\nUSSG §2G2.2(b)(4).         The pattern of sexual abuse or exploitation\n\nneed   not      occur    during       the   commission       of    the     offense      of\n\nconviction       in     order    to    constitute      this       specific       offense\n\ncharacteristic.          See id., comment. (n.1) (explaining that the\n\nterm \"'[p]attern of activity involving the sexual abuse or\n\nexploitation of a minor,'\" as used in section 2G2.2(b)(4),\n\n\"means any combination of two or more separate instances of the\n\nsexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant,\n\nwhether or not the abuse or exploitation (A) occurred during the\n\ncourse    of    the   offense,        (B)   involved   the    same       or    different\n\nvictims, or (C) resulted in a conviction for such conduct\").\n\n               This approach was sound.            A sentencing court is free\n\nto make suitable comparisons and draw plausible analogies in\n\nconsidering whether to depart from the guideline sentencing\n\nrange.    So it was here:             although the guideline applicable to\n\nthe offense of conviction was section 2G2.4 (the possession\n\nguideline), not section 2G2.2 (the trafficking guideline), see\n\nAmirault, 173 F.3d at 35, the district court was entitled to\n\nexamine factors set out in section 2G2.2(b) in order to evaluate\n\nthe appropriateness of a departure.                 Simply because a specific\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\foffense characteristic is listed explicitly in one guideline but\n\nnot another does not mean that the factor may not be relevant to\n\nthe departure calculus in respect to an offense under the latter\n\nguideline.     See USSG §5K2.0, p.s.            Finding, as we do, that the\n\nlower court permissibly drew this analogy to USSG §2G2.2(b)(4)\n\nconfirms     the   suitability      of    the   court's    use    of   the   sexual\n\nassaults     (if    proven)   as    the    cornerstone      of   the   envisioned\n\ndeparture.\n\n             The   appellant's      theory      —   that   the   district     court\n\nsomehow was obliged to forgo the analogy and shape any such\n\ndeparture around the contours of the relevant conduct guideline\n\n— is jejune.        The relevant conduct guideline is not directed\n\nspecifically at section 5K2.0 departures.                  Rather, its purpose\n\nis to determine adjustments to the base offense level, taking\n\ninto account a defendant's overall behavior.                 See United States\n\nv. Sanders, 982 F.2d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 1992).                      Adjustments and\n\ndepartures are different species, dissimilar both in purpose and\n\nkind.   See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146,\n\n151   (1st   Cir.    2000).        Not    surprisingly,     therefore,       upward\n\ndepartures are allowed for acts of misconduct not resulting in\n\nconviction, as long as those acts, whether or not relevant\n\nconduct in the section 1B1.3 sense, relate meaningfully to the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\foffense of conviction.            See United States v. Kim, 896 F.2d 678,\n\n684 (2d Cir. 1990).\n\n            This is such a case.                The sexual assaults that the\n\nsentencing court found the appellant had committed were part of\n\na pattern of sexual exploitation of the minor sisters-in-law\n\nthat included, inter alia, the taking of approximately forty\n\nnude photographs and their retention in his child pornography\n\ncollection (for his sexual gratification).                  These snapshots not\n\nonly memorialized the assaults but also meaningfully related\n\nthem to the possession offense.                   Even if, as the appellant\n\ncontends, the snapshots were not \"sexually explicit\" under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2256(2) (1994), they nonetheless demonstrated rather\n\nconvincingly      his      prurient      interest   in    sexualized    images    of\n\nchildren.      In fact, he admitted to the police and to the court\n\nbelow   that    he      kept     these    particular      pictures     secret    and\n\nmasturbated with them.            Because the retained photographs link\n\nthe appellant's conduct during the offense of conviction to the\n\nearlier assaults, the assaults constituted an allowable ground\n\non which to premise an upward departure.\n\n            Battling on, the appellant insists that there exists\n\na temporal limit — in his words, a \"temporal wall\" — that\n\nprecludes   the      use    of   past     conduct   for    sentence-enhancement\n\npurposes,    and     that      these     two-decade-old     incidents     are    too\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdistant in time.       To further this argument, he notes that the\n\nsentencing guidelines themselves contain time limits on the use\n\nof past convictions, see USSG §4A1.2(e), and cites cases that\n\nquestion the propriety, in particular circumstances, of basing\n\nsentence enhancements on unrelated, remote convictions,                see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 73 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nYet, as the sentencing guidelines and the cases recognize, the\n\nappropriateness of a temporal limit depends heavily on the\n\ncircumstances of the particular case.           For example, even though\n\nthe sentencing guidelines generally restrict the use of dated\n\nconvictions,    they   do   allow    the    sentencing   court    leeway   to\n\nconsider such convictions if they provide \"evidence of similar,\n\nor serious dissimilar, criminal conduct.\"          USSG §4A1.2, comment.\n\n(n.8).\n\n          For the crime of trafficking in child pornography, the\n\nSentencing Commission has specifically addressed the propriety\n\nof basing an upward departure on a dated pattern or incident of\n\nsexual abuse or exploitation.              The most pertinent guideline\n\ncommentary teaches, with an exception that has no bearing here,\n\nthat   \"[i]f   the   defendant      engaged   in   the   sexual   abuse    or\n\nexploitation of a minor at any time (whether or not such abuse\n\nor exploitation occurred during the course of the offense or\n\nresulted in a conviction for such conduct) . . . an upward\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdeparture    may    be   warranted.\"     Id.    §2G2.2,     comment.       (n.2)\n\n(emphasis    supplied).      Having    accepted      the   district   court's\n\nanalogy to section 2G2.2, we see no reason to disregard this\n\ncommentary.       It follows inexorably that there was no legal error\n\nin the lower court's determination that the sexual assaults,\n\nalthough occurring long ago, nevertheless could bear the weight\n\nof an upward departure under section 5K2.0.\n\n                                   III\n\n            The     appellant   couples        his    challenge       to     the\n\nappropriateness of the departure-justifying circumstance with a\n\nchallenge to the very existence of that circumstance.                 In this\n\nvein, he maintains that the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding that he had sexually assaulted his two sisters-in-law.\n\nThe appellant bases this remonstrance primarily on the two-\n\ndecade delay in the victims' revelations and the timing of those\n\nrevelations (they surfaced shortly after the commencement of his\n\ndivorce proceedings).        He marries this attack to an attack on\n\nthe reliability of his supposed admissions to the police, noting\n\nthat the reported statements were neither recorded nor submitted\n\nto him for signature and, in all events, were made in the\n\nimmediate aftermath of the turmoil engendered by his arrest.\n\n            Viewed in the abstract, these counter-arguments present\n\na plausible (although not inevitable) scenario different from\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fthat discerned by the district court.                But plausibility is not\n\nenough    to    carry      the   day.   We     review    a   sentencing   court's\n\nfactfinding deferentially, mindful of that court's superior\n\ncoign of vantage.           See Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98\n\n(1996); United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).           Give or take a few ruffles and flourishes, the\n\nappellant hawks the same set of arguments here that he proffered\n\nbelow.     The sentencing court rejected those arguments, choosing\n\ninstead to credit the detailed accounts contained in the victim\n\nimpact statements and to take the appellant's initial admissions\n\nof inappropriate contact at face value.                  The court found added\n\nsupport    for    the      occurrence   of     the   sexual    assaults   in   the\n\nappellant's taking and retention of the nude photographs of his\n\nsisters-in-law and credited the suggestion that the victims\n\nfailed     to    speak      out    earlier     due      to   fear,   shame,    and\n\nmortification.\n\n               There is no principled way that we can second-guess\n\nthese findings.            Because the record adequately supports the\n\ncourt's version of the controverted events, its rejection of the\n\nappellant's subsequent disavowals cannot be clearly erroneous.\n\nSee United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(stating       that    a   sentencing   court's      determination    cannot    be\n\nclearly erroneous \"where there is more than one plausible view\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fof the circumstances\" and the court chooses among them).               This\n\nis especially so because the appellant's position hinges on\n\nquestions of credibility, and such questions are uniquely within\n\nthe competence of the sentencing court.           See United States v.\n\nSandoval, 204 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v.\n\nConley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                 IV\n\n         The    appellant   further    contends    that,   even   if   the\n\ndistrict court had an appropriate, factually acceptable basis\n\nfor departing upward, the extent of the departure was excessive.\n\nBecause a sentencing court possesses considerable latitude in\n\nfixing the degree of an unguided departure, contentions of this\n\nsort usually face tough sledding in an appellate venue.                This\n\ncase is no exception.\n\n         The court of appeals will interfere in the sentencing\n\ncourt's determination of the extent of an unguided departure\n\nonly upon a showing that the court has committed a manifest\n\nabuse of discretion.    See Brewster, 127 F.3d at 31.             In this\n\ninstance, the magnitude of the departure, standing alone, is\n\nunremarkable.    Although the district court departed upward by\n\nnineteen months to a point approximately seventy percent above\n\nthe maximum permitted under the applicable guideline sentencing\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\frange,2 we have upheld more onerous upward departures where the\n\ncircumstances warranted.   See, e.g., United States v. Rostoff,\n\n53 F.3d 398, 411 (1st Cir. 1995) (collecting cases).       Here,\n\nmoreover, the court sufficiently explained the extent of the\n\ndeparture by drawing an analogy to USSG §2G2.2(b)(4), which\n\nprovides for a five-level increase in the applicable offense\n\nlevel if there is a pattern of activity involving the sexual\n\nabuse of a minor.    The court fortified this explanation by a\n\nfurther analogy to USSG §2A3.1 (covering criminal sexual abuse),\n\nwhich if directly applicable (i) would have dictated an offense\n\nlevel of twenty-seven — six levels higher than that calculated\n\nfor the appellant, even after taking the upward departure into\n\naccount — and (ii) would have yielded a sentencing range of\n\nseventy to eighty-seven months.   See USSG Ch.5, Pt.A (sentencing\n\ntable).   The appellant's riposte — that he was sentenced as if\n\nhe had sexually penetrated his sisters-in-law, notwithstanding\n\nthe absence of any evidence of penetration — is a blustery\n\neffort to distract attention from what really happened.   In all\n\nevents, the charge comprises rank conjecture, wholly unsupported\n\nby the record.\n\n\n\n    2The appellant's pre-departure sentencing range topped out\nat twenty-seven months (offense level sixteen; criminal history\ncategory I). The lower court departed upward by five levels and\nimposed a forty-six month incarcerative sentence.\n\n                              -12-\n\f                                V\n\n          The appellant has one more sheaf of arrows in his\n\nquiver.   He posits that the upward departure, even if otherwise\n\nunimpugnable, violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause\n\nand the Due Process Clause.   The government brands these claims\n\nas waived.\n\n          We need not tarry over the waiver question.        The\n\nappellant raised this matched set of constitutional claims at\n\nthe original disposition hearing, but to no avail.       He then\n\nadvanced them in his first appeal, but we found it unnecessary\n\nto go down that road.   See Amirault, 173 F.3d at 35.   Although\n\nthe appellant did not reassert the claims at resentencing, he\n\ndid not explicitly renounce them.    We decline to find waiver in\n\nthese circumstances.    Cf. United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171\n\nF.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Our waiver doctrine does not\n\nrequire that a defendant, in order to preserve his rights on\n\nappeal, raise every objection that might have been relevant if\n\nthe district court had not already rejected the defendant's\n\narguments.\").\n\n          From the appellant's standpoint, however, this is a\n\nPyrrhic victory.   The law (or a judicial decree) violates the Ex\n\nPost Facto Clause if it \"changes the punishment, and inflicts a\n\ngreater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\n\n\n                              -13-\n\fcommitted.\"    Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 (1798).\n\nThe appellant asserts that the upward departure worked such a\n\nviolation because it increased his sentence based on conduct\n\nthat happened twenty years earlier (before the inception of the\n\nfederal sentencing guidelines and before the date on which\n\npossession of child pornography became a federal offense).\n\n          This    construct       is   ingenious,    but    incorrect.       The\n\nSupreme Court recently declared \"consideration of information\n\nabout the defendant's character and conduct at sentencing does\n\nnot result in 'punishment' for any offense other than the one of\n\nwhich the defendant was convicted.\"           Witte v. United States, 515\n\nU.S. 389, 401 (1995).        Thus, to the extent that the sentence\n\nimposed on the appellant inflicted a harsher punishment, it did\n\nso not with respect to the earlier sexual assaults but, rather,\n\nwith respect to his current crime:                the possession of child\n\npornography.      It    follows    inexorably     that     no   ex   post   facto\n\nproblem exists.        See Gryger v.

Regan, 989 F.2d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting that\n\n\"[t]he guidelines' criminal history provisions are routinely\n\napplied   to   increase     sentences     based     upon   convictions      that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\foccurred before the guidelines were adopted\"); see also United\n\nStates v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294, 1302 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           In a related vein, the appellant contends that the\n\nupward departure unconstitutionally deprived him of a statute-\n\nof-limitations defense and effectively increased his punishment\n\nby the use of temporally remote conduct for which he could no\n\nlonger have been prosecuted.        This argument is shopworn.\n\n           It is by now firmly settled that a sentencing court may\n\nconsider   as     relevant     conduct     acts    which   could     not    be\n\nindependently prosecuted because of the passage of time.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Valenti, 121 F.3d 327, 334 (7th Cir. 1997)\n\n(collecting cases); see also United States v. Dolloph, 75 F.3d\n\n35, 40 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that a sentencing court may\n\nconsider, as relevant conduct, acts that are not within the\n\ncourt's jurisdiction to try).        We hold that the same principle\n\nobtains in the realm of departures:               a sentencing court may\n\nconsider as a ground for departure under USSG §5K2.0 conduct\n\nthat   could    not   be   independently    prosecuted     because   of    the\n\npassage of time.\n\n           Finally, the appellant maintains that if the sentencing\n\nguidelines allow consideration of the sexual assaults, their\n\napplication violates due process.          The appellant is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f            From the standpoint of due process, a district court\n\nproperly may consider uncharged conduct at sentencing (as long\n\nas that conduct either is admitted or reliably proved by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence).              See Witte, 515 U.S. at 401.\n\nEven acquitted conduct may be so considered.              See United States\n\nv. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 157 (1997) (per curiam); United States\n\nv.

Despite   the\n\nprotracted    length      of   time   that   passed    between      the   sexual\n\nassaults and the appellant's commission of the child pornography\n\noffense,     the   Due    Process     Clause    furnishes      no    basis    for\n\nprohibiting a sentencing court from assessing the impact of the\n\nearlier conduct en route to determining the appropriateness vel\n\nnon of an upward departure.3\n\n                                       VI\n\n\n\n\n    3Although the appellant phrases this argument in terms of\nthe sentencing guidelines, we note that the adoption of the\nguidelines did not materially alter a sentencing court's\nhistoric discretion to consider \"'the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant's life and characteristics.'\"\nWatts, 519 U.S. at 152 (quoting Williams v.

The\n\nappellant contests each of the elements of the Dethlefs inquiry.\n\nWe consider those three arguments seriatim.              We then confront\n\nthe tag end of the appellant's asseverational array.\n\n                                     II\n\n           We deal expeditiously with the appellant's thesis that,\n\neven if the sexual assaults occurred, they cannot support an\n\nupward departure.       This thesis rests on the premise that the\n\nassaults happened many years before the offense of conviction\n\nand, thus, were not \"relevant conduct\" under USSG §1B1.3.                This\n\nargument is a red herring.\n\n           In this case, the district court did not rest its\n\ndecision   on   a    determination   that    the   sexual     assaults   were\n\nrelevant conduct, but, rather, concluded that the acts warranted\n\nan upward departure under section 5K2.0.           In doing so, the court\n\ndrew an analogy to USSG §2G2.2, the guideline that deals with\n\ntrafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a\n\nminor.     One of the specific offense characteristics of the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\ftrafficking guideline mandates a five-level increase in the base\n\noffense    level      \"[i]f     the    defendant   engaged        in   a      pattern   of\n\nactivity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\"\n\nUSSG §2G2.2(b)(4).         The pattern of sexual abuse or exploitation\n\nneed   not      occur    during       the   commission       of    the     offense      of\n\nconviction       in     order    to    constitute      this       specific       offense\n\ncharacteristic.          See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> comment. (n.1) </span><pre class=\"inline\">(explaining that the\n\nterm \"'[p]attern of activity involving the sexual abuse or\n\nexploitation of a minor,'\" as used in section 2G2.2(b)(4),\n\n\"means any combination of two or more separate instances of the\n\nsexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant,\n\nwhether or not the abuse or exploitation (A) occurred during the\n\ncourse    of    the   offense,        (B)   involved   the    same       or    different\n\nvictims, or (C) resulted in a conviction for such conduct\").\n\n               This approach was sound.            A sentencing court is free\n\nto make suitable comparisons and draw plausible analogies in\n\nconsidering whether to depart from the guideline sentencing\n\nrange.    So it was here:             although the guideline applicable to\n\nthe offense of conviction was section 2G2.4 (the possession\n\nguideline), not section 2G2.2 (the trafficking guideline), see\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198407\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Amirault,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198407/united-states-v-amirault/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the district court was entitled to\n\nexamine factors set out in section 2G2.2(b) in order to evaluate\n\nthe appropriateness of a departure.                 Simply because a specific\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\foffense characteristic is listed explicitly in one guideline but\n\nnot another does not mean that the factor may not be relevant to\n\nthe departure calculus in respect to an offense under the latter\n\nguideline.     See USSG §5K2.0, p.s.            Finding, as we do, that the\n\nlower court permissibly drew this analogy to USSG §2G2.2(b)(4)\n\nconfirms     the   suitability      of    the   court's    use    of   the   sexual\n\nassaults     (if    proven)   as    the    cornerstone      of   the   envisioned\n\ndeparture.\n\n             The   appellant's      theory      —   that   the   district     court\n\nsomehow was obliged to forgo the analogy and shape any such\n\ndeparture around the contours of the relevant conduct guideline\n\n— is jejune.        The relevant conduct guideline is not directed\n\nspecifically at section 5K2.0 departures.                  Rather, its purpose\n\nis to determine adjustments to the base offense level, taking\n\ninto account a defendant's overall behavior.                 See United States\n\nv.

Adjustments and\n\ndepartures are different species, dissimilar both in purpose and\n\nkind.   See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198902\"><a href=\"/opinion/198902/united-states-v-ortiz-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n151   (1st   Cir.    2000).        Not    surprisingly,     therefore,       upward\n\ndepartures are allowed for acts of misconduct not resulting in\n\nconviction, as long as those acts, whether or not relevant\n\nconduct in the section 1B1.3 sense, relate meaningfully to the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\foffense of conviction.            See United States v. Kim, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536984\"><a href=\"/opinion/536984/united-states-v-won-tae-kim/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n684 (2d Cir. 1990).\n\n            This is such a case.                The sexual assaults that the\n\nsentencing court found the appellant had committed were part of\n\na pattern of sexual exploitation of the minor sisters-in-law\n\nthat included, inter alia, the taking of approximately forty\n\nnude photographs and their retention in his child pornography\n\ncollection (for his sexual gratification).                  These snapshots not\n\nonly memorialized the assaults but also meaningfully related\n\nthem to the possession offense.                   Even if, as the appellant\n\ncontends, the snapshots were not \"sexually explicit\" under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2256(2) (1994), they nonetheless demonstrated rather\n\nconvincingly      his      prurient      interest   in    sexualized    images    of\n\nchildren.      In fact, he admitted to the police and to the court\n\nbelow   that    he      kept     these    particular      pictures     secret    and\n\nmasturbated with them.            Because the retained photographs link\n\nthe appellant's conduct during the offense of conviction to the\n\nearlier assaults, the assaults constituted an allowable ground\n\non which to premise an upward departure.\n\n            Battling on, the appellant insists that there exists\n\na temporal limit — in his words, a \"temporal wall\" — that\n\nprecludes   the      use    of   past     conduct   for    sentence-enhancement\n\npurposes,    and     that      these     two-decade-old     incidents     are    too\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdistant in time.       To further this argument, he notes that the\n\nsentencing guidelines themselves contain time limits on the use\n\nof past convictions, see USSG §4A1.2(e), and cites cases that\n\nquestion the propriety, in particular circumstances, of basing\n\nsentence enhancements on unrelated, remote convictions,                see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Aymelek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556393\"><a href=\"/opinion/556393/united-states-v-kaya-aymelek/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nYet, as the sentencing guidelines and the cases recognize, the\n\nappropriateness of a temporal limit depends heavily on the\n\ncircumstances of the particular case.           For example, even though\n\nthe sentencing guidelines generally restrict the use of dated\n\nconvictions,    they   do   allow    the    sentencing   court    leeway   to\n\nconsider such convictions if they provide \"evidence of similar,\n\nor serious dissimilar, criminal conduct.\"          USSG §4A1.2, comment.\n\n(n.8).\n\n          For the crime of trafficking in child pornography, the\n\nSentencing Commission has specifically addressed the propriety\n\nof basing an upward departure on a dated pattern or incident of\n\nsexual abuse or exploitation.              The most pertinent guideline\n\ncommentary teaches, with an exception that has no bearing here,\n\nthat   \"[i]f   the   defendant      engaged   in   the   sexual   abuse    or\n\nexploitation of a minor at any time (whether or not such abuse\n\nor exploitation occurred during the course of the offense or\n\nresulted in a conviction for such conduct) . . . an upward\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdeparture    may    be   warranted.\"     </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>    §2G2.2,     comment. </span><pre class=\"inline\">      (n.2)\n\n(emphasis    supplied).      Having    accepted      the   district   court's\n\nanalogy to section 2G2.2, we see no reason to disregard this\n\ncommentary.       It follows inexorably that there was no legal error\n\nin the lower court's determination that the sexual assaults,\n\nalthough occurring long ago, nevertheless could bear the weight\n\nof an upward departure under section 5K2.0.\n\n                                   III\n\n            The     appellant   couples        his    challenge       to     the\n\nappropriateness of the departure-justifying circumstance with a\n\nchallenge to the very existence of that circumstance.                 In this\n\nvein, he maintains that the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding that he had sexually assaulted his two sisters-in-law.\n\nThe appellant bases this remonstrance primarily on the two-\n\ndecade delay in the victims' revelations and the timing of those\n\nrevelations (they surfaced shortly after the commencement of his\n\ndivorce proceedings).        He marries this attack to an attack on\n\nthe reliability of his supposed admissions to the police, noting\n\nthat the reported statements were neither recorded nor submitted\n\nto him for signature and, in all events, were made in the\n\nimmediate aftermath of the turmoil engendered by his arrest.\n\n            Viewed in the abstract, these counter-arguments present\n\na plausible (although not inevitable) scenario different from\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fthat discerned by the district court.                But plausibility is not\n\nenough    to    carry      the   day.   We     review    a   sentencing   court's\n\nfactfinding deferentially, mindful of that court's superior\n\ncoign of vantage.           See Koon v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98\n\n(1996); United States v.

Give or take a few ruffles and flourishes, the\n\nappellant hawks the same set of arguments here that he proffered\n\nbelow.     The sentencing court rejected those arguments, choosing\n\ninstead to credit the detailed accounts contained in the victim\n\nimpact statements and to take the appellant's initial admissions\n\nof inappropriate contact at face value.                  The court found added\n\nsupport    for    the      occurrence   of     the   sexual    assaults   in   the\n\nappellant's taking and retention of the nude photographs of his\n\nsisters-in-law and credited the suggestion that the victims\n\nfailed     to    speak      out    earlier     due      to   fear,   shame,    and\n\nmortification.\n\n               There is no principled way that we can second-guess\n\nthese findings.            Because the record adequately supports the\n\ncourt's version of the controverted events, its rejection of the\n\nappellant's subsequent disavowals cannot be clearly erroneous.\n\nSee United States v.

This\n\ncase is no exception.\n\n         The court of appeals will interfere in the sentencing\n\ncourt's determination of the extent of an unguided departure\n\nonly upon a showing that the court has committed a manifest\n\nabuse of discretion.    See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Brewster,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.             In this\n\ninstance, the magnitude of the departure, standing alone, is\n\nunremarkable.    Although the district court departed upward by\n\nnineteen months to a point approximately seventy percent above\n\nthe maximum permitted under the applicable guideline sentencing\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\frange,2 we have upheld more onerous upward departures where the\n\ncircumstances warranted.   See, e.g., United States v. Rostoff,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411 (1st Cir. 1995) (collecting cases).       Here,\n\nmoreover, the court sufficiently explained the extent of the\n\ndeparture by drawing an analogy to USSG §2G2.2(b)(4), which\n\nprovides for a five-level increase in the applicable offense\n\nlevel if there is a pattern of activity involving the sexual\n\nabuse of a minor.    The court fortified this explanation by a\n\nfurther analogy to USSG §2A3.1 (covering criminal sexual abuse),\n\nwhich if directly applicable (i) would have dictated an offense\n\nlevel of twenty-seven — six levels higher than that calculated\n\nfor the appellant, even after taking the upward departure into\n\naccount — and (ii) would have yielded a sentencing range of\n\nseventy to eighty-seven months.   See USSG Ch.5, Pt.A (sentencing\n\ntable).   The appellant's riposte — that he was sentenced as if\n\nhe had sexually penetrated his sisters-in-law, notwithstanding\n\nthe absence of any evidence of penetration — is a blustery\n\neffort to distract attention from what really happened.   In all\n\nevents, the charge comprises rank conjecture, wholly unsupported\n\nby the record.\n\n\n\n    2The appellant's pre-departure sentencing range topped out\nat twenty-seven months (offense level sixteen; criminal history\ncategory I). The lower court departed upward by five levels and\nimposed a forty-six month incarcerative sentence.\n\n                              -12-\n\f                                V\n\n          The appellant has one more sheaf of arrows in his\n\nquiver.   He posits that the upward departure, even if otherwise\n\nunimpugnable, violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause\n\nand the Due Process Clause.   The government brands these claims\n\nas waived.\n\n          We need not tarry over the waiver question.        The\n\nappellant raised this matched set of constitutional claims at\n\nthe original disposition hearing, but to no avail.       He then\n\nadvanced them in his first appeal, but we found it unnecessary\n\nto go down that road.   See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198407\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Amirault,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/198407/united-states-v-amirault/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   Although\n\nthe appellant did not reassert the claims at resentencing, he\n\ndid not explicitly renounce them.    We decline to find waiver in\n\nthese circumstances.    Cf. United States v. Ticchiarelli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198379\"><a href=\"/opinion/198379/united-states-v-ticchiarelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Our waiver doctrine does not\n\nrequire that a defendant, in order to preserve his rights on\n\nappeal, raise every objection that might have been relevant if\n\nthe district court had not already rejected the defendant's\n\narguments.\").\n\n          From the appellant's standpoint, however, this is a\n\nPyrrhic victory.   The law (or a judicial decree) violates the Ex\n\nPost Facto Clause if it \"changes the punishment, and inflicts a\n\ngreater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\n\n\n                              -13-\n\fcommitted.\"    Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 (1798).\n\nThe appellant asserts that the upward departure worked such a\n\nviolation because it increased his sentence based on conduct\n\nthat happened twenty years earlier (before the inception of the\n\nfederal sentencing guidelines and before the date on which\n\npossession of child pornography became a federal offense).\n\n          This    construct       is   ingenious,    but    incorrect.       The\n\nSupreme Court recently declared \"consideration of information\n\nabout the defendant's character and conduct at sentencing does\n\nnot result in 'punishment' for any offense other than the one of\n\nwhich the defendant was convicted.\"           Witte v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117954\"><a href=\"/opinion/117954/witte-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401 (1995).        Thus, to the extent that the sentence\n\nimposed on the appellant inflicted a harsher punishment, it did\n\nso not with respect to the earlier sexual assaults but, rather,\n\nwith respect to his current crime:                the possession of child\n\npornography.      It    follows    inexorably     that     no   ex   post   facto\n\nproblem exists.        See Gryger v.

This argument is shopworn.\n\n           It is by now firmly settled that a sentencing court may\n\nconsider   as     relevant     conduct     acts    which   could     not    be\n\nindependently prosecuted because of the passage of time.
