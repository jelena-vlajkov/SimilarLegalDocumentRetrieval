Robert Nichols brought this\n\ndiversity action in the district court for the District of Maine\n\nto recover for personal injuries he suffered in a \"road rage\"\n\nattack    by     Oscar    Gonzalez,   a    truck       driver   employed    by   Land\n\nTransport Corp.           The parties consented to proceed before a\n\nmagistrate       judge,    who   granted        Land    Transport's    motion     for\n\nsummary judgment, concluding that under Maine law Gonzalez was\n\nnot acting within the scope of employment when he attacked\n\nNichols.\n\n               We review a summary judgment de novo, viewing the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to\n\ndetermine whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact.\n\nSee Sheehy v. Town of Plymouth, 191 F.3d 15, 19-20 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).      We agree with the magistrate judge and affirm the\n\njudgment.\n\n               On November 11, 1996, Nichols, driving his pickup\n\ntruck,     and    Gonzalez,      driving        a    tractor-trailer       for   Land\n\nTransport, were traveling westbound on Route 9 in eastern Maine.\n\nDriving    recklessly        behind   Nichols,          Gonzalez   made     multiple\n\nattempts to pass Nichols in no-passing zones, nearly causing a\n\ncollision, and followed Nichols at an unsafe distance.                       Nichols\n\nresponded twice with the predictable obscene gesture.                      When both\n\ndrivers stopped at a red light in Brewer, Gonzalez exited his\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\ftruck, confronted Nichols, and attacked him with a rubber-coated\n\nmetal cable.        In the ensuing struggle, Nichols briefly subdued\n\nGonzalez, but then fell to the ground, and Gonzalez stabbed him\n\nin the thigh with a knife.         Gonzalez was later convicted of\n\naggravated assault.\n\n              Nichols seeks to hold Land Transport vicariously liable\n\nfor Gonzalez's actions, alleging that Gonzalez was acting within\n\nthe   scope    of   employment.   Maine   courts   apply   the   test   of\n\nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 228 (1958) in determining\n\nwhether conduct is within the scope of employment.           See McLain\n\nv. Training & Dev. Corp., 572 A.2d 494, 497 (Me. 1990); see also\n\nLyons v. Brown, 158 F.3d 605, 609 (1st Cir. 1998); Bergeron v.\n\nHenderson, 47 F. Supp. 2d 61, 65 (D. Me. 1999).        The Restatement\n\ntest provides:\n\n              Conduct of a servant is within the scope of\n              employment if, but only if:\n              (a) it is of the kind he is employed to\n              perform;\n              (b) it occurs substantially within the\n              authorized time and space limits;\n              (c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a\n              purpose to serve the master, and\n              (d) if force is intentionally used by the\n              servant against another, the use of force is\n              not unexpectable by the master.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 228(1).\n\n              We confine our discussion to the third prong of the\n\ntest because we conclude as a matter of law that Nichols has not\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fsatisfied that prong.         There is no evidence in the record that\n\nGonzalez was in any way motivated by a purpose to serve Land\n\nTransport when he fought and stabbed Nichols.           Indeed, Nichols\n\ndoes not seriously contend otherwise.          Instead, he argues that\n\n\"an employer may be held liable for an assault by its employee\n\nwhen the assault arises out of an employment-related dispute and\n\nthe    assault    occurs    within   work-related   limits   of   time   and\n\nplace,\" regardless of whether the employee had a purpose to\n\nserve the employer.1\n\n              Nichols's argument is plainly incompatible with the\n\nRestatement rule.          This is obvious enough from the text of §\n\n228.       The Restatement commentary is even clearer, stating that\n\na master is not liable\n\n              if the servant has no intent to act on his\n              master's behalf, although the events from\n              which the tortious act follows arise while\n              the servant is acting in the employment and\n              the servant becomes angry because of them.\n              The fact that the servant acts in an\n              outrageous manner or inflicts a punishment\n              out of all proportion to the necessities of\n\n\n       1\n      Nichols's formulation includes the second prong of the\nRestatement § 228 test, requiring that the tort occur\nsubstantially within authorized time and space limits. He also\nacknowledges that foreseeability, essentially embodied in the\nfourth prong of the Restatement test (that the use of force be\nnot unexpectable by the master), is an additional requirement,\nwhich he contends is almost always a jury issue, and should have\nbeen here.    We do not address this contention because our\ndiscussion is limited to the third prong of the Restatement\ntest.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           his master's business is evidence indicating\n           that the servant has departed from the scope\n           of employment in performing the act.\n\nRestatement § 245, comment f.2\n\n           There is, nevertheless, a split of authority on the\n\nissue of whether a purpose to serve the master is a requirement\n\nfor respondeat superior liability.         Nichols cites cases from a\n\nnumber of jurisdictions holding that an assault can be within\n\nthe scope of employment if it arises out of an employment-\n\nrelated dispute, even if in committing the assault the servant\n\nlacked a purpose to serve the master.             See, e.g., Rivas v.\n\nNationwide Personal Sec. Corp., 559 So. 2d 668, 670 (Fla. Dist.\n\nCt. App. 1990);    Lange v. National Biscuit Co., 211 N.W.2d 783,\n\n404 (Minn. 1973); Life & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Padgett, 407 S.W.2d\n\n728, 730 (Ark. 1966); Carr v. Wm. C. Cromwell Co., 171 P.2d 5,\n\n7 (Cal. 1946).      We, however, are applying Maine law, which\n\nfollows the Restatement.         The cases from other jurisdictions\n\nthat support Nichols's position represent a rejection, rather\n\nthan an application, of Restatement § 228(1)(c).\n\n           For example, in a case heavily relied on by Nichols,\n\nWeinberg   v.   Johnson,   518   A.2d    985   (D.C.   1986),   the   court\n\n\n    2Restatement § 245, \"Use of Force,\" expands on the fourth,\n\"not unexpectable\" prong of the § 228(1) scope of employment\ntest. Its commentary, however, also speaks to the application\nof the other prongs of the test to torts involving the use of\nforce.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fpurported to apply the Restatement in holding that it was a jury\n\nissue      whether    a   laundromat   employee    acted    in   the   scope    of\n\nemployment in shooting a customer who was leaving the laundromat\n\nafter an argument with the employee concerning the customer's\n\nmissing shirts.           In reaching this conclusion, the court held\n\nthat       District   of    Columbia   law   had    so     evolved     that    the\n\nrequirement of a purpose to serve the master \"has become broad\n\nenough to embrace an intentional tort arising out of any dispute\n\nthat was originally undertaken on the employer's behalf.\"                      Id.\n\nat 991 (internal quotation marks omitted).                  This outcome has\n\nbeen criticized.           See Smith v. American Express Travel Related\n\nServs. Co., 876 P.2d 1166, 1171-72 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1994).                     It is\n\nunmistakably a departure from the Restatement rule.3\n\n              Despite the departure in some jurisdictions noted by\n\nNichols, many courts continue to hold that a purpose to serve\n\nthe master is necessary under Restatement § 228(1) to bring a\n\ntort within the scope of employment.              See, e.g. id. at 1170-72;\n\n\n       3\n     We also note that the rule adopted in Weinberg would not\nhelp Nichols in this case. The D.C. court did not extend the\nscope of employment to any assaults arising out an employment-\nrelated dispute, but rather to those \"arising out of any dispute\nthat was originally undertaken on the employer's behalf.\" 518\nA.2d at 991 (internal quotation marks omitted).            Here,\nGonzalez's dispute with Nichols was related to his driving on\nbehalf of Land Transport, but unlike the laundromat employee\narguing about the lost shirts in Weinberg, Gonzalez was not\nacting on his employer's behalf when he initiated the\nconfrontation with Nichols.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fStoot v. D & D Catering Service, Inc., 807 F.2d 1197, 1200 (5th\n\nCir. 1987) (maritime law); Williams v. Alyeska Pipeline Service\n\nCo., 650 P.2d 343, 350 (Alaska 1982); Kuehn v. White, 600 P.2d\n\n679, 681-82 (Wash. Ct. App. 1979); see also Manning v. Grimsley,\n\n643 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1981) (applying Massachusetts rule\n\nthat assault is within scope of employment only if it was in\n\nresponse to plaintiff's present interference with employee's\n\nduties).   We have been given no reason to think that Maine would\n\nleave this company.      Indeed, in a related context, examining\n\nvicarious liability for torts committed outside the scope of\n\nemployment under Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219(2)(d)\n\n(1958), we noted that the Maine Law Court follows the plain\n\nmeaning of that Restatement provision.           See Costos v. Coconut\n\nIsland Corp., 137 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1998).               We have no\n\nreason to believe that the plain meaning of Restatement § 228\n\nwould not govern here.       Under Maine law, a servant's tort is\n\ncommitted in the scope of employment only if it is actuated, at\n\nleast in part, by a purpose to serve the master.              It is not\n\nenough   that   the   tort   arises   out   of   an   employment-related\n\ndispute.\n\n           Although Kuehn v. White, 600 P.2d 679 (Wash. Ct. App.\n\n1979), is not a Maine case, it applies the Restatement test used\n\nin Maine to facts similar to the facts here and reached the same\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fresult.    In response to reckless driving by a tractor-trailer\n\ndriver, including unsafe passing attempts that almost caused a\n\ncollision, the plaintiff motorist made the familiar obscene\n\ngesture (or at least the truck driver believed he had).                      See id.\n\nat 681.    Both vehicles pulled over to the side of the road, a\n\nconfrontation ensued, and the truck driver struck the plaintiff\n\nrepeatedly with a two-foot-long metal pipe.                    See id.     The truck\n\ndriver was later convicted of assault.                   See id.     The Washington\n\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the summary judgment for the trucking\n\ncompany,    holding      that   where    the       evidence     showed     that     the\n\nemployee had \"assaulted Kuehn because of his personal anger\n\ntowards    Kuehn   and    not   because       of   any    intent     to    serve    the\n\nemployer,\"   as    required     by   Restatement          §   228,   the    scope    of\n\nemployment issue could be resolved in the employer's favor as a\n\nmatter of law.     Id. at 683.\n\n           The same is true in this case.                     Because Gonzalez's\n\nattack on Nichols was not actuated by a purpose to serve Land\n\nTransport, it was not within the scope of Gonzalez's employment,\n\nand Land Transport may not be held vicariously liable. 4                            The\n\n\n\n    4Land Transport also argues that it may not be held liable\nfor Gonzalez's conduct outside the scope of employment.      See\nRestatement § 219(2); Costos, 137 F.3d at 48-49. We need not\naddress this argument because Nichols's claim is premised solely\non his allegation that Gonzalez was acting within the scope of\nemployment.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fmagistrate judge did not err in entering summary judgment for\n\nLand Transport.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -10-\n\f",

Maine courts apply the test of Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 228 (1958) in determining whether conduct is within the scope of employment. See McLain v. Training &amp; Dev. Corp., 572 A.2d 494, 497 (Me. 1990); see also Lyons v. Brown, 158 F.3d 605, 609 (1st Cir. 1998); Bergeron v. Henderson, 47 F. Supp. 2d 61, 65 (D. Me. 1999). The Restatement test provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if, but only if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 228(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We confine our discussion to the third prong of the test because we conclude as a matter of law that Nichols has not satisfied that prong. There is no evidence in the record that Gonzalez was in any way motivated by a purpose to serve Land Transport when he fought and stabbed Nichols. Indeed, Nichols does not seriously contend otherwise. Instead, he argues that \"an employer may be held liable for an assault by its employee when the assault arises out of an employment-related dispute and the assault occurs within work-related limits of time and place,\" regardless of whether the employee had a purpose to serve the employer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nichols's argument is plainly incompatible with the Restatement rule. This is obvious enough from the text of &#167; 228. The Restatement commentary is even clearer, stating that a master is not liable if the servant has no intent to act on his master's behalf, although the events from which the tortious act follows arise while the servant is acting in the employment and the servant becomes angry because of them. The fact that the servant acts in an outrageous manner or inflicts a punishment out of all proportion to the necessities of his master's business is evidence indicating that the servant has departed from the scope of employment in performing the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Restatement &#167; 245, comment f.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, nevertheless, a split of authority on the issue of whether a purpose to serve the master is a requirement for respondeat superior liability. Nichols cites cases from a number of jurisdictions holding that an assault can be within the scope of employment if it arises out of an employment-related dispute, even if in committing the assault the servant lacked a purpose to serve the master. See, e.g., Rivas v. Nationwide Personal Sec. Corp., 559 So. 2d 668, 670 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990); Lange v. National Biscuit Co., 211 N.W.2d 783, 404 (Minn. 1973); Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v.

In reaching this conclusion, the court held that District of Columbia law had so evolved that the requirement of a purpose to serve the master \"has become broad enough to embrace an intentional tort arising out of any dispute that was originally undertaken on the employer's behalf.\" Id. at 991 (internal quotation marks omitted). This outcome has been criticized. See Smith v. American Express Travel Related Servs. Co., 876 P.2d 1166, 1171-72 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1994).

Under Maine law, a servant's tort is committed in the scope of employment only if it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master.

Driving recklessly behind Nichols, Gonzalez made multiple attempts to pass Nichols in no-passing zones, nearly causing a collision, and followed Nichols at an unsafe distance. Nichols responded twice with the predictable obscene gesture. When both drivers stopped at a red light in Brewer, Gonzalez exited his truck, confronted Nichols, and attacked him with a rubber-coated metal cable. In the ensuing struggle, Nichols briefly subdued Gonzalez, but then fell to the ground, and Gonzalez stabbed him in the thigh with a knife. Gonzalez was later convicted of aggravated assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nichols seeks to hold Land Transport vicariously liable for Gonzalez's actions, alleging that Gonzalez was acting within the scope of employment. Maine courts apply the test of Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 228 (1958) in determining whether conduct is within the scope of employment. See McLain v. Training &amp; Dev. Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span>, 497 (Me. 1990); see also Lyons v.

The Restatement test provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if, but only if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 228(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We confine our discussion to the third prong of the test because we conclude as a matter of law that Nichols has not satisfied that prong. There is no evidence in the record that Gonzalez was in any way motivated by a purpose to serve Land Transport when he fought and stabbed Nichols. Indeed, Nichols does not seriously contend otherwise. Instead, he argues that \"an employer may be held liable for an assault by its employee when the assault arises out of an employment-related dispute and the assault occurs within work-related limits of time and place,\" regardless of whether the employee had a purpose to serve the employer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nichols's argument is plainly incompatible with the Restatement rule. This is obvious enough from the text of &#167; 228. The Restatement commentary is even clearer, stating that a master is not liable if the servant has no intent to act on his master's behalf, although the events from which the tortious act follows arise while the servant is acting in the employment and the servant becomes angry because of them. The fact that the servant acts in an outrageous manner or inflicts a punishment out of all proportion to the necessities of his master's business is evidence indicating that the servant has departed from the scope of employment in performing the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Restatement &#167; 245, comment f.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, nevertheless, a split of authority on the issue of whether a purpose to serve the master is a requirement for respondeat superior liability. Nichols cites cases from a number of jurisdictions holding that an assault can be within the scope of employment if it arises out of an employment-related dispute, even if in committing the assault the servant lacked a purpose to serve the master.
