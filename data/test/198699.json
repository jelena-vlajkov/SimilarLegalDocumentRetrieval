Jos Antonio Fust, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lipez,\r\n\n                       Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Franklin Rodrguez Mangual and Enrique Alcaraz Micheli on\r\nbrief for appellants.\r\n   Johanna Emmanuelli Huertas and Law Offices of Pedro Ortiz\r\nAlvarez on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 26, 1999\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  This appeal presents a question\r\nconcerning the procedural path that must be followed to prosecute\r\na private action for a claimed violation of Title I of the\r\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.  12101-12213\r\n(1990).  Because the district court dismissed the case for lack of\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), our review\r\nis plenary.  See BIW Deceived v. Local S6, 132 F.3d 824, 830 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  In carrying out that task, we draw the underlying\r\nfacts from the plaintiffs' complaint (despite the defendant's\r\ndenial of several key aspects of the plaintiffs' account).  See\r\nViqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nPlaintiff-appellant Evelyn Bonilla worked as a sales\r\nclerk in a furniture store.  She underwent a surgical laminectomy\r\nin May 1997 and spent several weeks recuperating, returning to work\r\non August 1.  Since her regular routine required her to climb\r\nstairs in a two-story building and to move heavy furniture, she\r\nsought an accommodation from her employer, defendant-appellee\r\nMuebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc. (Alvarez).  She contends that Alvarez\r\nrefused her request, ordered her to stay away until she had\r\nrecovered fully, and told her that she would be relegated to part-\r\ntime work upon her return.\r\nTo make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the appellant\r\nleft that day and never returned.  Instead, she sued Alvarez ten\r\nmonths later, claiming a violation of the ADA.  Alvarez asked the\r\ndistrict court to dismiss the suit on the ground that the appellant\r\nhad neither filed a claim with, nor obtained a right-to-sue letter\r\nfrom, either the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or\r\nthe Department of Labor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  See 42\r\nU.S.C.  12117 (incorporating by reference, inter alia, 42 U.S.C.\r\n2000e-5(f)(1)).  The appellant replied that the ADA did not\r\nrequire such antecedent steps.  The district court agreed with\r\nAlvarez and dismissed the case.  We now consider whether\r\nadministrative action must be taken as a prerequisite to filing a\r\nfederal suit under Title I of the ADA.\r\nThe appellant contends that filing a claim with the EEOC\r\nbefore bringing an ADA case in federal court is an option, not a\r\nprerequisite.  We have not previously had the opportunity to\r\naddress this question.  We do so today.  We hold that the ADA\r\nmandates compliance with the administrative procedures specified in\r\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e, and\r\nthat, absent special circumstances (not present here), such\r\ncompliance must occur before a federal court may entertain a suit\r\nthat seeks recovery for an alleged violation of Title I of the ADA. \r\nAccord Dao v. Auchan Hypermarket, 96 F.3d 787, 789 (5th Cir. 1996);\r\nStewart v. County of Brown, 86 F.3d 107, 111 (7th Cir. 1996);\r\nMcSherry v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 81 F.3d 739, 740 n.3 (8th\r\nCir. 1996).\r\nRefined to bare essence, this appeal presents a question\r\nof statutory construction.  As with all such questions, we focus\r\nfirst on the words that Congress chose to implement its wishes. \r\nThe ADA states in relevant part:\r\n  The powers, remedies, and procedures set forth\r\nin sections 2000e-4, 2000e-5, 2000e-6, 2000e-\r\n8, and 2000e-9 of this title shall be the\r\npowers, remedies, and procedures this\r\nsubchapter provides to the [EEOC], to the\r\nAttorney General, or to any person alleging\r\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. . .\r\n.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.  12117.  This language leaves no room to quibble: \r\ninstead of starting entirely from scratch when drafting the ADA,\r\nCongress borrowed liberally from Title VII.  Among other things, it\r\nengrafted onto the ADA the full panoply of \"procedures\" described\r\nin section 2000e of Title VII, and decreed that those enumerated\r\nprocedures \"shall be\" applicable to proceedings under Title I of\r\nthe ADA.  In an age when Congress sometimes sounds an uncertain\r\ntrumpet, this message comes through loud and clear.  The question,\r\nthen, reduces to what these transplanted procedures are and how\r\nthey affect this case.\r\nFor present purposes, we narrow the lens of inquiry to\r\nsection 2000e-5 of Title VII, because it alone is germane to the\r\nissue posed by this appeal.  That section states in pertinent part\r\nthat a charge \"shall be filed\" with the EEOC \"within one hundred\r\nand eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice\r\noccurred,\" or within 300 days if \"the person aggrieved has\r\ninitially instituted proceedings with [an authorized] State or\r\nlocal agency.\"  42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(e).  This completes our quest: \r\na claimant who seeks to recover for an asserted violation of Title\r\nI of the ADA, like one who seeks to recover for an asserted\r\nviolation of Title VII, first must exhaust administrative remedies\r\nby filing a charge with the EEOC, or alternatively, with an\r\nappropriate state or local agency, within the prescribed time\r\nlimits.  The appellant has done neither.  This omission, if\r\nunexcused, bars the courthouse door, as courts long have recognized\r\nthat Title VII's charge-filing requirement is a prerequisite to the\r\ncommencement of suit.  See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\r\n411 U.S. 792, 798 (1973); Seymore v. Shawver &amp; Sons, Inc., 111 F.3d\r\n794, 799 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 342 (1997); Cheek v.\r\nWestern &amp; S. Life Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1994); see\r\nalso, Dao, 96 F.3d at 788-89 (applying Title VII's charge-filing\r\nrequirement in the ADA context); Stewart, 86 F.3d at 110-11 (same).\r\nWe say \"unexcused\" because this charge-filing\r\nrequirement, while obligatory, is not jurisdictional.  See Zipes v.\r\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982).  Rather, it\r\nis more akin to a statute of limitations and therefore subject to\r\nthe usual gamut of equitable exceptions.  See id.  The appellant\r\ngrasps at this straw and, as a fall-back, asks that we relax the\r\nrigors of the charge-filing requirement by applying equitable\r\ntolling here.\r\nWe begin our consideration of this solicitation with\r\nbedrock:  the baseline rule is that time limitations are important\r\nin discrimination cases, and that federal courts therefore should\r\nemploy equitable tolling sparingly.  See Rys v. United States\r\nPostal Serv., 886 F.2d 443, 446 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that\r\ncourts should take a \"narrow view\" of equitable exceptions to Title\r\nVII limitations periods); Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 871\r\nF.2d 179, 185 (1st Cir. 1989) (similar).  Because the relevant\r\nlimitation period originates in a federal statute, federal law\r\nsupplies the rule of decision in respect to the equitable tolling\r\nissue.  See Chico-Velez v. Roche Prods., Inc., 139 F.3d 56, 58 n.3\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).\r\nGenerally speaking   peculiar circumstances may leave\r\nsome wiggle room   equitable tolling is not appropriate unless a\r\nclaimant misses a filing deadline because of circumstances\r\neffectively beyond her control (such as when her employer actively\r\nmisleads her, and she relies on that misconduct to her detriment). \r\nSee Mack, 871 F.2d at 185; Earnhardt v. Puerto Rico, 691 F.2d 69,\r\n71 (1st Cir. 1982); see also Kelley v. NLRB, 79 F.3d 1238, 1248\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  Here, however, the appellant has laid claim to\r\nequitable tolling but has advanced no developed argumentation in\r\nsupport of her claim.  Moreover, her complaint does not allege any\r\nfacts that remotely suggest a plausible basis for such relief. \r\nThat ends the matter:  the federal standard reserves equitable\r\ntolling for exceptional cases, and the appellant has done nothing\r\nto bring herself within that tiny sphere.\r\nWe need go no further.  Because the appellant\r\ninexcusably failed to take administrative action that is a\r\nprerequisite to filing a federal suit under Title I of the ADA, the\r\njudgment below must be\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

Local S6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749863\"><a href=\"/opinion/749863/biw-deceived-v-local-s6-industrial-union-of-marine-and-shipbuilding/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>, 830 (1st Cir. 1997). In carrying out that task, we draw the underlying facts from the plaintiffs' complaint (despite the defendant's denial of several key aspects of the plaintiffs' account). See Viqueira v. First Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197886\"><a href=\"/opinion/197886/jamie-viqueira-v-first-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Evelyn Bonilla<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> worked as a sales clerk in a furniture store. She underwent a surgical laminectomy in May 1997 and spent several weeks recuperating, returning to work on August 1. Since her regular routine required her to climb stairs in a two-story building and to move heavy furniture, she sought an accommodation from her employer, defendant-appellee Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc. (Alvarez). She contends that Alvarez refused her request, ordered her to stay away until she had recovered fully, and told her that she would be relegated to part-time work upon her return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the appellant left that day and never returned. Instead, she sued Alvarez ten months later, claiming a violation of the ADA. Alvarez asked the district court to dismiss the suit on the ground that the appellant had neither filed a claim with, nor obtained a right-to-sue letter from, either the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the Department of Labor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12117 (incorporating by reference, inter alia, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(1)). The appellant replied that the ADA did not require such antecedent steps. The district court agreed with Alvarez and dismissed the case. We now consider whether administrative action must be taken as a prerequisite to filing a federal suit under Title I of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that filing a claim with the EEOC before bringing an ADA case in federal court is an option, not a prerequisite. We have not previously had the opportunity to address this question. We do so today. We hold that the ADA mandates compliance with the administrative procedures specified in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e, and that, absent special circumstances (not present here), such compliance must occur before a federal court may entertain a suit that seeks recovery for an alleged violation of Title I of the ADA.

As with all such questions, we focus first on the words that Congress chose to implement its wishes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The ADA states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The powers, remedies, and procedures set forth in sections 2000e-4, 2000e-5, 2000e-6, 2000e-8, and 2000e-9 of this title shall be the powers, remedies, and procedures this subchapter provides to the [EEOC], to the Attorney General, or to any person alleging discrimination on the basis of disability. . . .42 U.S.C. &#167; 12117. This language leaves no room to quibble: instead of starting entirely from scratch when drafting the ADA, Congress borrowed liberally from Title VII. Among other things, it engrafted onto the ADA the full panoply of \"procedures\" described in section 2000e of Title VII, and decreed that those enumerated procedures \"shall be\" applicable to proceedings under Title I of the ADA. In an age when Congress sometimes sounds an uncertain trumpet, this message comes through loud and clear. The question, then, reduces to what these transplanted procedures are and how they affect this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, we narrow the lens of inquiry to section 2000e-5 of Title VII, because it alone is germane to the issue posed by this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That section states in pertinent part that a charge \"shall be filed\" with the EEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\" or within 300 days if \"the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with [an authorized] State or local agency.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This completes our quest: a claimant who seeks to recover for an asserted violation of Title I of the ADA, like one who seeks to recover for an asserted violation of Title VII, first must exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC, or alternatively, with an appropriate state or local agency, within the prescribed time limits. The appellant has done neither. This omission, if unexcused, bars the courthouse door, as courts long have recognized that Title VII's charge-filing requirement is a prerequisite to the commencement of suit.

Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 798 (1973); Seymore v.

See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110655\"><a href=\"/opinion/110655/zipes-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 393 (1982). Rather, it is more akin to a statute of limitations and therefore subject to the usual gamut of equitable exceptions. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110655\"><a href=\"/opinion/110655/zipes-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> The appellant </a></span>grasps at this straw and, as a fall-back, asks that we relax the rigors of the charge-filing requirement by applying equitable tolling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our consideration of this solicitation with bedrock: the baseline rule is that time limitations are important in discrimination cases, and that federal courts therefore should employ equitable tolling sparingly. See Rys v. United States Postal Serv., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529934\"><a href=\"/opinion/529934/john-e-rys-jr-v-us-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 446 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that courts should take a \"narrow view\" of equitable exceptions to Title VII limitations periods); Mack v.

Because the relevant limitation period originates in a federal statute, federal law supplies the rule of decision in respect to the equitable tolling issue. See Chico-Velez v. Roche Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752408\"><a href=\"/opinion/752408/felix-chico-velez-v-roche-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 58 n.3 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking -- peculiar circumstances may leave some wiggle room -- equitable tolling is not appropriate unless a claimant misses a filing deadline because of circumstances effectively beyond her control (such as when her employer actively misleads her, and she relies on that misconduct to her detriment). See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mack,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>; Earnhardt v.

Here, however, the appellant has laid claim to equitable tolling but has advanced no developed argumentation in support of her claim. Moreover, her complaint does not allege any facts that remotely suggest a plausible basis for such relief. That ends the matter: the federal standard reserves equitable tolling for exceptional cases, and the appellant has done nothing to bring herself within that tiny sphere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Because the appellant inexcusably failed to take administrative action that is a prerequisite to filing a federal suit under Title I of the ADA, the judgment below must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Bonilla's husband, Rafael Colon, also appears as a plaintiff.
