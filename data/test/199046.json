William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                     Boudin, Stahl, and Lynch,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Christopher J. Meade, American Civil Liberties Union, with whom\nAllan M. Tow was on brief, for petitioner, appellant.\n     Lyle D. Jentzer, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, Civil\nDivision, U.S. Department of Justice, with whom David W. Ogden, Acting\nAssistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Norah A. Schwarz,\n\fSenior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, were on\nbrief, for respondents, appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                            May 8, 2000\n\f-3-\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Before April 1996, lawful permanent\n\nresident aliens who were deportable because they had committed certain\n\ncriminal offenses had one last hope to remain in the United States.\n\nThey could apply for a waiver of deportation, technically known as a §\n\n212(c) waiver, and the Attorney General, by act of grace, could grant\n\nrelief.1 The act of grace was not rare: in the years immediately\n\npreceding the statute's passage, over half the applications were\n\ngranted.   See Mojica v. Reno, 970 F. Supp. 130, 178 (E.D.N.Y.\n\n1997); cf. Wallace v. Reno, 24 F. Supp. 2d 104, 110 (D. Mass.\n\n1998).\n\n           Congress changed this in April of 1996 when it passed AEDPA,\n\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. Law No.\n\n104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. In AEDPA § 440(d), Congress eliminated §\n\n212(c) relief for a significant number of criminal aliens.          In\n\nSeptember of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and\n\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. Law No. 104-208,\n\n110 Stat. 3009-546. IIRIRA eliminated § 212(c) relief altogether and\n\n\n\n\n     1    Prior to 1996, § 212(c) relief was available for an\nalien who was deportable because of an aggravated felony\nconviction as long as the alien had served less than five years\nin prison for the conviction.           See Immigration and\nNaturalization Act (INA) § 212(c), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994).\nThe only other requirement for relief under § 212(c) prior to AEDPA was\nthat the alien have maintained \"lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven\nconsecutive years\" in the United States. See id.\n\n                                 -3-\n\freplaced it with a new form of relief, \"cancellation of removal.\" See\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b. Compared with pre-AEDPA § 212(c) relief, this new\n\nform of relief applies to a much smaller group of aliens who have\n\ncommitted crimes. Compare id. § 1229b(a), with INA § 212(c), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(c) (1994).\n\n          Some deportable aliens, as a result, have been caught in the\n\ntransition between the different legal schemes established by these\n\nstatutory changes. Thus, a series of questions has arisen as to which\n\naliens are subject to which rules. Congress was not explicit in this\n\nregard, and so it has fallen to the courts to try to best determine\n\nwhat Congress intended and, failing that, which judicial default rules\n\nshould apply.\n\n          This case is the third in a trilogy of cases that has dealt\n\nwith those types of questions. The first question was whether § 212(c)\n\nrelief had been eliminated for deportable aliens who had applications\n\nfor such relief pending when AEDPA became effective. We answered that\n\nquestion \"no\" in Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 133 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\ncert. denied, 526 U.S. 1004 (1999). The second question was whether\n\nsuch relief was nonetheless eliminated as to aliens who had not applied\n\nfor § 212(c) relief prior to AEDPA's effective date but against whom\n\ndeportation proceedings had begun as of that date. We answered that\n\nquestion \"no\" in Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 285 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           This case presents a third question, one which we expressly\n\nreserved in Wallace: whether § 212(c) relief was eliminated for aliens\n\nwhose convictions predated AEDPA's passage but who were not placed into\n\ndeportation proceedings until after AEDPA's passage. See id. at 287.\n\nWe answer \"yes, except.\"      The \"except\" is for cases where the\n\ndeportable alien has demonstrated to the INS that, prior to AEDPA's\n\npassage, he or she actually relied on the availability of § 212(c)\n\nrelief in entering a guilty plea or not contesting a criminal charge.\n\nFor the reasons stated herein, we affirm the dismissal of the habeas\n\npetition and vacate the stay of deportation.2\n\n                                  I\n\n           Dwight W. Mattis is a native and citizen of Jamaica. In\n\nFebruary 1989, at the age of sixteen, he entered the United States as\n\na lawful permanent resident and has been here since. He is married to\n\na U.S. citizen and he has a child. The rest of his family is in this\n\ncountry. For several years, he ran two beauty salons in Springfield,\n\nMassachusetts, that had several employees. He lives within walking\n\ndistance of his parents' home and has occasionally given them financial\n\nsupport.\n\n\n\n\n     2    Mattis presents another claim: that AEDPA § 404(d) violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause because it bars § 212(c) relief for\ndeportable aliens but not for excludable aliens. This court has\npreviously rejected that argument, see Almon v. Reno, 192 F.3d 28, 32\n(1st Cir. 1999), and we do not revisit the issue here.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f               On January 22, 1997, the INS issued an Order to Show Cause\n\nagainst Mattis, charging him with deportability as an alien convicted\n\nof a controlled substance violation under former INA § 241(a)(2)(B)(i),\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i) (1994), and as an alien convicted of an\n\naggravated felony under former INA § 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1994).3 The charges were based upon convictions\n\nfor five different offenses: (1) a 1991 conviction for possession of\n\ncocaine; (2) a 1992 conviction for possession of cocaine; (3) a 1994\n\nconviction for possession of marijuana; (4) a 1995 conviction for\n\ntrafficking in cocaine; and (5) a 1995 conviction for statutory rape.4\n\nAt his deportation hearing, Mattis admitted the INS's allegations and\n\nmade no objection to the INS's entry into evidence of certified copies\n\nof the convictions.          Mattis sought relief in the form of a\n\ndiscretionary waiver of deportation under INA § 212(c).\n\n               After the hearing, the IJ ruled that the INS had proven, by\n\nclear    and    convincing   evidence,     that   Mattis   was   deportable.\n\nSpecifically, the IJ found that the INS had established deportability\n\non two grounds: (1) Mattis's conviction of a controlled substance\n\noffense under former INA § 241(a)(2)(B)(i), and (2) his convictions of\n\n\n\n     3    INA §§ 241(a)(2)(B)(i) and (a)(2)(A)(iii) have been\ntransferred to INA §§ 237(a)(2)(B)(i) and (a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C.\n§§ 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) and (a)(2)(A)(iii). See IIRIRA § 305(a)(2).\n     4    Except for Mattis's 1991 conviction for possession of\ncocaine, the convictions were all obtained through guilty pleas.\n\n                                     -6-\n\faggravated felonies under former INA § 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), pursuant to\n\nthree separate statutory definitions of \"aggravated felony.\" Mattis's\n\naggravated felonies included (1) trafficking in cocaine, which is an\n\naggravated felony under INA § 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B);\n\n(2) statutory rape, which is an aggravated felony under INA\n\n§ 101(a)(43)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A); and (3) statutory rape,\n\nwhich is also an aggravated felony under INA § 101(a)(43)(F), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(43)(F). Applying AEDPA § 440(d), the IJ denied Mattis's\n\napplication for § 212(c) relief because he was deportable by reason of\n\nhaving been convicted of an aggravated felony. The BIA upheld this\n\ndecision.5\n\n          The \"aggravated felony\" point has some importance. IIRIRA\n\nexpanded the definition of \"aggravated felony.\" See IIRIRA § 321.\n\nUnder former INA § 101(a)(43), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) (1994), only\n\n\n     5     The denial of the application for § 212(c) relief by the IJ\nand BIA was based on the Attorney General's position in Matter of\nSoriano, Int. Dec. 3289, 1996 WL 426888 (Op. Att'y Gen. Feb. 21, 1997).\nSoriano held that AEDPA § 440(d)'s elimination of § 212 relief for\ncertain aliens applied immediately as of April 24, 1996, to all cases,\nincluding those with § 212(c) applications pending. See id. We\ndisagreed with Soriano in Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 133.\n           To the best of our knowledge, the Attorney General has not\nissued a new interpretation on the question of AEDPA § 440(d)'s reach\nin light of Goncalves and Wallace or the opinions of the majority of\nthe circuits that have reached the same outcomes as those two cases.\n\n          Thus, on the precise question before us, all we have is the\nlitigating position of the government as expressed in its brief, which\nis not entitled to much deference. See Massachusetts v. Blackstone\nValley Elec. Co., 67 F.3d 981, 991 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fMattis's cocaine trafficking conviction would have constituted an\n\naggravated felony conviction. The expanded definition of \"aggravated\n\nfelony,\" which renders Mattis's statutory rape conviction an aggravated\n\nfelony on two grounds, applies to Mattis, since \"action\" was taken on\n\nhis case after IIRIRA's passage. See IIRIRA § 321(c); Choeum v. INS,\n\n129 F.3d 29, 36-37 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          Mattis filed a petition for habeas corpus in the\n\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, seeking review of\n\nthe BIA's decision.6    Mattis argued there, as he does here, that\n\napplying AEDPA § 440(d) to preclude him from eligibility for a\n\n§ 212(c) waiver of deportation constitutes an impermissible\n\nretroactive application of the section because his guilty pleas\n\npre-dated AEDPA's passage.       The district court dismissed his\n\npetition, finding that applying AEDPA § 440(d) to Mattis would\n\nnot have a retroactive effect.     See Mattis v. Reno, 44 F. Supp.\n\n2d 379, 383-84 (D. Mass. 1999).        The district court reasoned\n\nthat because the INS had not instituted deportation proceedings\n\nagainst Mattis until nine months after he pled guilty to the\n\n1995 charges, Mattis could not have had a reliance interest in\n\n\n\n     6    The government acknowledges that this court's decision in\nWallace, 194 F.3d at 285, makes clear that habeas relief remains\navailable in the district courts to aliens such as Mattis.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthe availability of § 212(c) relief when he pled guilty.            See\n\nid. at 384.    Mattis then filed this appeal.\n\n           The petition involves a pure issue of law and review\n\nis de novo.    See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 116.\n\n                                   II\n\nA.   Statutory Provisions\n\n           AEDPA § 440(d) narrowed the availability of § 212(c)\n\nrelief by rendering ineligible (for withholding of deportation)\n\nany alien deportable because of, inter alia, an aggravated\n\nfelony conviction, regardless of the amount of time served.7 See\n\nAEDPA § 440(d) (removing availability of § 212(c) relief for\n\naliens who are \"deportable by reason of having committed any\n\ncriminal      offense\"   covered        in,   inter   alia,   INA    §\n\n241(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated felons)).        Section 440(d), unlike\n\nsome other sections of AEDPA, has no specified temporal reach.\n\nSee Wallace, 194 F.3d at 286 (stating that certain sections of\n\n\n\n     7     AEDPA § 440(d) also renders ineligible for § 212(c) relief\naliens, such as Mattis, who are deportable because of drug convictions.\nSee AEDPA § 440(d) ( removing availability of § 212(c) relief for\naliens who are \"deportable by reason of having committed any\ncriminal offense\" covered in, inter alia, § 241(a)(2)(B)\n(controlled substance offenses)). The IJ did not rely on this\nground for ineligibility in pretermitting Mattis's application and so\nit is not before us.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fAEDPA    are   expressly    retroactive    and    others      expressly\n\nprospective,    while   §   440(d)     contains   no   such     express\n\nprovisions).\n\n          Absent § 440(d), Mattis would have been eligible for\n\nconsideration for § 212(c) relief at his deportation hearing.\n\nBy the time the Show Cause Order issued, Mattis had apparently\n\nmaintained seven consecutive years of residency in the United\n\nStates,8 and he had served less than five years in prison for his\n\naggravated felony convictions.       There is also no question that\n\nMattis would be ineligible for § 212(c) relief if AEDPA § 440(d)\n\napplies to him.9\n\n\n\n\n     8    There is no evidence in the record as to whether Mattis in\nfact maintained continuous lawful residency in the United States, but\nthe INS does not argue to the contrary.\n     9    Mattis makes an argument based on the equities that had\nthe INS prosecuted his case in a more timely fashion, he would\nlikely have remained eligible, under Wallace, to apply for\n§ 212(c) relief. It is worth noting that, had the INS waited\nuntil April 1, 1997 (three more months) to prosecute Mattis's\ncase -- a decision that would not be reviewable in any court,\nsee INA § 242(g), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g); Reno v. American-Arab\nAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999) -- Mattis\nwould not have been able to apply for a waiver, as his case\nwould have been governed by the permanent provisions of IIRIRA,\nsee Prado v. Reno, 198 F.3d 286, 288 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999), and\nINA § 240A, the relevant permanent provision enacted by IIRIRA,\ndoes not allow for waivers for aggravated felons.\n\n                                -10-\n\fB. Retroactivity Analysis\n\n           The \"presumption against retroactive legislation is\n\ndeeply rooted in our jurisprudence,\" and the \"principle that the\n\nlegal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the\n\nlaw that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and\n\nuniversal appeal.\" Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244,\n\n265 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nAccordingly, absent Congress's clear intent to the contrary, we\n\npresume that a law will not apply retroactively to conduct that\n\noccurred prior to the law's enactment.         See Hughes Aircraft Co.\n\nv. United States, 520 U.S. 939, 946 (1997).                 Thus, we first\n\nattempt to discern congressional intent.            If that intent is not\n\nclear, a second-level inquiry must be made to ascertain whether\n\napplying   the   law   to   the    conduct    at    issue    would   have   a\n\n\"retroactive     effect,\"   id.,     as   a   law     does    not    operate\n\nretroactively \"merely because it is applied in a case arising\n\nfrom conduct antedating [its] enactment,\"            Landgraf 511 U.S. at\n\n269.   This second inquiry \"demands a common sense, functional\n\njudgment about 'whether the new provision attaches new legal\n\nconsequences to events completed before its enactment.'\" Martin\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fv. Hadix, 119 S. Ct. 1998, 2006 (1999) (quoting Landgraf, 511\n\nU.S. at 270).\n\n1. Congressional Intent\n\n           Congress's intent with regard to the proper scope of\n\n§ 440(d) is not clear.      In Goncalves, we were faced with the\n\nquestion of whether the section should apply to an alien who not\n\nonly was in deportation proceedings at the time of AEDPA's\n\npassage, but also had already applied for relief under § 212(c)\n\nprior to\n\nAEDPA's passage.    See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 133.        We examined\n\nthe statutory language and legislative history of § 440(d) and\n\nother relevant sections, and, employing these \"traditional tools\n\nof statutory construction,\" id. at 127 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citations omitted), we concluded that Congress most likely\n\ndid not intend § 440(d) to remove eligibility for § 212(c)\n\nrelief   from   those   whose    applications   were   pending   on   the\n\neffective date of AEDPA.        See id. at 133.   Most other circuits\n\nagreed with the outcome, for this and other reasons.                  See\n\nMagana-Pizano v. INS, 200 F.3d 603, 611 (9th Cir. 1999); Pak v.\n\nReno, 196 F.3d 666, 675-76 (6th Cir. 1999); Shah v. Reno, 184\n\nF.3d 719, 724 (8th Cir. 1999); Mayers v. United States Dep't of\n\n                                   -12-\n\fINS, 175 F.3d 1289, 1304 (11th Cir. 1999); Sandoval v. INS, 166\n\nF.3d 225, 242 (3d Cir. 1999); Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106,\n\n130 (2d Cir. 1998); cf. Tasios v. Reno, 204 F.3d 544, 552 (4th\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n         In Wallace, the question was whether § 440(d) should\n\napply to aliens who were in deportation proceedings prior to\n\nAEDPA's passage but who had not yet applied for § 212(c) relief.\n\nAs to that situation, we concluded that we could not discern a\n\nclear expression of congressional intent and applied judicial\n\ndefault rules.   See Wallace, 194 F.3d at 286-87.\n\n         Now, we are faced with a situation two steps removed\n\nfrom the situation in Goncalves and one step removed from the\n\nsituation in Wallace.   Nothing in the language of AEDPA or its\n\nhistory renders us any more able to discern congressional intent\n\nas to the present question than we were able to in Wallace.   The\n\ncircuits that have faced the exact question before us have also\n\nfound that Congress's intent with regard to § 440(d)'s reach is\n\nambiguous.    See, e.g., Tasios, 204 F.3d at 548-49;    Magana-\n\nPizano, 200 F.3d at 612; Jurado-Gutierrez v. Greene, 190 F.3d\n\n1135, 1150 (10th Cir. 1999); DeSousa v. Reno, 190 F.3d 175, 186-\n\n87 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n                              -13-\n\f2. Retroactive Effect\n\n          That ambiguity forces us to decide whether applying\n\n§ 440(d) to Mattis would have a retroactive effect.        Using the\n\nSupreme Court's terminology, we must determine if applying the\n\nsection to Mattis would deprive him of \"legitimate expectations\n\nand upset settled transactions.\"          General Motors Corp. v.\n\nRomein, 503 U.S. 181, 191 (1992).       We examine \"the nature and\n\nextent of the change in the law and the degree of connection\n\nbetween the operation of the new rule and a relevant past\n\nevent.\"   Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 270.\n\n          The INS argues that applying § 440(d) to Mattis would not\n\nhave a retroactive effect because Mattis could not possibly have\n\ncommitted the underlying criminal offenses in reliance on the\n\navailability of discretionary relief.10 With deference, we think that\n\n\n     10    In inquiring into retroactive effect in cases identical to\nthis one, some courts have viewed the alien's underlying criminal act\nas a \"relevant past event.\" See, e.g., Jurado-Gutierrez, 190 F.3d at\n1151 (\"Petitioners had no settled expectations of discretionary relief\nwhen they committed their crimes.\"); Requena-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell,\n190 F.3d 299, 308 (5th Cir. 1999) (noting that \"[the alien] could\nnot seriously suggest that he would have refrained from\n[committing the criminal act] . . . had he only known that . .\n. he would not be eligible [for a waiver of deportation]\");\nDeSousa, 190 F.3d at 187 (\"The consequences of petitioner's\ncriminal conduct were clear at the time of that conduct and they\nremain unchanged today.\" (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted)); Turkhan v. Perryman, 188 F.3d 814, 828 (7th Cir.\n\n                                -14-\n\fis the wrong focus for several reasons. First, it is the conviction,\n\nnot the underlying criminal act, that triggers the disqualification\n\nfrom § 212(c) relief. Second, the focus on the underlying primary\n\nconduct is too narrow. In Hughes Aircraft, the Supreme Court did not\n\nfocus solely on whether the statutory amendment to the False Claims Act\n\nthat partially removed a bar to private suits made it more or less\n\nlikely the company would engage in a violation of the Act. Rather, in\n\naddition to examining the new law's impact on the filing of false\n\nclaims, see Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.S. at 947-48, the Court also focused\n\non the consequence to a company once a False Claims Act claim was\n\nbrought, see id. at 948.    That consequence was to \"eliminate[] a\n\ndefense to a qui tam suit . . . and therefore change[] the substance of\n\nthe existing cause of action for qui tam defendants.\"        Id.   More\n\nclosely on point, our opinion in Wallace viewed an alien's decisions\n\nand actions during his deportation proceedings, and not his underlying\n\ncriminal act, as the \"relevant past event\" for purposes of the\n\nretroactivity analysis. We explained in Wallace that, by the time an\n\nalien has been placed in deportation proceedings, \"the waiver rules .\n\n\n\n1999) (stating that \"[i]t would border on the absurd to argue\nthat these aliens might have decided not to commit drug crimes\n. . . had they known . . . they could not ask for a\ndiscretionary waiver of deportation\" (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)). We agree with all of those statements\nas to the aliens' interests at the time they committed the\ncrimes, but we do not find them dispositive.\n\n                                 -15-\n\f. . become a common focus of expectation and even reliance.\"       See\n\nWallace, 194 F.3d at 287. Further, \"an alien's choice of strategy in\n\n[the deportation] proceeding may well be affected by the chances of\n\nwaiver.\"   Id.\n\n           Because Mattis had not yet been placed into deportation\n\nproceedings when AEDPA became law, our reasoning in Wallace does not\n\ndispose of this case. Mattis's reliance and expectation interests are\n\nnot nearly as strong as the interests presented by the petitioners in\n\nGoncalves and Wallace. In the present case, unlike in Goncalves, there\n\nwas no summary dismissal of a pending § 212(c) petition that was\n\nentirely authorized at the time it was filed.        And, unlike the\n\nsituation in Wallace, there was no changing of the rules once a\n\ndeportation proceeding had been started. Mattis's only reliance and\n\nexpectancy interests were those he had at the time he pled guilty,\n\nknowing that he could be deported as a consequence.\n\n           Here, as in Wallace, it has fallen to the courts to draw a\n\nline, applying judicial default rules.11   The line in this case could\n\nbe drawn in various places.      The three most evident are:\n\n           1. that § 212(c) relief is eliminated for all deportable\n           aliens with the requisite criminal convictions, where\n           deportation proceedings commenced after the passage of AEDPA\n           -- the position urged by the government;\n\n\n\n     11   Of course, when Congress does not specify where to draw the\nlines, we assume that it makes this choice against a background of\njudicial decisions that have established default rules.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          2. that § 212(c) relief is unaffected by AEDPA § 440(d) for\n          all deportable aliens in such circumstances -- the position\n          urged by Mattis; or\n\n          3. that § 212(c) relief continues to be available for\n          deportable aliens whose requisite criminal convictions pre-\n          dated AEDPA, if, and only if, the alien actually and\n          reasonably relied on the availability of § 212(c) relief\n          when he pled guilty to or did not contest the criminal\n          charges.\n\nWe adopt the third rule, which we believe best fits with the approach\n\nthe Supreme Court has taken to issues of retroactivity.\n\n          Retroactivity analysis arises in different contexts that pose\n\ndifferent questions, and the tests articulated by the Supreme Court\n\ncannot be applied mechanically. Prior decisions are not on point. The\n\nquestion here is not whether a new statute restricting relief applies\n\nto pending proceedings for that relief. That was the question in Lindh\n\nv. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 322-23 (1997), and in Goncalves. The question\n\nhere is not whether a new statute restricting relief applies to pending\n\nproceedings even though an application for the specific relief had not\n\nbeen made prior to the statute's enactment. That was the situation in\n\nWallace. The question here is not whether a new statute eliminating a\n\ndefense to a cause of action applies in pending suits where the conduct\n\nthat gave rise to the suit pre-dated the new statute. That was the\n\nsituation in Hughes Aircraft. The question here is not whether a new\n\nstatute eliminating attorney's fees for work performed applies (a) to\n\nwork that was done before the enactment of the statute and for which\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fthere was a reasonable expectation of payment or (b) to work that was\n\ndone after the statute's enactment but in cases pending at the time of\n\nthe statute's enactment. That was the situation in Hadix. In each of\n\nthese different situations, the familiar two-step retroactivity\n\nanalysis was undertaken. And in each of these cases, the second step\n\nof the analysis -- applying judicial default rules -- weighed\n\nconsiderations of potential\n\nunfairness (including both fair notice and reliance) against the\n\nintended purposes and benefits of the statute. We apply the same\n\ncalculus here.\n\n          The general thrust of IIRIRA and AEDPA is clear. As the\n\ndistrict court noted, it is difficult to believe that Congress, despite\n\nhaving narrowed the eligibility for § 212(c) relief, wanted such relief\n\nto remain available for years to come in all deportation proceedings\n\nbegun after April 1996 simply because the alien was convicted before\n\nApril 1996. Cf. Barreiro v. INS, 989 F.2d 62, 64 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nCongress's clear intent in passing AEDPA and IIRIRA was to facilitate\n\nthe deportation of criminal aliens by broadening the class of crimes\n\nthat render an alien deportable and by narrowing the class of\n\ndeportable criminal aliens eligible for discretionary relief.12   With\n\n     12    In addition to narrowing eligibility for § 212(c) relief by\nenacting AEDPA § 440(d), Congress, in AEDPA § 435, expanded the range\nof criminal convictions that render an alien deportable. Compare 8\nU.S.C.    §    1251(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)     (1994),    with    8   U.S.C.\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). In IIRIRA § 309, Congress eliminated § 212(c)\n\n                                 -18-\n\fregard to waivers for aggravated felons, the permanent provision of\n\nIIRIRA that replaced § 212(c) continues to exclude aggravated felons\n\nfrom eligibility.    See supra note 9.\n\n           It is one thing not to apply AEDPA § 440(d) to pending\n\n§ 212(c) applications or to pending deportation proceedings; it is\n\nanother not to apply it to deportation proceedings begun after AEDPA's\n\neffective date.     That is particularly so in light of both the\n\nwidespread understanding that § 212(c) relief is an act of grace and\n\nthe fact that Congress has restricted judicial review of denials of the\n\nrelief.   See Kolster v. INS, 101 F.3d 785, 788-90 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          There are, however, arguments and interests on the other\n\nside. If Congress had wanted the elimination of § 212(c) relief to\n\napply here, it could easily have said so. Also, as Mattis argues, the\n\ngroup affected by his proposed rule is finite (we are dubious about his\n\nargument that the group is small, but there is no record evidence on\n\nthis point), as aliens whose deportation proceedings commenced after\n\nApril 1, 1997, are governed by IIRIRA's new, permanent rule. See supra\n\n\n\nrelief altogether and replaced it with § 240A relief, see supra note 9,\nand, consistent with AEDPA § 440(d), excluded aggravated felons from\neligibility, see 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3). Congress also restricted\neligibility for § 240A relief by enacting a provision that stops the\nclock on an alien's continuous residency period as of the date of the\ncriminal offense or the show cause order, whichever comes first. See\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1). Finally, in IIRIRA § 321, Congress expanded\nthe definition of \"aggravated felony,\" thus broadening the range of\ndeportable aliens and narrowing the class of deportable aliens eligible\nfor either § 212(c) relief or § 240A relief.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fnote 9. Moreover, factors of administrative ease and clarity are well\n\nserved by the Wallace rule and would not be much hindered by extending\n\nWallace to adopt Mattis's position.\n\n            Most importantly, there may be some reliance and expectation\n\ninterests involved. Of course, any such reliance must be reasonable.\n\nMattis correctly notes that prior to AEDPA, a guilty plea to an\n\naggravated    felony    rendered    one   deportable,   but    did   not\n\nnecessarily result in deportation because of the availability of\n\na waiver.    As a result, it can be argued that § 440(d) attaches\n\nnew legal consequences to Mattis's guilty plea.                 At oral\n\nargument, Mattis's counsel suggested to the court that we\n\nrecognize a general reliance interest in § 212(c) relief that\n\nexisted at the plea bargaining stage prior to AEDPA.          It is true\n\nthat a significant number of aliens deportable because of\n\ncriminal convictions were granted waivers in the years preceding\n\nAEDPA.    See Mojica, 970 F. Supp. at 178; cf. Wallace, 24 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 110.    Further, \"[t]hat an alien charged with a crime\n\n[that would render him deportable] would factor the immigration\n\nconsequences of conviction in deciding whether to plead or\n\nproceed to trial is well-documented.\"        Magana-Pizano, 200 F.3d\n\nat 612.\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f          Although deportation legislation is not subject to Ex Post\n\nFacto Clause constraints, cases analyzed under the clause can inform\n\nthe retroactive effect analysis, see Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.S. at 948.\n\nUnder that clause, a change from a system of discretionary relief to\n\none of mandated outcomes operates retroactively when applied to prior\n\nconduct. See Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 401 (1937). The\n\nsame might be said of removing a form of discretionary relief. It is\n\nnot inconceivable that some aliens pled guilty to crimes or did not\n\ncontest criminal charges before April 1996 in reasonable reliance on\n\nthe availability of § 212(c) waivers. This universe of aliens is, of\n\ncourse, much smaller than the universe of all aliens whose guilty pleas\n\nwere entered before April 1996, the universe Mattis seeks to encompass.\n\n          The universe of all aliens who entered guilty pleas before\n\nApril 1996 is too broad, as there are many reasons to plead guilty,\n\nreasons much stronger than the hope of discretionary relief from\n\ndeportation: hopes of sentencing leniency in recognition of acceptance\n\nof responsibility, a better bargain from the government in exchange for\n\nnot going to trial, and the like. Nonetheless, there is reason to\n\nbelieve that there might be some aliens who made such choices in actual\n\nand reasonable reliance on the availability of § 212(c) relief. Good\n\ndefense counsel in criminal cases often advise clients about\n\nimmigration law consequences. There may well be those who pled despite\n\nhaving a colorable defense because the act of accepting responsibility\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fwould bode well for their § 212(c) application. Similarly, there may\n\nbe aliens who pled to lesser offenses than those charged in\n\norder to ensure that they would serve less than five years of\n\nprison time. If applied to such aliens, that is, those who pled to\n\nor did not contest criminal charges in reasonable reliance on the\n\navailability of § 212(c) relief, AEDPA § 440(d) would have a\n\nretroactive effect. The questions of whether there was actual reliance\n\nand whether it was reasonable are questions of fact to be resolved by\n\nthe IJ.\n\n          In addition, our own prior case law lends support to the rule\n\nwe adopt. In Kolster we recognized the possibility that an alien's\n\nguilty plea could have been induced by reasonable reliance on\n\ndiscretionary § 212(c) relief, but found that the petitioner there had\n\nnot and could not show such reliance. See Kolster, 101 F.3d at 789\n\n(noting that the court \"[had] no reason to think [the alien's\n\nguilty plea] was induced by reliance on discretionary relief\n\nunder section 212(c)\" when the alien was three years away from\n\nbeing eligible for § 212(c) relief at the time he pled guilty).\n\nWe declined to adopt a rule presuming such reliance in all situations.\n\nSee id. Kolster addressed a question about restrictions on judicial\n\nreview and expressly noted a Seventh Circuit decision reaching a\n\ndifferent outcome where the petitioner had conceded deportability in\n\n                                -22-\n\freliance on the availability of judicial review of the denial of §\n\n212(c) relief. See id. (acknowledging Reyes-Hernandez v. INS, 89 F.3d\n\n490, 492 (7th Cir. 1996)). The rule we adopt today is also, we think,\n\nmost in accord with our approach in Goncalves and Wallace.\n\n          Our position adopts a middle ground among the circuits. The\n\nNinth Circuit reached a similar conclusion to ours in Magana-Pizano,\n\n200 F.3d. at 612-13. The Seventh Circuit has at least suggested that\n\na showing of actual reliance at the plea bargain stage might alter the\n\nretroactivity analysis. See Turkhan, 188 F.3d at 827 (noting, in a\n\ncase involving a pending § 212(c) application, that the court did not\n\n\"believe that Turkhan's guilty plea to the underlying drug offense was\n\ninduced by any reliance on discretionary relief under INA § 212(c).\").\n\n\n\n          We acknowledge that the Third and Tenth Circuits have adopted\n\nthe first rule -- the rule the government urges. See DeSousa, 190 F.3d\n\nat 187; Jurado-Gutierrez, 190 F.3d at 1150. And, the Fifth Circuit\n\nappears to have adopted this rule as well, see Requena-Rodriguez v.\n\nPasquarell, 190 F.3d 299, 307-08 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding no\n\nretroactive effect in applying § 440(d) to pending proceedings),\n\nalthough it is unclear whether the court might permit a showing of\n\nactual reliance, see id. at 308 (noting that the alien \"could not\n\nseriously suggest that he would have . . . changed his plea\" had he\n\nknown he would be ineligible for a waiver).\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f               The Fourth Circuit has taken an entirely different approach,\n\nadopting a blanket rule that applying AEDPA § 440(d) to all guilty\n\npleas made before AEDPA's enactment would have an impermissible\n                                                            13\nretroactive effect.        See Tasios, 204 F.3d at 552.\n\nC. Application of the Rule and Evidence of Reliance\n\n               It remains to apply this rule to this case. Mattis argues\n\nthat we should remand this matter to the agency so that he might have\n\nan opportunity to prove his reliance on the availability of § 212(c)\n\nrelief. We disagree. This opinion sets forth a new rule, and we might\n\nordinarily remand as a result. But we see no injustice to Mattis in\n\nnot remanding, for two reasons.\n\n               First, Mattis has waived this claim, as he did not raise it\n\nbefore the BIA or the district court. Traditional rules regarding\n\nexhaustion and waiver govern on direct review of BIA final orders.\n\nSee, e.g., Prado v. Reno, 198 F.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir. 1999). We see no\n\nreason why the same should not hold on habeas review, which we have\n\nsuggested is less broad than direct review. See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at\n\n125.        Failure to raise a claim on direct review of a criminal\n\nconviction constitutes a procedural default (absent a showing of cause\n\nand prejudice), barring the claim from being raised on habeas. See\n\n\n\n       13 In Tasios, the Fourth Circuit also identified the potential\nunfairness of applying § 440(d) to aliens who had conceded\ndeportability before AEDPA's enactment. See 204 F.3d at 552. Given\nour holding in Wallace, that problem should not arise in this circuit.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fProu v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 47 (1st Cir. 1999). And failure to\n\nraise a claim before the district court on a petition for habeas corpus\n\nbars a petitioner from raising that claim before the reviewing court of\n\nappeals. See Watkins v. Ponte, 987 F.2d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 1993); cf.\n\nNakaranurack v. United States, 68 F.3d 290, 293 (9th Cir. 1995)\n\n(applying procedural default rule to alien seeking habeas corpus relief\n\nfrom final order of deportation).        Mattis had the opportunity to\n\nraise the argument, and there was no reason to think he could\n\nnot.   Although our opinion sets forth a new rule, the issue of\n\nreliance is hardly new.     The issue of reliance is central to any\n\ninquiry into the retroactive effect of a new law under the\n\nLandgraf analysis and was discussed in Kolster.              Both of those\n\ndecisions pre-dated the habeas petition here.\n\n            In addition, there is little reason to think Mattis has\n\na colorable claim of actual and reasonable reliance of the sort\n\nrecognized by our new rule.        Mattis had not yet accrued seven\n\nyears of continuous residency in the United States when he\n\nentered any of his guilty pleas.         His potential eligibility for\n\n§ 212(c) relief, therefore, turned upon when the INS chose to\n\ninstitute    deportation    proceedings        against    him.      Further,\n\nMattis's deportation       is   based   upon    five     separate   criminal\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fconvictions, including three aggravated felonies.       With each\n\nsucceeding guilty plea to the offenses, ranging over a period of\n\nfour years, any argument that the plea was in actual reliance on\n\nthe availability of § 212(c) relief becomes more and more\n\ntenuous.   Any argument that each succeeding plea was entered in\n\nreasonable reliance on the availability of § 212(c) relief\n\nbecomes untenable.\n\n                               III\n\n           We affirm the decision of the district court dismissing\n\nMattis's habeas corpus petition, and we vacate the stay of\n\ndeportation.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f",

IIRIRA eliminated § 212(c) relief altogether and\n\n\n\n\n     1    Prior to 1996, § 212(c) relief was available for an\nalien who was deportable because of an aggravated felony\nconviction as long as the alien had served less than five years\nin prison for the conviction.           See Immigration and\nNaturalization Act (INA) § 212(c), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994).\nThe only other requirement for relief under § 212(c) prior to AEDPA was\nthat the alien have maintained \"lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven\nconsecutive years\" in the United States. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\n\n                                 -3-\n\freplaced </span><pre class=\"inline\">it with a new form of relief, \"cancellation of removal.\" See\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b. Compared with pre-AEDPA § 212(c) relief, this new\n\nform of relief applies to a much smaller group of aliens who have\n\ncommitted crimes. Compare </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> § 1229b(a), </span><pre class=\"inline\">with INA § 212(c), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(c) (1994).\n\n          Some deportable aliens, as a result, have been caught in the\n\ntransition between the different legal schemes established by these\n\nstatutory changes. Thus, a series of questions has arisen as to which\n\naliens are subject to which rules. Congress was not explicit in this\n\nregard, and so it has fallen to the courts to try to best determine\n\nwhat Congress intended and, failing that, which judicial default rules\n\nshould apply.\n\n          This case is the third in a trilogy of cases that has dealt\n\nwith those types of questions. The first question was whether § 212(c)\n\nrelief had been eliminated for deportable aliens who had applications\n\nfor such relief pending when AEDPA became effective. We answered that\n\nquestion \"no\" in Goncalves v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197952\"><a href=\"/opinion/197952/perceira-goncalves-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1999). The second question was whether\n\nsuch relief was nonetheless eliminated as to aliens who had not applied\n\nfor § 212(c) relief prior to AEDPA's effective date but against whom\n\ndeportation proceedings had begun as of that date. We answered that\n\nquestion \"no\" in Wallace v.

See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 287.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\nWe answer \"yes, except.\"      The \"except\" is for cases where the\n\ndeportable alien has demonstrated to the INS that, prior to AEDPA's\n\npassage, he or she actually relied on the availability of § 212(c)\n\nrelief in entering a guilty plea or not contesting a criminal charge.\n\nFor the reasons stated herein, we affirm the dismissal of the habeas\n\npetition and vacate the stay of deportation.2\n\n                                  I\n\n           Dwight W. Mattis is a native and citizen of Jamaica. In\n\nFebruary 1989, at the age of sixteen, he entered the United States as\n\na lawful permanent resident and has been here since. He is married to\n\na U.S. citizen and he has a child. The rest of his family is in this\n\ncountry. For several years, he ran two beauty salons in Springfield,\n\nMassachusetts, that had several employees. He lives within walking\n\ndistance of his parents' home and has occasionally given them financial\n\nsupport.\n\n\n\n\n     2    Mattis presents another claim: that AEDPA § 404(d) violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause because it bars § 212(c) relief for\ndeportable aliens but not for excludable aliens. This court has\npreviously rejected that argument, see Almon v.

Mattis sought relief in the form of a\n\ndiscretionary waiver of deportation under INA § 212(c).\n\n               After the hearing, the IJ ruled that the INS had proven, by\n\nclear    and    convincing   evidence,     that   Mattis   was   deportable.\n\nSpecifically, the IJ found that the INS had established deportability\n\non two grounds: (1) Mattis's conviction of a controlled substance\n\noffense under former INA § 241(a)(2)(B)(i), and (2) his convictions of\n\n\n\n     3    INA §§ 241(a)(2)(B)(i) and (a)(2)(A)(iii) have been\ntransferred to INA §§ 237(a)(2)(B)(i) and (a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C.\n§§ 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) and (a)(2)(A)(iii). See IIRIRA § 305(a)(2).\n     4    Except for Mattis's 1991 conviction for possession of\ncocaine, the convictions were all obtained through guilty pleas.\n\n                                     -6-\n\faggravated felonies under former INA § 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), pursuant to\n\nthree separate statutory definitions of \"aggravated felony.\" Mattis's\n\naggravated felonies included (1) trafficking in cocaine, which is an\n\naggravated felony under INA § 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B);\n\n(2) statutory rape, which is an aggravated felony under INA\n\n§ 101(a)(43)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A); and (3) statutory rape,\n\nwhich is also an aggravated felony under INA § 101(a)(43)(F), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(43)(F). Applying AEDPA § 440(d), the IJ denied Mattis's\n\napplication for § 212(c) relief because he was deportable by reason of\n\nhaving been convicted of an aggravated felony. The BIA upheld this\n\ndecision.5\n\n          The \"aggravated felony\" point has some importance. IIRIRA\n\nexpanded the definition of \"aggravated felony.\" See IIRIRA § 321.\n\nUnder former INA § 101(a)(43), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) (1994), only\n\n\n     5     The denial of the application for § 212(c) relief by the IJ\nand BIA was based on the Attorney General's position in Matter of\nSoriano, Int.

Mattis's reliance and expectation interests are\n\nnot nearly as strong as the interests presented by the petitioners in\n\nGoncalves and Wallace. In the present case, unlike in Goncalves, there\n\nwas no summary dismissal of a pending § 212(c) petition that was\n\nentirely authorized at the time it was filed.        And, unlike the\n\nsituation in Wallace, there was no changing of the rules once a\n\ndeportation proceeding had been started. Mattis's only reliance and\n\nexpectancy interests were those he had at the time he pled guilty,\n\nknowing that he could be deported as a consequence.\n\n           Here, as in Wallace, it has fallen to the courts to draw a\n\nline, applying judicial default rules.11   The line in this case could\n\nbe drawn in various places.      The three most evident are:\n\n           1. that § 212(c) relief is eliminated for all deportable\n           aliens with the requisite criminal convictions, where\n           deportation proceedings commenced after the passage of AEDPA\n           -- the position urged by the government;\n\n\n\n     11   Of course, when Congress does not specify where to draw the\nlines, we assume that it makes this choice against a background of\njudicial decisions that have established default rules.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          2. that § 212(c) relief is unaffected by AEDPA § 440(d) for\n          all deportable aliens in such circumstances -- the position\n          urged by Mattis; or\n\n          3. that § 212(c) relief continues to be available for\n          deportable aliens whose requisite criminal convictions pre-\n          dated AEDPA, if, and only if, the alien actually and\n          reasonably relied on the availability of § 212(c) relief\n          when he pled guilty to or did not contest the criminal\n          charges.\n\nWe adopt the third rule, which we believe best fits with the approach\n\nthe Supreme Court has taken to issues of retroactivity.\n\n          Retroactivity analysis arises in different contexts that pose\n\ndifferent questions, and the tests articulated by the Supreme Court\n\ncannot be applied mechanically. Prior decisions are not on point. The\n\nquestion here is not whether a new statute restricting relief applies\n\nto pending proceedings for that relief. That was the question in Lindh\n\nv. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118135\"><a href=\"/opinion/118135/lindh-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322-23 (1997), and in Goncalves. The question\n\nhere is not whether a new statute restricting relief applies to pending\n\nproceedings even though an application for the specific relief had not\n\nbeen made prior to the statute's enactment. That was the situation in\n\nWallace. The question here is not whether a new statute eliminating a\n\ndefense to a cause of action applies in pending suits where the conduct\n\nthat gave rise to the suit pre-dated the new statute. That was the\n\nsituation in Hughes Aircraft. The question here is not whether a new\n\nstatute eliminating attorney's fees for work performed applies (a) to\n\nwork that was done before the enactment of the statute and for which\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fthere was a reasonable expectation of payment or (b) to work that was\n\ndone after the statute's enactment but in cases pending at the time of\n\nthe statute's enactment. That was the situation in Hadix. In each of\n\nthese different situations, the familiar two-step retroactivity\n\nanalysis was undertaken. And in each of these cases, the second step\n\nof the analysis -- applying judicial default rules -- weighed\n\nconsiderations of potential\n\nunfairness (including both fair notice and reliance) against the\n\nintended purposes and benefits of the statute. We apply the same\n\ncalculus here.\n\n          The general thrust of IIRIRA and AEDPA is clear. As the\n\ndistrict court noted, it is difficult to believe that Congress, despite\n\nhaving narrowed the eligibility for § 212(c) relief, wanted such relief\n\nto remain available for years to come in all deportation proceedings\n\nbegun after April 1996 simply because the alien was convicted before\n\nApril 1996. Cf. Barreiro v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602840\"><a href=\"/opinion/602840/nestor-omar-barreiro-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nCongress's clear intent in passing AEDPA and IIRIRA was to facilitate\n\nthe deportation of criminal aliens by broadening the class of crimes\n\nthat render an alien deportable and by narrowing the class of\n\ndeportable criminal aliens eligible for discretionary relief.12   With\n\n     12    In addition to narrowing eligibility for § 212(c) relief by\nenacting AEDPA § 440(d), Congress, in AEDPA § 435, expanded the range\nof criminal convictions that render an alien deportable. Compare 8\nU.S.C.    §    1251(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)     (1994),    with    8   U.S.C.\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(II).

That is particularly so in light of both the\n\nwidespread understanding that § 212(c) relief is an act of grace and\n\nthe fact that Congress has restricted judicial review of denials of the\n\nrelief.   See Kolster v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730820\"><a href=\"/opinion/730820/alfredo-a-kolster-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788-90 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          There are, however, arguments and interests on the other\n\nside. If Congress had wanted the elimination of § 212(c) relief to\n\napply here, it could easily have said so. Also, as Mattis argues, the\n\ngroup affected by his proposed rule is finite (we are dubious about his\n\nargument that the group is small, but there is no record evidence on\n\nthis point), as aliens whose deportation proceedings commenced after\n\nApril 1, 1997, are governed by IIRIRA's new, permanent rule. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nrelief altogether and replaced it with § 240A relief, see supra note 9,\nand, consistent with AEDPA § 440(d), excluded aggravated felons from\neligibility, see 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3). Congress also restricted\neligibility for § 240A relief by enacting a provision that stops the\nclock on an alien's continuous residency period as of the date of the\ncriminal offense or the show cause order, whichever comes first. See\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1). Finally, in IIRIRA § 321, Congress expanded\nthe definition of \"aggravated felony,\" thus broadening the range of\ndeportable aliens and narrowing the class of deportable aliens eligible\nfor either § 212(c) relief or § 240A relief.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fnote 9. Moreover, factors of administrative ease and clarity are well\n\nserved by the Wallace rule and would not be much hindered by extending\n\nWallace to adopt Mattis's position.\n\n            Most importantly, there may be some reliance and expectation\n\ninterests involved. Of course, any such reliance must be reasonable.\n\nMattis correctly notes that prior to AEDPA, a guilty plea to an\n\naggravated    felony    rendered    one   deportable,   but    did   not\n\nnecessarily result in deportation because of the availability of\n\na waiver.    As a result, it can be argued that § 440(d) attaches\n\nnew legal consequences to Mattis's guilty plea.                 At oral\n\nargument, Mattis's counsel suggested to the court that we\n\nrecognize a general reliance interest in § 212(c) relief that\n\nexisted at the plea bargaining stage prior to AEDPA.          It is true\n\nthat a significant number of aliens deportable because of\n\ncriminal convictions were granted waivers in the years preceding\n\nAEDPA.

See Lindsey v.

The\n\nsame might be said of removing a form of discretionary relief. It is\n\nnot inconceivable that some aliens pled guilty to crimes or did not\n\ncontest criminal charges before April 1996 in reasonable reliance on\n\nthe availability of § 212(c) waivers. This universe of aliens is, of\n\ncourse, much smaller than the universe of all aliens whose guilty pleas\n\nwere entered before April 1996, the universe Mattis seeks to encompass.\n\n          The universe of all aliens who entered guilty pleas before\n\nApril 1996 is too broad, as there are many reasons to plead guilty,\n\nreasons much stronger than the hope of discretionary relief from\n\ndeportation: hopes of sentencing leniency in recognition of acceptance\n\nof responsibility, a better bargain from the government in exchange for\n\nnot going to trial, and the like. Nonetheless, there is reason to\n\nbelieve that there might be some aliens who made such choices in actual\n\nand reasonable reliance on the availability of § 212(c) relief. Good\n\ndefense counsel in criminal cases often advise clients about\n\nimmigration law consequences. There may well be those who pled despite\n\nhaving a colorable defense because the act of accepting responsibility\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fwould bode well for their § 212(c) application. Similarly, there may\n\nbe aliens who pled to lesser offenses than those charged in\n\norder to ensure that they would serve less than five years of\n\nprison time. If applied to such aliens, that is, those who pled to\n\nor did not contest criminal charges in reasonable reliance on the\n\navailability of § 212(c) relief, AEDPA § 440(d) would have a\n\nretroactive effect. The questions of whether there was actual reliance\n\nand whether it was reasonable are questions of fact to be resolved by\n\nthe IJ.\n\n          In addition, our own prior case law lends support to the rule\n\nwe adopt. In Kolster we recognized the possibility that an alien's\n\nguilty plea could have been induced by reasonable reliance on\n\ndiscretionary § 212(c) relief, but found that the petitioner there had\n\nnot and could not show such reliance.

The rule we adopt today is also, we think,\n\nmost in accord with our approach in Goncalves and Wallace.\n\n          Our position adopts a middle ground among the circuits.

Application of the Rule and Evidence of Reliance\n\n               It remains to apply this rule to this case. Mattis argues\n\nthat we should remand this matter to the agency so that he might have\n\nan opportunity to prove his reliance on the availability of § 212(c)\n\nrelief. We disagree. This opinion sets forth a new rule, and we might\n\nordinarily remand as a result. But we see no injustice to Mattis in\n\nnot remanding, for two reasons.\n\n               First, Mattis has waived this claim, as he did not raise it\n\nbefore the BIA or the district court. Traditional rules regarding\n\nexhaustion and waiver govern on direct review of BIA final orders.\n\nSee, e.g., Prado v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198734\"><a href=\"/opinion/198734/prado-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292 (1st Cir. 1999). We see no\n\nreason why the same should not hold on habeas review, which we have\n\nsuggested is less broad than direct review. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197952\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Goncalves,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/197952/perceira-goncalves-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at\n\n<span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.        Failure to raise a claim on direct review of a criminal\n\nconviction constitutes a procedural default (absent a showing of cause\n\nand prejudice), barring the claim from being raised on habeas. See\n\n\n\n       13 In Tasios, the Fourth Circuit also identified the potential\nunfairness of applying § 440(d) to aliens who had conceded\ndeportability before AEDPA's enactment. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767741\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/767741/konstantinos-tasios-v-janet-reno-doris-meissner-commissioner-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Given\nour holding in Wallace, that problem should not arise in this circuit.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fProu v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198748\"><a href=\"/opinion/198748/prou-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir. 1999). And failure to\n\nraise a claim before the district court on a petition for habeas corpus\n\nbars a petitioner from raising that claim before the reviewing court of\n\nappeals. See Watkins v. Ponte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601481\"><a href=\"/opinion/601481/theodis-watkins-v-joseph-ponte/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (1st Cir. 1993); cf.\n\nNakaranurack v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706089\"><a href=\"/opinion/706089/95-cal-daily-op-serv-6986-95-daily-journal-dar-11976-saksit/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293 (9th Cir. 1995)\n\n(applying procedural default rule to alien seeking habeas corpus relief\n\nfrom final order of deportation).        Mattis had the opportunity to\n\nraise the argument, and there was no reason to think he could\n\nnot.   Although our opinion sets forth a new rule, the issue of\n\nreliance is hardly new.     The issue of reliance is central to any\n\ninquiry into the retroactive effect of a new law under the\n\nLandgraf analysis and was discussed in Kolster.              Both of those\n\ndecisions pre-dated the habeas petition here.\n\n            In addition, there is little reason to think Mattis has\n\na colorable claim of actual and reasonable reliance of the sort\n\nrecognized by our new rule.        Mattis had not yet accrued seven\n\nyears of continuous residency in the United States when he\n\nentered any of his guilty pleas.         His potential eligibility for\n\n§ 212(c) relief, therefore, turned upon when the INS chose to\n\ninstitute    deportation    proceedings        against    him.      Further,\n\nMattis's deportation       is   based   upon    five     separate   criminal\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fconvictions, including three aggravated felonies.       With each\n\nsucceeding guilty plea to the offenses, ranging over a period of\n\nfour years, any argument that the plea was in actual reliance on\n\nthe availability of § 212(c) relief becomes more and more\n\ntenuous.   Any argument that each succeeding plea was entered in\n\nreasonable reliance on the availability of § 212(c) relief\n\nbecomes untenable.\n\n                               III\n\n           We affirm the decision of the district court dismissing\n\nMattis's habeas corpus petition, and we vacate the stay of\n\ndeportation.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f</pre>",
