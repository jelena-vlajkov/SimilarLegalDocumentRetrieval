George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Stahl and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJohn P. Conroy and Patricia E. Conroy on brief pro se.\r\nAnn S. Duross, Assistant Attorney General, Colleen J. Boles,\r\nSenior Counsel, and Daniel Glenn Lonergan, Counsel, on brief for\r\nappellee Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\r\n\nJanuary 5, 2000\r\n\nPer Curiam.  We have reviewed the parties' briefs and the\r\nrecord in these two appeals.  These appeals are the seventh and\r\neighth appeals by appellants seeking to forestall the completion of\r\na foreclosure sale that occurred in September 1995.  They are as\r\nmeritless as appellants' prior appeals as the arguments presented\r\nare either waived or barred by res judicata.\r\nIn Appeal No. 99-1150, the district court, by memorandum and\r\norder dated December 29, 1998, dismissed appellants' complaint for\r\nlack of jurisdiction.  We summarily affirm essentially for the\r\nreasons stated by the district court in that memorandum and order.\r\nIn Appeal No. 99-1218, the district court, by order dated\r\nDecember 29, 1998, enforced a January 17, 1996 order directing\r\nappellants to permit access to the property for an appraisal and\r\ninspection.  We summarily affirm essentially for the reasons stated\r\nby the district court in its order of December 29, 1998.  We also\r\nnote that we have already reviewed the January 1996 access order,\r\nwhich we summarily affirmed in Conroy v. FDIC, No. 96-1172 (1st\r\nCir. Order, June 10, 1996).\r\nAffirmed.  See Loc. R. 27(c).\r\n",
