This appeal requires us to decide\r\nwhether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\r\n(\"ERISA\") as amended, 29 U.S.C.  1001 et. seq., preempts a common\r\nlaw cause of action for lump sum contract damages where the alleged\r\nbreach involves the failure of a former employer to enroll the\r\nplaintiff in an ERISA-regulated employee pension benefit plan.  The\r\nplaintiff, Dr. Constantine Hampers, demanded a jury trial on his\r\ncommon law breach of contract claims against defendants, W.R. Grace\r\nand Company, W.R. Grace and Company-Connecticut, (collectively,\r\n\"Grace\"), National Medical Care, Inc. (\"NMC\"), and Fresenius\r\nNational Medical Care Holdings, Inc. (\"Fresenius\").  The district\r\ncourt rejected his demand, finding that ERISA preempted Hampers's\r\nstate law claims.  On appeal, Hampers argues that, with respect to\r\ndefendant Grace, the trial court erred in finding his claim\r\npreempted.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm.  \r\n\n                       I. BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1968, as an associate professor at the Harvard Medical\r\nSchool and a nephrologist specializing in end-stage renal disease,\r\nHampers co-founded NMC, a company that provides dialysis treatment\r\nto patients through private clinics.  In a series of transactions\r\nbetween 1984 and 1989, Grace purchased a 100 percent equity\r\ninterest in NMC, and began operating it as a wholly-owned\r\nsubsidiary.  In 1989, Hampers negotiated an employment agreement\r\nthat, among other things, provided for his participation in the\r\nNational Medical Care, Inc., Retirement Plan (the \"NMC qualified\r\nplan\").\r\nIn 1990, J.P. Bolduc became president and chief operating\r\nofficer of Grace, and he invited Hampers to become an executive\r\nvice president of Grace and director of its health care group,\r\nwhich included NMC.  On February 22, 1991, Bolduc sent a letter to\r\nHampers proposing terms for a new employment agreement with Grace\r\nthat was to include membership in the W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Retirement\r\nPlan for Salaried Employees (the \"Grace qualified plan\") and the\r\nW.R. Grace &amp; Co. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the \"Grace\r\nSERP\").  This agreement provided Hampers with more benefits than\r\nhe was previously entitled to under the NMC qualified plan because\r\nat that time NMC did not have a supplemental executive retirement\r\nplan (SERP) of its own.\r\nHampers and Bolduc decided that the February 22 letter\r\nwould be the basis of their agreement, and they turned the drafting\r\nover to their attorneys.  Before the agreement was executed,\r\nhowever, Grace identified a problem with the proposed benefit\r\nscheme: Hampers's participation in the Grace qualified plan could\r\njeopardize the plan's tax-preferred status.  Accordingly, Grace's\r\nlawyers redrafted the agreement, providing Hampers with a cash\r\nbenefit equal to what they estimated he would have received under\r\nthe Grace qualified plan and Grace SERP. \r\n\nAlthough these changes were acceptable to Hampers, \r\nGrace's Salary, Incentive Compensation and Employee Benefits\r\nCommittee found the terms too rich and refused to approve them. \r\nInstead, the compensation committee, and ultimately Grace's board\r\nof directors, approved a modified version of the agreement which\r\ncapped Hampers's retirement benefits at $300,000 per year.  Hampers\r\nreluctantly accepted the modified terms, and Grace's lawyers\r\nreduced them to writing, providing that Hampers's pension \r\n  shall be equal to the amount by which (a) the\r\nlesser of (i) three times the actual pension\r\nbenefit payable to him under NMC's retirement\r\nplan (beginning in the year in which he\r\nterminates employment with Grace) or (ii)\r\n$300,000 exceeds (b) the amount of the actual\r\npension benefit payable to him under NMC's\r\nretirement plan at that time.  \r\n\nIn July 1991, Hampers and Bolduc executed the agreement (the \"1991\r\nAgreement\").\r\nFour years later, NMC's earnings had skyrocketed, and NMC\r\nemployees demanded a richer benefits package.  In response, Grace's\r\nboard created in November 1995 the \"National Medical Care, Inc.\r\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan\" (the \"NMC SERP\").  In\r\n1996, Grace transferred ownership of NMC to Fresenius.  On June 14,\r\n1996, Hampers retired.  Upon retirement,  Hampers inquired about\r\nhis retirement benefits.  He learned from Grace that he was not a\r\nparticipant in the NMC SERP.  He also learned that if he had been\r\na participant in the NMC SERP, his aggregate retirement annuity\r\n(from the combined NMC qualified plan and NMC SERP) would have\r\ntotaled more than $500,000.  On January 2, 1997, Hampers filed the\r\npresent suit, asserting that he was wrongly denied participation in\r\nthe NMC SERP.    \r\nIn his complaint, Hampers contended that \"when a SERP for\r\nNMC senior executives . . . was created in or about November 15,\r\n1995, Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP,\r\nand NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\"  According to Hampers, this\r\nexclusion was a breach of the 1991 Agreement because under that\r\nagreement he was \"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC\r\nretirement plan as it existed on the date of his retirement,\r\nspecifically including such benefits under the NMC qualified plan\r\nand the NMC SERP.\"  In his view, the reference in the 1991\r\nAgreement to \"NMC's retirement plan\" entitled him to participate,\r\nnot only in the NMC qualified plan, which existed at the time of\r\ncontracting, but also in any additional retirement benefits that\r\nGrace might establish for NMC in the future.  \r\nIn a count of the complaint titled \"ERISA: The NMC SERP,\"\r\nHampers asserted that the \"NMC SERP is an 'employee benefits plan'\r\nunder ERISA,\" and Grace \"exercised and exercise[s] discretion and\r\nauthority or control respecting the management, disposition and\r\nadministration of the NMC SERP, including but not limited to, the\r\ndiscretion of who is to be included for participation in the NMC\r\nSERP.\"  Thus, Hampers contended, \"[b]y virtue of the terms of the\r\n1991 Agreement,\" Grace had a \"duty to include Dr. Hampers as a\r\nparticipant in the NMC SERP,\" and \"breached the duty.\"  \r\nHampers sought a declaration that he is a participant in\r\nthe NMC SERP and an order directing his enrollment in the NMC SERP\r\nwith annuity disbursements adjusted to reflect such participation. \r\nHampers also requested \"damages for the loss caused by [the\r\ndefendants'] illegal conduct, including interest, costs and\r\nattorneys [sic] fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C.  1132(g) [ERISA \r\n502(g)] and other applicable provisions of law.\"  Finally, Hampers\r\ndemanded a jury trial on all matters triable before a jury.\r\nThe defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds\r\nthat the 1991 Agreement contained no promise of participation in\r\nany future NMC SERP.  In opposition to the motion, Hampers argued\r\nthat the term \"NMC retirement plan\" in the 1991 Agreement could not\r\nbe construed to leave out future participation in the NMC SERP, as\r\n\"[b]y its very terms, the NMC SERP is inextricably linked to and\r\ndependent on the Qualified Plan.\"  Indeed, he argued, eligibility\r\nfor the NMC SERP depends on a formula that includes benefit accrual\r\nunder the NMC qualified plan.  As the only purpose of the SERP is\r\nto confer enhanced benefits on highly compensated executives\r\nwithout contravening the limits on qualified plans set by the tax\r\ncode, Hampers contended that the two plans must be construed\r\ntogether to comprise one seamless retirement package.  In the end,\r\nthe district court denied summary judgment, finding that there was\r\n\"more than one reasonable construction of the term 'NMC retirement\r\nplan.'\" \r\nThe defendants then moved to strike Hampers's demand for\r\na jury trial on the grounds that the NMC SERP was an ERISA plan and\r\nthat ERISA preempted Hampers's state law cause of action. \r\nCharacterizing the issue as a \"close question,\" the district court\r\ngranted the defendants' motion, ruling that ERISA preempted\r\nHampers's state law contract claims.\r\nThe court then conducted a ten day bench trial at which\r\nthe defendants disputed Hampers's reading of the 1991 Agreement,\r\narguing that the term \"NMC retirement plan\" referred to the NMC\r\nqualified plan, the plan that existed at the time of contracting,\r\nand did not promise inclusion in a future NMC SERP as Hampers\r\ncontended.  At the conclusion of the trial, the district court,\r\ninvoking principles of New York state contract law, found no\r\nevidence that the parties intended Hampers's retirement benefits to\r\ninclude benefits under the NMC SERP, and entered a judgment in\r\nfavor of the defendants.  On appeal, Hampers does not contest the\r\ndistrict court's application of contract law; rather, he argues\r\nthat the trial court erred in denying his demand for a jury trial\r\non his claim for lump sum contract damages against defendant Grace. \r\nBecause the district court's denial of Hampers's request for a jury\r\ntrial resulted from its legal ruling that his claim was preempted\r\nby ERISA, we review the trial court's decision de novo.  See Golas\r\nv. Homeview Inc. 106 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997) (Bownes, J.,\r\nconcurring); Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790, 792-\r\n93 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\n\n                    II. ERISA PREEMPTION\r\nA.  General Principles\r\nAs noted, this case requires us to decide whether ERISA's\r\npreemption clause applies to Hampers's state law cause of action. \r\nThat preemption clause, section 514(a), 29 U.S.C.  1144(a),\r\nprovides:\r\n  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this\r\nsection, the provisions of this subchapter . . \r\n. shall supersede any and all State laws\r\ninsofar as they may now or hereafter relate to\r\nany employee benefit plan . . . .\r\n\n(emphasis added).  \"The term 'State law' includes all laws,\r\ndecisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the\r\neffect of law, of any State.\"  ERISA  514(c)(1), 29 U.S.C. \r\n1144(c)(1).  Discerning the meaning of  514(a) requires us to\r\nconstrue the language of a congressional statute.  Therefore,\r\n\"[t]he question whether a certain state action is pre-empted by\r\nfederal law is one of congressional intent.\" Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.\r\nMcClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 137-38 (1990) (internal quotation marks\r\nand citation omitted).  Express \"ERISA preemption analysis . . .\r\ninvolves two central questions: (1) whether the plan at issue is an\r\n'employee benefit plan' and (2) whether the cause of action\r\n'relates to' this employee benefit plan.\" McMahon v. Digital Equip.\r\nCorp., 162 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 1998).  Because the NMC SERP is an\r\nERISA-regulated \"employee benefit plan,\" our preemption analysis\r\nfocuses on whether Hampers's cause of action \"relates to\" the NMC\r\nSERP.    \r\nIn adopting  514(a), Congress deliberately rejected\r\nnarrower preemption language directed at \"state laws relating to\r\nthe specific subjects covered by ERISA,\"  Shaw v. Delta Air Lines,\r\nInc., 463 U.S. 85, 98 (1983) (emphasis added), choosing instead to\r\nsupplant all state laws that \"relate to\" ERISA-regulated plans.  In\r\nShaw, the Supreme Court observed that \"[a] law 'relates to' an\r\nemployee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has\r\na connection with or reference to such a plan.\"  Id.  This \"early\r\nattempt[] by the Supreme Court to interpret ERISA's preemption\r\nclause relied heavily upon textual analysis and a dictionary\r\ndefinition of 'relate to,'\"  Plumbing Indus. Bd., Plumbing Local\r\nUnion No. 1 v. Howell Co., 126 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir. 1997), and led\r\nto the conclusion that ERISA preemption was \"conspicuous for its\r\nbreadth,\"  FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52, 58 (1990).  Indeed,\r\nERISA preempts a state law that has a connection with or refers to\r\nan ERISA-regulated benefits plan, \"even if the law is not\r\nspecifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only\r\nindirect and even if the law is consistent with ERISA's substantive\r\nrequirements.\"  District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of\r\nTrade, 506 U.S. 125, 130 (1992) (internal quotation marks and\r\ncitations omitted); see also Rosario-Cordero v. Crowley Towing &amp;\r\nTransp. Co., 46 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[A] state law may\r\nrelate to an employee benefit plan even though the law does not\r\nconflict with ERISA's own requirements . . . .\").  \r\nYet, from ERISA's inception, the Supreme Court \r\nrecognized that \"[s]ome state actions may affect employee benefit\r\nplans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a\r\nfinding that the law 'relates to' the plan,\" Shaw, 463 U.S. at 100\r\nn.21, and that such \"is the case with many laws of general\r\napplicability,\" Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. at 130\r\nn.1.  Drawing the line between those state laws that \"relate to\"\r\nERISA-regulated plans, and those that are only \"tenuous, remote, or\r\nperipheral\" has proven considerably difficult in practice,\r\nproducing an \"avalanche of litigation.\"  De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Med.\r\n&amp; Clinical Serv. Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 809 n.1 (1997) (collecting\r\nSupreme Court ERISA preemption cases and documenting the enormous\r\nvolume of cases in the lower federal courts).  This case calls upon\r\nus to once again draw such a line.\r\nIn drawing that line, we find cases emphasizing ERISA's\r\ncarefully crafted civil enforcement scheme particularly relevant. \r\nSee, e.g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 54 (1987);\r\nIngersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 143-44; Fitzgerald v. Codex Corp., 882\r\nF.2d 586, 588 (1st Cir. 1989) (concluding that preemption extends\r\nto \"causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement\r\nprovisions of ERISA.\").  In Pilot Life, the Supreme Court concluded\r\nthat \"[t]he deliberate care with which ERISA's civil enforcement\r\nremedies were drafted and the balancing of policies embodied in its\r\nchoice of remedies argue strongly for the conclusion that ERISA's\r\ncivil enforcement remedies were intended to be exclusive.\"  Id. at\r\n54 (emphasis added).  The Court explained:\r\n  In sum, the detailed provisions of  502(a)\r\nset forth a comprehensive civil enforcement\r\nscheme that represents a careful balancing of\r\nthe need for prompt and fair claims settlement\r\nprocedures against the public interest in\r\nencouraging the formation of employee benefit\r\nplans. The policy choices reflected in the\r\ninclusion of certain remedies and the\r\nexclusion of others under the federal scheme\r\nwould be completely undermined if ERISA-plan\r\nparticipants and beneficiaries were free to\r\nobtain remedies under state law that Congress\r\nrejected in ERISA.\r\n\nId. \r\nSimilarly, in Turner v. Fallon Community Heath Plan, 127\r\nF.3d 196 (1st Cir. 1997), we found state common law claims \r\npreempted after determining that they fell within ERISA's exclusive\r\ncivil enforcement regime.  The plaintiff brought breach of contract\r\nand other state law claims, and a claim under ERISA  502(a)(1)(B),\r\n29 U.S.C.  1132(a)(1)(B), against a health maintenance\r\norganization, charging that it wrongly denied a request to fund a\r\ncertain cancer treatment.  See id. at 197-98.  The plaintiff sought\r\ncompensatory damages, arguing \"that if ERISA provided no federal\r\n[damages] remedy, it ought not be read to preempt his state-law\r\nclaims;\" alternatively, \"if ERISA preempted the state-law claims,\r\nthen a federal remedy ought to be inferred or created by the court\r\nto permit damages for wrongful withholding of treatment under the\r\nemployee benefits plan.\"  Id. at 198.  We rejected both arguments,\r\nfinding the state law claims preempted and declining the\r\nplaintiff's invitation to fashion a federal remedy not authorized\r\nby ERISA's remedial scheme.  See id. at 198-200.  First, we\r\nconcluded that ERISA  501(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C.  1132(a)(1)(B),\r\nprovides a remedy to \"secure benefits under the plan rather than\r\ndamages for a breach of the plan.\"  Id. at 198 (emphasis added). \r\nWe noted that \"the Supreme Court has stressed that ERISA does not\r\ncreate compensatory or punitive damage remedies where an\r\nadministrator of a plan fails to provide the benefits due under\r\nthat plan.\"  Id. (citing Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.\r\nRussell, 473 U.S. 134, 147 (1985)).  We emphasized that Congress's\r\ndecision not to allow causes of action for damages under ERISA \"is\r\nnot a minor technicality: damage awards may increase effective\r\ncoverage but may also add significantly to the costs of coverage.\" \r\nId. at 198-99.  Second, we held that although \"[a]bsent preemption,\r\na health benefits plan . . . could certainly be treated as a\r\ncontract enforceable under state law and subject to the usual\r\ncontractual remedies, including compensatory damages,\" ERISA's\r\npreemption clause \"preclude[s] state claims to enforce rights under\r\nan ERISA plan or obtain damages for the wrongful withholding of\r\nthose rights.\"  Id. at 199.  \r\nWhile we acknowledged in Turner that the Supreme Court\r\nhas \"set some new limits on preemption,\" we stressed that ERISA\r\ncontinues to preempt \"a state's attempt to provide state remedies\r\nfor what is in essence a plan administrator's refusal to pay\r\nallegedly promised benefits.\" Id. at 199.  Such reasoning is\r\nconsistent with, and indeed supported by New York State Conference\r\nof Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Insurance Co., 514\r\nU.S. 645, 656 (1995), the case in which the Supreme Court first\r\nacknowledged the unworkability of a literal reading of ERISA \r\n514(a)'s \"relate to\" standard, and ruled that courts must \"look\r\ninstead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the\r\nscope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.\"\r\nAccording to the Travelers Court, ERISA's purpose was \"'to ensure\r\nthat plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of\r\nbenefits law.'\"  Id. at 656 (quoting Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at\r\n142).  The Court identified three categories of state laws that\r\n\"relate to\" ERISA plans in such a way that preemption of those laws\r\nfurthers this purpose: (1) state laws that \"mandate[] employee\r\nbenefit structures or their administration,\" (2) state laws that\r\n\"bind plan administrators to [a] particular choice,\" and (3) state\r\nlaw causes of action that provide \"alternative enforcement\r\nmechanisms\" to ERISA's enforcement regime.  See id. at 658-59.  The\r\nthird category has particular relevance for our present inquiry. In\r\nthis vein, we have stated that in order to assess whether the state\r\nlaw cause of action is an alternative enforcement mechanism, we\r\nmust \"look beyond the face of the complaint\" and determine the real\r\nnature of the claim \"regardless of plaintiff's . . .\r\ncharacterization.\"  Danca v. Private Health Care Sys., Inc., 185\r\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999). \r\n\nB.  Hampers's State Law Contract Claim\r\nHampers's complaint alleged a cause of action under ERISA\r\nbased on precisely the same conduct that underlies his state law\r\ncontract claim.  In particular, in Count III of the complaint,\r\nentitled \"ERISA: The NMC SERP,\" Hampers asserted that by virtue of\r\nthe 1991 Agreement, Grace had a \"duty to include Hampers as a\r\nparticipant in the NMC SERP,\" and breached that duty by \"causing\r\nhim to be excluded from the NMC SERP.\"  In Count II of the\r\ncomplaint, entitled, \"Contract: Retirement Benefit,\" Hampers argued\r\nthat under the terms of the 1991 Agreement with Grace he was\r\n\"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan\r\nas it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including\r\nsuch benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP.\" \r\nHampers contended that \"when a SERP for NMC senior executives . .\r\n. was created in or about November 15, 1995, Grace caused Dr.\r\nHampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP, and NMC so excluded Dr.\r\nHampers.\"  According to Hampers, this conduct constituted a breach\r\nof the 1991 Agreement.  That the very same conduct--Grace's failure\r\nto include Hampers in the NMC SERP--underlies both Hampers's state\r\nlaw contract claim and his ERISA-benefits claim suggests that the\r\nstate law claim is an alternative mechanism for obtaining ERISA\r\nplan benefits.\r\nAs relief, Hampers primarily sought benefits under the\r\nNMC SERP.  First, he sought a declaratory judgment that he is\r\n\"entitled to participate in the NMC SERP and is entitled to receive\r\nall such benefits as to which he is entitled under the NMC SERP,\"\r\nand he petitioned the court to \"order that Grace . . . cause\r\nHampers to be enrolled in the NMC SERP forthwith and cause the NMC\r\nSERP to disburse to Hampers his rightful annuity as of January 1,\r\n1997 at such amount as he would have been entitled to had Hampers\r\nbeen included in the SERP from the day of its creation on or about\r\nNovember 15, 1995.\"  Moreover, even with respect to Hampers's state\r\nlaw claim for contract damages, he asserts that \"upon a Jury's\r\nfinding that Grace is liable to Dr. Hampers under the 1991\r\nAgreement . . . [,] the district court [would] have to face the\r\nissue of the appropriateness of an injunctive order directed to NMC\r\nand Fresenius that they enroll Hampers in the NMC SERP.\" \r\nHampers's complaint requested \"damages for the loss\r\ncaused by [the defendants'] illegal conduct, including interest,\r\ncosts and attorneys [sic] fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C.  1132(g)\r\n[ERISA  502(g)] and other applicable provisions of law.\"  Hampers\r\ntherefore linked his claim for damages to a request for attorneys'\r\nfees authorized under ERISA, but not authorized under state law.\r\nMoreover, in attempting to prove the \"illegal conduct\"--Grace's\r\ndecision to deny him participation rights in the NMC SERP--Hampers\r\nrelied on the terms of the NMC SERP, arguing that because the SERP\r\ndefines its benefits with respect to the NMC qualified plan, the\r\nterm \"NMC retirement plan\" in the 1991 Agreement must include both\r\nthe qualified plan and the SERP.  We have consistently held that a\r\ncause of action \"relates to\" an ERISA plan when a court must\r\nevaluate or interpret the terms of the ERISA-regulated plan to\r\ndetermine liability under the state law cause of action.  See\r\nMcMahon v. Digital Equip. Corp., 162 F.3d. 28, 38 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nBoston Children's Heart Found., Inc. v. Nadal-Ginard, 73 F.3d 429,\r\n440 (1st Cir. 1996); Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d\r\n790, 793-94 (1st Cir. 1995); Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 14 F.3d\r\n697, 698-99 (1st Cir. 1994).  Finally, Hampers measured his damages\r\nby reference to the NMC SERP, contending that, as a participant, he\r\nwould have been entitled to approximately $250,000 per year in\r\nadditional annual pension benefits.  We have held that ERISA\r\npreempts state law causes of action for damages where the damages\r\nmust be calculated using the terms of an ERISA plan.  See Carlo, 49\r\nF.3d at 794. \r\nHampers concedes that as against defendants NMC and\r\nFresenius, his breach of contract claim is properly preempted\r\nbecause \"the relief he seeks is inclusion in the NMC SERP.\"  As\r\nagainst Grace, however, Hampers insists that he \"must necessarily\r\nand exclusively seek money damages due to the fact that Grace no\r\nlonger has any authority or control over the NMC SERP,\" having\r\ntransferred its ownership of NMC to Fresenius in August 1996 and\r\nrelinquished all administrative duties relating to the NMC SERP. \r\nThus, Hampers admits that his claim against Grace would have been\r\npreempted if Grace had not, subsequent to the time of its alleged\r\nbreach of the 1991 Agreement, relinquished its responsibility over\r\nthe NMC SERP.\r\nThe mere fortuity that Grace, subsequent to the\r\noccurrence of the conduct at issue in this case, relinquished its\r\nresponsibility over the NMC SERP does not affect the ERISA\r\npreemption analysis.  Hampers's claim is directed at Grace's\r\nalleged breach of its promise to enroll him in the NMC SERP. \r\nSpecifically, Hampers argues that under the 1991 Agreement he was\r\n\"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan\r\nas it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including\r\nsuch benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP,\" but\r\nthat \"Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP,\r\nand NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\"  Thus, the wrongful conduct\r\nalleged by Hampers involves a determination of whether benefits\r\nwill be paid under an ERISA-governed plan.  In deciding not to\r\nenroll Hampers in the NMC SERP, Grace was acting in its capacity as\r\nan ERISA employer and fiduciary with responsibility over the\r\nadministration of the plan.  If Grace had not exercised\r\n\"discretion and authority or control respecting the management,\r\ndisposition and administration of the NMC SERP, including but not\r\nlimited to, the discretion of who is to be included for\r\nparticipation in the NMC SERP,\" as Hampers asserted in his\r\ncomplaint, Grace simply could not have been in breach by failing to\r\nuse its \"discretion,\" \"authority,\" or \"control\" to include Hampers\r\nin the SERP.\r\nThus, it is only by virtue of Grace's status as an ERISA\r\nemployer with direct control over the administration and operation\r\nof the NMC SERP that Grace could have breached the 1991 Agreement\r\nin the way Hampers insists that it did.  Consequently, this is not\r\na case where the defendant is being sued for wrongful conduct\r\ncommitted in its individual capacity, see, e.g., Wilson v.\r\nZoellner, 114 F.3d 713, 715 (8th Cir. 1997) (claim of\r\nmisrepresentation against an insurance agent); Stetson v. PFL Ins.\r\nCo., 16 F. Supp. 2d 28, 29 (D. Me. 1998) (same); see also Golas v.\r\nHomeview Inc., 106 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997) (Bownes, J.,\r\nconcurring) (claim brought against insurance broker acting in his\r\nindividual capacity), nor is this a case where the defendant is a\r\nthird party insurer or service provider who is not an ERISA entity-\r\n-plan, employer, participant, beneficiary, fiduciary--at all, see,\r\ne.g., Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\r\n170 F.3d 985, 991 (10th Cir. 1999) (claims against insurer for\r\nmisconduct in selling life insurance); Geweke Ford v. St. Joseph's\r\nOmni Preferred Care, Inc., 130 F.3d 1355, 1357 (9th Cir. 1997)\r\n(contract claims against third party provider of insurance and\r\nadministrative services); Arizona State Carpenters Pension Trust\r\nFund v. Citibank Arizona, 125 F.3d 715, 717-18 (9th Cir. 1997)\r\n(claims against bank providing custodial services); Coyne &amp; Delany\r\nCo. v. Selman, 98 F.3d 1457, 1460-61 (4th Cir. 1996) (malpractice\r\nclaim against insurance professionals).  \r\n\nC.  Conclusion\r\nIn summary, we conclude that Hampers's state law contract\r\nclaim against Grace \"relates to\" the NMC SERP within the meaning of\r\nERISA's preemption clause because Hampers's state law claim is an\r\nalternative to his claims for NMC SERP benefits against Grace, NMC,\r\nand Fresenius brought under ERISA.  We base this conclusion on\r\nthese factors: (1) Hampers's state law claim against Grace alleges\r\nprecisely the same conduct that underlies his claims for SERP\r\nbenefits under ERISA; (2) the relief requested by Hampers focuses\r\nprimarily on NMC SERP benefits; (3) finding Grace liable for breach\r\nof contract might require the court to order the NMC SERP to pay\r\nplan benefits; (4) the only claim for damages in the complaint is\r\nlinked to a request for attorneys' fees under ERISA; (5) Hampers\r\ncalculates the amount of his alleged damages by reference to the\r\nNMC SERP; (6) the central liability question at issue in his state\r\nlaw claim against Grace--whether the 1991 Agreement promised him\r\ninclusion in the NMC SERP must be viewed in light of the terms of\r\nthe NMC SERP and the NMC qualified plan; and (7) Grace's decision\r\nto deny Hampers participation rights in the ERISA-regulated plan--\r\nthe conduct at issue in the state law claim--resulted from a\r\ndecision made by Grace in its capacity as an ERISA employer with\r\nresponsibility and authority over the ERISA-regulated plan. \r\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in finding Hampers's\r\nstate law claim against Grace preempted and denying his demand for\r\na jury trial. \r\nAffirmed.\n",

The plaintiff, Dr. Constantine Hampers, demanded a jury trial on his common law breach of contract claims against defendants, W.R. Grace and Company, W.R. Grace and Company-Connecticut, (collectively, \"Grace\"), National Medical Care, Inc. (\"NMC\"), and Fresenius National Medical Care Holdings, Inc. (\"Fresenius\"). The district court rejected his demand, finding that ERISA preempted Hampers's state law claims. On appeal, Hampers argues that, with respect to defendant Grace, the trial court erred in finding his claim preempted. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1968, as an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and a nephrologist specializing in end-stage renal disease, Hampers co-founded NMC, a company that provides dialysis treatment to patients through private clinics. In a series of transactions between 1984 and 1989, Grace purchased a 100 percent equity interest in NMC, and began operating it as a wholly-owned subsidiary. In 1989, Hampers negotiated an employment agreement that, among other things, provided for his participation in the National Medical Care, Inc., Retirement Plan (the \"NMC qualified plan\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, J.P. Bolduc became president and chief operating officer of Grace, and he invited Hampers to become an executive vice president of Grace and director of its health care group, which included NMC. On February 22, 1991, Bolduc sent a letter to Hampers proposing terms for a new employment agreement with Grace that was to include membership in the W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (the \"Grace qualified plan\") and the W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the \"Grace SERP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This agreement provided Hampers with more benefits than he was previously entitled to under the NMC qualified plan because at that time NMC did not have a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) of its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers and Bolduc decided that the February 22 letter would be the basis of their agreement, and they turned the drafting over to their attorneys. Before the agreement was executed, however, Grace identified a problem with the proposed benefit scheme: Hampers's participation in the Grace qualified plan could jeopardize the plan's tax-preferred status. Accordingly, Grace's lawyers redrafted the agreement, providing Hampers with a cash benefit equal to what they estimated he would have received under the Grace qualified plan and Grace SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these changes were acceptable to Hampers, Grace's Salary, Incentive Compensation and Employee Benefits Committee found the terms too rich and refused to approve them. Instead, the compensation committee, and ultimately Grace's board of directors, approved a modified version of the agreement which capped Hampers's retirement benefits at $300,000 per year. Hampers reluctantly accepted the modified terms, and Grace's lawyers reduced them to writing, providing that Hampers's pension</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be equal to the amount by which (a) the lesser of (i) three times the actual pension benefit payable to him under NMC's retirement plan (beginning in the year in which he terminates employment with Grace) or (ii) $300,000 exceeds (b) the amount of the actual pension benefit payable to him under NMC's retirement plan at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1991, Hampers and Bolduc executed the agreement (the \"1991 Agreement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four years later, NMC's earnings had skyrocketed, and NMC employees demanded a richer benefits package. In response, Grace's board created in November 1995 the \"National Medical Care, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan\" (the \"NMC SERP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In 1996, Grace transferred ownership of NMC to Fresenius. On June 14, 1996, Hampers retired. Upon retirement, Hampers inquired about his retirement benefits. He learned from Grace that he was not a participant in the NMC SERP. He also learned that if he had been a participant in the NMC SERP, his aggregate retirement annuity (from the combined NMC qualified plan and NMC SERP) would have totaled more than $500,000. On January 2, 1997, Hampers filed the present suit, asserting that he was wrongly denied participation in the NMC SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Hampers contended that \"when a SERP for NMC senior executives . . . was created in or about November 15, 1995, Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP, and NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\" According to Hampers, this exclusion was a breach of the 1991 Agreement because under that agreement he was \"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan as it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including such benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP.\" In his view, the reference in the 1991 Agreement to \"NMC's retirement plan\" entitled him to participate, not only in the NMC qualified plan, which existed at the time of contracting, but also in any additional retirement benefits that Grace might establish for NMC in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a count of the complaint titled \"ERISA: The NMC SERP,\" Hampers asserted that the \"NMC SERP is an 'employee benefits plan' under ERISA,\" and Grace \"exercised and exercise[s] discretion and authority or control respecting the management, disposition and administration of the NMC SERP, including but not limited to, the discretion of who is to be included for participation in the NMC SERP.\" Thus, Hampers contended, \"[b]y virtue of the terms of the 1991 Agreement,\" Grace had a \"duty to include Dr. Hampers as a participant in the NMC SERP,\" and \"breached the duty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers sought a declaration that he is a participant in the NMC SERP and an order directing his enrollment in the NMC SERP with annuity disbursements adjusted to reflect such participation. Hampers also requested \"damages for the loss caused by [the defendants'] illegal conduct, including interest, costs and attorneys [sic] fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g) [ERISA &#167; 502(g)] and other applicable provisions of law.\" Finally, Hampers demanded a jury trial on all matters triable before a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the 1991 Agreement contained no promise of participation in any future NMC SERP. In opposition to the motion, Hampers argued that the term \"NMC retirement plan\" in the 1991 Agreement could not be construed to leave out future participation in the NMC SERP, as \"[b]y its very terms, the NMC SERP is inextricably linked to and dependent on the Qualified Plan.\" Indeed, he argued, eligibility for the NMC SERP depends on a formula that includes benefit accrual under the NMC qualified plan. As the only purpose of the SERP is to confer enhanced benefits on highly compensated executives without contravening the limits on qualified plans set by the tax code, Hampers contended that the two plans must be construed together to comprise one seamless retirement package. In the end, the district court denied summary judgment, finding that there was \"more than one reasonable construction of the term 'NMC retirement plan.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants then moved to strike Hampers's demand for a jury trial on the grounds that the NMC SERP was an ERISA plan and that ERISA preempted Hampers's state law cause of action. Characterizing the issue as a \"close question,\" the district court granted the defendants' motion, ruling that ERISA preempted Hampers's state law contract claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then conducted a ten day bench trial at which the defendants disputed Hampers's reading of the 1991 Agreement, arguing that the term \"NMC retirement plan\" referred to the NMC qualified plan, the plan that existed at the time of contracting, and did not promise inclusion in a future NMC SERP as Hampers contended. At the conclusion of the trial, the district court, invoking principles of New York state contract law, found no evidence that the parties intended Hampers's retirement benefits to include benefits under the NMC SERP, and entered a judgment in favor of the defendants. On appeal, Hampers does not contest the district court's application of contract law; rather, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his demand for a jury trial on his claim for lump sum contract damages against defendant Grace. Because the district court's denial of Hampers's request for a jury trial resulted from its legal ruling that his claim was preempted by ERISA, we review the trial court's decision de novo. See Golas v. Homeview Inc. 106 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997) (Bownes, J., concurring); Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790, 792-93 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ERISA PREEMPTION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. General Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, this case requires us to decide whether ERISA's preemption clause applies to Hampers's state law cause of action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> That preemption clause, section 514(a), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of this subchapter . . . shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . . (emphasis added). \"The term 'State law' includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State.\" ERISA &#167; 514(c)(1), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(c)(1). Discerning the meaning of &#167; 514(a) requires us to construe the language of a congressional statute. Therefore, \"[t]he question whether a certain state action is pre-empted by federal law is one of congressional intent.\" Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 137-38 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Express \"ERISA preemption analysis . . . involves two central questions: (1) whether the plan at issue is an 'employee benefit plan' and (2) whether the cause of action 'relates to' this employee benefit plan.\" McMahon v. Digital Equip. Corp., 162 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 1998). Because the NMC SERP is an ERISA-regulated \"employee benefit plan,\" our preemption analysis focuses on whether Hampers's cause of action \"relates to\" the NMC SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In adopting &#167; 514(a), Congress deliberately rejected narrower preemption language directed at \"state laws relating to the specific subjects covered by ERISA,\" Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 98 (1983) (emphasis added), choosing instead to supplant all state laws that \"relate to\" ERISA-regulated plans. In Shaw, the Supreme Court observed that \"[a] law 'relates to' an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\" Id. This \"early attempt[] by the Supreme Court to interpret ERISA's preemption clause relied heavily upon textual analysis and a dictionary definition of 'relate to,'\" Plumbing Indus. Bd., Plumbing Local Union No. 1 v. Howell Co., 126 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir. 1997), and led to the conclusion that ERISA preemption was \"conspicuous for its breadth,\" FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52, 58 (1990). Indeed, ERISA preempts a state law that has a connection with or refers to an ERISA-regulated benefits plan, \"even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect and even if the law is consistent with ERISA's substantive requirements.\" District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125, 130 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Rosario-Cordero v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp. Co., 46 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[A] state law may relate to an employee benefit plan even though the law does not conflict with ERISA's own requirements . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, from ERISA's inception, the Supreme Court recognized that \"[s]ome state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law 'relates to' the plan,\" Shaw, 463 U.S. at 100 n.21, and that such \"is the case with many laws of general applicability,\" Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. at 130 n.1. Drawing the line between those state laws that \"relate to\" ERISA-regulated plans, and those that are only \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" has proven considerably difficult in practice, producing an \"avalanche of litigation.\" De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Med. &amp; Clinical Serv. Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 809 n.1 (1997) (collecting Supreme Court ERISA preemption cases and documenting the enormous volume of cases in the lower federal courts). This case calls upon us to once again draw such a line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In drawing that line, we find cases emphasizing ERISA's carefully crafted civil enforcement scheme particularly relevant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See, e.g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 54 (1987); Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 143-44; Fitzgerald v. Codex Corp., 882 F.2d 586, 588 (1st Cir. 1989) (concluding that preemption extends to \"causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA.\"). In Pilot Life, the Supreme Court concluded that \"[t]he deliberate care with which ERISA's civil enforcement remedies were drafted and the balancing of policies embodied in its choice of remedies argue strongly for the conclusion that ERISA's civil enforcement remedies were intended to be exclusive.\" Id. at 54 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the detailed provisions of &#167; 502(a) set forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that represents a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans. The policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in Turner v. Fallon Community Heath Plan, 127 F.3d 196 (1st Cir. 1997), we found state common law claims preempted after determining that they fell within ERISA's exclusive civil enforcement regime. The plaintiff brought breach of contract and other state law claims, and a claim under ERISA &#167; 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B), against a health maintenance organization, charging that it wrongly denied a request to fund a certain cancer treatment. See id. at 197-98. The plaintiff sought compensatory damages, arguing \"that if ERISA provided no federal [damages] remedy, it ought not be read to preempt his state-law claims;\" alternatively, \"if ERISA preempted the state-law claims, then a federal remedy ought to be inferred or created by the court to permit damages for wrongful withholding of treatment under the employee benefits plan.\" Id. at 198. We rejected both arguments, finding the state law claims preempted and declining the plaintiff's invitation to fashion a federal remedy not authorized by ERISA's remedial scheme. See id. at 198-200. First, we concluded that ERISA &#167; 501(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B), provides a remedy to \"secure benefits under the plan rather than damages for a breach of the plan.\" Id. at 198 (emphasis added). We noted that \"the Supreme Court has stressed that ERISA does not create compensatory or punitive damage remedies where an administrator of a plan fails to provide the benefits due under that plan.\" Id. (citing Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 147 (1985)). We emphasized that Congress's decision not to allow causes of action for damages under ERISA \"is not a minor technicality: damage awards may increase effective coverage but may also add significantly to the costs of coverage.\" Id. at 198-99. Second, we held that although \"[a]bsent preemption, a health benefits plan . . . could certainly be treated as a contract enforceable under state law and subject to the usual contractual remedies, including compensatory damages,\" ERISA's preemption clause \"preclude[s] state claims to enforce rights under an ERISA plan or obtain damages for the wrongful withholding of those rights.\" Id. at 199.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we acknowledged in Turner that the Supreme Court has \"set some new limits on preemption,\" we stressed that ERISA continues to preempt \"a state's attempt to provide state remedies for what is in essence a plan administrator's refusal to pay allegedly promised benefits.\" Id. at 199. Such reasoning is consistent with, and indeed supported by New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Insurance Co., 514 U.S. 645, 656 (1995), the case in which the Supreme Court first acknowledged the unworkability of a literal reading of ERISA &#167; 514(a)'s \"relate to\" standard, and ruled that courts must \"look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> According to the Travelers Court, ERISA's purpose was \"'to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law.'\" Id. at 656 (quoting Ingersoll-Rand, 498 U.S. at 142). The Court identified three categories of state laws that \"relate to\" ERISA plans in such a way that preemption of those laws furthers this purpose: (1) state laws that \"mandate[] employee benefit structures or their administration,\" (2) state laws that \"bind plan administrators to [a] particular choice,\" and (3) state law causes of action that provide \"alternative enforcement mechanisms\" to ERISA's enforcement regime. See id. at 658-59. The third category has particular relevance for our present inquiry. In this vein, we have stated that in order to assess whether the state law cause of action is an alternative enforcement mechanism, we must \"look beyond the face of the complaint\" and determine the real nature of the claim \"regardless of plaintiff's . . . characterization.\" Danca v. Private Health Care Sys., Inc., 185 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Hampers's State Law Contract Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers's complaint alleged a cause of action under ERISA based on precisely the same conduct that underlies his state law contract claim. In particular, in Count III of the complaint, entitled \"ERISA: The NMC SERP,\" Hampers asserted that by virtue of the 1991 Agreement, Grace had a \"duty to include Hampers as a participant in the NMC SERP,\" and breached that duty by \"causing him to be excluded from the NMC SERP.\" In Count II of the complaint, entitled, \"Contract: Retirement Benefit,\" Hampers argued that under the terms of the 1991 Agreement with Grace he was \"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan as it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including such benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP.\" Hampers contended that \"when a SERP for NMC senior executives . . . was created in or about November 15, 1995, Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP, and NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\" According to Hampers, this conduct constituted a breach of the 1991 Agreement. That the very same conduct--Grace's failure to include Hampers in the NMC SERP--underlies both Hampers's state law contract claim and his ERISA-benefits claim suggests that the state law claim is an alternative mechanism for obtaining ERISA plan benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As relief, Hampers primarily sought benefits under the NMC SERP. First, he sought a declaratory judgment that he is \"entitled to participate in the NMC SERP and is entitled to receive all such benefits as to which he is entitled under the NMC SERP,\" and he petitioned the court to \"order that Grace . . . cause Hampers to be enrolled in the NMC SERP forthwith and cause the NMC SERP to disburse to Hampers his rightful annuity as of January 1, 1997 at such amount as he would have been entitled to had Hampers been included in the SERP from the day of its creation on or about November 15, 1995.\" Moreover, even with respect to Hampers's state law claim for contract damages, he asserts that \"upon a Jury's finding that Grace is liable to Dr. Hampers under the 1991 Agreement . . . [,] the district court [would] have to face the issue of the appropriateness of an injunctive order directed to NMC and Fresenius that they enroll Hampers in the NMC SERP.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers's complaint requested \"damages for the loss caused by [the defendants'] illegal conduct, including interest, costs and attorneys [sic] fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g) [ERISA &#167; 502(g)] and other applicable provisions of law.\" Hampers therefore linked his claim for damages to a request for attorneys' fees authorized under ERISA, but not authorized under state law. Moreover, in attempting to prove the \"illegal conduct\"--Grace's decision to deny him participation rights in the NMC SERP--Hampers relied on the terms of the NMC SERP, arguing that because the SERP defines its benefits with respect to the NMC qualified plan, the term \"NMC retirement plan\" in the 1991 Agreement must include both the qualified plan and the SERP. We have consistently held that a cause of action \"relates to\" an ERISA plan when a court must evaluate or interpret the terms of the ERISA-regulated plan to determine liability under the state law cause of action. See McMahon v. Digital Equip. Corp., 162 F.3d. 28, 38 (1st Cir. 1998); Boston Children's Heart Found., Inc. v. Nadal-Ginard, 73 F.3d 429, 440 (1st Cir. 1996); Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790, 793-94 (1st Cir. 1995); Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 14 F.3d 697, 698-99 (1st Cir. 1994). Finally, Hampers measured his damages by reference to the NMC SERP, contending that, as a participant, he would have been entitled to approximately $250,000 per year in additional annual pension benefits. We have held that ERISA preempts state law causes of action for damages where the damages must be calculated using the terms of an ERISA plan. See Carlo, 49 F.3d at 794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers concedes that as against defendants NMC and Fresenius, his breach of contract claim is properly preempted because \"the relief he seeks is inclusion in the NMC SERP.\" As against Grace, however, Hampers insists that he \"must necessarily and exclusively seek money damages due to the fact that Grace no longer has any authority or control over the NMC SERP,\" having transferred its ownership of NMC to Fresenius in August 1996 and relinquished all administrative duties relating to the NMC SERP. Thus, Hampers admits that his claim against Grace would have been preempted if Grace had not, subsequent to the time of its alleged breach of the 1991 Agreement, relinquished its responsibility over the NMC SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere fortuity that Grace, subsequent to the occurrence of the conduct at issue in this case, relinquished its responsibility over the NMC SERP does not affect the ERISA preemption analysis. Hampers's claim is directed at Grace's alleged breach of its promise to enroll him in the NMC SERP. Specifically, Hampers argues that under the 1991 Agreement he was \"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan as it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including such benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP,\" but that \"Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP, and NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\" Thus, the wrongful conduct alleged by Hampers involves a determination of whether benefits will be paid under an ERISA-governed plan. In deciding not to enroll Hampers in the NMC SERP, Grace was acting in its capacity as an ERISA employer and fiduciary with responsibility over the administration of the plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> If Grace had not exercised \"discretion and authority or control respecting the management, disposition and administration of the NMC SERP, including but not limited to, the discretion of who is to be included for participation in the NMC SERP,\" as Hampers asserted in his complaint, Grace simply could not have been in breach by failing to use its \"discretion,\" \"authority,\" or \"control\" to include Hampers in the SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it is only by virtue of Grace's status as an ERISA employer with direct control over the administration and operation of the NMC SERP that Grace could have breached the 1991 Agreement in the way Hampers insists that it did. Consequently, this is not a case where the defendant is being sued for wrongful conduct committed in its individual capacity, see, e.g., Wilson v. Zoellner, 114 F.3d 713, 715 (8th Cir. 1997) (claim of misrepresentation against an insurance agent); Stetson v. PFL Ins. Co., 16 F. Supp. 2d 28, 29 (D. Me. 1998) (same); see also Golas v. Homeview Inc., 106 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997) (Bownes, J., concurring) (claim brought against insurance broker acting in his individual capacity), nor is this a case where the defendant is a third party insurer or service provider who is not an ERISA entity--plan, employer, participant, beneficiary, fiduciary--at all, see, e.g., Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 170 F.3d 985, 991 (10th Cir. 1999) (claims against insurer for misconduct in selling life insurance); Geweke Ford v. St. Joseph's Omni Preferred Care, Inc., 130 F.3d 1355, 1357 (9th Cir. 1997) (contract claims against third party provider of insurance and administrative services); Arizona State Carpenters Pension Trust Fund v. Citibank Arizona, 125 F.3d 715, 717-18 (9th Cir. 1997) (claims against bank providing custodial services); Coyne &amp; Delany Co. v. Selman, 98 F.3d 1457, 1460-61 (4th Cir. 1996) (malpractice claim against insurance professionals).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we conclude that Hampers's state law contract claim against Grace \"relates to\" the NMC SERP within the meaning of ERISA's preemption clause because Hampers's state law claim is an alternative to his claims for NMC SERP benefits against Grace, NMC, and Fresenius brought under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We base this conclusion on these factors: (1) Hampers's state law claim against Grace alleges precisely the same conduct that underlies his claims for SERP benefits under ERISA; (2) the relief requested by Hampers focuses primarily on NMC SERP benefits; (3) finding Grace liable for breach of contract might require the court to order the NMC SERP to pay plan benefits; (4) the only claim for damages in the complaint is linked to a request for attorneys' fees under ERISA; (5) Hampers calculates the amount of his alleged damages by reference to the NMC SERP; (6) the central liability question at issue in his state law claim against Grace--whether the 1991 Agreement promised him inclusion in the NMC SERP-must be viewed in light of the terms of the NMC SERP and the NMC qualified plan; and (7) Grace's decision to deny Hampers participation rights in the ERISA-regulated plan--the conduct at issue in the state law claim--resulted from a decision made by Grace in its capacity as an ERISA employer with responsibility and authority over the ERISA-regulated plan. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding Hampers's state law claim against Grace preempted and denying his demand for a jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A \"qualified\" plan is one that qualifies for special tax advantages under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Supplemental retirement plans do not qualify for tax-preferred status like \"qualified plans.\" Supplemental plans are used to offer top executives additional benefits that could not be offered under a qualified plan without jeopardizing the qualified plan's tax-preferred status.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As Hampers states in his complaint, the NMC SERP is an \"employee benefit plan\" within the meaning of ERISA &#167; 3(3), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(3).

The district court rejected his demand, finding that ERISA preempted Hampers's state law claims. On appeal, Hampers argues that, with respect to defendant Grace, the trial court erred in finding his claim preempted. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1968, as an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and a nephrologist specializing in end-stage renal disease, Hampers co-founded NMC, a company that provides dialysis treatment to patients through private clinics. In a series of transactions between 1984 and 1989, Grace purchased a 100 percent equity interest in NMC, and began operating it as a wholly-owned subsidiary. In 1989, Hampers negotiated an employment agreement that, among other things, provided for his participation in the National Medical Care, Inc., Retirement Plan (the \"NMC qualified plan\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, J.P. Bolduc became president and chief operating officer of Grace, and he invited Hampers to become an executive vice president of Grace and director of its health care group, which included NMC. On February 22, 1991, Bolduc sent a letter to Hampers proposing terms for a new employment agreement with Grace that was to include membership in the W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (the \"Grace qualified plan\") and the W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the \"Grace SERP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This agreement provided Hampers with more benefits than he was previously entitled to under the NMC qualified plan because at that time NMC did not have a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) of its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers and Bolduc decided that the February 22 letter would be the basis of their agreement, and they turned the drafting over to their attorneys. Before the agreement was executed, however, Grace identified a problem with the proposed benefit scheme: Hampers's participation in the Grace qualified plan could jeopardize the plan's tax-preferred status. Accordingly, Grace's lawyers redrafted the agreement, providing Hampers with a cash benefit equal to what they estimated he would have received under the Grace qualified plan and Grace SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these changes were acceptable to Hampers, Grace's Salary, Incentive Compensation and Employee Benefits Committee found the terms too rich and refused to approve them. Instead, the compensation committee, and ultimately Grace's board of directors, approved a modified version of the agreement which capped Hampers's retirement benefits at $300,000 per year.

In response, Grace's board created in November 1995 the \"National Medical Care, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan\" (the \"NMC SERP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In 1996, Grace transferred ownership of NMC to Fresenius. On June 14, 1996, Hampers retired. Upon retirement, Hampers inquired about his retirement benefits. He learned from Grace that he was not a participant in the NMC SERP. He also learned that if he had been a participant in the NMC SERP, his aggregate retirement annuity (from the combined NMC qualified plan and NMC SERP) would have totaled more than $500,000. On January 2, 1997, Hampers filed the present suit, asserting that he was wrongly denied participation in the NMC SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Hampers contended that \"when a SERP for NMC senior executives . . . was created in or about November 15, 1995, Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP, and NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\" According to Hampers, this exclusion was a breach of the 1991 Agreement because under that agreement he was \"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan as it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including such benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP.\" In his view, the reference in the 1991 Agreement to \"NMC's retirement plan\" entitled him to participate, not only in the NMC qualified plan, which existed at the time of contracting, but also in any additional retirement benefits that Grace might establish for NMC in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a count of the complaint titled \"ERISA: The NMC SERP,\" Hampers asserted that the \"NMC SERP is an 'employee benefits plan' under ERISA,\" and Grace \"exercised and exercise[s] discretion and authority or control respecting the management, disposition and administration of the NMC SERP, including but not limited to, the discretion of who is to be included for participation in the NMC SERP.\" Thus, Hampers contended, \"[b]y virtue of the terms of the 1991 Agreement,\" Grace had a \"duty to include Dr. Hampers as a participant in the NMC SERP,\" and \"breached the duty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers sought a declaration that he is a participant in the NMC SERP and an order directing his enrollment in the NMC SERP with annuity disbursements adjusted to reflect such participation. Hampers also requested \"damages for the loss caused by [the defendants'] illegal conduct, including interest, costs and attorneys [sic] fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g) [ERISA &#167; 502(g)] and other applicable provisions of law.\" Finally, Hampers demanded a jury trial on all matters triable before a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the 1991 Agreement contained no promise of participation in any future NMC SERP. In opposition to the motion, Hampers argued that the term \"NMC retirement plan\" in the 1991 Agreement could not be construed to leave out future participation in the NMC SERP, as \"[b]y its very terms, the NMC SERP is inextricably linked to and dependent on the Qualified Plan.\" Indeed, he argued, eligibility for the NMC SERP depends on a formula that includes benefit accrual under the NMC qualified plan. As the only purpose of the SERP is to confer enhanced benefits on highly compensated executives without contravening the limits on qualified plans set by the tax code, Hampers contended that the two plans must be construed together to comprise one seamless retirement package. In the end, the district court denied summary judgment, finding that there was \"more than one reasonable construction of the term 'NMC retirement plan.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants then moved to strike Hampers's demand for a jury trial on the grounds that the NMC SERP was an ERISA plan and that ERISA preempted Hampers's state law cause of action. Characterizing the issue as a \"close question,\" the district court granted the defendants' motion, ruling that ERISA preempted Hampers's state law contract claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then conducted a ten day bench trial at which the defendants disputed Hampers's reading of the 1991 Agreement, arguing that the term \"NMC retirement plan\" referred to the NMC qualified plan, the plan that existed at the time of contracting, and did not promise inclusion in a future NMC SERP as Hampers contended. At the conclusion of the trial, the district court, invoking principles of New York state contract law, found no evidence that the parties intended Hampers's retirement benefits to include benefits under the NMC SERP, and entered a judgment in favor of the defendants. On appeal, Hampers does not contest the district court's application of contract law; rather, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his demand for a jury trial on his claim for lump sum contract damages against defendant Grace. Because the district court's denial of Hampers's request for a jury trial resulted from its legal ruling that his claim was preempted by ERISA, we review the trial court's decision de novo.

The Court identified three categories of state laws that \"relate to\" ERISA plans in such a way that preemption of those laws furthers this purpose: (1) state laws that \"mandate[] employee benefit structures or their administration,\" (2) state laws that \"bind plan administrators to [a] particular choice,\" and (3) state law causes of action that provide \"alternative enforcement mechanisms\" to ERISA's enforcement regime.

Hampers's State Law Contract Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers's complaint alleged a cause of action under ERISA based on precisely the same conduct that underlies his state law contract claim. In particular, in Count III of the complaint, entitled \"ERISA: The NMC SERP,\" Hampers asserted that by virtue of the 1991 Agreement, Grace had a \"duty to include Hampers as a participant in the NMC SERP,\" and breached that duty by \"causing him to be excluded from the NMC SERP.\" In Count II of the complaint, entitled, \"Contract: Retirement Benefit,\" Hampers argued that under the terms of the 1991 Agreement with Grace he was \"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan as it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including such benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP.\" Hampers contended that \"when a SERP for NMC senior executives . . . was created in or about November 15, 1995, Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP, and NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\" According to Hampers, this conduct constituted a breach of the 1991 Agreement. That the very same conduct--Grace's failure to include Hampers in the NMC SERP--underlies both Hampers's state law contract claim and his ERISA-benefits claim suggests that the state law claim is an alternative mechanism for obtaining ERISA plan benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As relief, Hampers primarily sought benefits under the NMC SERP. First, he sought a declaratory judgment that he is \"entitled to participate in the NMC SERP and is entitled to receive all such benefits as to which he is entitled under the NMC SERP,\" and he petitioned the court to \"order that Grace . . . cause Hampers to be enrolled in the NMC SERP forthwith and cause the NMC SERP to disburse to Hampers his rightful annuity as of January 1, 1997 at such amount as he would have been entitled to had Hampers been included in the SERP from the day of its creation on or about November 15, 1995.\" Moreover, even with respect to Hampers's state law claim for contract damages, he asserts that \"upon a Jury's finding that Grace is liable to Dr. Hampers under the 1991 Agreement . . . [,] the district court [would] have to face the issue of the appropriateness of an injunctive order directed to NMC and Fresenius that they enroll Hampers in the NMC SERP.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampers's complaint requested \"damages for the loss caused by [the defendants'] illegal conduct, including interest, costs and attorneys [sic] fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g) [ERISA &#167; 502(g)] and other applicable provisions of law.\" Hampers therefore linked his claim for damages to a request for attorneys' fees authorized under ERISA, but not authorized under state law. Moreover, in attempting to prove the \"illegal conduct\"--Grace's decision to deny him participation rights in the NMC SERP--Hampers relied on the terms of the NMC SERP, arguing that because the SERP defines its benefits with respect to the NMC qualified plan, the term \"NMC retirement plan\" in the 1991 Agreement must include both the qualified plan and the SERP. We have consistently held that a cause of action \"relates to\" an ERISA plan when a court must evaluate or interpret the terms of the ERISA-regulated plan to determine liability under the state law cause of action.

Finally, Hampers measured his damages by reference to the NMC SERP, contending that, as a participant, he would have been entitled to approximately $250,000 per year in additional annual pension benefits. We have held that ERISA preempts state law causes of action for damages where the damages must be calculated using the terms of an ERISA plan.

Thus, Hampers admits that his claim against Grace would have been preempted if Grace had not, subsequent to the time of its alleged breach of the 1991 Agreement, relinquished its responsibility over the NMC SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere fortuity that Grace, subsequent to the occurrence of the conduct at issue in this case, relinquished its responsibility over the NMC SERP does not affect the ERISA preemption analysis. Hampers's claim is directed at Grace's alleged breach of its promise to enroll him in the NMC SERP. Specifically, Hampers argues that under the 1991 Agreement he was \"entitled to the full pension benefits of the NMC retirement plan as it existed on the date of his retirement, specifically including such benefits under the NMC qualified plan and the NMC SERP,\" but that \"Grace caused Dr. Hampers to be excluded from the NMC SERP, and NMC so excluded Dr. Hampers.\" Thus, the wrongful conduct alleged by Hampers involves a determination of whether benefits will be paid under an ERISA-governed plan. In deciding not to enroll Hampers in the NMC SERP, Grace was acting in its capacity as an ERISA employer and fiduciary with responsibility over the administration of the plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> If Grace had not exercised \"discretion and authority or control respecting the management, disposition and administration of the NMC SERP, including but not limited to, the discretion of who is to be included for participation in the NMC SERP,\" as Hampers asserted in his complaint, Grace simply could not have been in breach by failing to use its \"discretion,\" \"authority,\" or \"control\" to include Hampers in the SERP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it is only by virtue of Grace's status as an ERISA employer with direct control over the administration and operation of the NMC SERP that Grace could have breached the 1991 Agreement in the way Hampers insists that it did. Consequently, this is not a case where the defendant is being sued for wrongful conduct committed in its individual capacity, see, e.g., Wilson v. Zoellner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741110\"><a href=\"/opinion/741110/candace-j-wilson-v-wayne-zoellner/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 715 (8th Cir. 1997) (claim of misrepresentation against an insurance agent); Stetson v.

Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we conclude that Hampers's state law contract claim against Grace \"relates to\" the NMC SERP within the meaning of ERISA's preemption clause because Hampers's state law claim is an alternative to his claims for NMC SERP benefits against Grace, NMC, and Fresenius brought under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We base this conclusion on these factors: (1) Hampers's state law claim against Grace alleges precisely the same conduct that underlies his claims for SERP benefits under ERISA; (2) the relief requested by Hampers focuses primarily on NMC SERP benefits; (3) finding Grace liable for breach of contract might require the court to order the NMC SERP to pay plan benefits; (4) the only claim for damages in the complaint is linked to a request for attorneys' fees under ERISA; (5) Hampers calculates the amount of his alleged damages by reference to the NMC SERP; (6) the central liability question at issue in his state law claim against Grace--whether the 1991 Agreement promised him inclusion in the NMC SERP-must be viewed in light of the terms of the NMC SERP and the NMC qualified plan; and (7) Grace's decision to deny Hampers participation rights in the ERISA-regulated plan--the conduct at issue in the state law claim--resulted from a decision made by Grace in its capacity as an ERISA employer with responsibility and authority over the ERISA-regulated plan. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding Hampers's state law claim against Grace preempted and denying his demand for a jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A \"qualified\" plan is one that qualifies for special tax advantages under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Supplemental retirement plans do not qualify for tax-preferred status like \"qualified plans.\" Supplemental plans are used to offer top executives additional benefits that could not be offered under a qualified plan without jeopardizing the qualified plan's tax-preferred status.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As Hampers states in his complaint, the NMC SERP is an \"employee benefit plan\" within the meaning of ERISA &#167; 3(3), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(3).

However, as an \"employee benefit plan,\" the NMC-SERP is governed by ERISA's reporting and disclosure rules (the ERISA 100's), see ERISA &#167; 101 (a), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1021(a), and ERISA's criminal and civil enforcement provisions (the ERISA 500's), see ERISA &#167; 501, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1131(criminal enforcement); ERISA &#167; 502, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132 (civil enforcement), including ERISA's preemption provision, ERISA &#167; 514(a), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> \"[T]he Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art.
