Christopher Bayes was convicted\n\non one count of simple assault in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n113(a)(5) and 49 U.S.C. § 46506(1).              On appeal, Bayes challenges\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction and\n\nalso contests his sentence.               For the following reasons, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n                                  Background\n\n            As    with    any   challenge       to    the    sufficiency     of   the\n\nevidence following a trial by jury, we recite the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the jury's verdict.                    See United States\n\nv. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1310 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            On June 5, 1999, Bayes boarded Delta Airlines Flight\n\n64   from   Atlanta,      Georgia,   to       Manchester,      England.      Debbie\n\nParker, Mario Garcia, and Carron Smoak were the three flight\n\nattendants apparently responsible for the section of the cabin\n\nin which Bayes was seated.               Before the plane left the gate,\n\nParker served Bayes a glass of champagne and a glass of orange\n\njuice.      When Garcia went to collect the two glasses a short\n\nwhile later, Bayes responded by saying, \"What are you, crazy?\"\n\nAlthough     Garcia      concluded   that       \"we    might    have    an   unruly\n\npassenger\"       on   board,    Parker    gave       Bayes    another     alcoholic\n\nbeverage once the plane was in the air.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f           About an hour into the flight, Parker and Smoak began\n\nto distribute linen, flatware, and bread dishes by placing them\n\non each passenger's dining tray.             After providing Bayes with\n\nthese items, Smoak asked him what kind of bread he wanted.                    As\n\nSmoak \"reached over [her service] cart to get the roll that he\n\nsaid he wanted . . . [Bayes] put his hand on [her] buttocks and\n\nrubbed   [her]   buttocks     and   grabbed    at   the   bottom      of   [her]\n\nbuttocks.\"   Bayes claimed to have touched Smoak by accident, but\n\nWade McCallon, a passenger seated nearby, later described what\n\nhad   occurred   as   \"reaching     behind    the   flight    attendant      and\n\ngrabbing her in the rear end\" and \"squeezing.\"\n\n           Smoak immediately complained about Bayes's conduct to\n\nher on-board supervisor, Susan Corbett, and to the on-board\n\nCustomer Service Coordinator, Christopher Yates. Although there\n\nare conflicting accounts of exactly what happened next, there\n\nwas   evidence   that   Bayes   persisted      in   being    unruly    despite\n\nperiodic warnings from members of the crew.               A scuffle ensued,\n\nending only after the captain dumped thousands of gallons of\n\nfuel,    diverted     the   aircraft   in     mid-flight,     and     made    an\n\nunscheduled landing so that Bayes could be taken off the plane\n\nat Bangor International Airport in Maine.\n\n           Bayes was charged with five counts of simple assault\n\nagainst Smoak, Garcia, Corbett, Yates, and a passenger named\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fRhine Blake.    See 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5) (criminalizing \"[s]imple\n\nassault\"     within     the   special       maritime    and     territorial\n\njurisdiction    of    the   United   States);    49    U.S.C.   §   46506(1)\n\n(incorporating the conduct proscribed by 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5)\n\nas an offense within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States).       Bayes also faced one count of interfering with\n\na flight crew in violation of 49 U.S.C. § 46504.              After a five-\n\nday trial, a jury convicted Bayes of the assault against Smoak\n\nbut either acquitted him or failed to reach a verdict with\n\nrespect to the other charges.              The district court sentenced\n\nBayes to six months in prison with a $10 special assessment and\n\na $5000 fine.     This appeal followed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n                                     A.\n\n            Bayes supports his challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence by arguing that the offense for which he was convicted\n\nrequires a specific kind of intent that the government failed to\n\nprove.     Before reaching this claim, however, we must consider\n\nwhether Bayes has preserved the issue for appellate review.\n\n            After the government rested its case at trial, Bayes\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal.           See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\n\nAlthough Bayes made his motion \"on all counts,\" the arguments he\n\noffered to support it spoke only to the other counts in the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\findictment and not to the charge of assaulting Smoak.                     When\n\npressed on the issue, Bayes's attorney conceded that \"as far as\n\nCarron Smoak's case [goes], the best view of the evidence would\n\nbe an assault.     So, I'm not going to argue that that couldn't be\n\nfound by the jury.\"        A few moments later, counsel confirmed that\n\nBayes was not moving for a directed finding with respect to that\n\ncharge   because     \"if   you   believe    [Smoak],   there's      sufficient\n\nevidence for a jury to find [Bayes] guilty.\"\n\n           In any event, the district court refused to enter a\n\njudgment of acquittal, the trial proceeded, and ultimately the\n\njury found Bayes guilty only of assaulting Smoak.                   After the\n\njury was released, Bayes filed a new motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal questioning the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\n\nthe charge of conviction.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c) (\"It shall\n\nnot be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar\n\nmotion has been made prior to the submission of the case to the\n\njury.\").    Although this motion did put the relevant count of\n\nconviction under scrutiny, it still failed to raise the question\n\nof intent, merely arguing that none of the witnesses could have\n\nseen the alleged attack.            (Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n(\"The    testimony    of   Carron   Smoak    failed    to   place   her   in   a\n\nposition on the airplane where witnesses could have observed\n\nthat the alleged assault took place.\").)\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            On appeal, Bayes now seeks to change hats.           Rather than\n\nclaiming that no one could have witnessed the alleged assault,\n\nBayes   contends    that   his    offense     of    conviction   requires     a\n\nspecific kind of intent that the government failed to establish.\n\nBecause   Bayes    never   brought   this     argument    to   the   district\n\ncourt's attention, we might consider it waived.                   See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998)                     (\"A\n\nlitigant cannot jump from theory to theory like a bee buzzing\n\nfrom flower to flower. . . . [W]hen a party fails to raise a\n\ntheory at the district court level, that theory is generally\n\nregarded as forfeited and cannot be advanced on appeal.\"), cert.\n\ndenied, 67 U.S.L.W. 3613 (1999).\n\n            But even in the face of procedural default, we retain\n\nthe discretion to correct \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting\n\nsubstantial rights.\"       Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).        We will exercise\n\nthis discretion only to correct (1) an error; (2) that is plain;\n\n(3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) that \"seriously\n\naffect[s]    the   fairness,     integrity,    or    public    reputation    of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"      United States v. Johnson, 520 U.S. 461,\n\n467 (1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(alteration in original).         With this standard in mind, we turn\n\nour attention to whether there has been a plain error or defect\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fin this case and, if so, whether it warrants redress under Rule\n\n52(b).\n\n                                      B.\n\n            Bayes contends that the evidence failed to support his\n\nconviction for simple assault because the government did not\n\nprove that he intended to injure Smoak or to threaten her with\n\nharm when he touched her on the buttocks.             Viewing the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, we consider\n\nwhether   a   rational   juror    could      have   found    guilt    beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt.      See United States v. Alicea-Cardoza, 132 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Bayes was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5),\n\nwhich proscribes the crime of \"[s]imple assault\" but does not\n\ndefine that term in any way.                Although the statute neither\n\nstates nor suggests that simple assault requires the defendant\n\nto have acted with a specific kind of intent, the district court\n\nconcluded that the offense demanded exactly that.                  As a result,\n\nthe court instructed the jury that \"to prove simple assault, the\n\ngovernment     must   demonstrate     [that]    the   defendant      willfully\n\nattempted     to   inflict   injury   upon    the   person    of    another    or\n\nthreatened to inflict injury upon the person of another, coupled\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fwith an apparent present ability to do so, [and/or1] caused [a]\n\nreasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\"\n\n          If this instruction accurately described the level of\n\nintent that § 113(a)(5) requires, then we might question whether\n\nthere was sufficient evidence on which to base a conviction.\n\nThe jury reasonably could have found that Bayes had touched\n\nSmoak on the buttocks on purpose, given her testimony that he\n\nhad \"put his hand on [her] buttocks and rubbed [her] buttocks\n\nand   grabbed   at    the    bottom     of    [her]   buttocks.\"     McCallon\n\nconfirmed that Bayes had \"reach[ed] behind [Smoak] and grabb[ed]\n\nher in the rear end\" and \"squeez[ed].\"                  But this testimony\n\nmerely supported the conclusion that Bayes had touched Smoak\n\ndeliberately; it did not necessarily demonstrate that Bayes had\n\nintended to injure Smoak or to threaten her with harm when he\n\ntouched her.       Likewise, while Smoak testified that Bayes's\n\nconduct   caused     her    to   feel   \"frightened,\"     it   was   at   least\n\ndebatable whether Bayes intended that result.\n\n          Nevertheless, § 113(a)(5) merely prohibits \"[s]imple\n\nassault\" without specifying a particular kind of intent as a\n\n\n      1\n     The trial court should have included a conjunction here to\nindicate whether a \"reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily\nharm\" was an additional element of simple assault or an\nalternative basis for conviction.        The trial transcript\nindicates that the court failed to make this distinction, but\nour resolution of the merits does not depend on the court's\nintentions in this regard.\n\n                                        -9-\n\ftextual       element     of   the    offense.              The    district    court's\n\nrequirement that Bayes \"willfully attempted to inflict injury\n\nupon the person of another or threatened to inflict injury\" does\n\nnot   appear        anywhere   in    the    statutory        language.        Unlike    §\n\n113(a)(1) of the statute, which criminalizes \"[a]ssault with\n\nintent to commit murder,\" and § 113(a)(3), which prohibits\n\n\"[a]ssault with a dangerous weapon, with intent to do bodily\n\nharm,\"    a    specific     kind     of    intent      is    not   inherent    in   the\n\nstatutory definition of the crime for which Bayes was convicted.\n\nThe fact that Congress enumerated a very specific type of intent\n\nfor some kinds of assault but not for others casts doubt on\n\nwhether \"[s]imple assault\" -- a term left undefined -- requires\n\nan intent to cause harm or to threaten another with injury.                         See\n\nUnited States v. Martin, 536 F.2d 535, 535-36 (2d Cir. 1976)\n\n(per curiam).\n\n              We turn to the common law for additional guidance.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Turley, 352 U.S. 407, 411 (1957) (\"[W]here a\n\nfederal criminal statute uses a common-law term of established\n\nmeaning without otherwise defining it, the general practice is\n\nto give that term its common-law meaning.\").                        Assault had two\n\nmeanings at common law, \"the first being an attempt to commit a\n\nbattery       and   the   second     [being]      an   act    putting    another       in\n\nreasonable apprehension of bodily harm.\"                    United States v. Bell,\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\f505 F.2d 539, 540 (7th Cir. 1974); see also United States v.\n\nGuilbert, 692 F.2d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 1982).                A battery, in\n\nturn, did not require proof that the defendant intended to\n\ninjure another or to threaten her with harm.                  \"The slightest\n\nwillful       offensive     touching     of    another      constitute[d]      a\n\nbattery . . . regardless of whether the defendant harbor[ed] an\n\nintent to do physical harm.\"             United States v. Williams, 197\n\nF.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Burton v. Livingston,\n\n791 F.2d 97, 99 (8th Cir. 1986) (noting that \"a plaintiff may\n\nseek redress and win damages under state law for any unwanted\n\ntouching under the common law of battery\").\n\n              Thus, under the traditional view, \"offensive touchings\n\n(as where a man puts his hands upon a girl's body or kisses a\n\nwoman against her will . . .) w[ould] also suffice for battery\"\n\nin the absence of a valid justification or excuse.                2 Wayne R.\n\nLaFave    &   Austin   W.   Scott,    Jr.,    Substantive    Criminal    Law   §\n\n7.15(a),      at   301-02   (1986).     As    Blackstone    observed    in   his\n\nCommentaries:\n\n              The lea[s]t touching of another's per[s]on\n              wilfully, or in anger, is a battery; for the\n              law cannot draw the line between different\n              degrees of violence, and therefore totally\n              prohibits the fir[s]t and lowe[s]t [s]tage\n              of it: every man's per[s]on being [s]acred,\n              and no other having a right to meddle with\n              it, in any the [s]lighte[s]t manner.\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f3 Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120 (Univ. of\n\nChicago Press ed. 1979) (1768) (alterations from old English).\n\n             Consistent         with    these       principles,        the      common    law\n\nprovided that an assault committed by way of a battery did not\n\nrequire an intent to cause or to threaten an injury as long as\n\nthe defendant touched another in a deliberately offensive manner\n\nwithout a valid reason to do so.                    See 2 LaFave & Scott, supra,\n\n§ 7.16(a), at 37 n.13.1 (Supp. 1999).                      In Gates v. State, for\n\nexample, a Georgia court affirmed a conviction for \"assault and\n\nbattery\"      based       on     evidence          that   the      defendant           \"twice\n\ndeliberately        'touched,'        'tapped'       or   'hit'    [someone]        on    the\n\nbuttocks\" without her consent.                      138 S.E.2d 473, 474 (Ga. Ct.\n\nApp. 1964).      Similarly, in Wood v. Commonwealth, the Virginia\n\nSupreme Court affirmed a conviction for \"assault and battery\"\n\nbased   on    evidence         that    the   defendant      groped         a   minor     in    a\n\nnonviolent but sexually offensive manner.                       140 S.E. 114, 115-16\n\n(Va. 1927).         Likewise, in         Guarro v. United States, the D.C.\n\nCircuit observed that \"[u]nless there is consent, it would seem\n\nthat    a    [nonconsensual]           sexual       touching      is   a       sufficiently\n\noffensive     act    to    constitute         an     assault\"     under        District       of\n\nColumbia law.        237 F.2d 578, 580-81 (D.C. Cir. 1956).\n\n             These cases do not control our decision, but they\n\nprovide useful guidance as to what constitutes an assault at\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\fcommon law.      Collectively, the decisions support the conclusion\n\nthat, in a prosecution for simple assault under § 113(a)(5), it\n\nis sufficient to show that the defendant deliberately touched\n\nanother in a     patently offensive manner without justification or\n\nexcuse.    Cf. United States v. Frizzi, 491 F.2d 1231, 1232 (1st\n\nCir. 1974) (concluding that spitting would support a conviction\n\nfor    assaulting   or   otherwise    impeding        a   federal    officer      in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 111 because \"[a]lthough minor, it is .\n\n. . a bodily contact intentionally highly offensive\").                    We agree\n\nwith the views of some of our sister circuits in this regard.\n\nSee,    e.g.,    Williams,   197   F.3d     at    1096    (concluding      that    §\n\n113(a)(5) does not require an intent to cause physical harm and\n\ntherefore covers the act of touching a minor in a nonviolent but\n\nsexual manner); Martin, 536 F.2d at 536 (indicating that neither\n\n\"assault    by   striking,    beating[,]         or   wounding\"     nor   \"simple\n\nassault\" requires an intent to do bodily harm);                     cf.    United\n\nStates v. Masel, 563 F.2d 322, 324 (7th Cir. 1977) (affirming a\n\nconviction for assaulting a member of Congress in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 351, based on evidence that the defendant \"willfully\n\ncaused, by spitting, an offensive touching\").\n\n           Against this background, it appears that the district\n\ncourt's instructions to the jury overstated the government's\n\nburden, to the defendant's benefit, by demanding proof of a\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fhigher level of intent than § 113(a)(5) actually requires.                      With\n\nthe correct standard in mind, we turn to the evidence in the\n\nrecord.    Although Bayes maintained that he had touched Smoak to\n\nget her attention and that any contact with her buttocks was\n\naccidental, there was an abundance of competing testimony that\n\nhe had \"rubbed [her] buttocks and grabbed at the bottom of [her]\n\nbuttocks\" and \"squeez[ed].\"                Smoak testified that she felt\n\n\"angry,\" \"surprised,\" and \"frightened\" when Bayes touched her.\n\nIn the face of this testimony, the jury was entitled to conclude\n\nthat Bayes had groped Smoak in a way that could not have been\n\naccidental,      that     must    have    been    deliberate,      and   that    was\n\npatently    offensive.           On    these     facts,   the    evidence     amply\n\nsupported a conviction for simple assault under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n113(a)(5).       There was no plain error.\n\n                                         III.\n\n            Bayes       also   challenges        the   length    of   his    prison\n\nsentence.     Because simple assault is punishable by a maximum of\n\nsix months in prison, either with or without a fine, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 113(a)(5), it constitutes a Class B misdemeanor that is\n\nexempt    from    the    United       States    Sentencing      Guidelines    (\"the\n\nGuidelines\"), see U.S.S.G. § 1B1.9 & application note 1.                          We\n\nwill uphold a sentence for a non-Guidelines offense unless the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fsentence was \"imposed in violation of law\" or was \"plainly\n\nunreasonable.\"       18 U.S.C. §§ 3742(e)(1) & (4).\n\n             The district court sentenced Bayes to six months in\n\nprison with a $10 special assessment and a $5000 fine.                    Bayes\n\nconcedes     that    this   sentence    was   within    the   range      that    §\n\n113(a)(5) permits, but argues that it was plainly unreasonable\n\nto give him the maximum allowable term of imprisonment.                         In\n\nsupport of this claim, Bayes contends that the district court\n\nbased its sentence entirely on conduct for which the jury either\n\nacquitted him or failed to reach a verdict, when the court\n\ninstead should have focused on the assault for which he was\n\nconvicted.\n\n             Both the facts and the law belie Bayes's argument.\n\nAlthough the district court considered \"hung-jury conduct\" in\n\norder   to    determine     Bayes's     sentence,      it   also   considered\n\n\"relevant conduct\" that pertained directly to his offense of\n\nconviction.     Thus, contrary to what Bayes contends, the court\n\ndid   not    focus   \"only\"   on   conduct    for   which     he   was    never\n\nconvicted.     In any event, the court's consideration of hung-jury\n\nconduct was permissible as a matter of law.                 See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3661 (providing that \"[n]o limitation shall be placed\" on a\n\ntrial court's ability to consider the defendant's \"background,\n\ncharacter, and conduct\" in order to arrive at an appropriate\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fsentence); see also United States v. Lombard, 102 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (observing that even acquitted conduct may be taken\n\ninto account); cf. United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 153-54\n\n(per curiam) (concluding that even under the Guidelines, courts\n\ncan consider \"all other related conduct, whether or not it\n\nresulted in a conviction\").\n\n            In the final analysis, the district court understood\n\nthat its goal was to determine \"what is an appropriate sentence\n\nfor the crime that the defendant was found guilty of.\"                After\n\nsurveying     the    facts   surrounding     Bayes's   case,   the    court\n\nconcluded     that    the    defendant's     unwillingness     to     accept\n\nresponsibility for assaulting Smoak, the impact of his conduct\n\non the \"specific victim of the assault charge,\" and the risk\n\nthat his conduct posed on an airplane in mid-flight warranted\n\nthe imposition of the maximum allowable prison term.                  These\n\nconsiderations properly reflected the interests of punishment,\n\ndeterrence, and public safety that a court ought to weigh at\n\nsentencing.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), & (C).            Against\n\nthis background, the district court's sentence was appropriate.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendant's\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -17-\n\f",

On appeal, Bayes challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction and also contests his sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence following a trial by jury, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. See United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1310 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1999, Bayes boarded Delta Airlines Flight 64 from Atlanta, Georgia, to Manchester, England. Debbie Parker, Mario Garcia, and Carron Smoak were the three flight attendants apparently responsible for the section of the cabin in which Bayes was seated. Before the plane left the gate, Parker served Bayes a glass of champagne and a glass of orange juice. When Garcia went to collect the two glasses a short while later, Bayes responded by saying, \"What are you, crazy?\" Although Garcia concluded that \"we might have an unruly passenger\" on board, Parker gave Bayes another alcoholic beverage once the plane was in the air.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About an hour into the flight, Parker and Smoak began to distribute linen, flatware, and bread dishes by placing them on each passenger's dining tray. After providing Bayes with these items, Smoak asked him what kind of bread he wanted. As Smoak \"reached over [her service] cart to get the roll that he said he wanted... [Bayes] put his hand on [her] buttocks and rubbed [her] buttocks and grabbed at the bottom of [her] buttocks.\" Bayes claimed to have touched Smoak by accident, but Wade McCallon, a passenger seated nearby, later described what had occurred as \"reaching behind the flight attendant and grabbing her in the rear end\" and \"squeezing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smoak immediately complained about Bayes's conduct to her on- board supervisor, Susan Corbett, and to the on-board Customer Service Coordinator, Christopher Yates. Although there are conflicting accounts of exactly what happened next, there was evidence that Bayes persisted in being unruly despite periodic warnings from members of the crew. A scuffle ensued, ending only after the captain dumped thousands of gallons of fuel, diverted the aircraft in mid-flight, and made an unscheduled landing so that Bayes could be taken off the plane at Bangor International Airport in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes was charged with five counts of simple assault against Smoak, Garcia, Corbett, Yates, and a passenger named Rhine Blake. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5) (criminalizing \"[s]imple assault\" within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States); 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46506(1) (incorporating the conduct proscribed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5) as an offense within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States). Bayes also faced one count of interfering with a flight crew in violation of 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46504. After a five-day trial, a jury convicted Bayes of the assault against Smoak but either acquitted him or failed to reach a verdict with respect to the other charges. The district court sentenced Bayes to six months in prison with a $10 special assessment and a $5000 fine. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes supports his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by arguing that the offense for which he was convicted requires a specific kind of intent that the government failed to prove. Before reaching this claim, however, we must consider whether Bayes has preserved the issue for appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government rested its case at trial, Bayes moved for a judgment of acquittal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a). Although Bayes made his motion \"on all counts,\" the arguments he offered to support it spoke only to the other counts in the indictment and not to the charge of assaulting Smoak. When pressed on the issue, Bayes's attorney conceded that \"as far as Carron Smoak's case [goes], the best view of the evidence would be an assault. So, I'm not going to argue that that couldn't be found by the jury.\" A few moments later, counsel confirmed that Bayes was not moving for a directed finding with respect to that charge because \"if you believe [Smoak], there's sufficient evidence for a jury to find [Bayes] guilty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the district court refused to enter a judgment of acquittal, the trial proceeded, and ultimately the jury found Bayes guilty only of assaulting Smoak. After the jury was released, Bayes filed a new motion for a judgment of acquittal questioning the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the charge of conviction. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c) (\"It shall not be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion has been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.\"). Although this motion did put the relevant count of conviction under scrutiny, it still failed to raise the question of intent, merely arguing that none of the witnesses could have seen the alleged attack. (Motion for Judgment of Acquittal (\"The testimony of Carron Smoak failed to place her in a position on the airplane where witnesses could have observed that the alleged assault took place.\").)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bayes now seeks to change hats. Rather than claiming that no one could have witnessed the alleged assault, Bayes contends that his offense of conviction requires a specific kind of intent that the government failed to establish. Because Bayes never brought this argument to the district court's attention, we might consider it waived. See, e.g., United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A litigant cannot jump from theory to theory like a bee buzzing from flower to flower.... [W]hen a party fails to raise a theory at the district court level, that theory is generally regarded as forfeited and cannot be advanced on appeal.\"), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 119 S.Ct. 1370, 143 L.Ed.2d 530 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even in the face of procedural default, we retain the discretion to correct \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b). We will exercise this discretion only to correct (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) that \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" United States v. Johnson, 520 U.S. 461, 467 (1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). With this standard in mind, we turn our attention to whether there has been a plain error or defect in this case and, if so, whether it warrants redress under Rule 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes contends that the evidence failed to support his conviction for simple assault because the government did not prove that he intended to injure Smoak or to threaten her with harm when he touched her on the buttocks. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, we consider whether a rational juror could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Alicea- Cardoza, 132 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5), which proscribes the crime of \"[s]imple assault\" but does not define that term in any way. Although the statute neither states nor suggests that simple assault requires the defendant to have acted with a specific kind of intent, the district court concluded that the offense demanded exactly that. As a result, the court instructed the jury that \"to prove simple assault, the government must demonstrate [that] the defendant willfully attempted to inflict injury upon the person of another or threatened to inflict injury upon the person of another, coupled with an apparent present ability to do so, [and/or<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>] caused [a] reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\"If this instruction accurately described the level of intent that &#167; 113(a)(5) requires, then we might question whether there was sufficient evidence on which to base a conviction. The jury reasonably could have found that Bayes had touched Smoak on the buttocks on purpose, given her testimony that he had \"put his hand on [her] buttocks and rubbed [her] buttocks and grabbed at the bottom of [her] buttocks.\" McCallon confirmed that Bayes had \"reach[ed] behind [Smoak] and grabb[ed] her in the rear end\" and \"squeez[ed].\" But this testimony merely supported the conclusion that Bayes had touched Smoak deliberately; it did not necessarily demonstrate that Bayes had intended to injure Smoak or to threaten her with harm when he touched her. Likewise, while Smoak testified that Bayes's conduct caused her to feel \"frightened,\" it was at least debatable whether Bayes intended that result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, &#167; 113(a)(5) merely prohibits \"[s]imple assault\" without specifying a particular kind of intent as a textual element of the offense. The district court's requirement that Bayes \"willfully attempted to inflict injury upon the person of another or threatened to inflict injury\" does not appear anywhere in the statutory language. Unlike &#167; 113(a)(1) of the statute, which criminalizes \"[a]ssault with intent to commit murder,\" and &#167; 113(a)(3), which prohibits \"[a]ssault with a dangerous weapon, with intent to do bodily harm,\" a specific kind of intent is not inherent in the statutory definition of the crime for which Bayes was convicted. The fact that Congress enumerated a very specific type of intent for some kinds of assault but not for others casts doubt on whether \"[s]imple assault\" -- a term left undefined -- requires an intent to cause harm or to threaten another with injury. See United States v. Martin, 536 F.2d 535, 535-36 (2d Cir. 1976) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the common law for additional guidance. See United States v. Turley, 352 U.S. 407, 411 (1957) (\"[W]here a federal criminal statute uses a common-law term of established meaning without otherwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term its common-law meaning.\"). Assault had two meanings at common law, \"the first being an attempt to commit a battery and the second [being] an act putting another in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm.\" United States v. Bell, 505 F.2d 539, 540 (7th Cir. 1974); see also United States v. Guilbert, 692 F.2d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 1982). A battery, in turn, did not require proof that the defendant intended to injure another or to threaten her with harm. \"The slightest willful offensive touching of another constitute[d] a battery... regardless of whether the defendant harbor[ed] an intent to do physical harm.\" United States v. Williams, 197 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Burton v. Livingston, 791 F.2d 97, 99 (8th Cir. 1986) (noting that \"a plaintiff may seek redress and win damages under state law for any unwanted touching under the common law of battery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, under the traditional view, \"offensive touchings (as where a man puts his hands upon a girl's body or kisses a woman against her will...) w[ould] also suffice for battery\" in the absence of a valid justification or excuse. 2 Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 7.15(a), at 301-02 (1986). As Blackstone observed in his Commentaries:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lea[s]t touching of another's per[s]on wilfully, or in anger, is a battery; for the law cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the fir[s]t and lowe[s]t [s]tage of it: every man's per[s]on being [s]acred, and no other having a right to meddle with it, in any the [s]lighte[s]t manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120 (Univ. of Chicago Press ed. 1979) (1768) (alterations from old English).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with these principles, the common law provided that an assault committed by way of a battery did not require an intent to cause or to threaten an injury as long as the defendant touched another in a deliberately offensive manner without a valid reason to do so. See 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, supra, &#167; 7.16(a), at 37 n.13.1 (Supp. 1999). In Gates v. State, for example, a Georgia court affirmed a conviction for \"assault and battery\" based on evidence that the defendant \"twice deliberately 'touched,' 'tapped' or 'hit' [someone] on the buttocks\" without her consent. 138 S.E.2d 473, 474 (Ga. Ct. App. 1964). Similarly, in Wood v. Commonwealth, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed a conviction for \"assault and battery\" based on evidence that the defendant groped a minor in a nonviolent but sexually offensive manner. 140 S.E. 114, 115-16 (Va. 1927). Likewise, in Guarro v. United States, the D.C. Circuit observed that \"[u]nless there is consent, it would seem that a [nonconsensual] sexual touching is a sufficiently offensive act to constitute an assault\" under District of Columbia law. 237 F.2d 578, 580-81 (D.C. Cir. 1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cases do not control our decision, but they provide useful guidance as to what constitutes an assault at common law. Collectively, the decisions support the conclusion that, in a prosecution for simple assault under &#167; 113(a)(5), it is sufficient to show that the defendant deliberately touched another in a patently offensive manner without justification or excuse. Cf. United States v. Frizzi, 491 F.2d 1231, 1232 (1st Cir. 1974) (concluding that spitting would support a conviction for assaulting or otherwise impeding a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 111 because \"[a]lthough minor, it is... a bodily contact intentionally highly offensive\"). We agree with the views of some of our sister circuits in this regard. See, e.g., Williams, 197 F.3d at 1096 (concluding that &#167; 113(a)(5) does not require an intent to cause physical harm and therefore covers the act of touching a minor in a nonviolent but sexual manner); Martin, 536 F.2d at 536 (indicating that neither \"assault by striking, beating[,] or wounding\" nor \"simple assault\" requires an intent to do bodily harm); cf. United States v. Masel, 563 F.2d 322, 324 (7th Cir. 1977) (affirming a conviction for assaulting a member of Congress in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 351, based on evidence that the defendant \"willfully caused, by spitting, an offensive touching\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, it appears that the district court's instructions to the jury overstated the government's burden, to the defendant's benefit, by demanding proof of a higher level of intent than &#167; 113(a)(5) actually requires. With the correct standard in mind, we turn to the evidence in the record. Although Bayes maintained that he had touched Smoak to get her attention and that any contact with her buttocks was accidental, there was an abundance of competing testimony that he had \"rubbed [her] buttocks and grabbed at the bottom of [her] buttocks\" and \"squeez[ed].\" Smoak testified that she felt \"angry,\" \"surprised,\" and \"frightened\" when Bayes touched her. In the face of this testimony, the jury was entitled to conclude that Bayes had groped Smoak in a way that could not have been accidental, that must have been deliberate, and that was patently offensive. On these facts, the evidence amply supported a conviction for simple assault under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5). There was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes also challenges the length of his prison sentence. Because simple assault is punishable by a maximum of six months in prison, either with or without a fine, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5), it constitutes a Class B misdemeanor that is exempt from the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\"), see U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.9 &amp; application note 1. We will uphold a sentence for a non-Guidelines offense unless the sentence was \"imposed in violation of law\" or was \"plainly unreasonable.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3742(e)(1) &amp; (4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Bayes to six months in prison with a $10 special assessment and a $5000 fine. Bayes concedes that this sentence was within the range that &#167; 113(a)(5) permits, but argues that it was plainly unreasonable to give him the maximum allowable term of imprisonment. In support of this claim, Bayes contends that the district court based its sentence entirely on conduct for which the jury either acquitted him or failed to reach a verdict, when the court instead should have focused on the assault for which he was convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the facts and the law belie Bayes's argument. Although the district court considered \"hung-jury conduct\" in order to determine Bayes's sentence, it also considered \"relevant conduct\" that pertained directly to his offense of conviction. Thus, contrary to what Bayes contends, the court did not focus \"only\" on conduct for which he was never convicted. In any event, the court's consideration of hung-jury conduct was permissible as a matter of law. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3661 (providing that \"[n]o limitation shall be placed\" on a trial court's ability to consider the defendant's \"background, character, and conduct\" in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence); see also United States v. Lombard, 102 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996) (observing that even acquitted conduct may be taken into account); cf. United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 153-54 (per curiam) (concluding that even under the Guidelines, courts can consider \"all other related conduct, whether or not it resulted in a conviction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, the district court understood that its goal was to determine \"what is an appropriate sentence for the crime that the defendant was found guilty of.\" After surveying the facts surrounding Bayes's case, the court concluded that the defendant's unwillingness to accept responsibility for assaulting Smoak, the impact of his conduct on the \"specific victim of the assault charge,\" and the risk that his conduct posed on an airplane in mid-flight warranted the imposition of the maximum allowable prison term. These considerations properly reflected the interests of punishment, deterrence, and public safety that a court ought to weigh at sentencing. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), &amp; (C). Against this background, the district court's sentence was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTE:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The trial court should have included a conjunction here to indicate whether a \"reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm\" was an additional element of simple assault or an alternative basis for conviction.

On appeal, Bayes challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction and also contests his sentence.

See United States v. DeMasi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195694\"><a href=\"/opinion/195694/united-states-v-de-masi/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, 1310 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1999, Bayes boarded Delta Airlines Flight 64 from Atlanta, Georgia, to Manchester, England. Debbie Parker, Mario Garcia, and Carron Smoak were the three flight attendants apparently responsible for the section of the cabin in which Bayes was seated. Before the plane left the gate, Parker served Bayes a glass of champagne and a glass of orange juice. When Garcia went to collect the two glasses a short while later, Bayes responded by saying, \"What are you, crazy?\" Although Garcia concluded that \"we might have an unruly passenger\" on board, Parker gave Bayes another alcoholic beverage once the plane was in the air.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About an hour into the flight, Parker and Smoak began to distribute linen, flatware, and bread dishes by placing them on each passenger's dining tray. After providing Bayes with these items, Smoak asked him what kind of bread he wanted. As Smoak \"reached over [her service] cart to get the roll that he said he wanted... [Bayes] put his hand on [her] buttocks and rubbed [her] buttocks and grabbed at the bottom of [her] buttocks.\" Bayes claimed to have touched Smoak by accident, but Wade McCallon, a passenger seated nearby, later described what had occurred as \"reaching behind the flight attendant and grabbing her in the rear end\" and \"squeezing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smoak immediately complained about Bayes's conduct to her on- board supervisor, Susan Corbett, and to the on-board Customer Service Coordinator, Christopher Yates. Although there are conflicting accounts of exactly what happened next, there was evidence that Bayes persisted in being unruly despite periodic warnings from members of the crew. A scuffle ensued, ending only after the captain dumped thousands of gallons of fuel, diverted the aircraft in mid-flight, and made an unscheduled landing so that Bayes could be taken off the plane at Bangor International Airport in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes was charged with five counts of simple assault against Smoak, Garcia, Corbett, Yates, and a passenger named Rhine Blake. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5) (criminalizing \"[s]imple assault\" within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States); 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46506(1) (incorporating the conduct proscribed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5) as an offense within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States). Bayes also faced one count of interfering with a flight crew in violation of 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46504. After a five-day trial, a jury convicted Bayes of the assault against Smoak but either acquitted him or failed to reach a verdict with respect to the other charges. The district court sentenced Bayes to six months in prison with a $10 special assessment and a $5000 fine. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes supports his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by arguing that the offense for which he was convicted requires a specific kind of intent that the government failed to prove. Before reaching this claim, however, we must consider whether Bayes has preserved the issue for appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government rested its case at trial, Bayes moved for a judgment of acquittal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a). Although Bayes made his motion \"on all counts,\" the arguments he offered to support it spoke only to the other counts in the indictment and not to the charge of assaulting Smoak. When pressed on the issue, Bayes's attorney conceded that \"as far as Carron Smoak's case [goes], the best view of the evidence would be an assault. So, I'm not going to argue that that couldn't be found by the jury.\" A few moments later, counsel confirmed that Bayes was not moving for a directed finding with respect to that charge because \"if you believe [Smoak], there's sufficient evidence for a jury to find [Bayes] guilty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the district court refused to enter a judgment of acquittal, the trial proceeded, and ultimately the jury found Bayes guilty only of assaulting Smoak. After the jury was released, Bayes filed a new motion for a judgment of acquittal questioning the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the charge of conviction. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c) (\"It shall not be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion has been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.\"). Although this motion did put the relevant count of conviction under scrutiny, it still failed to raise the question of intent, merely arguing that none of the witnesses could have seen the alleged attack. (Motion for Judgment of Acquittal (\"The testimony of Carron Smoak failed to place her in a position on the airplane where witnesses could have observed that the alleged assault took place.\").)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Bayes now seeks to change hats. Rather than claiming that no one could have witnessed the alleged assault, Bayes contends that his offense of conviction requires a specific kind of intent that the government failed to establish. Because Bayes never brought this argument to the district court's attention, we might consider it waived. See, e.g., United States v. Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A litigant cannot jump from theory to theory like a bee buzzing from flower to flower....

With this standard in mind, we turn our attention to whether there has been a plain error or defect in this case and, if so, whether it warrants redress under Rule 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes contends that the evidence failed to support his conviction for simple assault because the government did not prove that he intended to injure Smoak or to threaten her with harm when he touched her on the buttocks. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, we consider whether a rational juror could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Alicea- Cardoza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749441\"><a href=\"/opinion/749441/united-states-v-luis-a-alicea-cardoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5), which proscribes the crime of \"[s]imple assault\" but does not define that term in any way. Although the statute neither states nor suggests that simple assault requires the defendant to have acted with a specific kind of intent, the district court concluded that the offense demanded exactly that. As a result, the court instructed the jury that \"to prove simple assault, the government must demonstrate [that] the defendant willfully attempted to inflict injury upon the person of another or threatened to inflict injury upon the person of another, coupled with an apparent present ability to do so, [and/or<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>] caused [a] reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\"If this instruction accurately described the level of intent that &#167; 113(a)(5) requires, then we might question whether there was sufficient evidence on which to base a conviction. The jury reasonably could have found that Bayes had touched Smoak on the buttocks on purpose, given her testimony that he had \"put his hand on [her] buttocks and rubbed [her] buttocks and grabbed at the bottom of [her] buttocks.\" McCallon confirmed that Bayes had \"reach[ed] behind [Smoak] and grabb[ed] her in the rear end\" and \"squeez[ed].\" But this testimony merely supported the conclusion that Bayes had touched Smoak deliberately; it did not necessarily demonstrate that Bayes had intended to injure Smoak or to threaten her with harm when he touched her. Likewise, while Smoak testified that Bayes's conduct caused her to feel \"frightened,\" it was at least debatable whether Bayes intended that result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, &#167; 113(a)(5) merely prohibits \"[s]imple assault\" without specifying a particular kind of intent as a textual element of the offense. The district court's requirement that Bayes \"willfully attempted to inflict injury upon the person of another or threatened to inflict injury\" does not appear anywhere in the statutory language. Unlike &#167; 113(a)(1) of the statute, which criminalizes \"[a]ssault with intent to commit murder,\" and &#167; 113(a)(3), which prohibits \"[a]ssault with a dangerous weapon, with intent to do bodily harm,\" a specific kind of intent is not inherent in the statutory definition of the crime for which Bayes was convicted. The fact that Congress enumerated a very specific type of intent for some kinds of assault but not for others casts doubt on whether \"[s]imple assault\" -- a term left undefined -- requires an intent to cause harm or to threaten another with injury. See United States v. Martin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336101\"><a href=\"/opinion/336101/united-states-v-alan-gregory-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, 535-36 (2d Cir. 1976) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the common law for additional guidance.

See 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, supra, &#167; 7.16(a), at 37 n.13.1 (Supp. 1999). In Gates v. State, for example, a Georgia court affirmed a conviction for \"assault and battery\" based on evidence that the defendant \"twice deliberately 'touched,' 'tapped' or 'hit' [someone] on the buttocks\" without her consent. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1249327\"><a href=\"/opinion/1249327/gates-v-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 474 (Ga.

Likewise, in Guarro v. United States, the D.C.

Collectively, the decisions support the conclusion that, in a prosecution for simple assault under &#167; 113(a)(5), it is sufficient to show that the defendant deliberately touched another in a patently offensive manner without justification or excuse. Cf. United States v. Frizzi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"316955\"><a href=\"/opinion/316955/united-states-v-gaetano-frizzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span>, 1232 (1st Cir. 1974) (concluding that spitting would support a conviction for assaulting or otherwise impeding a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 111 because \"[a]lthough minor, it is... a bodily contact intentionally highly offensive\"). We agree with the views of some of our sister circuits in this regard. See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74260\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Williams,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/74260/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1096</span> </a></span>(concluding that &#167; 113(a)(5) does not require an intent to cause physical harm and therefore covers the act of touching a minor in a nonviolent but sexual manner); <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336101\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Martin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/336101/united-states-v-alan-gregory-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">536</span> </a></span>(indicating that neither \"assault by striking, beating[,] or wounding\" nor \"simple assault\" requires an intent to do bodily harm); cf.

With the correct standard in mind, we turn to the evidence in the record. Although Bayes maintained that he had touched Smoak to get her attention and that any contact with her buttocks was accidental, there was an abundance of competing testimony that he had \"rubbed [her] buttocks and grabbed at the bottom of [her] buttocks\" and \"squeez[ed].\" Smoak testified that she felt \"angry,\" \"surprised,\" and \"frightened\" when Bayes touched her. In the face of this testimony, the jury was entitled to conclude that Bayes had groped Smoak in a way that could not have been accidental, that must have been deliberate, and that was patently offensive. On these facts, the evidence amply supported a conviction for simple assault under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5). There was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bayes also challenges the length of his prison sentence. Because simple assault is punishable by a maximum of six months in prison, either with or without a fine, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(5), it constitutes a Class B misdemeanor that is exempt from the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\"), see U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.9 &amp; application note 1. We will uphold a sentence for a non-Guidelines offense unless the sentence was \"imposed in violation of law\" or was \"plainly unreasonable.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3742(e)(1) &amp; (4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Bayes to six months in prison with a $10 special assessment and a $5000 fine. Bayes concedes that this sentence was within the range that &#167; 113(a)(5) permits, but argues that it was plainly unreasonable to give him the maximum allowable term of imprisonment. In support of this claim, Bayes contends that the district court based its sentence entirely on conduct for which the jury either acquitted him or failed to reach a verdict, when the court instead should have focused on the assault for which he was convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the facts and the law belie Bayes's argument. Although the district court considered \"hung-jury conduct\" in order to determine Bayes's sentence, it also considered \"relevant conduct\" that pertained directly to his offense of conviction. Thus, contrary to what Bayes contends, the court did not focus \"only\" on conduct for which he was never convicted. In any event, the court's consideration of hung-jury conduct was permissible as a matter of law. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3661 (providing that \"[n]o limitation shall be placed\" on a trial court's ability to consider the defendant's \"background, character, and conduct\" in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence); see also United States v. Lombard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197116\"><a href=\"/opinion/197116/united-states-v-lombard-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1996) (observing that even acquitted conduct may be taken into account); cf. United States v. Watts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 153-54 (per curiam) (concluding that even under the Guidelines, courts can consider \"all other related conduct, whether or not it resulted in a conviction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, the district court understood that its goal was to determine \"what is an appropriate sentence for the crime that the defendant was found guilty of.\" After surveying the facts surrounding Bayes's case, the court concluded that the defendant's unwillingness to accept responsibility for assaulting Smoak, the impact of his conduct on the \"specific victim of the assault charge,\" and the risk that his conduct posed on an airplane in mid-flight warranted the imposition of the maximum allowable prison term. These considerations properly reflected the interests of punishment, deterrence, and public safety that a court ought to weigh at sentencing. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), &amp; (C). Against this background, the district court's sentence was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTE:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The trial court should have included a conjunction here to indicate whether a \"reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm\" was an additional element of simple assault or an alternative basis for conviction. The trial transcript indicates that the court failed to make this distinction, but our resolution of the merits does not depend on the court's intentions in this regard.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
