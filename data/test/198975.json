A few years ago, we ventured\n\ninto the high-end retail market for fine crystal and upheld a\n\npreliminary injunction issued in favor of a group of affiliated\n\nretailers (collectively, \"Ross-Simons\") against Baccarat, Inc.\n\nSee Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) ( Ross-Simons I).         This appeal, in which Baccarat\n\nasks us to dissolve a permanent injunction compelling it to\n\ncontinue dealing with Ross-Simons, requires us to revisit those\n\npurlieus.     As before, Baccarat fails to make the sale.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n             Because we previously rehearsed the pertinent facts,\n\nsee    id.   at   14-15,   we   provide   here   only   a   simple   sketch,\n\nembellished with the new developments relevant to this appeal.\n\n             Baccarat distributes a prestigious line of French lead\n\ncrystal.     For its part, Ross-Simons sells a variety of items,\n\nincluding crystal and tableware, at widely dispersed retail\n\nstores and through an enormously successful direct-mail catalog.\n\nIn the fullness of time, Baccarat, apparently disturbed by Ross-\n\nSimons's aggressive pricing policies, took steps to block the\n\nlatter's access to Baccarat's wares.             Ross-Simons responded by\n\nfiling an antitrust suit.\n\n             That declaration of war yielded an uneasy peace:            the\n\nparties settled out of court, executing a written agreement on\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fNovember 24, 1992 (the \"1992 Agreement\").                       Pursuant to that\n\nagreement, Ross-Simons dismissed its action without prejudice.\n\nIn    return,    Baccarat       appointed        Ross-Simons   as    an    authorized\n\ndealer \"entitled to purchase and resell [Baccarat crystal] at\n\nsuch prices and upon such terms as are available to other\n\nauthorized dealers.\"            Baccarat also agreed \"not [to] terminate\n\nRoss-Simons'      status    as    an       authorized     dealer,    nor    otherwise\n\ndiscriminate against Ross-Simons in any manner, as a result of\n\nany failure or refusal by Ross-Simons to adhere to suggested\n\nresale prices or due to Ross-Simons' marketing through direct-\n\nmail    catalogs.\"       Although          the    1992   Agreement    contained      no\n\ndurational       term,     it     specifically           provided    that     changed\n\ncircumstances, in and of themselves, would not suffice as a\n\nbasis for extinguishment of its covenants and conditions.\n\n            In late 1994, shortly after new management assumed\n\ncontrol    of    Baccarat,       this       fragile      relationship      shattered.\n\nConcerned about maintaining the luster of its name, Baccarat\n\ninstituted a new authorized dealer program, which, among other\n\nthings, precluded dealers from advertising Baccarat products in\n\nany    printed    medium    that       —    like   the    Ross-Simons      catalog   —\n\npromoted a sizeable proportion (more than 25%) of \"off-price\"\n\nitems.    When Ross-Simons balked, Baccarat refused to fill its\n\norders.\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f            The hostilities resumed: Ross-Simons again filed suit,\n\nthis time alleging a breach of the 1992 Agreement.                     Citing\n\ndiversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in\n\nthe    requisite    amount,   Baccarat     removed   the   case   to    Rhode\n\nIsland's federal district court.            See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a),\n\n1441.      The     court,   acting   through   Judge   Boyle,     issued    a\n\npreliminary injunction directing Baccarat to supply Ross-Simons\n\npendente lite.       We upheld this order.       See Ross-Simons I, 102\n\nF.3d at 12.\n\n            The battle raged on, and the lower court, this time\n\nacting through Judge Lagueux, subsequently rejected Baccarat's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.         See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc.\n\nv. Baccarat, Inc., 182 F.R.D. 386 (D.R.I. 1998) (Ross-Simons\n\nII).     Then, following a three-day bench trial, Judge Lagueux\n\nentered a permanent injunction in favor of Ross-Simons.                   See\n\nRoss-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 66 F. Supp. 2d\n\n317 (D.R.I. 1999) (Ross-Simons III).           Baccarat again appeals.\n\nII.     ANALYSIS\n\n            We take up each tine of Baccarat's three-pronged attack\n\non the lower court's disposition.            In doing so, we apply the\n\nsubstantive law of Rhode Island.           See, e.g., Fithian v. Reed,\n\n204 F.3d 306, 308 (1st Cir. 2000); Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., 14\n\nF.3d 684, 689-90 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                A.   Duration of the 1992 Agreement.\n\n            The centerpiece of Baccarat's appeal is its contention\n\nthat the district court erred by not placing a finite temporal\n\nlimit on the decree.     This contention springs from the concept\n\nthat the 1992 Agreement, if it has not already expired, will\n\nbecome terminable after the passage of a commercially reasonable\n\nperiod of time.      The district court rejected this contention,\n\nostensibly relying on the plain language and purpose of the\n\ncontract.     See Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 325-26.\n\nImportantly, however, the court also found as a fact that when\n\nthe parties entered into the 1992 Agreement, they intended to\n\nestablish a long-term relationship.        See id. at 320.\n\n            We generally review the grant or denial of injunctive\n\nrelief for abuse of discretion.        See Ross-Simons I, 102 F.3d at\n\n16.   Withal, the standard of review is multi-dimensional and may\n\nvary depending on the specific issue under consideration.         See\n\nLanglois v. Abington Housing Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Here, we review the lower court's interpretation of the\n\nlanguage and purpose of the contract de novo and its findings of\n\nfact for clear error.       See United States Liab. Ins. Co. v.\n\nSelman, 70 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1995).        Moreover, we do not\n\nconsider ourselves bound by the trial court's rationale, but may\n\naffirm its judgment for any valid reason that finds support in\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe record.    See Phillips Exeter Academy v. Howard Phillips\n\nFund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st Cir. 1999); Garside v. Osco\n\nDrug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n         The district court's reasoning spans its two most\n\nrecent published opinions.    At the summary judgment stage, the\n\ncourt rejected Baccarat's argument that the 1992 Agreement was\n\ntoo indefinite to be enforceable, holding instead that the\n\nagreement fell into the category of contracts terminable upon\n\nthe happening of a specific event.        See Ross-Simons II, 182\n\nF.R.D. at 395-97.   In reaching this conclusion, the court relied\n\nheavily on Payroll Express Corp. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 659\n\nF.2d 285 (2d Cir. 1981).     The relevant insurance contract in\n\nthat case did not specify a duration but stated only that it was\n\nterminable by the insurer for nonpayment of premiums.      See id.\n\nat 288-89.     New York's policy against perpetual commitments\n\nnotwithstanding, the Second Circuit held that the insurer could\n\nnot cancel the policy as long as the insured continued to pay\n\nthe premium.    See id. at 292.     Embracing the logic of Payroll\n\nExpress, the court below determined that the 1992 Agreement, by\n\ncommitting Baccarat to sell to Ross-Simons \"at such prices and\n\nupon such terms as are available to other authorized dealers,\"\n\nimplicitly provided for termination upon the occurrence of a\n\nparticular event, i.e., Ross-Simons's breach of these standard\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fterms.   See Ross-Simons II, 182 F.R.D. at 396.              Thus, the 1992\n\nAgreement was sufficiently definite to be enforceable.                 See id.\n\nat 396-97.\n\n            The    difficulty   with     this    reasoning   is    that   every\n\nenforceable       contract   involves     a   bargained-for       exchange       of\n\nobligations, the material breach of which by one party gives the\n\nother party a right to terminate.             See, e.g., Ahearn v. Scholz,\n\n85 F.3d 774, 783 (1st Cir. 1996); Pelletier v. Masse, 143 A.\n\n609, 610 (R.I. 1928); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\n§ 237 (1981).       If the existence of an affirmative commitment,\n\nwithout more, automatically converts a contract of indefinite\n\nduration into a contract terminable upon the happening of a\n\nspecific event, then the presumption against perpetuity becomes\n\nillusory.     Broadly postured, this would conflict with Rhode\n\nIsland law, as that state's courts are quite clear that, in the\n\nemployment context at least, a contract silent as to duration is\n\nterminable at will.       See Salisbury v. Stone, 518 A.2d 1355, 1360\n\n(R.I. 1986); Booth v. National India-Rubber Co., 36 A. 714, 715\n\n(R.I. 1897).\n\n            Of course, the 1992 Agreement was an agreement for the\n\nsettlement    of    a   lawsuit,   not   an     employment   agreement       —    a\n\ndistinction upon which the district court expressly relied.                  See\n\nRoss-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 324-26; Ross-Simons II, 182\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fF.R.D. at 395-97.      The central goal of a settlement agreement is\n\nto fashion a final and permanent resolution of a dispute, see\n\nCity of Homestead v. Beard, 600 So. 2d 450, 454 (Fla. 1992); cf.\n\nMathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., 827 F.2d 850, 857 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (\"There is an institutional interest in the solemnity\n\nof   [settlement]      agreements,     in   bringing    certainty     to    the\n\nprocess, and in minimizing the opportunities for lawyers and\n\nlitigants alike to act as Monday morning quarterbacks.\"), so\n\napplying   the    presumption    against     perpetual    obligations        to\n\nsettlement      agreements   would     be   an    extremely    awkward     fit.\n\nLimited to this one small corner of contract law, the district\n\ncourt's \"implied termination clause\" rationale might well be\n\nappropriate.\n\n           We need not resolve this question here.             After all, it\n\nis common ground that where the presumption against perpetuity\n\napplies,   it    can   be   rebutted   by   evidence    that    the   parties\n\nintended a permanent arrangement.                See 1 Samuel Williston &\n\nWalter H.E. Jaeger, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts § 38, at\n\n113 (3d ed. 1957) (stating that \"unless the circumstances show\n\na contrary intention, [courts will] interpret a promise which\n\ndoes not . . . state the time of performance as intending\n\nperformance in a reasonable time\") (emphasis supplied); see also\n\nSchool Comm. v. Board of Regents for Educ., 308 A.2d 788, 790\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f(R.I.   1973)        (explaining       that        the   parties'        intentions      —    as\n\ngleaned from the course of prior dealings or other surrounding\n\ncircumstances — can rebut the presumption that an employment\n\ncontract without a durational term is terminable at will).                                    In\n\nthis instance, such evidence abounds.\n\n               The 1992 Agreement was designed, first and foremost,\n\nto settle an antitrust suit in which Ross-Simons claimed that\n\nBaccarat had refused to deal with it due to its practice of\n\nundercutting suggested retail prices.                          This is evident from the\n\ntitle     of     the       agreement          (\"Agreement          of    Compromise          and\n\nSettlement\"), the pact's delineation of its purpose, and the\n\npact's description of the underlying dispute.                             In exchange for\n\ndismissal of that action, Baccarat installed Ross-Simons as an\n\nauthorized dealer and pledged not to discriminate against it on\n\nthe basis of its pricing or marketing policies.                                These facts\n\nsupport    the       conclusion      that      the       parties    intended      the    1992\n\nAgreement       to    last    for    an   indefinite            period    of   time.         Cf.\n\nRossmassler          v.    Spielberger,         112       A.    876,     880   (Pa.     1921)\n\n(inferring       an       absolute   and       indefinite         obligation      from       the\n\nsubject matter of a contract with no period of duration).                                     As\n\nJudge Lagueux astutely noted, the arrangement was akin to an\n\nantitrust       consent       decree      —    a     device      that     often   mandates\n\n\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\fcompliance for an indefinite duration.           See Ross-Simons III, 66\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 325.\n\n            Several other provisions of the 1992 Agreement favor\n\nthis reading.       For one thing, as we observed before, both\n\nBaccarat and Ross-Simons \"must have understood that the 1992\n\nAgreement would operate at some length because they specifically\n\nprovided . . . that each party assumed the risk of changes in\n\nthe operative facts and relinquished any right to terminate the\n\nagreement on the basis of such factual shifts.\"              Ross-Simons I,\n\n102 F.3d at 18.         For another thing, Baccarat promised that \"in\n\nthe future\" it would consider Ross-Simons's applications for\n\nadditional store locations under the same standards generally\n\napplied to other dealers — and it did not place any restriction\n\non   how   far   into    the   future   this   obligation    would   extend.\n\nFinally, the 1992 Agreement provided that its benefits would\n\ninure to the parties' \"successors and assigns.\"              Viewed in the\n\nensemble, these forward-looking provisions suggest that the\n\nparties envisioned a lasting relationship.\n\n            The attendant circumstances also are relevant to a\n\ndetermination of the parties' mutual intent.                See Johnson v.\n\nWestern Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 641 A.2d 47, 48 (R.I. 1994) (per\n\ncuriam).    Here, those circumstances push in the same direction\n\nas the provisions of the 1992 Agreement.             Indeed, the former\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fpresident of Baccarat, who negotiated the 1992 Agreement on its\n\nbehalf, testified that he had discussed with his opposite number\n\nat Ross-Simons Baccarat's history of doing business with its\n\ndealers on a long-term basis (although Baccarat began selling\n\nits   product    in       the    United   States       in     1949,   it    had     never\n\nterminated      an    American      dealer       for    any    reason      other     than\n\nnonpayment) and had described this praxis as consistent with\n\nBaccarat's philosophy.            In short, the district court's finding\n\nthat the parties intended a long-term relationship was not\n\nclearly    erroneous,       and    this    finding      buttresses         the   court's\n\nconclusion that the 1992 Agreement was built to last.\n\n           In endeavoring to convince us to the contrary, Baccarat\n\nrelies heavily on our decision in Puretest Ice Cream, Inc. v.\n\nKraft, Inc., 806 F.2d 323 (1st Cir. 1986).                        Its reliance is\n\nmislaid.     In that case, we applied Indiana law and ruled that a\n\ndistributorship contract of indefinite duration was terminable\n\nat will.     See id. at 324.         Passing the point that Rhode Island\n\nlaw is not so clear, see Wayne Distributing Co. v. Schweppes\n\nU.S.A. Ltd., 352 A.2d 625, 626-27 & n.1 (R.I. 1976) (reserving\n\ndetermination        of    the     rule    to     be    applied       to    open-ended\n\ndistributorship           agreements),       the       fact    remains       that     the\n\npresumption against perpetual commitments is rebuttable,                              see\n\nSchool Comm., 308 A.2d at 790.             Moreover, we are confronted here\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fnot with a distributorship contract, but with an agreement\n\nintended to inter an antitrust dispute.            The promise to forbear\n\nfrom allegedly illegal activity in exchange for dismissal of a\n\nlawsuit is more plausibly intended to be permanent than is a\n\nnaked promise to sell goods for money.\n\n           We will not paint the lily.           We hold, without serious\n\nquestion, that the district court did not err by refusing to\n\nengraft a finite temporal limit onto the injunction that it\n\nissued.\n\n                             B.   Irreparable Harm.\n\n           Irreparable harm is an essential prerequisite for a\n\ngrant of injunctive relief.            See EEOC v. Astra USA, Inc., 94\n\nF.3d   738,    743    (1st    Cir.   1996).     Seizing   upon   this     hoary\n\nprinciple, Baccarat assails the district court's conclusion that\n\nRoss-Simons would suffer irreparable harm were injunctive relief\n\ndenied.    Because \"[d]istrict courts have broad discretion to\n\nevaluate      the    irreparability     of    alleged   harm   and   to    make\n\ndeterminations regarding the propriety of injunctive relief,\" K-\n\nMart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 915 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (internal quotation marks omitted), this argument faces an\n\nuphill climb.\n\n           In the end, that steep slope proves insurmountable.\n\nIt is settled beyond peradventure that irreparable harm can\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fconsist       of   \"a    substantial      injury   that   is    not    accurately\n\nmeasurable or adequately compensable by money damages.\"                     Ross-\n\nSimons I, 102 F.3d at 19; see also K-Mart, 875 F.2d at 914 (\"The\n\nnecessary concomitant of irreparable harm is the inadequacy of\n\ntraditional legal remedies.\").              Here, the district court found\n\nafter     a    bench      trial   that      Ross-Simons    would       suffer   an\n\n\"incalculable loss of reputation and prestige\" if Baccarat were\n\nallowed to go its own way.               Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n330.    Contrary to Baccarat's importunings, this finding was not\n\nplucked out of thin air.\n\n              Mary Morris, a Ross-Simons vice-president, explained\n\nthe importance of Baccarat to the retailer's marketing plan in\n\ngeneral and to its bridal registry in particular.                     According to\n\nMorris, losing Baccarat would cause fewer couples to register\n\nwith Ross-Simons, would disappoint former registrants who would\n\nlike to augment their holdings of Baccarat products, and would\n\nhurt Ross-Simons's image in the broader market.                  The \"uniqueness\n\nand prestige\" that Morris attributed to Baccarat's line was\n\nechoed in the testimony of Ross-Simons's president and two\n\nsenior Baccarat officials.\n\n              To    be   sure,    this    testimony   consists        largely   of\n\nopinions.          But opinion evidence, particularly when given by\n\ninformed witnesses, can be highly probative.                   See United States\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fv. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir. 1987) (emphasizing the\n\nvalue    of   experience   as   \"likely    the    best   teacher\"        anent    a\n\nwitness's qualifications to offer opinion testimony in certain\n\nfields).       We cannot say that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in crediting such testimony here.\n\n              Baccarat's parallel claim that injunctive relief is\n\nvirtually unprecedented in situations of this sort does not\n\nwithstand scrutiny.         In fact, \"injunctions against contract\n\nbreach are common where there is some reasonable doubt about\n\nwhether damages can be sufficient.\"           Almond v. Capital Props.,\n\nInc., ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 99-2249, slip op.\n\nat 12].       Because injuries to goodwill and reputation are not\n\neasily    quantifiable,    courts    often    find   this     type   of     harm\n\nirreparable.      See, e.g., K-Mart, 875 F.2d at 915; Camel Hair &\n\nCashmere Inst. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 799 F.2d 6, 14-15\n\n(1st Cir. 1986).       Of particular relevance here, \"several courts\n\nhave recognized that the loss of a prestigious brand or product\n\nline may create a threat of irreparable injury if it is likely\n\nthat     customers   (or   prospective       customers)     will     turn        to\n\ncompetitors who do not labor under the same handicap.\"                     Ross-\n\nSimons I, 102 F.3d at 20 (collecting cases); see also Reuters\n\nLtd. v. United Press Int'l, Inc., 903 F.2d 904, 907-08 (2d Cir.\n\n1990)    (explaining    that    stopping   \"the    delivery    of    a    unique\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fproduct . . . almost inevitably creates irreparable damage to .\n\n. . good will\").\n\n                         C.   Scope of the Injunction.\n\n              Baccarat's fallback position is that, even if some form\n\nof injunctive relief was appropriate, the injunction entered by\n\nthe lower court was overly broad and ambiguous to boot.               We test\n\nthe   scope    of   an    injunction    for   abuse   of   discretion.    See\n\nSigntech USA, Ltd. v. Vutek, Inc., 174 F.3d 1352, 1356 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1999); Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d 670,\n\n674 (1st Cir. 1998).          We discern none in this instance.\n\n              Injunctions must be tailored to the specific harm to\n\nbe prevented.       See Cok v. Family Court, 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (per curiam); Hypertherm, Inc. v. Precision Prods.,\n\nInc., 832 F.2d 697, 700-02 (1st Cir. 1987).                The district court\n\nfound that Baccarat violated the 1992 Agreement in two ways:\n\n(1) by constructively terminating the dealer agreement when\n\nRoss-Simons persisted in selling goods below suggested retail\n\nprices and in advertising that fact; and (2) by denying Ross-\n\nSimons the opportunity to purchase certain \"exclusives\" at least\n\nin part for the same reasons.           See Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 328-29.        These actions were held to violate Baccarat's\n\ncontractual pledge to deal with Ross-Simons on the same terms as\n\nother authorized dealers and not to discriminate against it\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fbased on its pricing or marketing practices.              See id.     The harms\n\nto be prevented flowed from the danger of future breach, and the\n\ninjunction entered by the district court mirrored the operative\n\nlanguage of the 1992 Agreement.\n\n            Baccarat complains bitterly about the imprecision of\n\nthe language employed, but this complaint rings hollow.                     The\n\ninjunction simply prohibits contract breach or, put another way,\n\nspecifically enforces the contract.          Perhaps more importantly,\n\nBaccarat negotiated and executed the 1992 Agreement, so it\n\nhardly can object to the court's ordering specific performance\n\nin precisely the same terms.          Cf. SEC v. Manor Nursing Ctrs.,\n\nInc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1103 (2d Cir. 1972) (\"There can be no abuse\n\nof discretion in framing an injunction in terms of the specific\n\nstatutory     provision    which     the   court        concludes     has   been\n\nviolated.\").\n\n            Baccarat also worries that the injunction might be\n\ninterpreted to prohibit it from offering \"exclusives\" to any\n\ndealer without including Ross-Simons.           In Baccarat's view, this\n\nfear renders the injunction fatally ambiguous.              We do not agree.\n\nIn the first place, the injunction simply reiterates the key\n\nprovisions     of   the   1992     Agreement;      it    does   not     mention\n\nexclusives.    In the second place, while the district court did\n\nconclude that Baccarat breached the 1992 Agreement by barring\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fRoss-Simons from one or more exclusive arrangements, Baccarat's\n\njeremiad     here   conveniently     ignores    the   court's         supportable\n\nfinding that Baccarat was motivated by its disdain for Ross-\n\nSimons's pricing and advertising practices.                 See Ross-Simons\n\nIII, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 322.          Given this finding, it would have\n\nbeen well within the district court's discretion to prohibit\n\nBaccarat from using exclusives as a means of disemboweling its\n\nnondiscrimination commitments.           See NLRB v. Express Publ'g Co.,\n\n312 U.S. 426, 435 (1941) (\"A federal court has broad power to\n\nrestrain acts which are of the same type or class as unlawful\n\nacts which the court has found to have been committed or whose\n\ncommission     in   the    future,   unless    enjoined,        may    fairly    be\n\nanticipated     from      the   defendant's    conduct     in    the     past.\").\n\nConversely, nothing in the injunction should be construed as\n\npreventing Baccarat from engaging in legitimate test-marketing\n\nof a new or unusual product at a small number of outlets\n\nunaffiliated     with     Ross-Simons,    so   long   as   its    reasons       are\n\nunrelated to Ross-Simons's pricing or marketing practices.\n\n             Finally, the injunction also includes a restatement of\n\nthe   1992    Agreement's       requirement    that   Baccarat         apply    its\n\ngenerally applicable standards in considering whether to sell to\n\nadditional Ross-Simons store locations.               On appeal, Baccarat\n\ndoes not specifically object to this inclusion.                 In all events,\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fwe are satisfied that discrimination against applications for\n\nnew Ross-Simons stores would be \"of the same type or class\" as\n\ndiscrimination against preexisting Ross-Simons stores.              Express\n\nPubl'g, 312 U.S. at 435;       accord Brown v. Trustees of Boston\n\nUniv., 891 F.2d 337, 361 n.23 (1st Cir. 1989).               The provision\n\nis, therefore, appropriate.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.     We think it crystal clear that\n\nthe    district     court's   entry    of   a    permanent       injunction\n\nspecifically enforcing the parties' earlier settlement agreement\n\nis adequately supported by the record.          In so holding, however,\n\nwe do not foreclose the possibility that, in the days to come,\n\nBaccarat might justify ending its relationship with Ross-Simons\n\nfor legitimate reasons unrelated to Ross-Simons's pricing or\n\nmarketing practices.     Of course, the unqualified language of the\n\ninjunction    may   require   Baccarat   (at    least   as   a   matter   of\n\nprudence) to seek permission from the district court before\n\nattempting such a termination.        Although we do not minimize the\n\nweight of this burden, it does not seem unreasonable in view of\n\nBaccarat's dogged attempts to evade contractual obligations.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 1996) (Ross-Simons I). This appeal, in which Baccarat asks us to dissolve a permanent injunction compelling it to continue dealing with Ross-Simons, requires us to revisit those purlieus. As before, Baccarat fails to make the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we previously rehearsed the pertinent facts, see id. at 14-15, we provide here only a simple sketch, embellished with the new developments relevant to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baccarat distributes a prestigious line of French lead crystal. For its part, Ross-Simons sells a variety of items, including crystal and tableware, at widely dispersed retail stores and through an enormously successful direct-mail catalog. In the fullness of time, Baccarat, apparently disturbed by Ross-Simons's aggressive pricing policies, took steps to block the latter's access to Baccarat's wares. Ross-Simons responded by filing an antitrust suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That declaration of war yielded an uneasy peace: the parties settled out of court, executing a written agreement on November 24, 1992 (the \"1992 Agreement\"). Pursuant to that agreement, Ross-Simons dismissed its action without prejudice. In return, Baccarat appointed Ross-Simons as an authorized dealer \"entitled to purchase and resell [Baccarat crystal] at such prices and upon such terms as are available to other authorized dealers.\" Baccarat also agreed \"not [to] terminate Ross-Simons' status as an authorized dealer, nor otherwise discriminate against Ross-Simons in any manner, as a result of any failure or refusal by Ross-Simons to adhere to suggested resale prices or due to Ross-Simons' marketing through direct-mail catalogs.\" Although the 1992 Agreement contained no durational term, it specifically provided that changed circumstances, in and of themselves, would not suffice as a basis for extinguishment of its covenants and conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1994, shortly after new management assumed control of Baccarat, this fragile relationship shattered. Concerned about maintaining the luster of its name, Baccarat instituted a new authorized dealer program, which, among other things, precluded dealers from advertising Baccarat products in any printed medium that - like the Ross-Simons catalog - promoted a sizeable proportion (more than 25%) of \"off-price\" items. When Ross-Simons balked, Baccarat refused to fill its orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hostilities resumed: Ross-Simons again filed suit, this time alleging a breach of the 1992 Agreement. Citing diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, Baccarat removed the case to Rhode Island's federal district court. See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1332(a), 1441. The court, acting through Judge Boyle, issued a preliminary injunction directing Baccarat to supply Ross-Simons pendente lite. We upheld this order. See Ross-Simons I, 102 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The battle raged on, and the lower court, this time acting through Judge Lagueux, subsequently rejected Baccarat's motion for summary judgment. See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 182 F.R.D. 386 (D.R.I. 1998) (Ross-Simons II). Then, following a three-day bench trial, Judge Lagueux entered a permanent injunction in favor of Ross-Simons. See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 66 F. Supp. 2d 317 (D.R.I. 1999) (Ross-Simons III). Baccarat again appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take up each tine of Baccarat's three-pronged attack on the lower court's disposition. In doing so, we apply the substantive law of Rhode Island. See, e.g., Fithian v. Reed, 204 F.3d 306, 308 (1st Cir. 2000); Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., 14 F.3d 684, 689-90 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Duration of the 1992 Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The centerpiece of Baccarat's appeal is its contention that the district court erred by not placing a finite temporal limit on the decree. This contention springs from the concept that the 1992 Agreement, if it has not already expired, will become terminable after the passage of a commercially reasonable period of time. The district court rejected this contention, ostensibly relying on the plain language and purpose of the contract. See Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 325-26. Importantly, however, the court also found as a fact that when the parties entered into the 1992 Agreement, they intended to establish a long-term relationship. See id. at 320.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We generally review the grant or denial of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion. See Ross-Simons I, 102 F.3d at 16. Withal, the standard of review is multi-dimensional and may vary depending on the specific issue under consideration. See Langlois v. Abington Housing Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 2000). Here, we review the lower court's interpretation of the language and purpose of the contract de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. See United States Liab. Ins. Co. v. Selman, 70 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1995). Moreover, we do not consider ourselves bound by the trial court's rationale, but may affirm its judgment for any valid reason that finds support in the record. See Phillips Exeter Academy v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st Cir. 1999); Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reasoning spans its two most recent published opinions. At the summary judgment stage, the court rejected Baccarat's argument that the 1992 Agreement was too indefinite to be enforceable, holding instead that the agreement fell into the category of contracts terminable upon the happening of a specific event. See Ross-Simons II, 182 F.R.D. at 395-97. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied heavily on Payroll Express Corp. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 659 F.2d 285 (2d Cir. 1981). The relevant insurance contract in that case did not specify a duration but stated only that it was terminable by the insurer for nonpayment of premiums. See id. at 288-89. New York's policy against perpetual commitments notwithstanding, the Second Circuit held that the insurer could not cancel the policy as long as the insured continued to pay the premium. See id. at 292. Embracing the logic of Payroll Express, the court below determined that the 1992 Agreement, by committing Baccarat to sell to Ross-Simons \"at such prices and upon such terms as are available to other authorized dealers,\" implicitly provided for termination upon the occurrence of a particular event, i.e., Ross-Simons's breach of these standard terms. See Ross-Simons II, 182 F.R.D. at 396. Thus, the 1992 Agreement was sufficiently definite to be enforceable. See id. at 396-97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with this reasoning is that every enforceable contract involves a bargained-for exchange of obligations, the material breach of which by one party gives the other party a right to terminate. See, e.g., Ahearn v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 783 (1st Cir. 1996); Pelletier v. Masse, 143 A. 609, 610 (R.I. 1928); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 237 (1981). If the existence of an affirmative commitment, without more, automatically converts a contract of indefinite duration into a contract terminable upon the happening of a specific event, then the presumption against perpetuity becomes illusory. Broadly postured, this would conflict with Rhode Island law, as that state's courts are quite clear that, in the employment context at least, a contract silent as to duration is terminable at will. See Salisbury v. Stone, 518 A.2d 1355, 1360 (R.I. 1986); Booth v. National India-Rubber Co., 36 A. 714, 715 (R.I. 1897).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the 1992 Agreement was an agreement for the settlement of a lawsuit, not an employment agreement - a distinction upon which the district court expressly relied. See Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 324-26; Ross-Simons II, 182 F.R.D. at 395-97. The central goal of a settlement agreement is to fashion a final and permanent resolution of a dispute, see City of Homestead v. Beard, 600 So. 2d 450, 454 (Fla. 1992); cf. Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., 827 F.2d 850, 857 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"There is an institutional interest in the solemnity of [settlement] agreements, in bringing certainty to the process, and in minimizing the opportunities for lawyers and litigants alike to act as Monday morning quarterbacks.\"), so applying the presumption against perpetual obligations to settlement agreements would be an extremely awkward fit. Limited to this one small corner of contract law, the district court's \"implied termination clause\" rationale might well be appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve this question here. After all, it is common ground that where the presumption against perpetuity applies, it can be rebutted by evidence that the parties intended a permanent arrangement. See 1 Samuel Williston &amp; Walter H.E. Jaeger, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts &#167; 38, at 113 (3d ed. 1957) (stating that \"unless the circumstances show a contrary intention, [courts will] interpret a promise which does not... state the time of performance as intending performance in a reasonable time\") (emphasis supplied); see also School Comm. v. Board of Regents for Educ., 112 R.I. 288, 308 A.2d 788,790 (1973) (explaining that the parties' intentions - as gleaned from the course of prior dealings or other surrounding circumstances - can rebut the presumption that an employment contract without a durational term is terminable at will). In this instance, such evidence abounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1992 Agreement was designed, first and foremost, to settle an antitrust suit in which Ross-Simons claimed that Baccarat had refused to deal with it due to its practice of undercutting suggested retail prices. This is evident from the title of the agreement (\"Agreement of Compromise and Settlement\"), the pact's delineation of its purpose, and the pact's description of the underlying dispute. In exchange for dismissal of that action, Baccarat installed Ross-Simons as an authorized dealer and pledged not to discriminate against it on the basis of its pricing or marketing policies. These facts support the conclusion that the parties intended the 1992 Agreement to last for an indefinite period of time. Cf. Rossmassler v. Spielberger, 112 A. 876, 880 (Pa. 1921) (inferring an absolute and indefinite obligation from the subject matter of a contract with no period of duration). As Judge Lagueux astutely noted, the arrangement was akin to an antitrust consent decree - a device that often mandates compliance for an indefinite duration. See Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other provisions of the 1992 Agreement favor this reading. For one thing, as we observed before, both Baccarat and Ross-Simons \"must have understood that the 1992 Agreement would operate at some length because they specifically provided... that each party assumed the risk of changes in the operative facts and relinquished any right to terminate the agreement on the basis of such factual shifts.\" Ross-Simons I, 102 F.3d at 18. For another thing, Baccarat promised that \"in the future\" it would consider Ross-Simons's applications for additional store locations under the same standards generally applied to other dealers - and it did not place any restriction on how far into the future this obligation would extend. Finally, the 1992 Agreement provided that its benefits would inure to the parties' \"successors and assigns.\" Viewed in the ensemble, these forward-looking provisions suggest that the parties envisioned a lasting relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attendant circumstances also are relevant to a determination of the parties' mutual intent. See Johnson v. Western Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 641 A.2d 47, 48 (R.I. 1994) (per curiam). Here, those circumstances push in the same direction as the provisions of the 1992 Agreement. Indeed, the former president of Baccarat, who negotiated the 1992 Agreement on its behalf, testified that he had discussed with his opposite number at Ross-Simons Baccarat's history of doing business with its dealers on a long-term basis (although Baccarat began selling its product in the United States in 1949, it had never terminated an American dealer for any reason other than nonpayment) and had described this praxis as consistent with Baccarat's philosophy. In short, the district court's finding that the parties intended a long-term relationship was not clearly erroneous, and this finding buttresses the court's conclusion that the 1992 Agreement was built to last.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In endeavoring to convince us to the contrary, Baccarat relies heavily on our decision in Puretest Ice Cream, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 806 F.2d 323 (1st Cir. 1986). Its reliance is mislaid. In that case, we applied Indiana law and ruled that a distributorship contract of indefinite duration was terminable at will. See id. at 324. Passing the point that Rhode Island law is not so clear, see Wayne Distributing Co. v. Schweppes U.S.A. Ltd., 352 A.2d 625, 626-27 &amp; n.1 (R.I. 1976) (reserving determination of the rule to be applied to open-ended distributorship agreements), the fact remains that the presumption against perpetual commitments is rebuttable,see School Comm., 308 A.2d at 790. Moreover, we are confronted here not with a distributorship contract, but with an agreement intended to inter an antitrust dispute. The promise to forbear from allegedly illegal activity in exchange for dismissal of a lawsuit is more plausibly intended to be permanent than is a naked promise to sell goods for money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. We hold, without serious question, that the district court did not err by refusing to engraft a finite temporal limit onto the injunction that it issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Irreparable Harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irreparable harm is an essential prerequisite for a grant of injunctive relief. See EEOC v. Astra USA, Inc., 94 F.3d 738, 743 (1st Cir. 1996). Seizing upon this hoary principle, Baccarat assails the district court's conclusion that Ross-Simons would suffer irreparable harm were injunctive relief denied. Because \"[d]istrict courts have broad discretion to evaluate the irreparability of alleged harm and to make determinations regarding the propriety of injunctive relief,\" K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 915 (1st Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks omitted), this argument faces an uphill climb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, that steep slope proves insurmountable. It is settled beyond peradventure that irreparable harm can consist of \"a substantial injury that is not accurately measurable or adequately compensable by money damages.\" Ross-Simons I, 102 F.3d at 19; see also K-Mart, 875 F.2d at 914 (\"The necessary concomitant of irreparable harm is the inadequacy of traditional legal remedies.\"). Here, the district court found after a bench trial that Ross-Simons would suffer an \"incalculable loss of reputation and prestige\" if Baccarat were allowed to go its own way. Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 330. Contrary to Baccarat's importunings, this finding was not plucked out of thin air.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mary Morris, a Ross-Simons vice-president, explained the importance of Baccarat to the retailer's marketing plan in general and to its bridal registry in particular. According to Morris, losing Baccarat would cause fewer couples to register with Ross-Simons, would disappoint former registrants who would like to augment their holdings of Baccarat products, and would hurt Ross-Simons's image in the broader market. The \"uniqueness and prestige\" that Morris attributed to Baccarat's line was echoed in the testimony of Ross-Simons's president and two senior Baccarat officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, this testimony consists largely of opinions. But opinion evidence, particularly when given by informed witnesses, can be highly probative. See United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir. 1987) (emphasizing the value of experience as \"likely the best teacher\" anent a witness's qualifications to offer opinion testimony in certain fields). We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in crediting such testimony here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baccarat's parallel claim that injunctive relief is virtually unprecedented in situations of this sort does not withstand scrutiny. In fact, \"injunctions against contract breach are common where there is some reasonable doubt about whether damages can be sufficient.\" Almond v. Capital Props., Inc., 212 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2000) Because injuries to goodwill and reputation are not easily quantifiable, courts often find this type of harm irreparable. See, e.g., K-Mart, 875 F.2d at 915; Camel Hair &amp; Cashmere Inst. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 799 F.2d 6, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1986). Of particular relevance here, \"several courts have recognized that the loss of a prestigious brand or product line may create a threat of irreparable injury if it is likely that customers (or prospective customers) will turn to competitors who do not labor under the same handicap.\" Ross-Simons I, 102 F.3d at 20 (collecting cases); see also Reuters Ltd. v. United Press Int'l, Inc., 903 F.2d 904, 907-08 (2d Cir. 1990) (explaining that stopping \"the delivery of a unique product... almost inevitably creates irreparable damage to... good will\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Scope of the Injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baccarat's fallback position is that, even if some form of injunctive relief was appropriate, the injunction entered by the lower court was overly broad and ambiguous to boot. We test the scope of an injunction for abuse of discretion. See Signtech USA, Ltd. v. Vutek, Inc., 174 F.3d 1352, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d 670, 674 (1st Cir. 1998). We discern none in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Injunctions must be tailored to the specific harm to be prevented. See Cok v. Family Court, 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam); Hypertherm, Inc. v. Precision Prods., Inc., 832 F.2d 697, 700-02 (1st Cir. 1987). The district court found that Baccarat violated the 1992 Agreement in two ways: (1) by constructively terminating the dealer agreement when Ross-Simons persisted in selling goods below suggested retail prices and in advertising that fact; and (2) by denying Ross-Simons the opportunity to purchase certain \"exclusives\" at least in part for the same reasons. See Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 328-29. These actions were held to violate Baccarat's contractual pledge to deal with Ross-Simons on the same terms as other authorized dealers and not to discriminate against it based on its pricing or marketing practices. See id. The harms to be prevented flowed from the danger of future breach, and the injunction entered by the district court mirrored the operative language of the 1992 Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baccarat complains bitterly about the imprecision of the language employed, but this complaint rings hollow. The injunction simply prohibits contract breach or, put another way, specifically enforces the contract. Perhaps more importantly, Baccarat negotiated and executed the 1992 Agreement, so it hardly can object to the court's ordering specific performance in precisely the same terms. Cf. SEC v. Manor Nursing Ctrs., Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1103 (2d Cir. 1972) (\"There can be no abuse of discretion in framing an injunction in terms of the specific statutory provision which the court concludes has been violated.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baccarat also worries that the injunction might be interpreted to prohibit it from offering \"exclusives\" to any dealer without including Ross-Simons. In Baccarat's view, this fear renders the injunction fatally ambiguous. We do not agree. In the first place, the injunction simply reiterates the key provisions of the 1992 Agreement; it does not mention exclusives. In the second place, while the district court did conclude that Baccarat breached the 1992 Agreement by barring Ross-Simons from one or more exclusive arrangements, Baccarat's jeremiad here conveniently ignores the court's supportable finding that Baccarat was motivated by its disdain for Ross-Simons's pricing and advertising practices. See Ross-Simons III, 66 F. Supp. 2d at 322. Given this finding, it would have been well within the district court's discretion to prohibit Baccarat from using exclusives as a means of disemboweling its nondiscrimination commitments. See NLRB v. Express Publ'g Co., 312 U.S. 426, 435 (1941) (\"A federal court has broad power to restrain acts which are of the same type or class as unlawful acts which the court has found to have been committed or whose commission in the future, unless enjoined, may fairly be anticipated from the defendant's conduct in the past.\"). Conversely, nothing in the injunction should be construed as preventing Baccarat from engaging in legitimate test-marketing of a new or unusual product at a small number of outlets unaffiliated with Ross-Simons, so long as its reasons are unrelated to Ross-Simons's pricing or marketing practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the injunction also includes a restatement of the 1992 Agreement's requirement that Baccarat apply its generally applicable standards in considering whether to sell to additional Ross-Simons store locations. On appeal, Baccarat does not specifically object to this inclusion. In all events, we are satisfied that discrimination against applications for new Ross-Simons stores would be \"of the same type or class\" as discrimination against pre-existing Ross-Simons stores. Express Publ'g, 312 U.S. at 435; accord Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d 337, 361 n.23 (1st Cir. 1989). The provision is, therefore, appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We think it crystal clear that the district court's entry of a permanent injunction specifically enforcing the parties' earlier settlement agreement is adequately supported by the record. In so holding, however, we do not foreclose the possibility that, in the days to come, Baccarat might justify ending its relationship with Ross-Simons for legitimate reasons unrelated to Ross-Simons's pricing or marketing practices. Of course, the unqualified language of the injunction may require Baccarat (at least as a matter of prudence) to seek permission from the district court before attempting such a termination. Although we do not minimize the weight of this burden, it does not seem unreasonable in view of Baccarat's dogged attempts to evade contractual obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span> </span>(1st Cir. 1996) (Ross-Simons I). This appeal, in which Baccarat asks us to dissolve a permanent injunction compelling it to continue dealing with Ross-Simons, requires us to revisit those purlieus. As before, Baccarat fails to make the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we previously rehearsed the pertinent facts, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 14-15, </span>we provide here only a simple sketch, embellished with the new developments relevant to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baccarat distributes a prestigious line of French lead crystal. For its part, Ross-Simons sells a variety of items, including crystal and tableware, at widely dispersed retail stores and through an enormously successful direct-mail catalog. In the fullness of time, Baccarat, apparently disturbed by Ross-Simons's aggressive pricing policies, took steps to block the latter's access to Baccarat's wares. Ross-Simons responded by filing an antitrust suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That declaration of war yielded an uneasy peace: the parties settled out of court, executing a written agreement on November 24, 1992 (the \"1992 Agreement\"). Pursuant to that agreement, Ross-Simons dismissed its action without prejudice. In return, Baccarat appointed Ross-Simons as an authorized dealer \"entitled to purchase and resell [Baccarat crystal] at such prices and upon such terms as are available to other authorized dealers.\" Baccarat also agreed \"not [to] terminate Ross-Simons' status as an authorized dealer, nor otherwise discriminate against Ross-Simons in any manner, as a result of any failure or refusal by Ross-Simons to adhere to suggested resale prices or due to Ross-Simons' marketing through direct-mail catalogs.\" Although the 1992 Agreement contained no durational term, it specifically provided that changed circumstances, in and of themselves, would not suffice as a basis for extinguishment of its covenants and conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1994, shortly after new management assumed control of Baccarat, this fragile relationship shattered. Concerned about maintaining the luster of its name, Baccarat instituted a new authorized dealer program, which, among other things, precluded dealers from advertising Baccarat products in any printed medium that - like the Ross-Simons catalog - promoted a sizeable proportion (more than 25%) of \"off-price\" items. When Ross-Simons balked, Baccarat refused to fill its orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hostilities resumed: Ross-Simons again filed suit, this time alleging a breach of the 1992 Agreement. Citing diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, Baccarat removed the case to Rhode Island's federal district court. See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1332(a), 1441. The court, acting through Judge Boyle, issued a preliminary injunction directing Baccarat to supply Ross-Simons pendente lite. We upheld this order. See Ross-Simons <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The battle raged on, and the lower court, this time acting through Judge Lagueux, subsequently rejected Baccarat's motion for summary judgment. See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span> </span>(D.R.I. 1998) (Ross-Simons II).

In doing so, we apply the substantive law of Rhode Island. See, e.g., Fithian v. Reed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198843\"><a href=\"/opinion/198843/fithian-v-zofchak/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 308 (1st Cir. 2000); Daigle v.

This contention springs from the concept that the 1992 Agreement, if it has not already expired, will become terminable after the passage of a commercially reasonable period of time. The district court rejected this contention, ostensibly relying on the plain language and purpose of the contract. See Ross-Simons <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2489088\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">III,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2489088/ross-simons-of-warwick-inc-v-baccarat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">325-26</span></a></span>. Importantly, however, the court also found as a fact that when the parties entered into the 1992 Agreement, they intended to establish a long-term relationship. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2489088\"><a href=\"/opinion/2489088/ross-simons-of-warwick-inc-v-baccarat-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 320.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We generally review the grant or denial of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion.

Here, we review the lower court's interpretation of the language and purpose of the contract de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. See United States Liab. Ins. Co. v.

Moreover, we do not consider ourselves bound by the trial court's rationale, but may affirm its judgment for any valid reason that finds support in the record. See Phillips Exeter Academy v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766721\"><a href=\"/opinion/766721/phillips-exeter-academy-v-howard-phillips-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 288 (1st Cir. 1999); Garside v.

At the summary judgment stage, the court rejected Baccarat's argument that the 1992 Agreement was too indefinite to be enforceable, holding instead that the agreement fell into the category of contracts terminable upon the happening of a specific event. See Ross-Simons <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> at <span class=\"page\">395-97</span></span>. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied heavily on Payroll Express Corp. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"394083\"><a href=\"/opinion/394083/payroll-express-corporation-cross-appellee-v-the-aetna-casualty-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span> </a></span>(2d Cir. 1981). The relevant insurance contract in that case did not specify a duration but stated only that it was terminable by the insurer for nonpayment of premiums.

See Ross-Simons <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> at <span class=\"page\">396</span></span>.

See, e.g., Ahearn v. Scholz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196795\"><a href=\"/opinion/196795/ahern-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 783 (1st Cir. 1996); Pelletier v.

If the existence of an affirmative commitment, without more, automatically converts a contract of indefinite duration into a contract terminable upon the happening of a specific event, then the presumption against perpetuity becomes illusory. Broadly postured, this would conflict with Rhode Island law, as that state's courts are quite clear that, in the employment context at least, a contract silent as to duration is terminable at will. See Salisbury v. Stone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2361367\"><a href=\"/opinion/2361367/salisbury-v-stone/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></a></span>, 1360 (R.I. 1986); Booth v.

Limited to this one small corner of contract law, the district court's \"implied termination clause\" rationale might well be appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve this question here. After all, it is common ground that where the presumption against perpetuity applies, it can be rebutted by evidence that the parties intended a permanent arrangement. See 1 Samuel Williston &amp; Walter H.E. Jaeger, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts &#167; 38, at 113 (3d ed. 1957) (stating that \"unless the circumstances show a contrary intention, [courts will] interpret a promise which does not... state the time of performance as intending performance in a reasonable time\") (emphasis supplied); see also School Comm. v. Board of Regents for Educ., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span>, 308 A.2d 788,790 (1973) (explaining that the parties' intentions - as gleaned from the course of prior dealings or other surrounding circumstances - can rebut the presumption that an employment contract without a durational term is terminable at will). In this instance, such evidence abounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1992 Agreement was designed, first and foremost, to settle an antitrust suit in which Ross-Simons claimed that Baccarat had refused to deal with it due to its practice of undercutting suggested retail prices. This is evident from the title of the agreement (\"Agreement of Compromise and Settlement\"), the pact's delineation of its purpose, and the pact's description of the underlying dispute. In exchange for dismissal of that action, Baccarat installed Ross-Simons as an authorized dealer and pledged not to discriminate against it on the basis of its pricing or marketing policies. These facts support the conclusion that the parties intended the 1992 Agreement to last for an indefinite period of time. Cf. Rossmassler v. Spielberger, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></span>, 880 (Pa. 1921) (inferring an absolute and indefinite obligation from the subject matter of a contract with no period of duration). As Judge Lagueux astutely noted, the arrangement was akin to an antitrust consent decree - a device that often mandates compliance for an indefinite duration. See Ross-Simons <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2489088\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">III,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2489088/ross-simons-of-warwick-inc-v-baccarat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

For one thing, as we observed before, both Baccarat and Ross-Simons \"must have understood that the 1992 Agreement would operate at some length because they specifically provided... that each party assumed the risk of changes in the operative facts and relinquished any right to terminate the agreement on the basis of such factual shifts.\" Ross-Simons <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">18</span></span>. For another thing, Baccarat promised that \"in the future\" it would consider Ross-Simons's applications for additional store locations under the same standards generally applied to other dealers - and it did not place any restriction on how far into the future this obligation would extend. Finally, the 1992 Agreement provided that its benefits would inure to the parties' \"successors and assigns.\" Viewed in the ensemble, these forward-looking provisions suggest that the parties envisioned a lasting relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attendant circumstances also are relevant to a determination of the parties' mutual intent. See Johnson v. Western Nat'l Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1938462\"><a href=\"/opinion/1938462/johnson-v-western-nat-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 48 (R.I. 1994) (per curiam). Here, those circumstances push in the same direction as the provisions of the 1992 Agreement. Indeed, the former president of Baccarat, who negotiated the 1992 Agreement on its behalf, testified that he had discussed with his opposite number at Ross-Simons Baccarat's history of doing business with its dealers on a long-term basis (although Baccarat began selling its product in the United States in 1949, it had never terminated an American dealer for any reason other than nonpayment) and had described this praxis as consistent with Baccarat's philosophy. In short, the district court's finding that the parties intended a long-term relationship was not clearly erroneous, and this finding buttresses the court's conclusion that the 1992 Agreement was built to last.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In endeavoring to convince us to the contrary, Baccarat relies heavily on our decision in Puretest Ice Cream, Inc. v.

Moreover, we are confronted here not with a distributorship contract, but with an agreement intended to inter an antitrust dispute.

Seizing upon this hoary principle, Baccarat assails the district court's conclusion that Ross-Simons would suffer irreparable harm were injunctive relief denied.

The injunction simply prohibits contract breach or, put another way, specifically enforces the contract. Perhaps more importantly, Baccarat negotiated and executed the 1992 Agreement, so it hardly can object to the court's ordering specific performance in precisely the same terms. Cf. SEC v. Manor Nursing Ctrs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"302963\"><a href=\"/opinion/302963/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-manor-nursing-centers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span>, 1103 (2d Cir. 1972) (\"There can be no abuse of discretion in framing an injunction in terms of the specific statutory provision which the court concludes has been violated.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baccarat also worries that the injunction might be interpreted to prohibit it from offering \"exclusives\" to any dealer without including Ross-Simons. In Baccarat's view, this fear renders the injunction fatally ambiguous. We do not agree. In the first place, the injunction simply reiterates the key provisions of the 1992 Agreement; it does not mention exclusives. In the second place, while the district court did conclude that Baccarat breached the 1992 Agreement by barring Ross-Simons from one or more exclusive arrangements, Baccarat's jeremiad here conveniently ignores the court's supportable finding that Baccarat was motivated by its disdain for Ross-Simons's pricing and advertising practices. See Ross-Simons <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2489088\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">III,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2489088/ross-simons-of-warwick-inc-v-baccarat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span>. Given this finding, it would have been well within the district court's discretion to prohibit Baccarat from using exclusives as a means of disemboweling its nondiscrimination commitments. See NLRB v. Express Publ'g Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103473\"><a href=\"/opinion/103473/labor-board-v-express-pub-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 435 (1941) (\"A federal court has broad power to restrain acts which are of the same type or class as unlawful acts which the court has found to have been committed or whose commission in the future, unless enjoined, may fairly be anticipated from the defendant's conduct in the past.\"). Conversely, nothing in the injunction should be construed as preventing Baccarat from engaging in legitimate test-marketing of a new or unusual product at a small number of outlets unaffiliated with Ross-Simons, so long as its reasons are unrelated to Ross-Simons's pricing or marketing practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the injunction also includes a restatement of the 1992 Agreement's requirement that Baccarat apply its generally applicable standards in considering whether to sell to additional Ross-Simons store locations. On appeal, Baccarat does not specifically object to this inclusion. In all events, we are satisfied that discrimination against applications for new Ross-Simons stores would be \"of the same type or class\" as discrimination against pre-existing Ross-Simons stores.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We think it crystal clear that the district court's entry of a permanent injunction specifically enforcing the parties' earlier settlement agreement is adequately supported by the record. In so holding, however, we do not foreclose the possibility that, in the days to come, Baccarat might justify ending its relationship with Ross-Simons for legitimate reasons unrelated to Ross-Simons's pricing or marketing practices. Of course, the unqualified language of the injunction may require Baccarat (at least as a matter of prudence) to seek permission from the district court before attempting such a termination. Although we do not minimize the weight of this burden, it does not seem unreasonable in view of Baccarat's dogged attempts to evade contractual obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
