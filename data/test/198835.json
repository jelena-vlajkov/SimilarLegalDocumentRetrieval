We stated on page 6 that\n    “Susan Alfano, Senior Vice-President in Charge of Human Resources,\n\n\n*\n Judge Aldrich, who sat on the panel that heard the appeal and\nparticipated in the initial opinion, did not participate in this\nMemorandum and Order, having ceased to sit as a judge in matters\npending before this court.

Between March and September, 1992, Alfano thoroughly\nanalyzed the costs and benefits of a reduction in force.” That\nstatement merely paraphrases, accurately, the district court’s own\npublished and supported assertion that Alfano’s “analysis [of costs\nand benefits] occurred in the months between March and September\n1992.”    See Rodowicz v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\n3 F. Supp.2d at 1485, 1481 (D. Mass. 1998). For reasons set forth\nin our opinion, we are also satisfied that factual issues,\nprecluding summary judgment, exist on the present record as to\nwhether three of the plaintiffs could rely on certain statements\nalleged to have been made by MassMutual personnel. We have been\ncareful to point out that nothing in our current disposition is\nintended as a final word on these matters.\n\n     MassMutual makes a more convincing point regarding the\nstandard by which this court reviews the district court’s\ndetermination that the termination program was not an ERISA “plan.”\nAfter giving this matter further thought, the panel believes that\nthe standard of review in the circumstances is de novo rather than\nclear error.   Accordingly, we have modified our opinion in the\nmanner set out in the attached errata sheet.\n\n     While we are persuaded that the standard of review in the\npresent circumstances is de novo, the alteration in review standard\ndoes not alter the outcome of the case. Reviewing the record in\nwhat is undoubtedly a fairly close case, we are satisfied that the\nvoluntary termination program was not a “plan” within the meaning\nof ERISA.\n\n     Subject to the changes set forth in the attached errata sheet,\nthe petition for panel rehearing is DENIED.\n\n                                      By the Court:\n\n                                      PHOEBE MORSE,\n\n                                              Clerk.\n\natt.\n\f          United States Court of Appeals\n                      For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 98-1654\n                   STANLEY A.
