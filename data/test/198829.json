Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n             Before\r\n\n    Selya, Stahl, and Lipez\r\n       Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJames E. Kelleher, with whom Revens, Lanni, Revens &amp; St.\r\nPierre was on brief, for Rhode Island Public Transit Authority.\r\nJohn A. Donovan, III, with whom Robert H. Gaynor and Sloane &amp;\r\nWalsh, LLP were on brief, for Hartford Fire Insurance Company.\r\n\nFebruary 14, 2000\r\n\n                 Per Curiam.  These appeals arise out of a declaratory\r\njudgment action brought by an insurer against its insured,\r\nquestioning the scope of its coverage and the existence vel non of\r\na duty to defend.  Jurisdiction is premised on diversity of\r\ncitizenship.  See 28 U.S.C.  1332(a).  Rhode Island law controls. \r\nThe district court decided the questions presented on summary\r\njudgment.  See Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Rhode Island Pub. Transit\r\nAuth., C.A. No. 98-094-ML, slip op. (D.R.I. Mar. 31, 1999).  Both\r\nsides now appeal.\r\nWe have said before, and today reaffirm, that \"when a\r\ntrial court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates\r\nits rationale clearly and convincingly, 'an appellate court should\r\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\r\nwords resonate.'\"  Cruz-Ramos v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,     F.3d\r\n,     (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 99-1683, slip op. at 3] (quoting\r\nLawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.\r\n1996)); accord Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas de P.R., Local 901, 74\r\nF.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel\r\nFire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).  This is such a case.\r\nInsofar as Appeal No. 99-1525 is concerned, the district\r\ncourt properly rejected the insured's claims of estoppel and/or\r\nwaiver.  See Hartford Fire, slip op. at 11-12.  By like token, the\r\ncourt correctly analyzed and resolved the coverage question.  See\r\nid. at 12-16.  Consequently, we uphold the determination that no\r\ncoverage exists for substantially the reasons set forth by the\r\ndistrict court in its thoughtful rescript.\r\nAs to the cross-appeal, No. 99-1637, the insurer's\r\ncounsel conceded at oral argument that the duty-to-defend issue\r\nraised therein has become moot.  We therefore lack jurisdiction to\r\nconsider this cross-appeal.  See, e.g., Mills v. Green, 159 U.S.\r\n651, 653 (1895); Oakville Dev. Corp. v. FDIC, 986 F.2d 611, 613\r\n(1st Cir. 1993).  Accordingly, we need go no further.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",
