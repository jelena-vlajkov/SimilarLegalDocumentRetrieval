D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Christian Castro on brief pro se.\n     Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and F. Mark\nTerison, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                      September 6, 2000\n\f         Per Curiam.     After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm.\n\n         Even if appellant Christian Castro (“Castro”) had\n\nadequately alleged in his § 2255 petition that his counsel\n\nfell below the standard of care – a matter we do not decide\n\n–   Castro   wholly   failed   to   establish   that   any   alleged\n\nfailure on counsel’s part caused him prejudice.         Strickland\n\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).         “A defendant who\n\nenters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under\n\n[U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1] as a matter of right.”          See U.S.S.G. §\n\n3E1.1, app. note 3; see also United States v. Muriel, 111\n\nF.3d 975, 982 (1 st Cir. 1997).         Rather, the court must\n\nconsider a number of factors, including whether defendant\n\n“truthfully admit[s] the conduct comprising the offense[] of\n\nconviction.”    U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, app. note 1(a).             Castro\n\nindicates he would only have been willing to enter into a\n\nplea pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25\n\n(1970), so he has failed to allege he would have “truthfully\n\nadmitted” that he had conspired to distribute cocaine base.\n\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f             Further, he has not alleged that he could have\n\nearned a section 3E1.1 reduction by pointing to any other\n\nfactor      listed     in   application     note    1;    and      we    see    no\n\nindication in the record that he could have supported any\n\nsuch allegation.        See generally United States v. Burns, 925\n\nF.2d 18, 20-21 (1 st Cir. 1991) (defendant entered                       Alford\n\nplea; court properly denied section 3E1.1 reduction where\n\nevidence     as   a    whole   indicated    a    lack    of   acceptance        of\n\nresponsibility).        Thus, Castro failed to show any reasonable\n\nprobability that the result at his sentencing would have\n\nbeen different had his attorney convinced him to plead\n\nguilty, Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; so the lower court did\n\nnot   err    in   denying      him   an   evidentiary     hearing        on    his\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.                 See United States\n\nv. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225-26 (1st Cir. 1993) (“[A] § 2255\n\nmotion      may   be   denied    without     a   hearing      as    to    those\n\nallegations which, if accepted as true, entitled the movant\n\nto no relief. . . .”).\n\n             Affirmed.      1st Cir.
