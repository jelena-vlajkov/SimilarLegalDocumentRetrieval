Burnham with whom Burnham &amp; Hines was on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n   Nicholas C. Theodorou with whom Toni G. Wolfman, David A.\r\nAnderson and Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot LLP were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 4, 1999\r\n\n                                BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This appeal presents an unusual\r\nquestion of Massachusetts law concerning the possible duty of a\r\nsocial host to protect his guest from the criminal acts of another\r\nguest where this can be done without risk to the host.  Because the\r\nappeal is from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6), we set forth the facts as alleged in the\r\ncomplaint, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving\r\nparty, here the appellant \"Jane Doe.\"  See Day v. Massachusetts Air\r\nNat'l Guard, 167 F.3d 678, 680 (1st Cir. 1999). \r\nFrom the complaint, the following allegations can be\r\nderived.  Doe first became acquainted with the appellee, Antoine\r\nWalker, a professional basketball player, around May 1997, and\r\ndated him sporadically thereafter.  In the course of their dating\r\nrelationship, Doe had on several occasions visited Walker's home in\r\nWaltham, Massachusetts, where she became acquainted with Michael\r\nIrvin, who lived in Walker's home.  Similarly, Doe met Dennis\r\nSmith, who also lived in Walker's home.\r\nOn the night of November 9, 1997, Doe went to a comedy \r\nclub in Boston, Massachusetts, where she socialized with Walker,\r\nIrvin, and Smith, as well as two of Walker's teammates--Ronald\r\nMercer and Chauncey Billups--whom Doe had not previously met.  As\r\nthe group prepared to leave the club, Irvin told Doe that Walker\r\nwanted her to visit him at his home.  Walker and Smith left the\r\nclub in one car while Billups drove Doe, Irvin and Mercer in\r\nanother car.  When Billups' car arrived at Walker's home, Doe was\r\ndirected to Irvin's bedroom.  There, all three men began to subject\r\nDoe to a series of sexual acts, including sexual intercourse,\r\nwithout her consent and despite her attempted resistance.  At one\r\npoint during this assault, Walker entered Irvin's bedroom,  and\r\nIrvin asked Walker \"Don't you want some?\" but Walker declined and\r\nleft.\r\nAfter Walker left Irvin's bedroom, the assault continued. \r\nDoe awoke the next morning.  She located Smith, who drove her home\r\nbut told her not to report the incident.  Later that day, Doe\r\nsought medical attention at the Boston Medical Center.  The medical\r\nexamination revealed bruises about Doe's body and injuries to her\r\nthroat, cervix and rectum, and she was diagnosed as suffering from\r\nshock.  That same day, Doe provided police with a report of the\r\nassault.  This is the gist of the allegations in the complaint.\r\nOn April 15, 1998, Doe filed suit in federal court,\r\nnaming Mercer, Irvin, Billups and Walker as defendants.  As\r\namended, Doe's complaint asserted claims against Mercer, Irvin, and\r\nBillups under the Violence Against Women Act, 42 U.S.C.  13981, as\r\nwell as state claims of assault and battery and intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress.  Doe also asserted a state common\r\nlaw claim of negligence against Walker, contending that he breached\r\na duty that he owed to her in his role of social host.  Only this\r\nsingle claim against Walker is the subject of this appeal.\r\nOn May 14, 1998, Walker moved to dismiss the claim\r\nagainst him on the ground that Doe had failed to state a claim.  On\r\nDecember 18, 1998, the district court granted Walker's motion to\r\ndismiss; it reasoned that Walker had no duty under Massachusetts\r\nlaw to intervene or otherwise to protect Doe from the assault by\r\nthe others.  On February 19, 1999, the district court entered a\r\nseparate, final judgment as to Walker pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n54(b), permitting this immediate appeal while Doe's suit against\r\nthe other three defendants continues.\r\nIf Walker were a passerby who ignored a stranger in\r\nperil, this would be an easy case.  For a variety of reasons,\r\nAnglo-American law, unlike some Continental regimes, imposes no\r\ngeneral duty to assist others in peril.  See 3 Harper, James &amp;\r\nGray, The Law of Torts  18.6, at 718-19 (2d ed. 1986).  The\r\nreasons for this reluctance to impose such a duty are the usual\r\ncompound of history and policy.  See id. at 719 n.10, 725 n.26. \r\nMassachusetts courts interpreting the common law follow this\r\ngeneral principle.  See generally Jean W. v. Commonwealth, 610\r\nN.E.2d 305, 318-19 (Mass. 1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring)\r\nYet in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, there is continuing\r\npressure to carve out special situations in which some kind of duty\r\nto protect may be found.  Two sets of Massachusetts precedents are\r\ninvoked by Doe here:  the most helpful to her arise in cases\r\nrecognizing various common law duties of property owners toward\r\nguests, other invitees and even trespassers; and the other,\r\narguably less relevant here, are cases in which a host takes\r\naffirmative steps that causally connect to later harm done by a\r\nguest to a third party (e.g., a social host serving liquor to an\r\nintoxicated guest who later drives home and hits a pedestrian). \r\nE.g., McGuiggan v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 496 N.E.2d 141, 146\r\n(Mass. 1986).\r\nThe common law duties of a property owner toward a guest\r\ngenerally include an obligation to take reasonable care to provide\r\na safe premises, including warnings to the guest as to dangers of\r\nwhich the host knows or should know.  Polak, 487 N.E.2d at 215-16. \r\nIn principle, nothing would prevent applying this obligation where\r\nthe host knew that another guest had a record of committing violent\r\nacts.  Several Massachusetts cases, involving failures of a\r\nproperty owner to protect his guests from the criminal acts of\r\nothers on the premises, declined to hold the hosts liable, but in\r\ndoing so, stressed that the host had no reason to know that\r\ncriminal acts were likely until it was too late to prevent them. \r\nAnthony H. v. John G., 612 N.E.2d 663, 666 (Mass. 1993); Husband v.\r\nDubose, 531 N.E.2d 600, 603 (Mass. App. Ct. 1988).\r\nBut suppose that the social host becomes aware of a crime\r\nin progress involving an assault by one of his guests upon another;\r\nthat the host could avert or ameliorate the danger at no risk to\r\nhimself; and that he nevertheless chooses to do nothing.  The\r\ndistrict court, drawing every possible inference in favor of Doe\r\nbased on the bare bones complaint, was prepared to assume that\r\nWalker had authorized or at least endorsed the invitation to Doe\r\nand that Walker had not only become a witness to a rape but had\r\nknown that Doe was being assaulted and that she had not consented\r\nto the encounter.  And while the district court does not directly\r\nmention the opportunity for Walker to halt the assault without risk\r\nto himself, that is an inference at least as easy to draw in favor\r\nof Doe as the other two.  (Of course, further evidence might reveal\r\nthat Walker could have done nothing to stop the assault, but\r\nactions ranging from telling the others to stop to calling 911\r\npresent themselves as reasonable possibilities.)\r\nFacing this situation squarely, the district court\r\nconcluded that Walker would still have no duty to intervene.  The\r\ndistrict court explained:\r\n  Rather, the law discourages such intervention\r\nas much as human sentiment applauds the good\r\nSamaritan.  The law is so for reasons of\r\nsocial policy that are intended to curb\r\nvigilantism and to avert the risk of untrained\r\ncivilians causing personal injury to\r\nthemselves or creating an even greater risk to\r\nthe victim.\r\n\nAdded to the practical considerations mentioned by the district\r\ncourt is the general reluctance of the law to impose affirmative\r\nduties to aid except in narrowly defined situations based on\r\nspecial relationships (e.g., parent-child, policeman-citizen) and\r\nthe benefit of bright lines in reducing litigation.\r\nBut Massachusetts case law does not definitely rule out\r\nliability in the hypothetical case we have posited.  The only\r\nprecedent cited to us that is closely in point is Husband v.\r\nDubose, 531 N.E.2d 600 (Mass. 1988), where the defendant was sued\r\nwhen unexpectedly one of her two guests drew a knife, stated that\r\nshe intended to kill the other guest and eventually inflicted knife\r\nwounds on the other guest.  Since the defendant had no reason to\r\nexpect the fight, the court easily rejected lack of a prior warning\r\nas a ground of liability.  Id. at 603.  Needless to say, a\r\ndefendant is \"not required to take precautions against a sudden\r\nattack from a third person which he has no reason to anticipate.\" \r\nId., at 602 (quoting Restatement (2d) of Torts  314A, cmt. e\r\n(1964)).\r\nHowever, Husband also addressed the claim that the\r\ndefendant might have breached a duty to render aid once the knife\r\nattack had begun.  The court held that the host, \"now in danger\r\nherself and badly frightened, could not have been expected to\r\ndisarm [the assaulter] or to remain in the house,\" and it said that\r\nthe defendant's warning to the plaintiff to flee \"was an adequate\r\nresponse to a very dangerous situation that had arisen suddenly.\" \r\nHusband, 531 N.E.2d at 603.  After noting that it was the plaintiff\r\nwho had chosen \"to ignore the warning\", the court concluded:\r\n  We are . . . not prepared to say that\r\nprevailing values and expectations required\r\nthe defendant to be more vigilant of security,\r\nto intervene directly, or to summon assistance\r\nat the risk of serious personal injury to\r\nherself or of causing greater danger to the\r\nplaintiff. . . . [W]e conclude, as did the\r\n[trial] judge, that the circumstances imposed\r\nno duty on the defendant.\r\n\nId. at 672 (footnote omitted).\r\nAssuredly, Husband would protect Walker if he had\r\nbelieved that he could not intervene without risk to himself or to\r\nDoe.  But if Walker could have intervened without risk, we think\r\nthat it is far from clear that the Husband decision forecloses\r\nliability; technically, the case did not decide the issue because,\r\nas the court construed the facts, there was no such opportunity for\r\na riskless rescue.  Indeed, the court pointed to the lack of proof\r\nthat, if the police had been summoned by the defendant, help would\r\nhave arrived in time to prevent the stabbing.\r\nIndignation is not a reliable trigger for imposing a duty\r\nto act since the common law refuses to impose liability in a wide\r\nswath of cases where morality would require action (typified by the\r\nrefusal to throw a drowning stranger a rope from the pier).  Still,\r\nit is instructive to consider an older decision, cited to us by\r\nneither of the parties, with egregious facts.  In Pridgen v. Boston\r\nHousing Auth., 308 N.E.2d 467 (Mass. 1974), the Supreme Judicial\r\nCourt cast aside the usual distinction between misfeasance and\r\nnonfeasance and upheld a jury verdict for the plaintiff where a\r\nchild trespasser had crawled into an elevator shaft of a building\r\nowned by the defendant and the building agent, despite notice and\r\na plea from the boy's mother, failed to turn off power in the\r\nelevator.\r\nThe child was thereafter injured and the jury found the\r\nbuilding owner liable for the \"wilful, wanton or reckless conduct\"\r\nof its agent, the standard deemed to apply in the case of a\r\ntrespasser.  In upholding the verdict, the SJC said that it did not\r\nmatter that the defendant's conduct could be described simply as a\r\nfailure to act.  Id. at 476-77.  The case is clearly\r\ndistinguishable in that it did not involve a failure to intervene\r\nin criminal conduct by one person on the premises directed against\r\nanother and that none of the concerns about vigilantism or risk to\r\nthe owner were present.  However, decisions like Pridgen do suggest\r\nthat the SJC, like most other courts, responds as much to facts as\r\nto abstractions, and it confirms to us that further development of\r\nthe facts in this case is well warranted before Doe's claim is\r\nwritten off as hopeless.\r\nWe would affirm without hesitating if Massachusetts case\r\nlaw had squarely rejected liability in the case of the social host\r\nwho costlessly could have saved a guest from harm but failed to\r\nact.  Plaintiffs who come to federal court and ask federal judges\r\nto forecast a substantial change in state law will normally get a\r\ncold reception.  Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 744 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).  But we think that the Massachusetts courts have not\r\nclearly spoken one way or the other and, while they would surely\r\ngive weight to concerns about vigilantism, they might on extreme\r\nfacts (as in Pridgen) choose to treat inaction as equivalent to\r\naction.\r\nThe legal issue presented is one that has important\r\nsocial and moral implications, and we decline to decide it without\r\nmore facts.  In areas like this one, the common law tradition is\r\none of deciding such matters in the concrete and not in the\r\nabstract.  This is in part because further facts may make it\r\nunnecessary to decide the hard case but also because the facts are\r\nlikely to contribute to a more sensitive assessment of what the law\r\n\"is\" (which, absent decisive precedent, means what it \"should be\"). \r\nOur preference for a better record is well supported and, while not\r\nmandatory, is one which we are entitled to require for reasons of\r\nprudence.\r\nThe same paucity of facts makes it impractical for us to\r\ncertify the issue to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  Of\r\ncourse, we could pose the question on one set of extreme assumed\r\nfacts, but suppose the SJC replied that liability on such facts\r\nwould exist:  it is at least even odds that one or more of the\r\nextreme facts so assumed would be disproved at the summary judgment\r\nor trial stage, and there is no assurance that anything the SJC\r\nsaid about that hypothetical case would tell us how to solve the\r\nmatter on the facts actually presented.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that dismissal at this stage was\r\npremature, vacate the judgment of dismissal, and remand to the\r\ndistrict court for further development of the facts.  We do not,\r\nhowever, foreclose the possibility of summary judgment in favor of\r\nWalker after a more complete record has been developed.  It is far\r\nfrom clear whether Walker authorized, acquiesced or even knew of\r\nDoe's presence at the house prior to the alleged assault; nor is it\r\nclear that he knew that an assault was occurring.  Further, as\r\nIrvin was himself living in the residence and extended the\r\ninvitation, this might mitigate any duty that Walker might\r\notherwise have had.\r\nAn alternative resolution deserves some consideration by\r\nthe district court.  The claim against Walker, unlike the claims\r\nagainst the other defendants, is not coupled with a federal claim\r\nagainst him, nor is there any suggestion of diversity jurisdiction. \r\nIn such a case, the statute gives the district court discretion to\r\ndecline jurisdiction over a supplemental state claim where, as\r\nhere, it raises a novel or complex issue of state law.  28 U.S.C.\r\n1367 (c)(1).  Cf. Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,\r\n175 F.3d 178, 192 (1st Cir. 1999).  Occasionally, we have even\r\ndirected such a dismissal where the federal claims have disappeared\r\nand where no economies justified having a federal court resolve the\r\nremaining state issues.  See id.\r\nHowever, in this instance economies may exist since\r\ndiscovery and possibly trial may proceed in respect to the other\r\ndefendants.  But the district court can balance this against the\r\nbenefit of having the state system resolve an unusual question of\r\nstate law with broad implications for state policy.  So far as we\r\ncan ascertain, the statute of limitations on Doe's claim would not\r\nexpire until November 2000 (see M.G.L.A. ch. 260  2A), and it is\r\nprobably subject to the Massachusetts one-year tolling statute in\r\nany event.  See id. ch. 260,  32; Liberace v. Conway, 574 N.E.2d\r\n1010, 1011-13 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991).\r\nThe judgment of the district court is vacated and the\r\nmatter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.\r\nIt is so ordered.\n",

Because the appeal is from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we set forth the facts as alleged in the complaint, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, here the appellant \"Jane Doe.\" See Day v. Massachusetts Air Nat'l Guard, 167 F.3d 678, 680 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the complaint, the following allegations can be derived. Doe first became acquainted with the appellee, Antoine Walker, a professional basketball player, around May 1997, and dated him sporadically thereafter. In the course of their dating relationship, Doe had on several occasions visited Walker's home in Waltham, Massachusetts, where she became acquainted with Michael Irvin, who lived in Walker's home.

As the group prepared to leave the club, Irvin told Doe that Walker wanted her to visit him at his home. Walker and Smith left the club in one car while Billups drove Doe, Irvin and Mercer in another car. When Billups' car arrived at Walker's home, Doe was directed to Irvin's bedroom. There, all three men began to subject Doe to a series of sexual acts, including sexual intercourse, without her consent and despite her attempted resistance. At one point during this assault, Walker entered Irvin's bedroom, and Irvin asked Walker \"Don't you want some?\" but Walker declined and left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Walker left Irvin's bedroom, the assault continued.

The medical examination revealed bruises about Doe's body and injuries to her throat, cervix and rectum, and she was diagnosed as suffering from shock.

As amended, Doe's complaint asserted claims against Mercer, Irvin, and Billups under the Violence Against Women Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 13981, as well as state claims of assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Doe also asserted a state common law claim of negligence against Walker, contending that he breached a duty that he owed to her in his role of social host. Only this single claim against Walker is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1998, Walker moved to dismiss the claim against him on the ground that Doe had failed to state a claim. On December 18, 1998, the district court granted Walker's motion to dismiss; it reasoned that Walker had no duty under Massachusetts law to intervene or otherwise to protect Doe from the assault by the others. On February 19, 1999, the district court entered a separate, final judgment as to Walker pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

For a variety of reasons, Anglo-American law, unlike some Continental regimes, imposes no general duty to assist others in peril. See 3 Harper, James &amp; Gray, The Law of Torts &#167; 18.6, at 718-19 (2d ed. 1986). The reasons for this reluctance to impose such a duty are the usual compound of history and policy.

App. Ct. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But suppose that the social host becomes aware of a crime in progress involving an assault by one of his guests upon another; that the host could avert or ameliorate the danger at no risk to himself; and that he nevertheless chooses to do nothing. The district court, drawing every possible inference in favor of Doe based on the bare bones complaint, was prepared to assume that Walker had authorized or at least endorsed the invitation to Doe and that Walker had not only become a witness to a rape but had known that Doe was being assaulted and that she had not consented to the encounter. And while the district court does not directly mention the opportunity for Walker to halt the assault without risk to himself, that is an inference at least as easy to draw in favor of Doe as the other two. (Of course, further evidence might reveal that Walker could have done nothing to stop the assault, but actions ranging from telling the others to stop to calling 911 present themselves as reasonable possibilities.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Facing this situation squarely, the district court concluded that Walker would still have no duty to intervene. The district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the law discourages such intervention as much as human sentiment applauds the good Samaritan. The law is so for reasons of social policy that are intended to curb vigilantism and to avert the risk of untrained civilians causing personal injury to themselves or creating an even greater risk to the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Added to the practical considerations mentioned by the district court is the general reluctance of the law to impose affirmative duties to aid except in narrowly defined situations based on special relationships (e.g., parent-child, policeman-citizen) and the benefit of bright lines in reducing litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Massachusetts case law does not definitely rule out liability in the hypothetical case we have posited. The only precedent cited to us that is closely in point is Husband v. Dubose, 531 N.E.2d 600 (Mass. 1988), where the defendant was sued when unexpectedly one of her two guests drew a knife, stated that she intended to kill the other guest and eventually inflicted knife wounds on the other guest. Since the defendant had no reason to expect the fight, the court easily rejected lack of a prior warning as a ground of liability. Id. at 603. Needless to say, a defendant is \"not required to take precautions against a sudden attack from a third person which he has no reason to anticipate.\" Id., at 602 (quoting Restatement (2d) of Torts &#167; 314A, cmt. e (1964)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Husband also addressed the claim that the defendant might have breached a duty to render aid once the knife attack had begun. The court held that the host, \"now in danger herself and badly frightened, could not have been expected to disarm [the assaulter] or to remain in the house,\" and it said that the defendant's warning to the plaintiff to flee \"was an adequate response to a very dangerous situation that had arisen suddenly.\" Husband, 531 N.E.2d at 603. After noting that it was the plaintiff who had chosen \"to ignore the warning\", the court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are . . . not prepared to say that prevailing values and expectations required the defendant to be more vigilant of security, to intervene directly, or to summon assistance at the risk of serious personal injury to herself or of causing greater danger to the plaintiff. . . . [W]e conclude, as did the [trial] judge, that the circumstances imposed no duty on the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 672 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuredly, Husband would protect Walker if he had believed that he could not intervene without risk to himself or to Doe. But if Walker could have intervened without risk, we think that it is far from clear that the Husband decision forecloses liability; technically, the case did not decide the issue because, as the court construed the facts, there was no such opportunity for a riskless rescue. Indeed, the court pointed to the lack of proof that, if the police had been summoned by the defendant, help would have arrived in time to prevent the stabbing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indignation is not a reliable trigger for imposing a duty to act since the common law refuses to impose liability in a wide swath of cases where morality would require action (typified by the refusal to throw a drowning stranger a rope from the pier). Still, it is instructive to consider an older decision, cited to us by neither of the parties, with egregious facts. In Pridgen v. Boston Housing Auth., 308 N.E.2d 467 (Mass. 1974), the Supreme Judicial Court cast aside the usual distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance and upheld a jury verdict for the plaintiff where a child trespasser had crawled into an elevator shaft of a building owned by the defendant and the building agent, despite notice and a plea from the boy's mother, failed to turn off power in the elevator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The child was thereafter injured and the jury found the building owner liable for the \"wilful, wanton or reckless conduct\" of its agent, the standard deemed to apply in the case of a trespasser. In upholding the verdict, the SJC said that it did not matter that the defendant's conduct could be described simply as a failure to act. Id. at 476-77. The case is clearly distinguishable in that it did not involve a failure to intervene in criminal conduct by one person on the premises directed against another and that none of the concerns about vigilantism or risk to the owner were present. However, decisions like Pridgen do suggest that the SJC, like most other courts, responds as much to facts as to abstractions, and it confirms to us that further development of the facts in this case is well warranted before Doe's claim is written off as hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would affirm without hesitating if Massachusetts case law had squarely rejected liability in the case of the social host who costlessly could have saved a guest from harm but failed to act. Plaintiffs who come to federal court and ask federal judges to forecast a substantial change in state law will normally get a cold reception. Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 744 (1st Cir. 1990). But we think that the Massachusetts courts have not clearly spoken one way or the other and, while they would surely give weight to concerns about vigilantism, they might on extreme facts (as in Pridgen) choose to treat inaction as equivalent to action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal issue presented is one that has important social and moral implications,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and we decline to decide it without more facts. In areas like this one, the common law tradition is one of deciding such matters in the concrete and not in the abstract. This is in part because further facts may make it unnecessary to decide the hard case but also because the facts are likely to contribute to a more sensitive assessment of what the law \"is\" (which, absent decisive precedent, means what it \"should be\"). Our preference for a better record is well supported and, while not mandatory, is one which we are entitled to require for reasons of prudence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same paucity of facts makes it impractical for us to certify the issue to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Of course, we could pose the question on one set of extreme assumed facts, but suppose the SJC replied that liability on such facts would exist: it is at least even odds that one or more of the extreme facts so assumed would be disproved at the summary judgment or trial stage, and there is no assurance that anything the SJC said about that hypothetical case would tell us how to solve the matter on the facts actually presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that dismissal at this stage was premature, vacate the judgment of dismissal, and remand to the district court for further development of the facts. We do not, however, foreclose the possibility of summary judgment in favor of Walker after a more complete record has been developed. It is far from clear whether Walker authorized, acquiesced or even knew of Doe's presence at the house prior to the alleged assault; nor is it clear that he knew that an assault was occurring. Further, as Irvin was himself living in the residence and extended the invitation, this might mitigate any duty that Walker might otherwise have had.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alternative resolution deserves some consideration by the district court. The claim against Walker, unlike the claims against the other defendants, is not coupled with a federal claim against him, nor is there any suggestion of diversity jurisdiction. In such a case, the statute gives the district court discretion to decline jurisdiction over a supplemental state claim where, as here, it raises a novel or complex issue of state law. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 (c)(1). Cf. Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 192 (1st Cir. 1999). Occasionally, we have even directed such a dismissal where the federal claims have disappeared and where no economies justified having a federal court resolve the remaining state issues. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in this instance economies may exist since discovery and possibly trial may proceed in respect to the other defendants. But the district court can balance this against the benefit of having the state system resolve an unusual question of state law with broad implications for state policy. So far as we can ascertain, the statute of limitations on Doe's claim would not expire until November 2000 (see M.G.L.A. ch. 260 &#167; 2A), and it is probably subject to the Massachusetts one-year tolling statute in any event. See id. ch. 260, &#167; 32; Liberace v. Conway, 574 N.E.2d 1010, 1011-13 (Mass.

Because the appeal is from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we set forth the facts as alleged in the complaint, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, here the appellant \"Jane Doe.\" See Day v. Massachusetts Air Nat'l Guard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198308\"><a href=\"/opinion/198308/day-v-massachusetts-natl/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 680 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the complaint, the following allegations can be derived. Doe first became acquainted with the appellee, Antoine Walker, a professional basketball player, around May 1997, and dated him sporadically thereafter. In the course of their dating relationship, Doe had on several occasions visited Walker's home in Waltham, Massachusetts, where she became acquainted with Michael Irvin, who lived in Walker's home. Similarly, Doe met Dennis Smith, who also lived in Walker's home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of November 9, 1997, Doe went to a comedy club in Boston, Massachusetts, where she socialized with Walker, Irvin, and Smith, as well as two of Walker's teammates--Ronald Mercer and Chauncey Billups--whom Doe had not previously met. As the group prepared to leave the club, Irvin told Doe that Walker wanted her to visit him at his home. Walker and Smith left the club in one car while Billups drove Doe, Irvin and Mercer in another car. When Billups' car arrived at Walker's home, Doe was directed to Irvin's bedroom. There, all three men began to subject Doe to a series of sexual acts, including sexual intercourse, without her consent and despite her attempted resistance. At one point during this assault, Walker entered Irvin's bedroom, and Irvin asked Walker \"Don't you want some?\" but Walker declined and left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Walker left Irvin's bedroom, the assault continued. Doe awoke the next morning. She located Smith, who drove her home but told her not to report the incident. Later that day, Doe sought medical attention at the Boston Medical Center. The medical examination revealed bruises about Doe's body and injuries to her throat, cervix and rectum, and she was diagnosed as suffering from shock. That same day, Doe provided police with a report of the assault. This is the gist of the allegations in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 1998, Doe filed suit in federal court, naming Mercer, Irvin, Billups and Walker as defendants. As amended, Doe's complaint asserted claims against Mercer, Irvin, and Billups under the Violence Against Women Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 13981, as well as state claims of assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Doe also asserted a state common law claim of negligence against Walker, contending that he breached a duty that he owed to her in his role of social host. Only this single claim against Walker is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1998, Walker moved to dismiss the claim against him on the ground that Doe had failed to state a claim. On December 18, 1998, the district court granted Walker's motion to dismiss; it reasoned that Walker had no duty under Massachusetts law to intervene or otherwise to protect Doe from the assault by the others. On February 19, 1999, the district court entered a separate, final judgment as to Walker pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), permitting this immediate appeal while Doe's suit against the other three defendants continues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Walker were a passerby who ignored a stranger in peril, this would be an easy case. For a variety of reasons, Anglo-American law, unlike some Continental regimes, imposes no general duty to assist others in peril. See 3 Harper, James &amp; Gray, The Law of Torts &#167; 18.6, at 718-19 (2d ed. 1986). The reasons for this reluctance to impose such a duty are the usual compound of history and policy. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 719 </span>n.10, 725 n.26. Massachusetts courts interpreting the common law follow this general principle. See generally Jean W. v. Commonwealth, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span>, 318-19 (Mass. 1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, there is continuing pressure to carve out special situations in which some kind of duty to protect may be found. Two sets of Massachusetts precedents are invoked by Doe here: the most helpful to her arise in cases recognizing various common law duties of property owners toward guests, other invitees and even trespassers;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the other, arguably less relevant here, are cases in which a host takes affirmative steps that causally connect to later harm done by a guest to a third party (e.g., a social host serving liquor to an intoxicated guest who later drives home and hits a pedestrian). E.g., McGuiggan v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span>, 146 (Mass. 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common law duties of a property owner toward a guest generally include an obligation to take reasonable care to provide a safe premises, including warnings to the guest as to dangers of which the host knows or should know. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Polak,</span> <span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">215-16</span></span>. In principle, nothing would prevent applying this obligation where the host knew that another guest had a record of committing violent acts. Several Massachusetts cases, involving failures of a property owner to protect his guests from the criminal acts of others on the premises, declined to hold the hosts liable, but in doing so, stressed that the host had no reason to know that criminal acts were likely until it was too late to prevent them.

[W]e conclude, as did the [trial] judge, that the circumstances imposed no duty on the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2100097\"><a href=\"/opinion/2100097/husband-v-dubose/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 672 </a></span>(footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuredly, Husband would protect Walker if he had believed that he could not intervene without risk to himself or to Doe. But if Walker could have intervened without risk, we think that it is far from clear that the Husband decision forecloses liability; technically, the case did not decide the issue because, as the court construed the facts, there was no such opportunity for a riskless rescue. Indeed, the court pointed to the lack of proof that, if the police had been summoned by the defendant, help would have arrived in time to prevent the stabbing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indignation is not a reliable trigger for imposing a duty to act since the common law refuses to impose liability in a wide swath of cases where morality would require action (typified by the refusal to throw a drowning stranger a rope from the pier). Still, it is instructive to consider an older decision, cited to us by neither of the parties, with egregious facts. In Pridgen v. Boston Housing Auth., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span> </span>(Mass. 1974), the Supreme Judicial Court cast aside the usual distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance and upheld a jury verdict for the plaintiff where a child trespasser had crawled into an elevator shaft of a building owned by the defendant and the building agent, despite notice and a plea from the boy's mother, failed to turn off power in the elevator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The child was thereafter injured and the jury found the building owner liable for the \"wilful, wanton or reckless conduct\" of its agent, the standard deemed to apply in the case of a trespasser. In upholding the verdict, the SJC said that it did not matter that the defendant's conduct could be described simply as a failure to act. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 476-77. </span>The case is clearly distinguishable in that it did not involve a failure to intervene in criminal conduct by one person on the premises directed against another and that none of the concerns about vigilantism or risk to the owner were present. However, decisions like Pridgen do suggest that the SJC, like most other courts, responds as much to facts as to abstractions, and it confirms to us that further development of the facts in this case is well warranted before Doe's claim is written off as hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would affirm without hesitating if Massachusetts case law had squarely rejected liability in the case of the social host who costlessly could have saved a guest from harm but failed to act. Plaintiffs who come to federal court and ask federal judges to forecast a substantial change in state law will normally get a cold reception. Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550084\"><a href=\"/opinion/550084/maury-a-ryan-dba-ryan-klimek-ryan-partnership-v-royal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 744 (1st Cir. 1990). But we think that the Massachusetts courts have not clearly spoken one way or the other and, while they would surely give weight to concerns about vigilantism, they might on extreme facts (as in Pridgen) choose to treat inaction as equivalent to action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal issue presented is one that has important social and moral implications,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and we decline to decide it without more facts. In areas like this one, the common law tradition is one of deciding such matters in the concrete and not in the abstract. This is in part because further facts may make it unnecessary to decide the hard case but also because the facts are likely to contribute to a more sensitive assessment of what the law \"is\" (which, absent decisive precedent, means what it \"should be\"). Our preference for a better record is well supported and, while not mandatory, is one which we are entitled to require for reasons of prudence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same paucity of facts makes it impractical for us to certify the issue to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Of course, we could pose the question on one set of extreme assumed facts, but suppose the SJC replied that liability on such facts would exist: it is at least even odds that one or more of the extreme facts so assumed would be disproved at the summary judgment or trial stage, and there is no assurance that anything the SJC said about that hypothetical case would tell us how to solve the matter on the facts actually presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that dismissal at this stage was premature, vacate the judgment of dismissal, and remand to the district court for further development of the facts. We do not, however, foreclose the possibility of summary judgment in favor of Walker after a more complete record has been developed. It is far from clear whether Walker authorized, acquiesced or even knew of Doe's presence at the house prior to the alleged assault; nor is it clear that he knew that an assault was occurring. Further, as Irvin was himself living in the residence and extended the invitation, this might mitigate any duty that Walker might otherwise have had.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alternative resolution deserves some consideration by the district court. The claim against Walker, unlike the claims against the other defendants, is not coupled with a federal claim against him, nor is there any suggestion of diversity jurisdiction. In such a case, the statute gives the district court discretion to decline jurisdiction over a supplemental state claim where, as here, it raises a novel or complex issue of state law. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 (c)(1). Cf. Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763565\"><a href=\"/opinion/763565/houlton-citizens-coalition-v-town-of-houlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 192 (1st Cir. 1999). Occasionally, we have even directed such a dismissal where the federal claims have disappeared and where no economies justified having a federal court resolve the remaining state issues. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in this instance economies may exist since discovery and possibly trial may proceed in respect to the other defendants. But the district court can balance this against the benefit of having the state system resolve an unusual question of state law with broad implications for state policy. So far as we can ascertain, the statute of limitations on Doe's claim would not expire until November 2000 (see M.G.L.A. ch. 260 &#167; 2A), and it is probably subject to the Massachusetts one-year tolling statute in any event.
