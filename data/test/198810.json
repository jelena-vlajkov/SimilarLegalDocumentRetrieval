Gallardo, with whom Woods &amp; Woods and Philip E.\r\nRoberts were on brief, for appellee A.M. Capen's Co., Inc.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       February 8, 2000\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  For the second time, this Court\r\nis asked to determine whether the Puerto Rico Dealers' Act of 1964,\r\n10 L.P.R.A.  278a-d (1994) (\"Act 75\"), applies to the\r\ncircumstances of this case.  On appeal from entry of a preliminary\r\ninjunction, a prior panel of this Court reached an initial\r\ndetermination that the claims of plaintiff-appellee, A.M. Capen's\r\nCo., Inc., against defendant-appellant, American Trading &amp;\r\nProduction Corp. (\"ATAPCO\"), were likely to be resolved in Capen's\r\nfavor under the laws of Puerto Rico, specifically Act 75.  See\r\ngenerally A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading &amp; Prod. Corp., 74\r\nF.3d 317 (1st Cir. 1996).  However, on appeal from judgment below\r\nfor Capen's, this Court must again consider whether Capen's is a\r\ndealer under Act 75.  For the reasons further discussed in this\r\nopinion, we reverse the decision of the district court.\r\nAs we observed in our recent opinion, Triangle Trading\r\nCo. v. Robroy Industries, Inc., No. 98-2366, slip op. at 2 (1st\r\nCir. Dec. 29, 1999), there is much case law carving out the scope\r\nof Puerto Rico's dealership act.  In order to honor the legislative\r\nintent of Act 75, the Puerto Rico and federal courts have taken\r\nsteps to restrict the definition of who is a \"dealer\" within the\r\nbroad framework of section 278(a).  See id. at 7-9.  We now take\r\none more step down that path and hold that under the facts of this\r\ncase, appellee fails to qualify for the remedies of the statute\r\nbecause it did not operate as a \"dealer\" in Puerto Rico.                                I.\r\nThe undisputed facts underlying this action are as\r\nfollows.  Capen's, a New Jersey corporation with its principal\r\nplace of business in that state, entered into an agreement with\r\nATAPCO's predecessor to be the exclusive distributor of Globe-Weiss\r\nand Steelmaster office products in Puerto Rico, along with thirty-\r\nseven other countries in the Caribbean and Central and South\r\nAmerica.  The arrangement continued after ATAPCO, whose principal\r\nplace of business is Missouri, took over.  However, the parties\r\nnever signed a formal contract because they could not agree on\r\nchoice-of-law and forum-selection clauses.  \r\nThe negotiations took place in Missouri and New Jersey.\r\nPursuant to the agreement, ATAPCO's products were shipped to\r\nCapen's in New Jersey.  Capen's would generally take orders from\r\nits Puerto Rican customers in New Jersey via telephone or fax,\r\nalthough an agent would actually travel to Puerto Rico two to three\r\ntimes a year for that purpose.  Capen's would then ship the\r\nproducts directly to its customers in Puerto Rico and send bills\r\nfrom New Jersey to Puerto Rico.  Capen's did not advertise in\r\nPuerto Rico, nor did it maintain a warehouse, showroom, inventory,\r\nemployees, office, address, or telephone number in Puerto Rico. \r\nLikewise, Capen's is not qualified to do business in Puerto Rico. \r\nSee A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading &amp; Prod. Corp., 973 F.\r\nSupp. 247, 253-55 (D.P.R. 1997).\r\nIn December 1993, ATAPCO terminated the exclusive aspect\r\nof the dealership, and it authorized Blas Rossy-Asencio as a sales\r\nrepresentative for Puerto Rico effective January 1994.  The trial\r\ncourt entered a preliminary injunction in favor of Capen's on\r\nJune 16, 1995, which this Court affirmed.  See A.M. Capen's, 74\r\nF.3d at 319.  In July 1997, the district court resolved Capen's\r\npending cross-motion for partial summary judgment on liability. \r\nFirst, the court observed that ATAPCO had failed to provide\r\nadditional evidence on Capen's dealership status within the\r\nestablished time frame; consequently, the court concluded that\r\nthere was no reason to reconsider its original finding, based on\r\nthe same record and affirmed by the court of appeals, that Act 75\r\ncovered Capen's dealership.  See A.M. Capen's, 973 F. Supp. at 257-\r\n58.  Then, based on the material facts it deemed admitted, the\r\ncourt found Act 75 liability against ATAPCO as a matter of law. \r\nSee id. at 260.  Damages were set after a bench trial, by opinion\r\nand order entered on March 31, 1998.  See A.M. Capen's Co. v.\r\nAmerican Trading &amp; Prod. Corp., 12 F. Supp. 2d 222, 224-30 (D.P.R.\r\n1998).                               II. \r\nSummary judgment is only appropriate if there is no\r\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n56(c).  We normally review the district court's summary judgment de\r\nnovo, \"viewing 'the entire record in the light most hospitable to\r\nthe party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable\r\ninferences in that party's favor.'\"  Euromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N.\r\nAm., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Griggs-Ryan\r\nv. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990)); see also Morris v.\r\nGovernment Dev. Bank, 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir. 1994).  However,\r\nin this case, the district court properly admitted the uncontested\r\nfacts submitted by the plaintiff-appellant when ATAPCO failed to\r\ncomply with the local rules and oppose the motion in the\r\nappropriate form.  See A.M. Capen's, 973 F. Supp. at 256 (citing\r\nStepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922,\r\n930-31 (1st Cir. 1983).  Because we limit our review to \"the record\r\nas it stood before the district court at the time of its ruling,\"\r\nJ. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc.,\r\n76 F.3d 1245, 1250 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Voutour v. Vitale, 761\r\nF.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir. 1985)), there are no facts in dispute.\r\nConsequently, the only matter before the Court is the\r\napplicability of Act 75, a matter we previously considered and\r\nprovisionally affirmed.  ATAPCO argues that we are not bound by our\r\nearlier decision which was rendered as a preliminary opinion for\r\nthe purposes of reviewing an injunction.  In this case, because the\r\nrecord was fully developed before the first panel, there is a\r\ntension between the limited binding authority of a decision\r\nregarding a preliminary injunction and the law of the case\r\ndoctrine.  See Cohen v. Brown University, 101 F.3d 155, 167 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (citing 1B James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal\r\nPractice  0.404[1] (2d ed. 1993)), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1186\r\n(1997); see also Ackerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v. City of\r\nCambridge, 135 F.3d 210, 213-15 (1st Cir. 1998) (implying that\r\nlegal opinion was law of case in preliminary injunction setting\r\nwhere facts were undisputed).  However, the law of the case\r\ndoctrine only directs our discretion; it does not limit our power. \r\nSee Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983); see also\r\nCochran v. M &amp; M Transp. Co., 110 F.2d 519, 521-22 (1st Cir. 1940)\r\n(quoting Messinger v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444 (1912)).  Two\r\ntraditional considerations weigh in favor of reopening our initial\r\ndetermination.  First, as we acknowledged in our prior opinion,\r\n\"'conclusions as to the merits of the issues presented on\r\npreliminary injunction are to be understood as statements of\r\nprobable outcomes,' rather than as comprising the law of the case.\" \r\n74 F.3d at 322 (quoting Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934\r\nF.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1991)).  Thus, it is implicit that \"a party\r\nlosing the battle on likelihood of success may nonetheless win the\r\nwar at a succeeding trial on the merits.\"  Jimnez Fuentes v.\r\nTorres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 238 (1st Cir. 1986).  Second, we\r\nreview an award of a preliminary injunction only for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 319.  Therefore, the\r\nscope of review given a case that comes to us in the posture of a\r\npreliminary injunction is more deferential than that given to one\r\nwhich comes to us on appeal from final judgment.  See,\r\ne.g., Rodrguez-Burgos v. Electric Energy Auth., 853 F.2d 31, 37\r\n(1st Cir. 1988) (considering case upholding a permanent\r\ninjunction); Goyco de Maldonado v. Rivera, 849 F.2d 683, 686 (1st\r\nCir. 1988) (distinguishing case heard on appeal from issuance of\r\ninterim injunction); Rosario Nevrez v. Torres Gaztambide, 820 F.2d\r\n525, 527 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that review is limited to\r\nplaintiff's likelihood of success, and not a \"clear-cut ruling,\" on\r\nthe merits).\r\n                             III.\r\nThus, we turn to Capen's status as a dealer under Act 75. \r\nIn departing from the legal determination of our colleagues in this\r\ncircuit, we take into account that the initial decision was not\r\nintended to be binding, and that the court did not fully\r\ncontemplate the meaning of dealer under the Act, but rather\r\nconsidered the Act only in the context of Puerto Rico's interest in\r\nthe action.  See A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 321-22.\r\nIn a statutory construction case, we begin with the\r\nlanguage of the statute, and only if the language is ambiguous or\r\nleads to an unreasonable interpretation do we turn to the\r\nlegislative history and other aids.  The words that are not defined\r\nwithin the statute are given their ordinary meaning, with all due\r\nconsideration to the context.  See Brady v. Credit Recovery Co.,\r\n160 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 1998); Grunbeck v. Dime Sav. Bank, 74\r\nF.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1996); Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003,\r\n1007 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nAct 75 defines a dealer as:  \"a person actually\r\ninterested in a dealer's contract because of his having effectively\r\nin his charge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency, concession\r\nor representation of a given merchandise or service.\"  10 L.P.R.A.\r\n278(a) (emphasis added).  Although the underscored text does not\r\nexplicitly \"require[] a dealer to be a resident of Puerto Rico, to\r\nbe authorized to do business in the Commonwealth, or to have a\r\nplace of business such as an official showroom or warehouse on the\r\nIsland,\" as do the comparable statutes in New Jersey and Missouri, \r\nA.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 322, it does strongly suggest that the\r\ndealer must operate in Puerto Rico under similar requirements.  The\r\nalternative, that the phrase could simply refer to a company with\r\na contractual right to distribute in Puerto Rico, regardless of the\r\nlocale of the bulk of its business, is a less likely reading. \r\nFirst, under such circumstances, Puerto Rico would have little or\r\nno interest in providing the dealer with an additional remedy for\r\nthe breach of contract, and second, Puerto Rico would face\r\nsignificant legal and practical problems regulating conduct outside\r\nits borders.\r\nWhile we gain no additional insight from the definition\r\nof a dealer's contract, the legislative history confirms an\r\ninterpretation of \"in Puerto Rico\" that incorporates requirements\r\nthat an Act 75 dealer be located in, be a resident of, or be\r\nauthorized to do business in Puerto Rico.  The statement of\r\nlegislative purpose for Law 75 reads:\r\n  \"The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico cannot remain\r\nindifferent to the growing number of cases in\r\nwhich domestic and foreign enterprises,\r\nwithout just cause, eliminate their dealers\r\n. . . as soon as these have created a\r\nfavorable market and without taking into\r\naccount their legitimate concerns.\r\n\n  The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico\r\ndeclares that the reasonable stability in the\r\ndealer's relationship in Puerto Rico is vital\r\nto the general economy of the country, to the\r\npublic interest and to the general welfare\r\n. . . .\"\r\n\nRoberco, 122 D.P.R. at 121-22, 22 Offic. Trans. at 113-14 (emphasis\r\nadded) (quoting 18-3 Diario de Sesiones 1531 (1954)).  In addition,\r\n\"the Industry and Commerce Committee submitted a report\r\nrecommending the bill's approval as a means to tackle the problem\r\nof termination of a dealer's contract without just cause, in\r\nprejudice to the local dealer, who 'has created a favorable market\r\nfor the products, and . . . has effectively assumed his\r\nresponsibilities.'\"  Id. (quoting 18-3 Diario de Sesiones 1531).\r\nThe legislative history clearly focuses on the problems\r\nfaced by dealers in Puerto Rico who are terminated once they have\r\ninvested in and created a favorable market for a principal's\r\nproduct.  See Draft-Line Corp. v. Hon Co., 781 F. Supp. 841, 843-44\r\n(D.P.R. 1991), aff'd, 983 F.2d 1046 (1st Cir. 1993); see also\r\nFranceschini, 591 F. Supp. at 415 (\"The scant legislative history\r\nof the statute refers solely to the problems faced by dealers in\r\nPuerto Rico who created a favorable market . . . .\"); Roberco, 122\r\nD.P.R. at 121-22, 22 Offic. Trans. at 113-14 (discussing\r\nlegislative intent to protect local dealers).  The courts that have\r\ninterpreted the statute and its legislative history uniformly\r\nconclude that the statute was enacted to prevent \"economic\r\nexploitation of local dealers.\"  A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 321\r\n(quoting Draft-Line, 781 F. Supp. at 844); see also Roberco, 122\r\nD.P.R. at 121, 22 Offic. Trans. at 113 (\"Act 75 was created to\r\navoid the harm resulting from the practice of some manufacturers\r\nwho arbitrarily break with local dealers\"); J. Soler Motors, Inc.\r\nv. Kaiser Jeep Int'l Corp., 108 D.P.R. 134, 8 P.R. Offic. Trans.\r\n138, 143 (1978) (Act 75 \"has the purpose of protecting the Puerto\r\nRican intermediaries\").  Because there is no evidence to the\r\ncontrary, we similarly ascertain that the legislature sought to\r\nprotect the interests of commercial distributors working in Puerto\r\nRico.  See A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 321 (citing Ballester Hermanos,\r\nInc. v. Campbell Soup Co., 797 F. Supp. 103, 106 (D.P.R. 1992)).\r\nBased on the facts before us, we cannot conclude that\r\nCapen's operates \"in Puerto Rico\" for purposes of Act 75.  Capen's\r\npresence in Puerto Rico is almost nonexistent; Puerto Rico is\r\nmerely one of the destination markets for the ATAPCO goods that it\r\ndistributes.  Capen's has no employees, no office space or\r\nwarehouses, and no assets in Puerto Rico.  Other than the two or\r\nthree times a year that an agent visits Puerto Rico to take orders\r\ndirectly, all other contact and orders are made through New Jersey,\r\nwhere Capen's maintains a place of business and is incorporated.\r\n                          CONCLUSION\r\nAfter careful consideration and review, based on the\r\nparties' limited connection to Puerto Rico, we conclude that Act 75\r\nshould not apply to this case.  We therefore reverse and remand for\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",

First, the court observed that ATAPCO had failed to provide additional evidence on Capen's dealership status within the established time frame;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> consequently, the court concluded that there was no reason to reconsider its original finding, based on the same record and affirmed by the court of appeals, that Act 75 covered Capen's dealership. See A.M. Capen's, 973 F. Supp. at 257-58. Then, based on the material facts it deemed admitted, the court found Act 75 liability against ATAPCO as a matter of law. See id. at 260. Damages were set after a bench trial, by opinion and order entered on March 31, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading &amp; Prod.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We normally review the district court's summary judgment de novo, \"viewing 'the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.'\" Euromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990)); see also Morris v. Government Dev. Bank, 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir. 1994). However, in this case, the district court properly admitted the uncontested facts submitted by the plaintiff-appellant when ATAPCO failed to comply with the local rules and oppose the motion in the appropriate form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See A.M. Capen's, 973 F. Supp. at 256 (citing Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 930-31 (1st Cir. 1983). Because we limit our review to \"the record as it stood before the district court at the time of its ruling,\" J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1250 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Voutour v. Vitale, 761 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir. 1985)), there are no facts in dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, the only matter before the Court is the applicability of Act 75,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> a matter we previously considered and provisionally affirmed. ATAPCO argues that we are not bound by our earlier decision which was rendered as a preliminary opinion for the purposes of reviewing an injunction. In this case, because the record was fully developed before the first panel, there is a tension between the limited binding authority of a decision regarding a preliminary injunction and the law of the case doctrine. See Cohen v. Brown University, 101 F.3d 155, 167 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing 1B James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 0.404[1] (2d ed. 1993)), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1186 (1997); see also Ackerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v. City of Cambridge, 135 F.3d 210, 213-15 (1st Cir. 1998) (implying that legal opinion was law of case in preliminary injunction setting where facts were undisputed). However, the law of the case doctrine only directs our discretion; it does not limit our power. See Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983); see also Cochran v. M &amp; M Transp. Co., 110 F.2d 519, 521-22 (1st Cir. 1940) (quoting Messinger v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444 (1912)). Two traditional considerations weigh in favor of reopening our initial determination. First, as we acknowledged in our prior opinion, \"'conclusions as to the merits of the issues presented on preliminary injunction are to be understood as statements of probable outcomes,' rather than as comprising the law of the case.\" 74 F.3d at 322 (quoting Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1991)). Thus, it is implicit that \"a party losing the battle on likelihood of success may nonetheless win the war at a succeeding trial on the merits.\" Jimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 238 (1st Cir. 1986). Second, we review an award of a preliminary injunction only for abuse of discretion. See A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 319. Therefore, the scope of review given a case that comes to us in the posture of a preliminary injunction is more deferential than that given to one which comes to us on appeal from final judgment. See, e.g., Rodrguez-Burgos v. Electric Energy Auth., 853 F.2d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 1988) (considering case upholding a permanent injunction); Goyco de Maldonado v. Rivera, 849 F.2d 683, 686 (1st Cir. 1988) (distinguishing case heard on appeal from issuance of interim injunction); Rosario Nevarez v. Torres Gaztambide, 820 F.2d 525, 527 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that review is limited to plaintiff's likelihood of success, and not a \"clear-cut ruling,\" on the merits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we turn to Capen's status as a dealer under Act 75. In departing from the legal determination of our colleagues in this circuit, we take into account that the initial decision was not intended to be binding, and that the court did not fully contemplate the meaning of dealer under the Act, but rather considered the Act only in the context of Puerto Rico's interest in the action. See A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 321-22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a statutory construction case, we begin with the language of the statute, and only if the language is ambiguous or leads to an unreasonable interpretation do we turn to the legislative history and other aids. The words that are not defined within the statute are given their ordinary meaning, with all due consideration to the context. See Brady v. Credit Recovery Co., 160 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 1998); Grunbeck v. Dime Sav. Bank, 74 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1996); Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act 75 defines a dealer as: \"a person actually interested in a dealer's contract because of his having effectively in his charge in Puerto Rico the distribution, agency, concession or representation of a given merchandise or service.\" 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278(a) (emphasis added). Although the underscored text does not explicitly \"require[] a dealer to be a resident of Puerto Rico, to be authorized to do business in the Commonwealth, or to have a place of business such as an official showroom or warehouse on the Island,\" as do the comparable statutes in New Jersey and Missouri, A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 322, it does strongly suggest that the dealer must operate in Puerto Rico under similar requirements. The alternative, that the phrase could simply refer to a company with a contractual right to distribute in Puerto Rico, regardless of the locale of the bulk of its business, is a less likely reading. First, under such circumstances, Puerto Rico would have little or no interest in providing the dealer with an additional remedy for the breach of contract, and second, Puerto Rico would face significant legal and practical problems regulating conduct outside its borders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we gain no additional insight from the definition of a dealer's contract,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the legislative history confirms an interpretation of \"in Puerto Rico\" that incorporates requirements that an Act 75 dealer be located in, be a resident of, or be authorized to do business in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The statement of legislative purpose for Law 75 reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico cannot remain indifferent to the growing number of cases in which domestic and foreign enterprises, without just cause, eliminate their dealers . . . as soon as these have created a favorable market and without taking into account their legitimate concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico declares that the reasonable stability in the dealer's relationship in Puerto Rico is vital to the general economy of the country, to the public interest and to the general welfare . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 121-22, 22 Offic.

In addition, \"the Industry and Commerce Committee submitted a report recommending the bill's approval as a means to tackle the problem of termination of a dealer's contract without just cause, in prejudice to the local dealer, who 'has created a favorable market for the products, and . . . has effectively assumed his responsibilities.'\" Id.

Trans. at 113-14 (discussing legislative intent to protect local dealers). The courts that have interpreted the statute and its legislative history uniformly conclude that the statute was enacted to prevent \"economic exploitation of local dealers.\" A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 321 (quoting Draft-Line, 781 F. Supp. at 844); see also Roberco, 122 D.P.R. at 121, 22 Offic.

Kaiser Jeep Int'l Corp., 108 D.P.R. 134, 8 P.R. Offic. Trans. 138, 143 (1978) (Act 75 \"has the purpose of protecting the Puerto Rican intermediaries\"). Because there is no evidence to the contrary, we similarly ascertain that the legislature sought to protect the interests of commercial distributors working in Puerto Rico. See A.M. Capen's, 74 F.3d at 321 (citing Ballester Hermanos, Inc. v. Campbell Soup Co., 797 F.

Capen's presence in Puerto Rico is almost nonexistent; Puerto Rico is merely one of the destination markets for the ATAPCO goods that it distributes. Capen's has no employees, no office space or warehouses, and no assets in Puerto Rico. Other than the two or three times a year that an agent visits Puerto Rico to take orders directly, all other contact and orders are made through New Jersey, where Capen's maintains a place of business and is incorporated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration and review, based on the parties' limited connection to Puerto Rico, we conclude that Act 75 should not apply to this case.

Capen's, 973 F. Supp. at 256 (quoting Local Rule 311.12). Because ATAPCO did not comply with Local Rule 311.12, the district court admitted Capen's statement of uncontested facts.

Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 931-32 (1st Cir. 1983).

ATAPCO relies solely on evidence presented in the damages trial. However, as we already discussed above, the district court's decision not to reconsider the matter after judgment had been entered was not an abuse of discretion. ATAPCO's argument that we should on our own initiative take up evidence introduced at the damages trial is unavailing. We will not consider new evidence now. See Ayala-Gerena v.

On appeal from entry of a preliminary injunction, a prior panel of this Court reached an initial determination that the claims of plaintiff-appellee, A.M. Capen's Co., Inc., against defendant-appellant, American Trading &amp; Production Corp. (\"ATAPCO\"), were likely to be resolved in Capen's favor under the laws of Puerto Rico, specifically Act 75.

Capen's, a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business in that state, entered into an agreement with ATAPCO's predecessor to be the exclusive distributor of Globe-Weiss and Steelmaster office products in Puerto Rico, along with thirty-seven other countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America. The arrangement continued after ATAPCO, whose principal place of business is Missouri, took over.

Pursuant to the agreement, ATAPCO's products were shipped to Capen's in New Jersey. Capen's would generally take orders from its Puerto Rican customers in New Jersey via telephone or fax, although an agent would actually travel to Puerto Rico two to three times a year for that purpose. Capen's would then ship the products directly to its customers in Puerto Rico and send bills from New Jersey to Puerto Rico. Capen's did not advertise in Puerto Rico, nor did it maintain a warehouse, showroom, inventory, employees, office, address, or telephone number in Puerto Rico. Likewise, Capen's is not qualified to do business in Puerto Rico. See A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading &amp; Prod.

In departing from the legal determination of our colleagues in this circuit, we take into account that the initial decision was not intended to be binding, and that the court did not fully contemplate the meaning of dealer under the Act, but rather considered the Act only in the context of Puerto Rico's interest in the action. See A.M. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196521\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Capen's,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196521/am-capens-co-v-american-trading/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">321-22</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a statutory construction case, we begin with the language of the statute, and only if the language is ambiguous or leads to an unreasonable interpretation do we turn to the legislative history and other aids.
