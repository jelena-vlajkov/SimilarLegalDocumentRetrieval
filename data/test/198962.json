Petricca Development Limited\n\nPartnership and Berkshire Concrete Corporation (collectively:\n\n“Petricca”) appeal from various district court orders which dismissed\n\ntheir claims against defendant-appellee Pioneer Development Company\n\n(“Pioneer”) for breach of fiduciary duty and unfair or deceptive trade\n\npractices allegedly arising out of Pioneer’s unilateral abandonment of\n\na planned real estate venture with Petricca. We affirm the district\n\ncourt judgment.\n\n                                  I\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          In June 1992, Petricca and Tamarack Investors Company, Inc.,\n\na business entity controlled by Pioneer, entered into a written\n\nagreement which granted Pioneer a renewable one-year option to purchase\n\ntwo parcels of land which Petricca owned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts,\n\nupon which Pioneer planned to develop a WalMart shopping center. The\n\nagreement provided that (1) Pioneer would pay Petricca $11,300 per\n\nmonth in option fees; (2) “In the event [Pioneer] does not exercise its\n\nOption . . . , th[e] Agreement shall expire and terminate and neither\n\nparty shall have any liability to the other under or pursuant to this\n\nAgreement[,]”; and (3) “In the event [Pioneer] exercises its Option,\n\nth[e] Agreement shall . . . become a contract for the purchase and sale\n\nof the [land] . . . on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.”\n\nWere Pioneer to breach the agreement, Petricca's \"sole and exclusive\n\n\n                                  3\n\fremedy [would be to] terminate th[e] Agreement, in which case neither\n\nparty [would] have any further liability or obligation to the other .\n\n. . .\" The agreement also contained the following integration clause:\n\n“This agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between [the\n\nparties].”\n\n          Further, the agreement afforded Petricca an option to\n\nparticipate in a joint venture with Pioneer to develop the shopping\n\ncenter. The “basic terms” of any such joint venture were described in\n\nExhibit C, as follows: “This letter is intended to be a memorandum of\n\nunderstanding which shall serve as the basis for a more detailed\n\npartnership agreement based on the following terms[.]” Under the\n\noption, Petricca had thirty days within which to decide whether to join\n\nPioneer in the joint venture, at which time Pioneer would be entitled\n\nto reimbursement for all option fees previously paid. Thereafter, a\n\nnew partnership — Pioneer/Petricca Associates — would be formed, and\n\n“upon the closing of a construction loan,” Petricca would transfer the\n\nland title to the new partnership. Pioneer would pay the purchase\n\nprice to Petricca, whereupon Pioneer would acquire a 32.5% ownership\n\ninterest in the new partnership. Pioneer expressly retained sole\n\nresponsibility for obtaining the legal right to build, as well as for\n\nthe actual construction, the legal representation of the partnership,\n\nand the shopping center management. Finally, Exhibit C, which included\n\nsubstantial handwritten corrections and insertions, identified itself\n\n\n                                  4\n\fas “the outline for preparation of a formal agreement to govern our\n\nbusiness relationship.”\n\n          In July 1992, Petricca afforded Pioneer due notice that it\n\nintended to participate in the joint venture. On October 7, Pioneer\n\nand Petricca executed an addendum to their June option agreement,\n\nnoting that “Petricca exercised its option” to participate in the joint\n\nventure. The October 7 addendum replaced the original Exhibit C, in\n\ntheir June option contract, with a new Exhibit C which announced at the\n\noutset: “This letter agreement shall serve as a record of our mutual\n\nunderstanding regarding the terms of our joint venture arrangement as\n\ndescribed in paragraph 13 of the [June option agreement].” The new\n\nExhibit C further provided that “the transactions will be concluded in\n\naccordance with the Outline of Structure for Pioneer/Petricca\n\nAssociates, a copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated by\n\nreference.”\n\n          The referenced outline set forth the following terms: First,\n\nPioneer and a straw partner would form a general partnership — Tamarack\n\nPlaza Company — to handle the right-to-build development stage which\n\nwould precede the construction phase. Pioneer would assign its June\n\noption contract rights to Tamarack Plaza Company, and amend the June\n\ncontract to reflect the joint venture arrangement with Petricca.\n\nSecond, Pioneer would pay the new partnership for all costs of\n\ndevelopment, necessary personnel and expertise, and would retain sole\n\n\n                                  5\n\fdiscretion to discontinue development ”at any time and for any reason.”\n\nUpon any such discontinuation, Petricca would reimburse Pioneer for\n\n32.5% of its development costs. Id. The Outline further provided that\n\n“[u]pon exercise of [Pioneer’s] Option to purchase any portion of the\n\nLand, Petricca will be admitted as a partner of Tamarack Plaza Company,\n\nthe straw partner will withdraw as a partner, and the partnership will\n\nchange its name to Pioneer/Petricca Associates.” Finally, the October\n\n7 addendum stated: “Except as amended by this [addendum], the [June]\n\nOption Agreement, including without limitation, Petricca’s exercise of\n\nits option to participate in the joint venture, shall remain in full\n\nforce and effect.”\n\n          On October 9, 1992, Pioneer notified the designated escrow\n\nagent that Pioneer and Petricca had “elected to participate in a joint\n\nventure,” and requested reimbursement for the $22,600 in option fees\n\nPioneer had paid Petricca to date. In December 1992, Pioneer filed\n\nrezoning petitions with the city council, as required before a shopping\n\nfacility could be constructed on the Petricca land. In March 1993,\n\nhowever, Pioneer failed to gain city council approval for its rezoning\n\npetitions.   During April 1993, unbeknownst to Petricca, Pioneer\n\nnegotiated an option to purchase another property approximately one\n\nmile from the Petricca parcels, then requested the city council to\n\nsuspend further action on the pending zoning applications relating to\n\nthe Petricca parcels.\n\n\n                                  6\n\f          In May 1993, Pioneer informed Petricca that the failure to\n\nobtain zoning approval rendered their joint venture impossible of\n\nperformance, and that the zoning applications were being withdrawn.\n\nWhen Pioneer proposed to pay option fees for the October 1992 — May\n\n1993 period, Petricca rejected the proposal. Eventually, Pioneer\n\ndeveloped the WalMart facility at the other site.\n\n          In due course, Petricca brought the present action against\n\nPioneer, demanding, inter alia, (1) a declaratory judgment that the\n\nparties had commenced their joint venture as early as July or October\n\n1992 (Count 1); (2) damages and costs for Pioneer’s breach, as a joint\n\nventurer, of its fiduciary duty of good faith and loyalty to Petricca\n\nin negotiating to purchase the alternate site for the shopping center\n\nwithout Petricca’s knowledge (Count 2); and (3) treble damages for\n\nPioneer’s willful violation of the \"unfair or deceptive trade\n\npractices\" provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A (Count 5).1\n\nPioneer successfully moved to dismiss Count 5 pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that Chapter 93A is\n\ninapplicable to incipient business relationships between joint\n\nventurers.\n\n          Thereafter, Pioneer successfully moved for summary judgment\n\non Counts 1 and 2.   The district court ruled that the June option\n\n\n\n     1\n     Petricca voluntarily dismissed Counts 3 and 4, respectively\nalleging breach of contract and deceit.\n\n                                  7\n\fcontract and its October addendum were unambiguous in precluding any\n\njoint venture unless and until Pioneer had exercised its option to\n\npurchase the Petricca land, a condition precedent which was never\n\nsatisfied. Petricca Dev. Ltd. Partnership v. Pioneer Dev. Co., 40 F.\n\nSupp.2d 49 (D. Mass. 1999). On appeal, Petricca challenges both the\n\nRule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Count 5 and the summary judgment rulings\n\nrelating to Counts 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f                                  II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim\n\n          Petricca first contends that the district court erroneously\n\ndetermined that the June contract and October addendum unambiguously\n\ndemonstrated a mutual intention that the joint venture not be\n\nestablished until such time as Pioneer opted to purchase the Petricca\n\nland. Instead, Petricca insists that these documents, as well as other\n\nevidence, generate a trialworthy issue as to whether the parties\n\nintended that the joint venture relationship arise in July 1992, at the\n\ntime Petricca exercised its option to participate in the joint venture.\n\nSince joint venturers unquestionably owe one another a generalized duty\n\nof good faith and utmost loyalty, see Zimmerman v. Bogoff, 524 N.E.2d\n\n849, 855 (Mass. 1988); Cardullo v. Landau, 105 N.E.2d 843, 845 (Mass.\n\n1952), Petricca suggests that Pioneer breached its duty by unilaterally\n\naborting its efforts to gain city council approval of the rezoning\n\nrequired to enable development of the Petricca land, and instead\n\nsurreptitiously negotiating an alternate land deal.2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n     Summary judgment rulings are reviewed de novo, with all\nreasonable inferences drawn against the moving party, in order\nto determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact\nor the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nSee Randlett v. Shalala, 118 F.3d 857, 861 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                  9\n\f           Under Massachusetts law, the existence of a joint venture is\n\nentirely dependent upon the parties’ intent, which may turn on many\n\nfactors:\n\n           (1) an agreement by the parties manifesting their\n           intention to associate for joint profit not\n           amounting to a partnership or a corporation; (2)\n           a contribution of money, property, effort,\n           knowledge, skill, or other assets to a common\n           undertaking; (3) a joint property interest in\n           all or parts of the subject matter of the\n           venture; (4) a right to participate in the\n           control or management of the enterprise; (5) an\n           expectation of profit; (6) a right to share in\n           profits; (7) an express or implied duty to share\n           in losses; and (8) a limitation to a single\n           undertaking (or possibly a small number of\n           enterprises).\n\nShain Inv. Co. v. Cohen, 443 N.E.2d 126, 130 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982)\n\n(citing 2 Samuel Williston, Contracts § 318, at 555-56, § 318A, at 563-\n\n65, 574, 579 (3d ed. 1959)).3      Where the contract language is\n\nunambiguous, its purport may be determined as a matter of law. See\n\nLawrence-Lynch Corp. v. Department of Envtl. Mgt., 467 N.E.2d 838, 840\n\n(Mass. 1984); see also Rey v. Lafferty, 990 F.2d 1379, 1384 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (construing Massachusetts law).\n\n           Although our review is plenary, the trial court’s analysis\n\nof the summary judgment record in the instant case is so cogent and\n\n     3Although Massachusetts partnerships and joint ventures share many\nof these same attributes, a “business relationship . . . limited in\nscope to the acquisition and development of [a single] property . . .\nis better termed a ‘joint venture’ than a partnership.” Loft v.\nLapidus, 936 F.2d 633, 637 n.6 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Gurney v.\nCumberland Farms, Inc., 550 N.E.2d 127, 133 (Mass. 1990)).\n\n                                  10\n\fcomprehensive that any extended exegesis would be superfluous. See\n\nPetricca Dev. Ltd. Partnership, 40 F. Supp.2d at 49.     The essential\n\nissue in this case is not whether the parties intended a joint venture\n\n— for surely they did — but when they intended that the joint venture\n\ncommence. Notwithstanding an utter absence of support in the contract\n\nlanguage, Petricca insists that a joint venture came into existence on\n\nJuly 1992, the date it notified Pioneer of its election to participate\n\nin a joint venture, or at the very latest on October 7, 1992, the date\n\nthe contract addendum was executed.\n\n          Under the eight Shain criteria, see supra, it is clear that\n\nthese parties contemplated that their post-election business\n\nrelationship should consist in at least two discrete stages. First,\n\nduring the right-to-build development stage, Pioneer had the unilateral\n\nright, as well as the sole discretion, to discontinue its development\n\nefforts at any time and for any reason. Pioneer and its straw partner\n\nwould form a partnership called Tamarack Plaza Company to undertake its\n\npreparatory mission. Plainly, unless and until the Petricca land could\n\nbe rezoned, Pioneer would not be able to develop the shopping facility,\n\nnor would it have any financial incentive to exercise its option to\n\npurchase the land as originally zoned.4\n\n     4Frequently, joint ventures of this variety are anticipatory in\nnature. Cf., e.g., HDA Parking Developers, Inc. v. Mount Vernon Hosp.,\nInc., 687 N.Y.S.2d 663, 664 (App. Div.)(affirming summary judgment for\ndefendant hospital where parties had “only memorialized their intent to\nform, in the future, a joint venture” to operate a parking garage once\n\n                                  11\n\f          Second, after the right-to-build stage had been successfully\n\ncompleted, the contract provided that Pioneer was to purchase the\n\nPetricca land. Only then would Petricca replace the straw partner as\n\na copartner in the Tamarack Plaza Company, and the partnership name\n\nwould change to Pioneer/Petricca Associates.\n\n          As the district court aptly noted, this temporal demarcation\n\nunambiguously indicates that the joint venture was not to commence\n\nuntil Pioneer exercised its option to purchase the Petricca land.\n\nDuring the earlier, development stage, Petricca had no meaningful\n\ncontrol over any aspect of the business operations, which remained\n\nentirely in the hands of Tamarack Plaza Company.         See Judge v.\n\nGallagher, 461 N.E.2d 261, 264 (Mass. App. Ct.) (noting that right to\n\ncontrol normally is “essential element” of joint venture), review\n\ndenied, 465 N.E.2d 261 (Mass. 1984); Shain Inv. Co., 443 N.E.2d at\n\n126; cf. Klose v. Wood Valley Racquet Club, Inc., 975 P.2d 1218, 1224\n\n(Kan. 1999) (requiring that “joint venturer have an equal right of\n\ncontrol over the instrumentality” (emphasis added)). By contrast, in\n\nthe cases cited by Petricca the complainant possessed at least some\n\ncontrol. See, e.g., Shain Inv. Co., 443 N.E.2d at 131 (noting that\n\ncontract made party “more than a spectator in the enterprise” by\n\n\nthe developer leased the garage from the City; “the hospital [properly]\nopted out of the anticipated joint venture . . . when it became\napparent that this joint venture could never be formed due to the\nCity’s refusal to . . . lease the garage to a joint venture involving\na developer”), appeal denied, 697 N.Y.S.2d 562 (1999).\n\n                                  12\n\faffording him a “role in the decision making process”); see also\n\nZimmerman, 524 N.E.2d at 854 (noting that party “did ‘control . . . the\n\npurse strings of the enterprise’” (citation omitted)). Moreover, even\n\nif Pioneer were to breach the contract, Petricca's \"sole and exclusive\n\nremedy [would be to] terminate th[e] Agreement, in which case neither\n\nparty [would] have any further liability or obligation to the other .\n\n. . .\"\n\n          Of course, since Pioneer never exercised its option to\n\npurchase the Petricca land, Petricca could not be said to have made any\n\n“contribution of money, property, effort, knowledge, skill, or other\n\nassets.” Shain Inv. Co., 443 N.E.2d at 130. Nor could Pioneer and\n\nPetricca have acquired “a joint property interest in all or parts of\n\nthe subject matter of the venture [viz., the Petricca parcels].”          Id.\n\n          Petricca instead argues that Pioneer’s simple option to\n\npurchase the Petricca land constituted a sufficient “joint property\n\ninterest” to satisfy the third Shain criterion. Petricca cites no\n\nauthority for its novel proposition, however, nor have we found any.\n\nRather, Pioneer’s options to purchase are more aptly analogized to\n\ncontractual rights which may be converted into property interests at\n\nthe election of the optionee. See, e.g., LDA Acquisition v. Flag\n\nWharf, Inc. (In re Competrol Acquisition Partnership), 203 B.R. 914,\n\n917 (Bankr. D. Del. 1996) (“As a general rule of Massachusetts law, the\n\ngranting of an option to purchase property does not convey a property\n\n\n                                  13\n\finterest in the subject of the option.”) (citing New England Trust Co.\n\nv. Spaulding, 38 N.E.2d 672, 676 (Mass. 1941)); Webber Lumber & Supply\n\nCo. v. Trucklease Corp. (In re Webber Lumber & Supply Co.), 134 B.R.\n\n76, 78-79 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991).5\n\n          Petricca can muster only a few tenuous challenges to the\n\nsturdy rationale adopted by the district court. For instance, it notes\n\nthat the October addendum says that “Petricca exercised its option,”\n\nand by using the past tense suggests that the joint venture already\n\nexisted. On the contrary, the quoted language simply described an\n\nhistorical event: Petricca’s July 1992 election. Neither the June\n\ncontract nor the October addendum defined Petricca’s election as an\n\nevent which would actuate a joint venture.\n\n          Petricca also claims that the October addendum arguably\n\nemployed more emphatic language and assumed a more final form than the\n\nlanguage in the June contract (which, for example, contained many\n\nhandwritten additions and strikeouts) by describing the terms of the\n\njoint venture. Its argument begs the question, however, since there is\n\nno serious dispute that the parties anticipated that a joint venture\n\n\n\n     5Moreover, even if the option contract were deemed to have\nconveyed a real property interest to Pioneer, the mere fact that two\nparties hold “joint property . . . does not of itself establish a\npartnership.” Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 108A, § 7(2) (emphasis added).\nSee Loft, 936 F.2d at 637 n.6 (noting that laws governing partnerships\nnormally apply to joint ventures as well); Edgerly v. Equitable Life\nAssur. Soc’y of the U.S., 191 N.E. 415, 417 (Mass. 1934) (“A joint\nadventure . . . resembles in many respects a partnership.”).\n\n                                 14\n\fwould be created; instead, the dispute concerns only the timing of its\n\ncreation. Whatever their differences, both Exhibits C — the one in the\n\nJune contract and the one in the October addendum — make very clear\n\nthat the Petricca-Pioneer business relationship could not meet the\n\nShain criteria until Pioneer exercised its option to purchase the\n\nPetricca land and Pioneer/Petricca Associates had been formed.\n\n          With the same mission in mind, Petricca points to certain\n\nextra-contractual evidence, such as internal memoranda generated by\n\nPioneer in 1992 referencing Petricca as Pioneer’s “partner” and\n\ndescribing “a meeting of the minds on the basic business deal.”\n\nAssuming arguendo that the integration clause in the June option\n\ncontract contemplated consideration of such evidence, see Shain Inv.\n\nCo., 443 N.E.2d at 132 (noting that “under the parol evidence rule the\n\nwriting will control if it is an integrated agreement”); Bendetson v.\n\nCoolidge, 390 N.E.2d 1124, 1126-27 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979) (same); see\n\nalso Rey, 990 F.2d at 1385 (“[P]arol evidence may not be used to\n\n‘create ambiguity where none otherwise exists.’” (citation omitted)),\n\nnone of the evidence even remotely contradicts the contract or its\n\naddendum on the pivotal timing issue.     Similarly, the referenced\n\nstatements in the Pioneer memoranda strike us as little more than\n\ncasual prolepses.\n\n          Petricca points also to the fact that Pioneer — just two days\n\nafter the execution of the October 1992 addendum — asked the escrow\n\n\n                                 15\n\fagent to reimburse it for the $22,600 in option fees previously paid to\n\nPetricca.    Petricca argues that reimbursement was due under the\n\ncontract “specifically because the parties had become joint venturers.”\n\nOn the contrary, the contract permitted reimbursement only “[i]f\n\nPetricca elect[ed] to participate in the joint venture.” Exhibit C\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            Further, Petricca argues that the exercise of Pioneer’s\n\noption to purchase the Petricca land could not have been a condition\n\nprecedent to the creation of their joint venture because Massachusetts\n\nlaw mandates that contracts expressly and emphatically identify any\n\nsuch conditions. See Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Town of\n\nDanvers,    577   N.E.2d   283,   288    (Mass.   1991).   Its   argument\n\nmischaracterizes Massachusetts law, however, since “emphatic or precise\n\nwords are not absolutely necessary to create a condition [precedent] .\n\n. . [which] may nonetheless be found to exist if the intent of the\n\nparties to create one is clearly manifested in the contract as a\n\nwhole.”    Id. (emphasis added).        As already explained, supra, the\n\nintegrated contract itself clearly demonstrates that the Pioneer-\n\nPetricca relationship, during the preliminary right-to-build phase, did\n\nnot meet muster under any pertinent Shain criterion. Accordingly, the\n\nsummary judgment ruling must be upheld.\n\nB.   Chapter 93A Claim\n\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\f          Finally, Petricca argues that the district court committed\n\nreversible error by dismissing, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6), the claim that Pioneer violated the Massachusetts\n\nunfair or deceptive trade practices statute by abandoning the joint\n\nventure. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. 93A, § 11 (“Any person who engages\n\nin the conduct of any trade or commerce and who suffers any loss of\n\nmoney or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or\n\nemployment by another person who engages in any trade or commerce of an\n\nunfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice\n\ndeclared unlawful by section two . . . may bring an action in the\n\nsuperior court . . . for damages . . . .”).6 Petricca concedes, as it\n\nmust, that Chapter 93A generally is applicable only to business\n\ndealings “between discrete, independent business entities,” not to\n\n“disputes between parties in the same [joint] venture,” as the latter\n\nare not regarded as having arisen in “trade or commerce.” Szalla v.\n\nLocke, 657 N.E.2d 1267, 1269 (Mass. 1995) (citing cases). See Linkage\n\nCorp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d 191, 207 n.33 (Mass.\n\n\n\n\n     6We review the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo, accepting\nthe factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all\nreasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. See Tompkins v.\nUnited Healthcare of N.E., Inc., 203 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir.\n2000).\n\n                                  17\n\f1997); see also Ansin v. River Oaks Furniture, Inc., 105 F.3d 745, 760\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).7\n\n          Petricca attempts to distinguish Szalla on the ground that\n\nPioneer and Petricca unquestionably remained two distinct business\n\nentities for at least the first thirty days of their contractual\n\nrelationship, whereas the parties in Szalla had asserted from the\n\noutset an intent to enter into a joint venture. Even assuming arguendo\n\nthat Petricca might have retained Chapter 93A protection for the\n\ninitial thirty-day period, however, all actions undertaken by Pioneer\n\nwhich allegedly violated Chapter 93 occurred after Petricca voluntarily\n\nelected to participate in a joint venture in July 1992, during which\n\ntime Pioneer filed rezoning applications and negotiated the alternate\n\nland deal. During that period, even if no joint venture had yet been\n\nformed, the parties unquestionably negotiated the details of their\n\nfuture joint venture.\n\n          Indeed, the Szalla court itself rejected the very distinction\n\nnow advanced by Petricca:\n\n          The plaintiff claims that some of the\n          misrepresentations occurred prior to the\n          formation of their association and therefore it\n\n\n     7\n     Thus, the authority most prominently relied upon by\nPetricca, see NASCO, Inc. v. Public Storage, Inc., 29 F.3d 28\n(1st Cir. 1994), is inapposite, since (1) it dealt with\nnegotiations for an outright sale of property between two\nindependent business entities which had expressed no intention\nto enter into a joint venture, see id. at 29-30, and (2) NASCO\npredated the Szalla decision.\n\n                                  18\n\f          was an “arms-length transaction.”             The\n          plaintiff’s argument is unavailing because the\n          prior events occurred in the course of developing\n          their mutual association which culminated in an\n          agreement and an exchange of property and\n          services. The association between the plaintiff\n          and the defendant in the interests of forming a\n          business venture together is not the kind of\n          commercial transaction regulated by the statute.\n\nSzalla, 657 N.E.2d at 1270 (emphasis added). The highlighted sentence\n\nin the above quote completely undermines the Petricca claim. That is\n\nto say, by its July 1992 election and its negotiation of the terms of\n\na joint venture, Petricca forfeited any Chapter 93A protection, without\n\nregard to whether its election would have culminated in the formation\n\nof a joint venture.\n\n                                 III\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed,\n\nwith costs to appellees.

The agreement provided that (1) Pioneer would pay  Petricca $11,300 per month in option fees; (2) \"In the event  [Pioneer] does not exercise its Option . . . , th[e] Agreement  shall expire and terminate and neither party shall have any  liability to the other under or pursuant to this Agreement[,]\"; and  (3) \"In the event [Pioneer] exercises its Option, th[e] Agreement  shall . . . become a contract for the purchase and sale of the  [land] . . . on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\" Were Pioneer to breach the agreement, Petricca's \"sole and  exclusive remedy [would be to] terminate th[e] Agreement, in which  case neither party [would] have any further liability or obligation  to the other . . . .\"  The agreement also contained the following  integration clause:  \"This agreement constitutes the sole and  entire agreement between [the parties].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the agreement afforded Petricca an option to  participate in a joint venture with Pioneer to develop the shopping  center.  The \"basic terms\" of any such joint venture were described  in Exhibit C, as follows:  \"This letter is intended to be a  memorandum of understanding which shall serve as the basis for a  more detailed partnership agreement based on the following  terms[.]\"  Under the option, Petricca had thirty days within which  to decide whether to join Pioneer in the joint venture, at which  time Pioneer would be entitled to reimbursement for all option fees  previously paid.  Thereafter, a new partnership -- Pioneer/Petricca  Associates -- would be formed, and \"upon the closing of a construction loan,\" Petricca would transfer the land title to the new  partnership.  Pioneer would pay the purchase price to Petricca,  whereupon Pioneer would acquire a 32.5% ownership interest in the  new partnership.  Pioneer expressly retained sole responsibility  for obtaining the legal right to build, as well as for the actual  construction, the legal representation of the partnership, and the  shopping center management.  Finally, Exhibit C, which included  substantial handwritten corrections and insertions, identified  itself as \"the outline for preparation of a formal agreement to  govern our business relationship.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1992, Petricca afforded Pioneer due notice that  it intended to participate in the joint venture.  On October 7,  Pioneer and Petricca executed an addendum to their June option  agreement, noting that \"Petricca exercised its option\" to participate in the joint venture.  The October 7addendum replaced the  original Exhibit C, in their June option contract, with a new  Exhibit C which announced at the outset:  \"This letter agreement  shall serve as a record of our mutual understanding regarding the  terms of our joint venture arrangement as described in paragraph 13  of the [June option agreement].\"  The new Exhibit C further  provided that \"the transactions will be concluded in accordance  with the Outline of Structure for Pioneer/Petricca Associates, a  copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The referenced outline set forth the following terms: First, Pioneer and a straw partner would form a general partnership  -- Tamarack Plaza Company -- to handle the right-to-build development  stage which would precede the construction phase.  Pioneer would  assign its June option contract rights to Tamarack Plaza Company,  and amend the June contract to reflect the joint venture arrangement with Petricca.  Second, Pioneer would pay the new partnership  for all costs of development, necessary personnel and expertise,  and would retain sole discretion to discontinue development \"at any  time and for any reason.\"  Upon any such discontinuation, Petricca  would reimburse Pioneer for 32.5% of its development costs.  Id. The Outline further provided that \"[u]pon exercise of [Pioneer's]  Option to purchase any portion of the Land, Petricca will be  admitted as a partner of Tamarack Plaza Company, the straw partner  will withdraw as a partner, and the partnership will change its  name to Pioneer/Petricca Associates.\"  Finally, the October 7  addendum stated:  \"Except as amended by this [addendum], the [June]  Option Agreement, including without limitation, Petricca's exercise  of its option to participate in the joint venture, shall remain in  full force and effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 9, 1992, Pioneer notified the designated  escrow agent that Pioneer and Petricca had \"elected to participate  in a joint venture,\" and requested reimbursement for the $22,600 in  option fees Pioneer had paid Petricca to date.  In December 1992,  Pioneer filed rezoning petitions with the city council, as required  before a shopping facility could be constructed on the Petricca  land.  In March 1993, however, Pioneer failed to gain city council  approval for its rezoning petitions.  During April 1993, unbeknownst to Petricca, Pioneer negotiated an option to purchase  another property approximately one mile from the Petricca parcels,  then requested the city council to suspend further action on the  pending zoning applications relating to the Petricca parcels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1993, Pioneer informed Petricca that the failure  to obtain zoning approval rendered their joint venture impossible  of performance, and that the zoning applications were being  withdrawn.  When Pioneer proposed to pay option fees for the  October 1992 -- May 1993 period, Petricca rejected the proposal. Eventually, Pioneer developed the WalMart facility at the other  site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Petricca brought the present action  against Pioneer, demanding, inter alia, (1) a declaratory judgment  that the parties had commenced their joint venture as early as July  or October 1992 (Count 1); (2) damages and costs for Pioneer's  breach, as a joint venturer, of its fiduciary duty of good faith  and loyalty to Petricca in negotiating to purchase the alternate  site for the shopping center without Petricca's knowledge (Count  2); and (3) treble damages for Pioneer's willful violation of the  \"unfair or deceptive trade practices\" provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws  Ann. ch. 93A (Count 5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Pioneer successfully moved to dismiss  Count 5 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the  ground that Chapter 93A is inapplicable to incipient business  relationships between joint venturers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Pioneer successfully moved for summary  judgment on Counts 1 and 2.  The district court ruled that the June  option contract and its October addendum were unambiguous in  precluding any joint venture unless and until Pioneer had exercised  its option to purchase the Petricca land, a condition precedent  which was never satisfied.  Petricca Dev. Ltd. Partnership v. Pioneer Dev. Co., 40 F. Supp.2d 49 (D. Mass. 1999).  On appeal,  Petricca challenges both the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Count 5 and  the summary judgment rulings relating to Counts 1 and 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petricca first contends that the district court erroneously determined that the June contract and October addendum  unambiguously demonstrated a mutual intention that the joint  venture not be established until such time as Pioneer opted to  purchase the Petricca land.  Instead, Petricca insists that these  documents, as well as other evidence, generate a trialworthy issue  as to whether the parties intended that the joint venture relationship arise in July 1992, at the time Petricca exercised its option  to participate in the joint venture.  Since joint venturers  unquestionably owe one another a generalized duty of good faith and  utmost loyalty, see Zimmerman v. Bogoff, 524 N.E.2d 849, 855 (Mass.  1988); Cardullo v. Landau, 105 N.E.2d 843, 845 (Mass. 1952),  Petricca suggests that Pioneer breached its duty by unilaterally  aborting its efforts to gain city council approval of the rezoning  required to enable development of the Petricca land, and instead  surreptitiously negotiating an alternate land deal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, the existence of a joint venture  is entirely dependent upon the parties' intent, which may turn on  many factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) an agreement by the parties manifesting  their intention to associate for joint profit  not amounting to a partnership or a corporation;  (2) a contribution of money, property,  effort, knowledge, skill, or other assets to a  common undertaking;  (3) a joint property  interest in all or parts of the subject matter  of the venture;  (4) a right to participate in  the control or management of the enterprise; (5) an expectation of profit; (6) a right to  share in profits;  (7) an express or implied  duty to share in losses;  and (8) a limitation  to a single undertaking (or possibly a small  number of enterprises).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shain Inv.

SeeLawrence-Lynch Corp. v. Department of Envtl. Mgt., 467 N.E.2d 838,  840 (Mass. 1984); see also Rey v. Lafferty, 990 F.2d 1379, 1384  (1st Cir. 1993) (construing Massachusetts law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our review is plenary, the trial court's  analysis of the summary judgment record in the instant case is so  cogent and comprehensive that any extended exegesis would be  superfluous.  See PetriccaDev. Ltd. Partnership, 40 F. Supp.2d at  49.   The essential issue in this case is not whether the parties  intended a joint venture -- for surely they did -- but when they  intended that the joint venture commence.  Notwithstanding an utter  absence of support in the contract language, Petricca insists that  a joint venture came into existence on July 1992, the date it  notified Pioneer of its election to participate in a joint venture,  or at the very latest on October 7, 1992, the date the contract  addendum was executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the eight Shain criteria, see supra, it is clear  that these parties contemplated that their post-election business  relationship should consist in at least two discrete stages. First, during the right-to-build development stage, Pioneer had the  unilateral right, as well as the sole discretion, to discontinue  its development efforts at any time and for any reason.  Pioneer  and its straw partner would form a partnership called Tamarack  Plaza Company to undertake its preparatory mission.  Plainly,  unless and until the Petricca land could be rezoned, Pioneer would  not be able to develop the shopping facility, nor would it have any  financial incentive to exercise its option to purchase the land as  originally zoned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, after the right-to-build stage had been successfully completed, the contract provided that Pioneer was to purchase  the Petricca land.  Only then would Petricca replace the straw  partner as a copartner in the Tamarack Plaza Company, and the  partnership name would change to Pioneer/Petricca Associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court aptly noted, this temporal  demarcation unambiguously indicates that the joint venture was not  to commence until Pioneer exercised its option to purchase the  Petricca land.  During the earlier, development stage, Petricca had  no meaningful control over any aspect of the business operations,  which remained entirely in the hands of Tamarack Plaza Company. See Judge v. Gallagher, 461 N.E.2d 261, 264 (Mass. App. Ct.)  (noting that right to control normally is \"essential element\" of  joint venture), review denied, 465 N.E.2d 261 (Mass. 1984); Shain  Inv.  Co., 443 N.E.2d at 126; cf. Klose v. Wood Valley Racquet  Club, Inc., 975 P.2d 1218, 1224 (Kan. 1999) (requiring that \"joint  venturer have an equal right of control over the instrumentality\"  (emphasis added)).  By contrast, in the cases cited by Petricca the  complainant possessed at least some control.  See, e.g., Shain Inv.  Co., 443 N.E.2d at 131 (noting that contract made party \"more than  a spectator in the enterprise\" by affording him a \"role in the  decision making process\"); see also Zimmerman, 524 N.E.2d at 854  (noting that party \"did 'control . . . the purse strings of the  enterprise'\" (citation omitted)).  Moreover, even if Pioneer were  to breach the contract, Petricca's \"sole and exclusive remedy  [would be to] terminate th[e] Agreement, in which case neither  party [would] have any further liability or obligation to the other  . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, since Pioneer never exercised its option to  purchase the Petricca land, Petricca could not be said to have made  any \"contribution of money, property, effort, knowledge, skill, or  other assets.\"  Shain Inv. Co., 443 N.E.2d at 130.  Nor could  Pioneer and Petricca have acquired \"a joint property interest in  all or parts ofthe subject matter of the venture [viz., the  Petricca parcels].\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petricca instead argues that Pioneer's simple option to  purchase the Petricca land constituted a sufficient \"joint property  interest\" to satisfy the third Shain criterion.  Petricca cites no  authority for its novel proposition, however, nor have we found  any.  Rather, Pioneer's options to purchase are more aptly  analogized to contractual rights which may be converted into  property interests at the election of the optionee.  See, e.g., LDA  Acquisition v. Flag Wharf, Inc. (In re Competrol Acquisition  Partnership), 203 B.R. 914, 917 (Bankr. D. Del. 1996) (\"As a  general rule of Massachusetts law, the granting of an option to  purchase property does not convey a property interest in the  subject of the option.\") (citing New England Trust Co. v. Spaulding, 38 N.E.2d 672, 676 (Mass. 1941)); Webber Lumber &amp; Supply  Co. v. Trucklease Corp. (In re Webber Lumber &amp; Supply Co.), 134  B.R. 76, 78-79 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petricca can muster only a few tenuous challenges to the  sturdy rationale adopted by the district court.  For instance, it  notes that the October addendum says that \"Petricca exercised its  option,\" and by using the past tense suggests that the joint  venture already existed.  On the contrary, the quoted language  simply described an historical event:  Petricca's July 1992  election.  Neither the June contract nor the October addendum  defined Petricca's election as an event which would actuate a joint  venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petricca also claims that the October addendum arguably  employed more emphatic language and assumed a more final form than  the language in the June contract (which, for example, contained  many handwritten additions and strikeouts) by describing the terms  of the joint venture.  Its argument begs the question, however,  since there is no serious dispute that the parties anticipated that  a joint venture would be created; instead, the dispute concerns  only the timing of its creation.  Whatever their differences, both  Exhibits C -- the one in the June contract and the one in the  October addendum -- make very clear that the Petricca-Pioneer  business relationship could not meet the Shain criteria until  Pioneer exercised its option to purchase the Petricca land and  Pioneer/Petricca Associates had been formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the same mission in mind, Petricca points to certain  extra-contractual evidence, such as internal memoranda generated by  Pioneer in 1992 referencing Petricca as Pioneer's \"partner\" and  describing \"a meeting of the minds on the basic business deal.\" Assuming arguendo that the integration clause in the June option  contract contemplated consideration of such evidence, see Shain  Inv. Co., 443 N.E.2d at 132 (noting that \"under the parol evidence  rule the writing will control if it is an integrated agreement\"); Bendetson v. Coolidge, 390 N.E.2d 1124, 1126-27 (Mass. App. Ct.  1979) (same); see also Rey, 990 F.2d at 1385 (\"[P]arol evidence may  not be used to 'create ambiguity where none otherwise exists.'\"  (citation omitted)), none of the evidence even remotely contradicts  the contract or its addendum on the pivotal timing issue. Similarly, the referenced statements in the Pioneer memoranda  strike us as little more than casual prolepses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petricca points also to the fact that Pioneer--just two  days after the execution of the October 1992 addendum--asked the  escrow agent to reimburse it for the $22,600 in option fees  previously paid toPetricca.  Petricca argues that reimbursement  was due under the contract \"specifically because the parties had  become joint venturers.\"  On the contrary, the contract permitted  reimbursement only \"[i]f Petricca elect[ed] to participate in the  joint venture.\" Exhibit C (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Petricca argues that the exercise of Pioneer's  option to purchase the Petricca land could not have been a  condition precedent to the creation of their joint venture because  Massachusetts law mandates that contracts expressly and emphatically identify any such conditions.  See Massachusetts Mun.  Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Town of Danvers, 577 N.E.2d 283, 288 (Mass.  1991).  Its argument mischaracterizes Massachusetts law, however,  since \"emphatic or precise words are not absolutely necessary to  create a condition [precedent] . . .

As already explained, supra, the integrated contract  itself clearly demonstrates that the Pioneer-Petricca relationship,  during the preliminary right-to-build phase, did not meet muster  under any pertinent Shain criterion.

Chapter 93A Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Petricca argues that the district court  committed reversible error by dismissing, pursuant to Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the claim that Pioneer violated the  Massachusetts unfair or deceptive trade practices statute by  abandoning the joint venture.  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. 93A, &#167; 11  (\"Any person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce  and who suffers any loss of money or property, real or personal, as  a result of the use or employment by another person who engages in  any trade or commerce of an unfair method of competition or an  unfair or deceptive act or practice declared unlawful by section  two . . . may bring an action in the superior court . . . for  damages . . . .\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Petricca concedes, as it must, that Chapter  93A generally is applicable only to business dealings \"between  discrete, independent business entities,\" not to \"disputes between  parties in the same [joint] venture,\" as the latter are not  regarded as having arisen in \"trade or commerce.\"  Szalla v. Locke,  657 N.E.2d 1267, 1269 (Mass. 1995) (citing cases).  See Linkage  Corp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d 191, 207 n.33 (Mass.  1997); see also Ansin v.

Even assuming arguendo that Petricca might have retained Chapter  93A protection for the initial thirty-day period, however, all  actions undertaken by Pioneer which allegedly violated Chapter 93  occurred after Petricca voluntarily elected to participate in a  joint venture in July 1992, during which time Pioneer filed  rezoning applications and negotiated the alternate land deal. During that period, even if no joint venture hadyet been formed,  the parties unquestionably negotiated the details of their future  joint venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Szalla court itself rejected the very  distinction now advanced by Petricca:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff claims that some of the misrepresentations occurred prior to the formation  of their association and therefore it was an  \"arms-length transaction.\"  The plaintiff's  argument is unavailing because the prior  events occurred in the course of developing  their mutual association which culminated in  an agreement and an exchange of property and  services.  The association between the plaintiff and the defendant in the interests of  forming a business venture together is not the  kind of commercial transaction regulated by  the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Szalla, 657 N.E.2d at 1270 (emphasis added).  The highlighted  sentence in the above quote completely undermines the Petricca  claim.

The agreement provided that (1) Pioneer would pay  Petricca $11,300 per month in option fees; (2) \"In the event  [Pioneer] does not exercise its Option . . . , th[e] Agreement  shall expire and terminate and neither party shall have any  liability to the other under or pursuant to this Agreement[,]\"; and  (3) \"In the event [Pioneer] exercises its Option, th[e] Agreement  shall . . . become a contract for the purchase and sale of the  [land] . . . on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\" Were Pioneer to breach the agreement, Petricca's \"sole and  exclusive remedy [would be to] terminate th[e] Agreement, in which  case neither party [would] have any further liability or obligation  to the other . . . .\"  The agreement also contained the following  integration clause:  \"This agreement constitutes the sole and  entire agreement between [the parties].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the agreement afforded Petricca an option to  participate in a joint venture with Pioneer to develop the shopping  center.  The \"basic terms\" of any such joint venture were described  in Exhibit C, as follows:  \"This letter is intended to be a  memorandum of understanding which shall serve as the basis for a  more detailed partnership agreement based on the following  terms[.]\"  Under the option, Petricca had thirty days within which  to decide whether to join Pioneer in the joint venture, at which  time Pioneer would be entitled to reimbursement for all option fees  previously paid.  Thereafter, a new partnership -- Pioneer/Petricca  Associates -- would be formed, and \"upon the closing of a construction loan,\" Petricca would transfer the land title to the new  partnership.  Pioneer would pay the purchase price to Petricca,  whereupon Pioneer would acquire a 32.5% ownership interest in the  new partnership.  Pioneer expressly retained sole responsibility  for obtaining the legal right to build, as well as for the actual  construction, the legal representation of the partnership, and the  shopping center management.  Finally, Exhibit C, which included  substantial handwritten corrections and insertions, identified  itself as \"the outline for preparation of a formal agreement to  govern our business relationship.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1992, Petricca afforded Pioneer due notice that  it intended to participate in the joint venture.  On October 7,  Pioneer and Petricca executed an addendum to their June option  agreement, noting that \"Petricca exercised its option\" to participate in the joint venture.  The October 7addendum replaced the  original Exhibit C, in their June option contract, with a new  Exhibit C which announced at the outset:  \"This letter agreement  shall serve as a record of our mutual understanding regarding the  terms of our joint venture arrangement as described in paragraph 13  of the [June option agreement].\"  The new Exhibit C further  provided that \"the transactions will be concluded in accordance  with the Outline of Structure for Pioneer/Petricca Associates, a  copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The referenced outline set forth the following terms: First, Pioneer and a straw partner would form a general partnership  -- Tamarack Plaza Company -- to handle the right-to-build development  stage which would precede the construction phase.  Pioneer would  assign its June option contract rights to Tamarack Plaza Company,  and amend the June contract to reflect the joint venture arrangement with Petricca.  Second, Pioneer would pay the new partnership  for all costs of development, necessary personnel and expertise,  and would retain sole discretion to discontinue development \"at any  time and for any reason.\"  Upon any such discontinuation, Petricca  would reimburse Pioneer for 32.5% of its development costs.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> The Outline </span>further provided that \"[u]pon exercise of [Pioneer's]  Option to purchase any portion of the Land, Petricca will be  admitted as a partner of Tamarack Plaza Company, the straw partner  will withdraw as a partner, and the partnership will change its  name to Pioneer/Petricca Associates.\"  Finally, the October 7  addendum stated:  \"Except as amended by this [addendum], the [June]  Option Agreement, including without limitation, Petricca's exercise  of its option to participate in the joint venture, shall remain in  full force and effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 9, 1992, Pioneer notified the designated  escrow agent that Pioneer and Petricca had \"elected to participate  in a joint venture,\" and requested reimbursement for the $22,600 in  option fees Pioneer had paid Petricca to date.  In December 1992,  Pioneer filed rezoning petitions with the city council, as required  before a shopping facility could be constructed on the Petricca  land.  In March 1993, however, Pioneer failed to gain city council  approval for its rezoning petitions.  During April 1993, unbeknownst to Petricca, Pioneer negotiated an option to purchase  another property approximately one mile from the Petricca parcels,  then requested the city council to suspend further action on the  pending zoning applications relating to the Petricca parcels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1993, Pioneer informed Petricca that the failure  to obtain zoning approval rendered their joint venture impossible  of performance, and that the zoning applications were being  withdrawn.  When Pioneer proposed to pay option fees for the  October 1992 -- May 1993 period, Petricca rejected the proposal. Eventually, Pioneer developed the WalMart facility at the other  site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Petricca brought the present action  against Pioneer, demanding, inter alia, (1) a declaratory judgment  that the parties had commenced their joint venture as early as July  or October 1992 (Count 1); (2) damages and costs for Pioneer's  breach, as a joint venturer, of its fiduciary duty of good faith  and loyalty to Petricca in negotiating to purchase the alternate  site for the shopping center without Petricca's knowledge (Count  2); and (3) treble damages for Pioneer's willful violation of the  \"unfair or deceptive trade practices\" provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws  Ann. ch. 93A (Count 5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Pioneer successfully moved to dismiss  Count 5 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the  ground that Chapter 93A is inapplicable to incipient business  relationships between joint venturers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Pioneer successfully moved for summary  judgment on Counts 1 and 2.  The district court ruled that the June  option contract and its October addendum were unambiguous in  precluding any joint venture unless and until Pioneer had exercised  its option to purchase the Petricca land, a condition precedent  which was never satisfied.

Instead, Petricca insists that these  documents, as well as other evidence, generate a trialworthy issue  as to whether the parties intended that the joint venture relationship arise in July 1992, at the time Petricca exercised its option  to participate in the joint venture.

Supp. 2d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>.   The essential issue in this case is not whether the parties  intended a joint venture -- for surely they did -- but when they  intended that the joint venture commence.  Notwithstanding an utter  absence of support in the contract language, Petricca insists that  a joint venture came into existence on July 1992, the date it  notified Pioneer of its election to participate in a joint venture,  or at the very latest on October 7, 1992, the date the contract  addendum was executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the eight Shain criteria, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra</span>, it is clear  that these parties contemplated that their post-election business  relationship should consist in at least two discrete stages. First, during the right-to-build development stage, Pioneer had the  unilateral right, as well as the sole discretion, to discontinue  its development efforts at any time and for any reason.  Pioneer  and its straw partner would form a partnership called Tamarack  Plaza Company to undertake its preparatory mission.  Plainly,  unless and until the Petricca land could be rezoned, Pioneer would  not be able to develop the shopping facility, nor would it have any  financial incentive to exercise its option to purchase the land as  originally zoned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, after the right-to-build stage had been successfully completed, the contract provided that Pioneer was to purchase  the Petricca land.  Only then would Petricca replace the straw  partner as a copartner in the Tamarack Plaza Company, and the  partnership name would change to Pioneer/Petricca Associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court aptly noted, this temporal  demarcation unambiguously indicates that the joint venture was not  to commence until Pioneer exercised its option to purchase the  Petricca land.  During the earlier, development stage, Petricca had  no meaningful control over any aspect of the business operations,  which remained entirely in the hands of Tamarack Plaza Company. See Judge v. Gallagher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2051663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2051663/judge-v-gallagher/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 264 (Mass.

Petricca cites no  authority for its novel proposition, however, nor have we found  any.  Rather, Pioneer's options to purchase are more aptly  analogized to contractual rights which may be converted into  property interests at the election of the optionee.  See, e.g., LDA  Acquisition v. Flag Wharf, Inc. (In re Competrol Acquisition  Partnership), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1916480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1916480/competrol-acquisition-v-lda-acquisition-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 917 (Bankr.

For instance, it  notes that the October addendum says that \"Petricca exercised its  option,\" and by using the past tense suggests that the joint  venture already existed.  On the contrary, the quoted language  simply described an historical event:  Petricca's July 1992  election.  Neither the June contract nor the October addendum  defined Petricca's election as an event which would actuate a joint  venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petricca also claims that the October addendum arguably  employed more emphatic language and assumed a more final form than  the language in the June contract (which, for example, contained  many handwritten additions and strikeouts) by describing the terms  of the joint venture.  Its argument begs the question, however,  since there is no serious dispute that the parties anticipated that  a joint venture would be created; instead, the dispute concerns  only the timing of its creation.  Whatever their differences, both  Exhibits C -- the one in the June contract and the one in the  October addendum -- make very clear that the Petricca-Pioneer  business relationship could not meet the Shain criteria until  Pioneer exercised its option to purchase the Petricca land and  Pioneer/Petricca Associates had been formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the same mission in mind, Petricca points to certain  extra-contractual evidence, such as internal memoranda generated by  Pioneer in 1992 referencing Petricca as Pioneer's \"partner\" and  describing \"a meeting of the minds on the basic business deal.\" Assuming arguendo that the integration clause in the June option  contract contemplated consideration of such evidence, see Shain  Inv. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1978404\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1978404/shain-investment-co-inc-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">132</span> </a></span>(noting that \"under the parol evidence  rule the writing will control if it is an integrated agreement\"); Bendetson v.

Similarly, the referenced statements in the Pioneer memoranda  strike us as little more than casual prolepses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petricca points also to the fact that Pioneer--just two  days after the execution of the October 1992 addendum--asked the  escrow agent to reimburse it for the $22,600 in option fees  previously paid toPetricca.  Petricca argues that reimbursement  was due under the contract \"specifically because the parties had  become joint venturers.\"  On the contrary, the contract permitted  reimbursement only \"[i]f Petricca elect[ed] to participate in the  joint venture.\" Exhibit C (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Petricca argues that the exercise of Pioneer's  option to purchase the Petricca land could not have been a  condition precedent to the creation of their joint venture because  Massachusetts law mandates that contracts expressly and emphatically identify any such conditions.  See Massachusetts Mun.  Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Town of Danvers, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></span>, 288 (Mass.  1991).  Its argument mischaracterizes Massachusetts law, however,  since \"emphatic or precise words are not absolutely necessary to  create a condition [precedent] . . . [which] may nonetheless be  found to exist if the intent of the parties to create one is clearly manifested in the contract as a whole.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis  added). </span> As already <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">explained,</span> supra</span>, the integrated contract  itself clearly demonstrates that the Pioneer-Petricca relationship,  during the preliminary right-to-build phase, did not meet muster  under any pertinent Shain criterion.  Accordingly, the summary  judgment ruling must be upheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Chapter 93A Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Petricca argues that the district court  committed reversible error by dismissing, pursuant to Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the claim that Pioneer violated the  Massachusetts unfair or deceptive trade practices statute by  abandoning the joint venture.  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. 93A, &#167; 11  (\"Any person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce  and who suffers any loss of money or property, real or personal, as  a result of the use or employment by another person who engages in  any trade or commerce of an unfair method of competition or an  unfair or deceptive act or practice declared unlawful by section  two . . . may bring an action in the superior court . . . for  damages . . . .\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Petricca concedes, as it must, that Chapter  93A generally is applicable only to business dealings \"between  discrete, independent business entities,\" not to \"disputes between  parties in the same [joint] venture,\" as the latter are not  regarded as having arisen in \"trade or commerce.\"  Szalla v. Locke,  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></span>, 1269 (Mass. 1995) (citing cases).

Even assuming arguendo that Petricca might have retained Chapter  93A protection for the initial thirty-day period, however, all  actions undertaken by Pioneer which allegedly violated Chapter 93  occurred after Petricca voluntarily elected to participate in a  joint venture in July 1992, during which time Pioneer filed  rezoning applications and negotiated the alternate land deal. During that period, even if no joint venture hadyet been formed,  the parties unquestionably negotiated the details of their future  joint venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Szalla court itself rejected the very  distinction now advanced by Petricca:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff claims that some of the misrepresentations occurred prior to the formation  of their association and therefore it was an  \"arms-length transaction.\"  The plaintiff's  argument is unavailing because the prior  events occurred in the course of developing  their mutual association which culminated in  an agreement and an exchange of property and  services.  The association between the plaintiff and the defendant in the interests of  forming a business venture together is not the  kind of commercial transaction regulated by  the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Szalla,</span> <span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1270</span> </span>(emphasis added).  The highlighted  sentence in the above quote completely undermines the Petricca  claim.  That is to say, by its July 1992 election and its negotiation of the terms of a joint venture, Petricca forfeited any  Chapter 93A protection, without regard to whether its election  would have culminated in the formation of a joint venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is  affirmed, with costs to appellees.
