The    plaintiff-\n\nappellants, John and Eileen Connell, filed a fourteen-count\n\namended complaint alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994\n\n& Supp. II 1996), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 12 §§ 11H and 11I (1998), and claims for negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.              They named as defendants: the\n\nBoard of Selectmen of the Town of Harwich, in their official\n\ncapacities; Wayne Melville, Town of Harwich Town Administrator,\n\nin his individual and official capacities; Paula J. Champagne,\n\nboth    individually       and   in    her    official    capacity    as   Health\n\nDirector for the Town of Harwich Board of Health; and George\n\nArsenault, former Building Commissioner/Building Inspector, in\n\nhis    individual   and     official     capacities       (collectively      “Town\n\nDefendants”).        The    plaintiffs        also   alleged   that    the    Town\n\nDefendants conspired with Defendant-Appellee Robin Wilcox to\n\ndeprive the plaintiffs of their rights.\n\n           All defendants moved to dismiss the action as time-\n\nbarred.    The district court (Lasker, J.) granted the motions,\n\nand this appeal followed.             For the reasons set forth below, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                                     I.\n\n            We recount the facts as ably recited by the district\n\ncourt, noting that for purposes of these motions to dismiss, the\n\nfacts alleged in the amended complaint are deemed to be true.\n\nThe Connells are the owners and operators of “The Cape Cod\n\nCladdagh Inn” in Harwich, Massachusetts.                  In July 1993, the\n\nConnells began receiving billing statements from Stanley R.\n\nSweetster, Inc. (“Sweetster”) for surveying and engineering work\n\nallegedly done on their property.          The Connells, however, never\n\ncontracted for the work and immediately contacted Sweetster and\n\ninformed it of that fact.       Sweetster acknowledged that no work\n\nhad been contracted for or performed, and that the bills should\n\nbe ignored.      Nevertheless, Sweetster continued to send bills to\n\nthe plaintiffs.\n\n            In   November   1993,    defendant     Wilcox    telephoned     the\n\nConnells, claiming that the Sweetster bill was genuine and that\n\nhe was owed for the purported work.              The Connells repeatedly\n\ninformed Wilcox that they never hired him and owed him nothing.\n\nIn   late   November   or   early    December    1993,     Wilcox   presented\n\nhimself at the Connell home seeking payment for the work billed\n\nby   Sweetster.      Wilcox   also    presented     the    Connells   with    a\n\nproposal for a septic system for their property.               The Connells\n\nagain   informed     Wilcox   that    they   had    never     hired   him    or\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fSweetster, that they had no contract with either party, and that\n\nconsequently they owed nothing to him or Sweetster.                  Wilcox\n\nbecame enraged and stated: “I will make things very difficult\n\nfor you in the Town of Harwich through my very good friend,\n\nPaula Champagne, the Town of Harwich Health Officer.”\n\n          The Connells allege that the defendants thereafter\n\nengaged in a series of wrongful acts, in an effort to disrupt\n\nand   damage   the   Connells'      business,     including   denying    them\n\nlicenses and permits which were necessary for them to operate\n\ntheir lodging house and restaurant.             The plaintiffs allege that\n\nthese acts occurred between April 1, 1994 and June 19, 1995.               On\n\nJuly 12, 1995, the plaintiffs filed suit in Barnstable County\n\nSuperior Court seeking an order that the Town of Harwich Board\n\nof Health issue a food service permit which would enable them to\n\noperate their business until they installed the new septic\n\nsystem required by the Board of Health.             At the hearing on July\n\n14,   1995,    the   court    denied    the   Connells'    application    for\n\ninjunctive     relief.       The   plaintiffs    contend   that   “[w]hether\n\nmalevolently or not, the records produced on behalf of the Town\n\nof Harwich and its Health Department . . . were in plain error\n\nand misrepresented the truth” and that the court relied on that\n\ninformation to deny injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           Three years later, on July 14, 1998, the plaintiffs\n\nfiled the present action in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Massachusetts.             The defendants moved to dismiss\n\nthe action as time-barred.             The district court granted the\n\nmotions, holding that the plaintiffs' action was not filed\n\nwithin the applicable three-year statute of limitations and that\n\n“they may not reach back to the pre-limitations period[.]”                  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           The plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court\n\n“plainly      erred”    in    dismissing      their     amended    complaint.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs argue that the alleged actions of\n\nthe defendants constituted a “systemic” continuing violation\n\nthat was not realized until July 14, 1995 and that a further act\n\nof conspiracy occurred on that date.                They contend that they\n\nfiled   their       complaint     within     the    three-year    statute     of\n\nlimitations by filing on July 14, 1998.               We disagree.\n\n           When reviewing a district court's allowance of a motion\n\nto dismiss, we apply de novo review.               See New England Cleaning\n\nServs. v. American Arbitration Ass'n, 199 F.3d 542, 544 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).      For actions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the\n\nstatute of limitations is derived from the forum state's law.\n\nSee   Owens    v.    Okure,     488   U.S.   235,    249-50   (1989).       The\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fappropriate referent here is the general statute of limitations\n\nfor personal injury claims.        See id.       In Massachusetts, that\n\nperiod is three years.     See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260 § 2A (1998).\n\nThe same statute of limitations applies to claims of civil\n\nconspiracy.   See id.\n\n          A cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 accrues when\n\na plaintiff knew, or should have known, of the wrongful act or\n\nacts alleged in the complaint.           See Morris v. Government Dev.\n\nBank of Puerto Rico, 27 F.3d 746, 748-49 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nShahzade v. Gregory, 930 F. Supp. 673 (D. Mass. 1996).                    The\n\nlimitation period may be extended, however, if a plaintiff can\n\ndemonstrate   a    “continuing    violation.”          Provencher    v.   CVS\n\nPharmacy, Div. of Melville, Corp., 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   As we have stated: “The continuing violation doctrine\n\ncreates an equitable exception to the [limitations period] when\n\nthe unlawful behavior is deemed ongoing.”              Id.     There are two\n\ntypes of continuing violations: systemic and serial.                See Id.\n\n          The district court held that “the Connells have not\n\nalleged, nor is there any evidence of, a systemic violation” and\n\nfocused its analysis on the serial violation.                 The plaintiffs\n\nnow argue that the defendants' alleged scheme against them “was\n\nnot   actualized   until   July   14,     1995   and    can    be   deemed    a\n\n'systemic' violation.”     A systemic violation “refers to general\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fpractices and policies” and “has its roots in a discriminatory\n\npolicy or practice; so long as the policy or practice itself\n\ncontinues into the limitations period, a challenger may be\n\ndeemed to have filed a timely complaint.”               Provencher, 145 F.3d\n\nat 14 (internal quotation marks omitted); Sabree v. United Bhd.\n\nof Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33, 921 F.2d 396 400-402 &\n\nn.7 (1st Cir. 1990).           We agree with the district court that\n\nthere is no sufficient allegation of a systemic violation in the\n\nplaintiffs' complaint.         At best, the plaintiffs allege that they\n\nwere personally discriminated against by the defendants between\n\nApril 1, 1994 and June 19, 1995.            They fail, however, to link\n\nany    such    alleged     discrimination   to     a    policy      and    practice\n\nattributable to the defendants.\n\n              The   plaintiffs   also    contend       that   the    defendants'\n\nactions constitute a “serial violation.”                 “A serial violation\n\noccurs where a chain of similar discriminatory acts emanating\n\nfrom the same discriminatory animus exists and where there has\n\nbeen some violation within the statute of limitations period\n\nthat anchors the earlier claims.”           Provencher, 145 F.3d at 14.\n\n“The    series      must   contain   a   specific       beachhead         violation\n\noccurring within the limitations period.”                Pilgrim v. Trustees\n\nof Tufts College, 118 F.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f              The plaintiffs claim that the July 14, 1995 decision\n\nof    the   Barnstable    Superior        Court      was     the     final      overt    act\n\ntriggering      the    statute     of     limitations.             They       claim     that\n\nrepresentations made, “whether malevolently or otherwise,” by\n\ntwo persons who are not named as defendants here, former Town\n\nCounsel, James Falla, and             Bruce Campbell of the Harwich Board\n\nof Health, “impelled the Barnstable County Court to rule against\n\nthe Plaintiffs, the Connells, further adversely affecting their\n\nbusiness        and      livelihood             by        delaying        the      proper\n\ncontinuation/growth           of   the    same       by    means     of   a     tortious,\n\nnegligent and unjustified course of conduct which shocks the\n\nconscience.”         They then cite Hoffman v. C.H. Halden, 268 F.2d\n\n280 (9th Cir. 1959), overruled on other grounds Cohen v. Norris,\n\n300    F.2d    24,    29-30    (9th      Cir.    1962),      as    support       for     the\n\nproposition that this July 14, 1995 hearing was an overt act of\n\nthe defendants.        Hoffman is readily distinguishable on the facts\n\nrevealed by the plaintiffs' complaint.                      We hold that the July\n\n14, 1995 hearing was not an overt act of the defendants and\n\ncannot be used as an “anchor” to bind the earlier claims.                              As we\n\nhave stated previously, “residual effects of past discriminatory\n\nconduct . . . are not themselves acts of discrimination and\n\ntherefore will not satisfy the anchor violation requirement.”\n\nProvencher, 145 F.3d at 14; see also Pilgrim, 118 F.3d at 869\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f(“Mere subsequent effects of earlier discriminatory action will\n\nnot     extend       the   limitations        period.”).           The   plaintiffs'\n\ncontention that they suffered from a continuing serial violation\n\nby the defendants lacks merit.\n\n               In    all   events,    a   continuing       violation     --    whether\n\nsystemic       or    serial   --   will     fail    “[e]ven   where      a   plaintiff\n\nalleges     a        violation     within     the     appropriate        statute      of\n\nlimitations period, . . . if the plaintiff was or should have\n\nbeen aware that he was being unlawfully discriminated against\n\nwhile    the     earlier      acts,   now    untimely,      were    taking     place.”\n\nProvencher, 145 F.3d at 14; Sabree, 921 F.2d at 402.                         In Sabree,\n\nwe rejected the plaintiff's continuing violation claim because\n\nthe plaintiff “admitted that he believed, at every turn, that he\n\nwas being discriminated against.”                  Sabree, 921 F.2d at 402.\n\n               It is clear from our review of the amended complaint\n\nthat the plaintiffs knew of the alleged unlawful discriminatory\n\nacts of the defendants while they were taking place.                            As the\n\ndistrict court noted, the amended complaint makes manifest that\n\nthe plaintiffs believed all along that Wilcox's actions and\n\nstatements          constituted    extortion.        The    plaintiffs        not   only\n\nreported those actions to the state police and the Massachusetts\n\nAttorney General's Office, but also expressly stated that in\n\nApril 1995, “they were quite certain that much of what had\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\foccurred    to   them   by    and   through    various    town   departments,\n\nagencies, decisions, etc. was motivated to a large degree by\n\nnothing    other   than      malice.”      Amended   Complaint    at   ¶   62.\n\nIndeed, the very fact that the plaintiffs filed their suit in\n\nBarnstable Superior Court on July 12, 1995 seeking injunctive\n\nrelief proves that they knew of the alleged wrongful acts of the\n\ndefendants prior to the running of the statute of limitations.\n\n\n\n            As the district court correctly held: “The plaintiffs\n\nwere on notice of the unlawful nature of the defendants' alleged\n\nconduct before July 14, 1995 and failed to file this action\n\nwithin     the   applicable      three-year     statute    of    limitations.\n\n[Accordingly,] they may not reach back to the pre-limitations\n\nperiod . . . .”     Affirmed.       Costs to appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f",

For the reasons set forth below, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                                     I.\n\n            We recount the facts as ably recited by the district\n\ncourt, noting that for purposes of these motions to dismiss, the\n\nfacts alleged in the amended complaint are deemed to be true.\n\nThe Connells are the owners and operators of “The Cape Cod\n\nCladdagh Inn” in Harwich, Massachusetts.                  In July 1993, the\n\nConnells began receiving billing statements from Stanley R.\n\nSweetster, Inc. (“Sweetster”) for surveying and engineering work\n\nallegedly done on their property.          The Connells, however, never\n\ncontracted for the work and immediately contacted Sweetster and\n\ninformed it of that fact.       Sweetster acknowledged that no work\n\nhad been contracted for or performed, and that the bills should\n\nbe ignored.      Nevertheless, Sweetster continued to send bills to\n\nthe plaintiffs.\n\n            In   November   1993,    defendant     Wilcox    telephoned     the\n\nConnells, claiming that the Sweetster bill was genuine and that\n\nhe was owed for the purported work.              The Connells repeatedly\n\ninformed Wilcox that they never hired him and owed him nothing.\n\nIn   late   November   or   early    December    1993,     Wilcox   presented\n\nhimself at the Connell home seeking payment for the work billed\n\nby   Sweetster.      Wilcox   also    presented     the    Connells   with    a\n\nproposal for a septic system for their property.               The Connells\n\nagain   informed     Wilcox   that    they   had    never     hired   him    or\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fSweetster, that they had no contract with either party, and that\n\nconsequently they owed nothing to him or Sweetster.                  Wilcox\n\nbecame enraged and stated: “I will make things very difficult\n\nfor you in the Town of Harwich through my very good friend,\n\nPaula Champagne, the Town of Harwich Health Officer.”\n\n          The Connells allege that the defendants thereafter\n\nengaged in a series of wrongful acts, in an effort to disrupt\n\nand   damage   the   Connells'      business,     including   denying    them\n\nlicenses and permits which were necessary for them to operate\n\ntheir lodging house and restaurant.             The plaintiffs allege that\n\nthese acts occurred between April 1, 1994 and June 19, 1995.               On\n\nJuly 12, 1995, the plaintiffs filed suit in Barnstable County\n\nSuperior Court seeking an order that the Town of Harwich Board\n\nof Health issue a food service permit which would enable them to\n\noperate their business until they installed the new septic\n\nsystem required by the Board of Health.             At the hearing on July\n\n14,   1995,    the   court    denied    the   Connells'    application    for\n\ninjunctive     relief.       The   plaintiffs    contend   that   “[w]hether\n\nmalevolently or not, the records produced on behalf of the Town\n\nof Harwich and its Health Department . . . were in plain error\n\nand misrepresented the truth” and that the court relied on that\n\ninformation to deny injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           Three years later, on July 14, 1998, the plaintiffs\n\nfiled the present action in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Massachusetts.             The defendants moved to dismiss\n\nthe action as time-barred.             The district court granted the\n\nmotions, holding that the plaintiffs' action was not filed\n\nwithin the applicable three-year statute of limitations and that\n\n“they may not reach back to the pre-limitations period[.]”                  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           The plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court\n\n“plainly      erred”    in    dismissing      their     amended    complaint.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs argue that the alleged actions of\n\nthe defendants constituted a “systemic” continuing violation\n\nthat was not realized until July 14, 1995 and that a further act\n\nof conspiracy occurred on that date.                They contend that they\n\nfiled   their       complaint     within     the    three-year    statute     of\n\nlimitations by filing on July 14, 1998.               We disagree.\n\n           When reviewing a district court's allowance of a motion\n\nto dismiss, we apply de novo review.               See New England Cleaning\n\nServs. v.
