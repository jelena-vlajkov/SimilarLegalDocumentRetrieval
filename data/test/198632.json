Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Shannon E. Hicks on brief pro se.\r\n   Nancy A. White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\r\nBeatriz E. Van Meek, Counsel, Department of Corrections, on Motion\r\nfor Summary Disposition.\r\n\nSeptember 14, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Shannon Hicks appeals pro se from the\r\ndismissal of his 42 U.S.C.  1983 action seeking damages\r\nagainst the Massachusetts Department of Corrections,\r\nCommissioner Michael Maloney, and Bridgewater State Hospital\r\nbased on alleged violations of the Interstate Agreement on\r\nDetainers (\"IAD\").  Upon careful review of the record and\r\nfilings in this court, we affirm essentially for the reasons\r\nstated by the district court in its December 4, 1998 memorandum\r\nand order.  \r\n          We add that Hicks has made no argument that the\r\ndistrict court erred in denying his motion to supplement the\r\ncomplaint, and any claims that he may have against the Maricopa\r\nCounty Sheriff's Office, Nate Jackson, or the Maricopa County\r\nCorrectional Health Services are not before us.  In addition,\r\nhis  1983 law suit below was limited to alleged violations of\r\nthe IAD, and any claims that he may have for violation of the\r\nUniform Criminal Extradition Act, the Fifth and Fourteenth\r\nAmendments of the United States Constitution, or the\r\nMassachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure are not before us.  \r\n          Affirmed.\r\n",
