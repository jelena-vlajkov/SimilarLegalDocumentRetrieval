This is an appeal by appellant Theresa Dupre\n\nfrom the decision of the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Massachusetts vacating the judgment of the United States Bankruptcy\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts and remanding the case to the\n\nbankruptcy court with the instruction that judgment be entered for the\n\nappellees, Haemonetics Corporation and Nova Biomedical Corporation.\n\nSee Haemonetics Corp. v. Dupre, 238 B.R. 224 (D. Mass. 1999).\n\n          The appellant's husband Paul Dupre was convicted of\n\nembezzling nearly one million dollars from Nova and Haemonetics between\n\n1988 and 1994. Nova and Haemonetics brought suit against the Dupres\n\nalleging a civil conspiracy. While motions for summary judgment were\n\npending, Theresa Dupre filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The\n\nappellees challenged the discharge of her debt relying on section\n\n523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code which provides in relevant part:\n\n          A discharge under . . . this title does not\n          discharge an individual debtor from any debt--\n\n                                . . .\n\n          (2) for money, property, services, or an\n          extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to\n          the extent obtained by--\n\n                  (A) false pretenses, a false\n                  representation, or actual fraud,\n                  other than a statement respecting\n                  the debtor's or an insider's\n                  financial condition;\n\n                                . . .\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          (6) for willful and malicious injury by the\n          debtor to another entity or to the property of\n          another entity.\n\n11 U.S.C. ยง 523(a).\n\n          The bankruptcy court found the following relevant facts: the\n\nembezzled funds were deposited into six joint accounts maintained by\n\nthe Dupres in six different banks. \"Theresa was aware that her husband\n\nwas providing funds for the various accounts far in excess of his\n\nearnings\" and far in excess of their combined wages. Haemonetics v.\n\nDupre (In re Dupre), 208 B.R. 609, 611 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997).\n\nNevertheless, she regularly wrote checks from those accounts, and\n\nmaintained the check registers, for expenditures that went beyond the\n\nDupre's disposable income from their wages. Accordingly, the court\n\nfound that Theresa was \"intimately familiar\" with the amount of funds\n\ncoming into the household, refuting \"her attempts to appear\n\nunsophisticated in financial dealings.\" Id. In addition, Theresa\n\nDupre deleted a Quicken software program from her home computer to\n\nconceal the family's financial affairs from her creditors, denied this\n\nact to the creditors, and testified falsely in court about the purpose\n\nof the deletions.1\n\n          Despite these findings implicating Theresa in her husband's\n\nembezzlement, the bankruptcy court concluded that \"[t]here is not an\n\n\n\n1 For a full disposition of the facts, see Haemonetics Corp., 238 B.R.\nat 226-27.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fiota of evidence that Theresa acted in concert with Paul in the act of\n\nconverting the Plaintiffs' funds.\" Id. at 612. The bankruptcy court\n\ninexplicably determined that there was insufficient evidence that\n\nTheresa knew the source of the funds.        See id.    Based on this\n\nconclusion, the court held that ยง 523(a) did not apply and entered\n\njudgment for Theresa Dupre.      See id.\n\n          The district court in vacating the bankruptcy court's\n\njudgment relied on the bankruptcy court's subsidiary findings and the\n\nadditional evidence that Theresa had occasionally reviewed the regular\n\nbank statements sent to the Dupre home.       At least some of those\n\nstatements explicitly detailed the numerous deposits of very large sums\n\nof money from Haemonetics and Nova. See Haemonetics, 238 B.R. at 228.\n\nFinding both knowledge and participation, the district court properly\n\nconcluded that the appellant acted in concert with her husband in\n\nconverting the appellees' property and, consequently, that her debt\n\nshould not be discharged under ยง 523(a).       See id. at 229-30.\n\n          Based on our independent judgment that the bankruptcy court's\n\nultimate finding is clearly erroneous, we affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court. See Palmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 785 (1st Cir.\n\n1997). With all due deference to the bankruptcy court as the trial\n\ncourt in this case, see Palmacci, 121 F.3d at 785; Williams v. Poulos,\n\n11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir. 1993), Theresa Dupre's willful destruction\n\nof evidence, untruthful testimony, knowledge of income far in excess of\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fearnings, and review of the bank statements indisputably establish that\n\nshe knew the illicit source of the funds. Where, as here, there is no\n\nother plausible inference, we are compelled to hold that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's conclusion that Theresa lacked knowledge of the source of the\n\nfunds and could not therefore act in concert with her husband is\n\nclearly erroneous. See Jackson v. United States, 156 F.3d 230, 232-33\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); Irving v. United States, 49 F.3d 830, 835 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); Williams, 11 F.3d at 278.\n\n          It follows that Theresa's willful participation in the\n\nconversion of the appellees' property through embezzlement satisfies\n\nthe exception to discharge. See ยง 523(a)(6); Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523\n\nU.S. 57, 61-62 (1998) (holding that the injury -- the deprivation of\n\nproperty -- must be wilful, not just the intentional act that results\n\nin the injury); Roumeliotis v. Popa (In re Popa), 140 F.3d 317, 318\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (applying Geiger); cf. Barclays American Business\n\nCredit v. Long (In re Long), 774 F.2d 875, 879 (8th Cir. 1985)\n\n(observing that discharge exception requires egregious conduct rather\n\nthan mere conversion).\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons discussed above and set forth more fully in\n\nthe district court opinion, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
