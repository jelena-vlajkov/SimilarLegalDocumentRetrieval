KROCK,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nDavid D. Pavek, Pavek &amp; Associates, William V. Sopp, and\r\nFinnegan, Hickey, Dinsmoor &amp; Johnson on brief for appellant.\r\nAlan M. Spiro and Edwards &amp; Angell, LLP on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                      January 3, 2000\r\n\n                                LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Beal Bank sued Richard Krock on a\r\nnote with a face amount of $350,000. The district court entered\r\njudgment for Krock, finding Beal Bank had orally modified the note\r\nand that Krock owed nothing. On appeal, this court affirmed the\r\ncourt's holding that there was an agreed-upon oral modification of\r\nthe original contract and remanded for a calculation of the proper\r\namount owed. See Beal Bank S.S.B. v. Krock, 187 F.3d 621 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (unpublished table decision). On remand, the district court\r\nrecalculated the amount and found again that Krock owed nothing to\r\nthe Bank. The Bank appeals.\r\nThe property secured by the note was sold for $1,505,000,\r\nwhich, according to the oral modification of the agreement, meant\r\nthat $403,333.33 would be applied as an offset to Krock's debt. The\r\nBank's position is that Krock owed $432,020.39 under the note. That\r\namount is the undisputed note amount of $381,888.88 (the $350,000\r\nprincipal plus 8% \"contract rate\" interest), plus 13% \"default\r\nrate\" interest after Krock's default in paying the November 1, 1994\r\ninstallment, plus a sum for late charges of 5% due on the past-due\r\ninstallment and accelerated balance. Accordingly, the Bank says\r\nthat, after the offset, Krock still owes it monies.\r\nKrock argues that because the Bank never gave written\r\nnotice of a default or opportunity to cure, as required by the\r\nnote, the note was not accelerated nor was default interest rate\r\ntriggered. Krock says that the Bank cannot claim default because\r\nthe parties orally modified their agreement and the Bank agreed to\r\ntake no further action until the sale. Accordingly, Krock says, the\r\ninterest rate remained at 8%, not 13%, and no late charge can be\r\nimposed. Krock says that the amount owed under the note at the\r\ncontract interest rate was $399,710.43, which is less than the\r\noffset amount. The district court agreed with Krock and, so, found\r\nno money was due.\r\nBeal Bank erroneously argues it is entitled to de novo\r\nreview of the district court's decision. Barring this, it says that\r\nthe findings of fact made by the district court are clearly\r\nerroneous. The district court's decision is based on findings of\r\nfact and we review them under a clearly erroneous standard. See\r\nFleet Nat'l Bank v. H &amp; D Entertainment, Inc., 96 F.3d 532, 540\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).\r\nThe Bank argues there is no notice or opportunity to cure\r\nrequirement because the note says that in event of default, the\r\nnote becomes immediately payable without notice or demand. The Bank\r\nselectively quotes from the note in making this argument: it does\r\nnot quote from the language of the note concerning default, but\r\nrather from the language concerning covenants. The covenant\r\nlanguage, however, is inapt because the default alleged by the Bank\r\nis Krock's failure to make the November 1, 1994 payment, an event\r\ncovered by an earlier portion of the agreement.\r\nEven if notice were required, the Bank says that Krock\r\nhad actual notice because Krock's counsel acknowledged, in a letter\r\nof November 10, 1994, that Krock was aware of his default. Because\r\nKrock was so aware, the Bank argues that the purpose, under\r\nMassachusetts law, for having notice requirements -- so individuals\r\ncan protect their interests in real property -- was essentially\r\nserved here. In any event, Beal Bank says, it was not open to the\r\ndistrict court on remand to determine that there was no default.\r\nKrock replies that Beal Bank has misled the court by\r\nfailing to inform us of two key phrases in the note. Those phrases\r\nare:\r\n  Following the occurrence and continuation beyond the\r\napplicable cure period of an \"Event of Default\" as\r\ndefined herein . . . . \r\n\nand one of the definitions of \"Event of Default\": \r\n\n  [a failure] to pay any . . . obligation . . . when such\r\npayment is due, which failure remains uncured after five\r\n(5) days after written notice thereof . . . .\r\n\nThus, Krock says that there was a notice requirement under the\r\nnote, that the Bank admits it did not give notice, and that, in any\r\nevent, the oral modification meant there was no default and the\r\nBank was not entitled to accelerate the note balance. An event of\r\ndefault triggers acceleration, at the holder's option, but both the\r\nnote and Massachusetts law require written notice first. See Clark\r\nv. Trumble, 692 N.E.2d 74, 79 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998).\r\nThe trial judge's findings of fact are supported and are\r\ncertainly not clearly erroneous. The district court found there was\r\nno event of default because the Bank agreed orally to take no\r\nfurther action until the property was sold. Even if there had been\r\nan event of default, the note contains a requirement of notice and\r\nthe opportunity to cure before the debt could be accelerated. The\r\nBank does not dispute that it did not give notice or an opportunity\r\nto cure, and so neither the default interest rate nor acceleration\r\nwere triggered. Nothing in this court's earlier opinion precluded\r\nthe district court from making these determinations.\r\nWe affirm the decision of the district court. \r\nCounsel for the Bank are required to show cause within\r\nten days of the date of this opinion why they should not be\r\nrequired personally to pay an award to Krock of his attorney's fees\r\nfor this appeal and double his costs of appeal because of their\r\nmisrepresentation to this court of the pertinent language of the\r\nnote. See 28 U.S.C.  1912; Fed. R. App. P. 38; Thomas v. Digital\r\nEquip. Corp., 880 F.2d 1486, 1491 (1st Cir. 1989).\n",
